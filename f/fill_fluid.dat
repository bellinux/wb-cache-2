Currently, however, dependence on external light sources, detectors and fluid pumping equipment undermines true portability and adds significant cost. Emitters and detectors {{can be incorporated}} on-chip using pick-and place style fabrication e. g. [2], but, alignment constraints and cost make this approach impractical for anything but the simplest systems. We present a prototype of an integrated III-V semiconductor flow cytometer with an on-chip capillary <b>fill</b> <b>fluid</b> delivery system designed to overcome these limitations. Monolithic integration allows photonic elements such as lasers and photo-detectors to be defined on a common substrate using high resolution lithographic techniques while use of capillary fill micro-fluidics removes the need for large scale expensive pumping equipment...|$|E

More accurate terms are volume expanders for inert products, and oxygen therapeutics for oxygen-carrying products. Ideal blood substitute should have universally compatibility. There should be elimination of cross matching, it should be pathogen free, it should have minimal side effects, survivability over a wider range of storage temperatures, long shelf life, cost efficient etc. Their main function is replacing lost blood volume and oxygen carrying capacity. Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers vaguely resemble blood. Unlike haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, perfluoro chemicals are entirely synthetic. It’s concluded that large-scale production of blood substitutes would also help to meet the anticipated increase in demand for blood.

40|$|Four-ruminally fistulated, multiparous, {{pregnant}} Holstein cows {{were studied}} to characterize ruminal adaptations {{during the transition}} from gestation to lactation. Cows were fed typical far-off and close-up diets, a late lactation diet containing wet corn gluten feed (20 % DM), and an alfalfa hay, corn silage based early lactation diet. Ruminal measurements were obtained 72 (late lactation), 51 (far-off dry), 23 and 9 (close-up dry) days before expected parturition and 6, 20, and 34 days postpartum. Measurements included total fill, dry matter <b>fill,</b> <b>fluid</b> fill, and water-holding capacity of the rumen. Dry matter intake and milk production data were collected daily and body weight and body condition were determined weekly. Body weights and condition increased during the dry period, whereas intake {{as a percentage of}} body weight decreased. Ruminal water holding capacity, an indicator of rumen capacity, increased linearly from late lactation to 34 days postpartum. These data suggest rumen capacity is not the causative factor of intake depression in dairy cows during the final 3 wk of gestation...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} resistance of an epichlorohydrin elastomer and three fluorocarbon elastomers to Bayol 35, Voltesso 35, and Marcol 72 hydrocarbon fill fluids has been investigated. Absorption of <b>fill</b> <b>fluid</b> {{and the resulting}} change in the glass transition temperature were {{used to evaluate the}} {{chemical resistance}} of the elastomers. The weight change of the fluorocarbon elastomers was less than 0. 1 % by weight indicating that these elastomers have excellent chemical resistance to the fluids. The epichlorohydrin elastomer absorbed approximately 0. 6 % Bayol 35, 2. 0 % Voltesso 35, and 3. 25 % Marcol 72 and the Tg of the epichlorohydrin elastomer decreased slightly following immersion in the fill fluids. This elastomer has good to excellent resistance to the fill fluids. The Tg of the four elastomers studied here are high enough to cause concern about these elastomers undergoing a rubber to glass transition in low temperature, high frequency applications. Epichlorohydrin based copolymer or terpolymer elastomers have lower Tgs and should remain rubbery at low temperature and higher frequencies. Evaluation of these elastomers is warranted...|$|E

Comprising the four Class 1 enabling experiments are tank press control, tank chilldown, tank no-vent fill, and liquid acquisition device fill/refill. The nine Class 2 enhancing experiments are tanker thermal performance, pressurization, low-gravity setting and outflow, liquid acquisition device performance, transfer line chilldown, outflow subcooling, low-gravity vented <b>fill,</b> <b>fluid</b> dumping, and advanced instrumentation. Consisting {{of an experiment}} module mated to a spacecraft bus, COLD-SAT will be placed in an initial 1300 km circular orbit by an Atlas commercial launch vehicle, and will perform experiments in a semi-autonomous mode {{for a period of}} up to six months. The three-axis controlled spacecraft bus provides electric power, control and data management, communications, and attitude control along with propulsive acceleration levels ranging from 10 (exp - 6) to 10 (exp - 4) g. It is desired to understand the effects that low acceleration levels might have on the heat and mass transfer processes involved in some of the experiments. The experiment module contains the three liquid hydrogen tanks, valves, pressurization and pumping equipment, and instrumentation. Within the highly insulated tanks are specialized fluid management equipment that might be used in future space transportation systems. At launch all the liquid hydrogen for the experiments is contained in the largest tank, which has helium-purged insulation to prevent cryo-pumping of air on the launch pad. The tank is loaded by the hydrogen tanking system used for the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas. After reaching orbit the two smaller tanks become receivers for fluid transfers, and when tanked, become the vessels for performing many of the experiments...|$|E

40|$|Offshore {{structures}} with partially filled {{storage tanks}} may experience sloshing {{of the cargo}} when exposed to waves. Inventive use on the topside result in storage tanks which are built as an integrated part of the deck structure. Weight control and available space is often a critical issue for offshore projects and can be improved by this application. CB&I have decided {{to carry out a}} research related to the occurrence of sloshing and impact pressures for these, so called, in-deck tanks. The sloshing assessment procedure {{is an important part of}} the structural strength checks. Sloshing occurs when the natural period of the fluid coincides to the motions of the storage tank. Four factors mainly contribute to the sloshing phenomenon. Namely, tank dimensions, <b>fill,</b> <b>fluid</b> properties and motion characteristics. However, the complex, chaotic and non-linear behaviour of sloshing makes it hard to predict or estimate impact pressures. In-deck tanks are applied at the topside of the Aasta Hansteen SPAR project, carried out by CB&I. The application of these tanks faced difficulties concerning the sloshing assessment procedure. There is no method applicable related to this situation. Therefore, a conservative method has been defined as a temporary solution. For future implementation of these tanks, better understanding and knowledge of fluid behaviour is essential. In order to tackle this problem, a CFD analysis is carried out in two phases and concludes with a statistical analysis in order to estimate sloshing impact pressures. The first phase relates to a general 2 D CFD simulation for various cases. The second phase includes 2 D long time simulations of sloshing cases extracted from the first phase. The results of the first phase show that no sloshing occurs for the Aasta Hansteen SPAR related cases. Where the motion period of 60 seconds is too far away from the period of the 1 st wave mode, which is around 8 seconds. FPSO related cases contain a period around 10 seconds and show sloshing impact behaviour. The impacts occur specifically for longer tank lengths and higher filling levels as these cases coincide better with the motion behaviour of the tank. Noted that the combination of input parameters for which sloshing occurs is highly dependent on the forced excitation on the tank, where sloshing behaviour is sensitive to changes of these parameters. Furthermore, a motion case analysis is added and different sea states are assessed from mild to harsh tank motion excitations. Resulting in sloshing for harsher sea states and higher accelerations. Overall, sloshing impacts conclude in the order of 100 kPa - 300 kPa. The impact area includes the vertical wall and 2. 4 meters on the top of the tank. In the event of non-impulsive oscillating behaviour (no sloshing), one can apply the linear theory for an accurate prediction of the pressures. However, when the fluid motion becomes chaotic and non-linear, there is no method able to accurately predict the impact pressures. The results of the second phase contain the sloshing impact order of magnitude for eight individual sloshing cases. With difference in fluid, tank length, fill and motion type. Six of these cases can be compared to one another and resulted in a fill/length ratio of 0. 063 for the highest impact pressures. A lower viscosity of the fluid seems to increase the sensitivity to sloshing behaviour. Filling levels of 50 % - 70 % show high sloshing impacts, where 80 % fill does not result in sloshing anymore. The increase of tank lengths results in higher sloshing impacts. Briefly summed up: 7 m no sloshing, 12 m semi sloshing, 15 m sloshing impact order 150 kPa - 200 kPa and 20 m sloshing impact order 300 kPa - 500 kPa. Two fitting curves are used in order to establish the Exceedance Probability Function. Namely, the Generalized Pareto and Kernel Smoothing. Both show a good fitting, but present different behaviour in the so called 'tail' of the Probability Density Function. A good distribution of this 'tail' result in a better Exceedance Probability Function. A decision on the best fitting curve is not made due to the lack of sufficient simulated statistical data. The sensitivity analysis proved the Kernel Smoothing fitting more robust compared to the Generalized Pareto. Also, the reduction of statistical data resulted in the highest sensitivities within the sensitivity analysis. Which underlines the need of more simulation and statistical data for improvement of the results.

After testing the proper functioning of the sensor, the best materials for the capsule are determined based on acoustic properties. The capsule is designed and built by NPS staff. To predict {{the sensitivity of the}} encapsulated sensor, the characteristic equations are modified to reflect the new medium. In {{order to be able to}} predict the sensitivity of the encapsulated sensor, the performance ratio is determined between the sensitivity in air and the <b>filling</b> <b>fluid</b> of choice. Temperature dependency is introduced in the relevant parameters to be able to model the sensitivity at various operating temperatures. The measured sensitivity from the calibration report is then used to predict its performance in castor oil. The theoretical sensitivity model is verified by experimental data gathered from calibration studies at NUWC. The verified model is then used to analyze the consequences of changing critical operating parameters like the distance between the filaments and the operating temperature. Based on these calculations, recommendations are made for a better performing prototype. Eventually a new design is proposed that increases sensitivity significantly and is better adapted to operate in the <b>filling</b> <b>fluid.</b> Lieutenant Commander, Royal Netherlands Nav...|$|R
