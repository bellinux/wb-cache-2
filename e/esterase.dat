40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the enzymatic profile of <b>esterases</b> and peroxidases during early stages of somatic embryogenesis of Fritillaria meleagris L. Somatic embryogenesis was induced using the leaf base as explant on a medium supplemented with 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D). Zymography showed the presence of different moieties, six isoforms of <b>esterases</b> and peroxidases, during morphogenesis as compared to control explants. One isoform of <b>esterases</b> was detected only during the process of somatic embryogenesis, and one isoform was detected in control explants. Analysis of <b>esterases</b> with 1 -naphthyl butyrate proved that <b>esterases,</b> which participate in somatic embryogenesis of F. meleagris, belong to the family of aryl <b>esterases.</b> For the first time it was proved that five isoforms of <b>esterases,</b> which are involved in morphogenesis of F. meleagris, belong to the family of aryl <b>esterases,</b> while two isoforms are carboxyl <b>esterases.</b> One isoform of carboxyl <b>esterases</b> was visible in control explants. This is also the first description of peroxidases during the morphogenetic process, and of the difference between aryl and carboxyl <b>esterases.</b> More isoforms of <b>esterases</b> during morphogenesis as compared to control explants are probably responsible for some early physiological process during somatic embryogenesis of F. meleagris.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. elsevier. com. Includes bibliography. Three different monoacetates of 4 -nitrophenyl beta-D-xylopyranoside were tested as substrates for beta -xylosidase and for microbial carbohydrate <b>esterases</b> {{and a series of}} non-hemicellulolytic <b>esterases.</b> The acetyl group in 2 -O-acetyl, 3 -O-acetyl, and 4 -O-acetyl 4 -nitrophenyl beta-D-xylopyranoside makes the glycoside resistant to the action of beta-xylosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 37). This fact was explored to introduce a new enzyme-coupled assay of acetylxylan <b>esterases</b> (EC 3. 1. 1. 72) and other carbohydrate-deacetylating enzymes. The deacetylation converts the monoacetates into the substrate of beta -xylosidase, the auxiliary enzyme. The eVect of the acetyl group migration along the xylopyranoid ring in aqueous media can be avoided by shortening the assay duration. The assay enables an easy examination of the positional specificity of the enzymes, which is important for classification of acetylxylan <b>esterases</b> and for elucidation of the structure–function relationship among carbohydrate <b>esterases</b> in general. Non-hemicellulolytic <b>esterases</b> showed different positional specificity of deacetylation than did acetylxylan <b>esterases...</b>|$|R
40|$|Remifentanil is {{a potent}} opioid metabolized by serum and tissue esterases; it is {{routinely}} administered to patients with liver failure as anaesthetic and analgo-sedative without variation in doses, even if prolonged clinical effects and respiratory depression have been observed in these patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine remifentanil enzymatic degradation kinetics bearing in mind the effect of liver <b>esterases</b> in order to trace a more accurate pharmacokinetic profile of the drug. Solution samples were taken over time and analysed to measure remifentanil concentration by HPLC. We reproduced the physiological settings, varying temperature and pH in vitro and evaluated the kinetics of degradation of remifentanil in the presence of Rhizopus Oryzae <b>esterases,</b> equine liver <b>esterases</b> and porcine liver <b>esterases.</b> Remifentanil kinetics of degradation was accelerated by porcine liver <b>esterases.</b> Remifentanil in vitro half-life decreases with increasing temperatures in the presence of porcine liver <b>esterases.</b> A drug model simulation considering the effect of temperature in the presence of liver <b>esterases</b> was developed.

An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins.

5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate <b>esterase</b> and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|E
30|$|Industrially, feruloyl <b>esterases</b> {{are applied}} in various biotechnological {{processes}} such as production of platform chemicals, fuel, animal feed, textile, paper and pulp, food processing, agriculture and pharmaceutical industries (Fazary and Ju 2013). In the last few decades, several studies were being conducted to understand and increase the activity of enzymes used in paper and pulp industries. Enzyme mixtures containing feruloyl <b>esterases</b> and acetyl xylan <b>esterases</b> enhance the enzymatic activity of hemicellulases and cellulases, by breaking down the substitutions and linkages between lignin and carbohydrate complexes and solubilize the complex (Fazary and Ju 2013; Mathew and Abraham 2004; Topakas et al. 2004). The lignocellulolytic enzyme mixtures including feruloyl <b>esterases,</b> secreted by fungi, were being applied for the pretreatment of animal feedstock. Pretreatment of animal feedstock with the lignocellulolytic enzyme mixtures were significantly found to increase the activity of rumen microbiota by 80 %, thus increasing the rate of digestion (Mathew and Abraham 2004; Tarbouriech et al. 2005; Topakas et al. 2004). Major applications of feruloyl <b>esterases</b> were reported in food and pharmaceutical industries by converting cinnamic acid/ferulic acid and other phenolic compounds into commercially valuable products like vanillin (Fazary and Ju 2013). Feruloyl <b>esterases</b> are also applied for {{improving the quality of}} bread, preparation and clarification of juices, synthesis of oligosaccharides and production of medicinal compounds (Fazary and Ju 2013). Glucuronoyl <b>esterases</b> are active against a wide range of natural and synthetic lignin–carbohydrate complexes (Hüttner et al. 2017). Specifically, glucuronoyl <b>esterases</b> cleave ester linkages between the lignin and glucuronoxylan complexes (Arnling Bååth et al. 2016). Thus, glucuronoyl <b>esterases</b> share various industrial applications in common with feruloyl <b>esterases.</b> Glucuronoyl <b>esterases</b> are primarily used in biofuel industries in combinations with other lignocellulolytic enzymes for conversion of plant biomass into fuel. Studies have reported that the presence of glucuronoyl <b>esterases</b> in the enzyme mixture has significantly improved the rate of substrate hydrolysis (d’Errico et al. 2016). Glucuronoyl <b>esterases</b> are also applied in food and beverage industries for the clarification and concentration of fruit juices and wine. Glucuronoyl <b>esterases</b> are also applied for synthetically altering glucuronic acid derivatives for developing nonionic surfactants and other bioactive substances with great applications in the pharmaceutical (anti tumorous prodrugs) and cosmetic preparations (De Graaf et al. 2004). Studies were continuously being conducted for developing recombinant plants-vulnerable plant cell-wall components (Lionetti et al. 2010; Sticklen 2006); parallelly, studies were also reported to develop the recombinant enzymes with higher rate of hydrolysis and greater substrate-binding abilities (Himmel et al. 2007; Martinez et al. 2009). In this article, we have listed some of the state-of-the-art articles based on enzyme engineering and developing efficient recombinant enzymes (Bloom et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2018; Dalby 2007; Damborsky and Brezovsky 2014; Gaj et al. 2013; Jørgensen et al. 2007; Martinez et al. 2009; Taylor et al. 2001; Tischer and Wedekind 1999).|$|R
40|$|Filamentous fungi {{are widely}} used for enzyme {{production}} for the biofuel industry. The ascomycetous fungus Chrysosporium lucknowense C 1 was isolated as a natural producer of neutral cellulases. It is at present an attractive alternative to well known fungi like Aspergillus sp. and Trichoderma reesei for protein production on a commercial scale. Besides many cellulases, {{a large number of}} hemicellulases (particularly xylanases and arabinofuranosidases) and <b>esterases</b> (acetyl xylan <b>esterases</b> and ferulic acid <b>esterases)</b> encoding genes have also been identified in the C 1 genome. Many of these extracellular enzymes have been selectively expressed in C 1 and then purified and characterized. Four arabinofuranosidases, two acetyl xylan <b>esterases,</b> two ferulic acid <b>esterases,</b> an a-glucuronidase and four xylanases have been purified and characterized. All these enzymes were found to be active towards arabinoxylans, demonstrating the high potential of C 1 as a producer of hemicellulolytic enzymes...|$|R

5|$|Sundews are characterised by the glandular tentacles, {{topped with}} sticky secretions, that cover their laminae. The {{trapping}} and digestion mechanism usually employs {{two types of}} glands: stalked glands that secrete sweet mucilage to attract and ensnare insects and enzymes to digest them, and sessile glands that absorb the resulting nutrient soup (the latter glands are missing in some species, such as D.erythrorhiza). Small prey, mainly consisting of insects, are attracted by the sweet secretions of the peduncular glands. Upon touching these, the prey become entrapped by sticky mucilage which prevents their progress or escape. Eventually, the prey either succumb to death through exhaustion or through asphyxiation as the mucilage envelops them and clogs their spiracles. Death usually occurs within 15 minutes. The plant meanwhile secretes <b>esterase,</b> peroxidase, phosphatase and protease enzymes. These enzymes dissolve the insect and free the nutrients contained within it. This nutrient mixture is then absorbed through the leaf surfaces {{to be used by}} the rest of the plant.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, <b>esterase,</b> phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E
5|$|One synonym, Iridomyrmex greensladei, was {{described}} as a separate species from the meat ant based on the anatomical differences of its head and pronotum (the dorsal portion of the prothorax's exoskeletal plates), which are the same colour as its mesosoma. In the meat ant, the head and pronotum are usually lighter than the mesosoma. American entomologist Steve Shattuck notes that the two ants are non-sympatric (they exist in the same geographic area and regularly encounter each other), and supporting evidence to separate them as two distinct species emerged when the enzymes <b>esterase</b> and amylase were examined and the results show that they had different amylase allele. These examinations, however, did not take any account of any distinction in colour between populations previously known as I. greensladei and I. purpureus. For example, colonies residing in Western Australia may have lighter heads whereas those living in the eastern states have darker heads. An unpublished study examining the mitochondrial DNA did not find any distinction between eastern and western populations of I. greensladei and I. purpureus. Additional evidence suggests that the populations found in the east and west are the same species. Despite this evidence, there are several problems: forms intended to be I. greensladei were found in the Yorke Peninsula by a 1987 study, which noted that while the ants were morphologically indistinguishable from both I. greensladei and I. purpureus populations, their nests only contained a single nest hole (whereas I. purpureus nests have many). Shattuck also collected workers for his holotype and paratype specimens from Israelite Bay in Western Australia, rather than collecting those from Yorke Peninsula. The forms in Yorke Peninsula have also never been subject to study, so future research may shed light {{as to whether or not}} these ants are genetically different from the meat ant.|$|E

40|$|Larvae of {{the common}} green {{lacewing}} (GLW), Chrysopa carnea Stephens, have been reported tolerant to synthetic pyrethroid insecticides including permethrin (C/T) (3 -phenoxybenzyl- 3 -(2, 2 -dichlorovinyl) - 2, 2 -dimethyl-cyclopropanecarboxylate), the trans isomer being more toxic than cis. An investigation was performed to determine the possible role of metabolism in this tolerance. Following topical application, GLW metabolized 80 % of cis and 71 % of trans within two hrs. About 95 % of both cis and trans were metabolized by 50 hrs. Metabolism of C/T in vitro was compared to a susceptible insect, the tobacco budworm (TBW), Heliothis virescens (F.). GLW degraded cis 1. 7 -fold faster than trans, while TBW metabolized trans at a slightly higher rate than cis. When <b>esterases</b> and oxidases were active together or alone, cis and trans were metabolized faster by GLW than TBW. Metabolism of C/T by GLW was primarily oxidative with hydrolysis as a secondary mechanism. Trans is more toxic to GLW apparently because of this isomer's lower rate of detoxication. Several metabolites of C/T, cis-, and trans-permethrin were identified in studies with GLW in vivo and in vitro. It appeared that cis was metabolized more intensively than trans in vivo. The roles of <b>esterases</b> and oxidases in metabolizing C/T, cis-, and trans-isomers were studied in vitro and the following number of metabolites were identified: with C/T [...] five with <b>esterases</b> plus oxidases, six with <b>esterases,</b> and seven with oxidases alone. With cis [...] six metabolites were produced when <b>esterases</b> plus oxidases were active, five with <b>esterases,</b> and four with oxidases alone.
