50|$|FKM (by ASTM D1418 standard) (equivalent to FPM by ISO/DIN 1629 standard) is the {{designation}} for about 80% of fluoroelastomers {{as defined in}} ASTM D1418. Other <b>fluorinated</b> <b>elastomers</b> are perfluoro-elastomers (FFKM) and tetrafluoro ethylene/propylene rubbers (FEPM). All FKMs contain vinylidene fluoride as a monomer. Originally developed by DuPont (Viton), FKMs are today also produced by Daikin Chemical (Dai-El), 3M's Dyneon (Dyneon Fluoroelastomers), Solvay Specialty Polymers (Tecnoflon), HaloPolymer (Elaftor) and several Chinese manufacturers. Viton is now manufactured by Chemours. Fluoroelastomers are more expensive than neoprene or nitrile rubber elastomers. They provide additional heat and chemical resistance.

40|$|Stop Flow Lithography (SFL) is a microfluidic-based {{particle}} synthesis {{method for}} creating anisotropic multifunctional particles with applications {{that range from}} MEMS to biomedical engineering. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has been typically used to construct SFL devices as the material enables rapid prototyping of channels with complex geometries, optical transparency, and oxygen permeability. However, PDMS is not compatible with most organic solvents which limit the current range of materials that can be synthesized with SFL. Here, we demonstrate that a <b>fluorinated</b> <b>elastomer,</b> called perfluoropolyether (PFPE), can be an alternative oxygen permeable elastomer for SFL microfluidic flow channels. We fabricate PFPE microfluidic devices with soft lithography and synthesize anisotropic multifunctional particles in the devices via the SFL process - {{this is the first}} demonstration of SFL with oxygen lubrication layers in a non-PDMS channel. We benchmark the SFL performance of the PFPE devices by comparing them to PDMS devices. We synthesized particles in both PFPE and PDMS devices under the same SFL conditions and found the difference of particle dimensions was less than a micron. PFPE devices can greatly expand the range of precursor materials that can be processed in SFL because the fluorinated devices are chemically resistant to most organic solvents, an inaccessible class of reagents in PDMS-based devices due to swelling. close 0...|$|R

After describing commercially available (per) fluorocarbon elastomers, fluoro-phosphazenes and silicones, recent data on hybrid fluorosilicones containing longer chains (often fluorinated) between silicon atoms are supplied. The second part deals with well-architectured fluoroelastomers.

40|$|International audienceFluorinated {{polymers}} {{are usually}} synthesized by radical (co) polymerization of fluoroalkenes. These interesting materials have outstanding properties such as thermal stability, chemical inertness (to solvents, oils, water, acids, and bases), low refractive index, permittivity, dissipation factor and water absorptivity, {{as well as}} excellent weatherability, durability, and resistance to oxidation. Actually, two families of fluorinated polymers can be considered: (1) in first group, the fluorinated groups are located on the polymer backbone and their chemical inertness, thermal stability, low refractive index, and dielectric constant are explored, and (2) the second group contains a fluorinated dangling group that induces enhanced surface properties. Various strategies of synthesis via radical conventional or controlled copolymerizations are proposed; {{some of them are}} well-architectured fluoropolymers (block, graft, alternated, and so on) just like their properties and applications ranging from energy-related-materials (fuel cell membranes, separators for lithium ion batteries, piezoelectric devices) to original <b>fluorinated</b> <b>elastomers,</b> thermoplastic elastomers, surfactants, thermostable polymers, and optical devices...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{reliable}} technique for irreversibly bonding chemically inert Viton® membranes to PMMA and COC substrates to produce microfluidic devices with integrated elastomeric structures. Viton® {{is widely used}} in commercially available valves and has several advantages {{when compared to other}} elastomeric membranes currently utilised in microfluidic valves (e. g. PDMS), such as high solvent resistance, low porosity and high temperature tolerance. The bond strength was sufficient to withstand a fluid pressure of 400 kPa (PMMA/Viton®) and 310 kPa (COC/Viton®) before leakage or burst failure, which is sufficient for most microfluidic applications. We demonstrate and characterise on-chip pneumatic Viton® microvalves on PMMA and COC substrates. We also provide a detailed method for bonding <b>fluorinated</b> Viton® <b>elastomer,</b> a highly chemically compatible material, to PMMA and COC polymers.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of soft {{materials in the}} design of optical systems provides opportunities for imparting these optical systems with completely unprecedented properties. This will enhance performance of systems, such as optical fibers, and enable new application scenarios. Here, we report the design, manufacture and characterization of elastic stretchable optical fibers. Analogous to conventional optical fibers, the elastic fibers consist of a high index core, made from a polystyrene-polyisoprene triblock copolymer, and a low refractive index cladding, formed by a <b>fluorinated</b> thermoplastic <b>elastomer.</b> The fibers are manufactured by co-extrusion of their constituent materials. They can be stretched to 300 % strain repeatedly. Axial deformation of the fibers results in a variation of their light guiding properties. The fibers' attenuation coefficient was determined to be 0. 021 ± 0. 003 dB/mm, which is 2 orders of magnitude higher than for standard optical glass fibers. The high attenuation coefficient is likely due to scattering of light by air inclusions incorporated during manufacturing at the core-cladding interface. The fibers elastic modulus is 960 ± 280 kPA and their yield strength lies in the range of 2150 ± 480 kPA. The variation in intensity of guided light as a function of strain applied axially to the fibers was measured with a customized optical setup. Our experiments show that elastic optical fibers have properties that make them desirable as mechanical sensors and components in a range of other applications, provided current manufacturing shortcomings are addressed. The fibers could be used for light delivery to individual pixels of flexible deformable displays. They could be incorporated into clothing for delivery of light for display purposes or textile-integrated photonic circuits to create functional textiles. Because the fibers can stretch, the textiles or displays will be able to undergo deformation without damage or loss in performance. by Beth Cholst. Thesis: S.

40|$|Halogen bonding has {{increasingly}} facilitated {{the assembly of}} diverse host-guest solids. Here, we show that a well-known class of organic salts, bis(trimethylammonium) alkane diiodides, can reversibly encapsulate a,w-diiodoperfluoroalkanes (DIPFAs) through intermolecular interactions between the host’s I – anions and the guest’s terminal iodine substituents. The process is highly selective for the fluorocarbon that forms an I–∙∙∙I(CF 2) mI∙∙∙I – superanion that is matched in length to the chosen dication. DIPFAs that are 2 to 12 carbons in length (common industrial intermediates) can thereby be isolated from mixtures by means of crystallization from solution upon addition of the dissolved size-matched ionic salt. The solid-state salts can also selectively capture the DIPFAs from the vapor phase, yielding the same product formed from solution {{despite a lack of}} porosity of the starting lattice structure. Heating liberates the DIPFAs and regenerates the original salt lattice, highlighting the practical potential for the system in separation applications. ap,w-Diiodoperfluoroalkanes (a,w-DIPFAs) are key intermediates (1) for the synthe-sis of various fluorochemicals and fluoro-polymers, such as <b>fluorinated</b> <b>elastomers</b> (2 – 4).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes work {{in three}} inter-related areas – micro-fluidics, opto-fluidics and fluidic self-assembly. Micro-fluidics {{has gotten a}} boost in recent years {{with the development of}} multilayered elastomeric devices made of poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), allowing active elements like valves and pumps. However, while PDMS has many advantages, it is not resistant to organic solvents. New materials and/or new designs are needed for solvent resistance. I describe how novel <b>fluorinated</b> <b>elastomers</b> can replace PDMS when combined with three dimensional (3 -D) solid printing. I also show how another 3 -D fabrication method, multilayer photo-lithography, allows for fabrication of devices integrating filters. In general, 3 -D fabrications allow new kinds of micro-fluidic devices to be made that would be impossible to emulate with two dimensional chips. In opto-fluidics, I describe a number of experiments with quantum dots both inside and outside chips. Inside chips, I manipulate quantum dots using hydrodynamic focusing to pattern fine lines, like a barcode. Outside chips, I describe our attempts to create quantum dot composites with micro-spheres. I also show how evaporated gold films and chemical passivation can then be used to enhance the emission of quantum dots. Finally, within fluids, self-assembly is an attractive way to manipulate materials, and I provide two examples: first, a DNA-based energy transfer molecule that relies on quantum mechanics and self-assembles inside fluids. This kind of molecular photonics mimics parts of the photosynthetic apparatus of plants and bacteria. The second example of self-assembly in fluids describes a new phenomena - the surface tension mediated self assembly of particles like quantum dots and micro-spheres into fine lines. This self assembly by capillary flows can be combined with photo-lithography, and is expected to find use in future nano- and micro-fabrication schemes. In conclusion, advances in fluidics, integrating materials like quantum dots and solvent resistant elastomers along with 3 -D fabrication and methods of self assembly, provide a new set of tools that significantly expand our control over fluids...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the most}} {{pressing}} problems constraining the development of geothermal energy {{is the lack of}} satisfactory component and system reliability. This is due to the unavailability, on a commercial scale, of cost-effective materials that can function {{in a wide range of}} geothermal environments and to the unavailability of a comprehensive body of directly related test data or materials selection experience. In 1976, the GHTD started the Geothermal Materials Program to address materials-related problems, and since 1978 Brookhaven National Laboratory has provided technical and managerial assistance in the implementation of the effort. Major successes have been attained in the development of elastomers for high-temperature applications and in the use of polymer concrete liners for corrosion protection. Both technologies have been successfully transferred to industry. Current efforts in metallic and nonmetallic materials development and corrosion protection will be summarized. In the metals area, testing of a series of experimental stainless steels has led to compositions which show a very remarkable resistance to pitting corrosion in hot chloride electrolytes. Combinations of molybdenum and nitrogen are very beneficial. Alternate materials for line shaft pump bearings have been identified through tests in simulated hot brine. Cermets and carbides show promise of extending pump life. A series of drill bit steels has been examined for fatigue and hot fracture toughness. The work has indicated alloys with properties that exceed those of materials now in use. A major finding in the nonmetallic materials area has been the development of <b>fluorinated</b> <b>elastomers</b> for use in statis seals at temperatures greater than 300 C. Field testing has just commenced, but based upon laboratory results, the work is very promising. Commercialization of this material is underway. Technology transfer of a 240 C EPDM was completed earlier. Field testing of polymer concrete-lined pipe has been successful, and at least one commercial source of the material now exists. Programs started in FY 1983 include the development of high-thermal-conductivity composites for heat exchanger tubes and elastomers for dynamic seal applications. Cathodic protection measurements of carbon steel have been made, both in the laboratory and in the field, which showed the feasibility of such protection of some carbon steel components, e. g., the outer surface of well casing. More work is suggested to include heat exchanges. Studies of corrosion in binary systems is also reviewed...|$|E
