Bebek betutu is duck stuffed with spices, wrapped in banana leaves and coconut husks cooked in a pit of embers.

5000|$|The Adventure {{playground}} at the Parish School {{was started}} in 2008 with a sand-pile and two cement culverts. [...] The three-acre play-area now contains a zip-line, shade structures, and an expanse of grassy floodplain, with natural features (dirt, <b>grass,</b> <b>sticks),</b> wildlife, and various scavenged construction materials, other recyclables, lumber, pipes, fabric and rope. [...] Children also have access to tools (hammers and nails, hand drills and saws, shovels and post-hole diggers) for building structures out of recycled building materials. [...] Many of these materials are collected from the Building Materials Reuse Warehouse, {{a part of the}} [...] City of Houston's Solid Waste Management Department.|$|R
500|$|Males {{construct}} a rough nest in a semi-sheltered hollow on the ground, using bark, <b>grass,</b> <b>sticks</b> and leaves to line it. The nest {{is almost always}} a flat surface rather than a segment of a sphere, although in cold conditions the nest is taller, up to [...] tall, and more spherical to provide some extra heat retention. When other material is lacking, the bird sometimes uses a spinifex tussock a metre or so across, despite the prickly nature of the foliage. The nest can be placed on open ground or near a shrub or rock. The nest is usually placed {{in an area where}} the emu has a clear view of its surroundings and can detect approaching predators.|$|R
50|$|Northern {{caracaras}} {{can usually}} be spotted either alone, in pairs or family parties of 3-5 birds. Occasionally roosts may contain {{more than a dozen}} caracaras and abundant food sources can cause more than 75 to gather. The nesting season is from December to May and is a bit earlier the closer the birds live to the tropics. They build large stick nests in trees such as mesquites and palms, cacti, or on the ground as a last resort. The nests are bulky and untidy, 60 - 100 cm wide and 15 - 40 cm deep, often made of <b>grasses,</b> <b>sticks</b> and hay, spotted with much animal matter. It lays 2 to 3 (rarely 1 to 4) pinkish-brown eggs with darker blotches, which are incubated for 28-32 days.|$|R
50|$|Of the two subspecies, the {{nominate}} eastern race prefers sheltered beaches, and {{the western}} race L. p. georgii is commonly found even on exposed shores. Both subspecies nest in pairs or loose colonies on offshore islands, making a cup of <b>grasses</b> and <b>sticks</b> in an exposed position, and laying two or three mottled brown eggs.|$|R

50|$|The white-sided jackrabbit {{constructs}} {{and uses}} shelter forms averaging 15 in in length, 20 in in width, and 7 - 8 in in depth. The shelter form is usually located in clumps {{of grass and}} surrounded by dense stands of tobosa grass. The white-sided jackrabbit may also occupy underground shelters, but this behavior is rare. It forages by chewing and pulling grass blades near the ground until they are either uprooted or broken off. The food is ingested by chewing the <b>grass</b> <b>sticking</b> out of the mouth, with the head raised and the body sitting in a crouched position. The fore paws are not used in feeding except to brace against the ground as the grass is bitten off or uprooted. When eating certain nutgrass, however, the fore paws are used to excavate the bulbous tubers, leaving behind oval foraging depressions in which fecal pellets are often deposited.|$|R
50|$|Carex specuicola is a {{rare species}} of sedge known by the common name Navajo sedge. It is native to a small section of the Colorado Plateau in the United States, its {{distribution}} straddling the border between Utah and Arizona, and completely within the Navajo Nation. There are several populations but they are limited to {{a specific type of}} habitat. The plants grow from the sides of steep, often vertical cliffs of red Navajo Sandstone, in areas where water trickles from the rock. It occurs at elevations between 5700 and 6000 ft, usually in shady spots. Though it is not a grass, the sedge grows in inconspicuous clumps resembling tufts of <b>grass</b> <b>sticking</b> out of the rock face. When the sedge was federally listed as a threatened species in 1985, it was known from only three populations in Coconino County, Arizona, with no more than 700 plants existing. The species has since been observed in northeastern Arizona and San Juan County, Utah.|$|R
50|$|Iktomi {{comes across}} a {{beautiful}} peacock {{in a tree}} and wishes to be as beautiful as the peacock. He begs the peacock to give him wonderful feathers, so the peacock magically transforms Iktomi into a peacock. The only condition is that Iktomi may not try to fly. Being stubborn, Iktomi tries to fly but fails and gets transformed back into a human being. Next Iktomi comes across an arrow and is transformed into it, but again fails to follow one rule and returns to normal. Finally, he comes across a fawn and asks the fawn to give him spots similar to him. In {{order to get the}} spots, Iktomi has to be buried in a hole and burned with dried <b>grass,</b> <b>sticks,</b> and cedar ember. The fawn agrees to help Iktomi, and Iktomi lies down in the hole and blue smoke rises, but Iktomi climbs out of the fire before burning, and does not get the brown spots he desired.|$|R

500|$|Like all amphibians, {{the life}} of a long-toed {{salamander}} begins as an egg. In the northern extent of its range, the eggs are laid in lumpy masses along <b>grass,</b> <b>sticks,</b> rocks, or the mucky substrate of a calm pond. The number of eggs in a single mass ranges in size, possibly up to 110 eggs per cluster. Females invest a significant amount of resources into egg production, with the ovaries accounting for over 50% of the body mass in the pre-breeding season. A maximum of 264 eggs have been found in a single femalea large number considering each egg is approximately [...] in diameter. The egg mass is held together by a gelatinous outer layer protecting the outer capsule of individual eggs. The eggs are sometimes laid singly, especially in warmer climates south of the Canada and US border. The egg jellies contribute a yearly supply of biological material that supports the chemistry and nutrient dynamics of shallow-water aquatic ecosystems and adjacent forest ecosystems. The eggs also provide habitat for water molds, also known as oomycetes.|$|R

There, {{just above}} the water, was a splendid {{platform}} of mud and <b>grass</b> and <b>sticks.</b> A great many sticks were carefully laid {{as soon as the}} platform was above the water, for Paddy was very particular about this.

50|$|These {{birds are}} found alone, in pairs or small family groups. Males sing {{continuously}} at daybreak in the breeding season, which is normally between {{the months of}} July and August. Breeding occurs on the ground, with cup-shaped nests being built in depressions and lined with strips of bark, fine <b>grass</b> or <b>sticks.</b> The nest is usually located amongst rocky areas, against fallen branches or under low bushes or sparse tufts of grass. The clutch can contain two or three eggs.|$|R

A hole, near water, with dry grass bedding is usually used for birth, though if a hole is unavailable near water, nests are made of reeds, <b>grass,</b> and <b>sticks.</b> Up to three offspring per litter have been recorded, and the young open their eyes in 9-14 days, with weaning complete at 30-46 days. A second adult may accompany the family. Soon after weaning, the young depart.|$|R

Around this he lays solid foundations of log and stone in a circle from six to fifteen feet in diameter, according to the number of beavers to occupy the house. On these foundations he rears a thick mass of <b>sticks</b> and <b>grass,</b> which are held together by plenty of mud. The top is roofed by stout sticks arranged as in an Indian wigwam, and the whole domed over with <b>grass,</b> stones, <b>sticks,</b> and mud.
