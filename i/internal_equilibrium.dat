25|$|After formation, a hypercycle reaches {{either an}} <b>internal</b> <b>equilibrium</b> or {{a state with}} {{oscillating}} concentrations of each type of chain I, but with the total concentration of all chains remaining constant. In this way, the system consisting of all chains can be expressed as a single, integrated entity. During the formation of hypercycles, several {{of them could be}} present in comparable concentrations, but very soon, a selection of the hypercycle with the highest fitness value will take place. Here, the fitness value expresses the adaptation of the hypercycle to the environment, and the selection based on it is very sharp. After one hypercycle wins the competition, it is very unlikely that another one could take its place, even if the new hypercycle would be more efficient than the winner. Usually, even large fluctuations in the numbers of internal species cannot weaken the hypercycle enough to destroy it. In the case of a hypercycle, we can speak of one-for-ever selection, which is responsible for the existence of a unique translation code and a particular chirality.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermodynamic}} process {{might be}} initiated by a thermodynamic {{operation in the}} surroundings, that mechanically increases in the controlled volume of the vapor. Some mechanical work will be done within the surroundings by the vapor, but also some of the parent liquid will evaporate and enter the vapor collection which is the contiguous surrounding subsystem. Some internal energy will accompany the vapor that leaves the system, {{but it will not}} make sense to try to uniquely identify part of that internal energy as heat and part of it as work. Consequently, the energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of matter between the system and its surrounding subsystem cannot be uniquely split into heat and work transfers to or from the open system. The component of total energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of vapor into the surrounding subsystem is customarily called 'latent heat of evaporation', but this use of the word heat is a quirk of customary historical language, not in strict compliance with the thermodynamic definition of transfer of energy as heat. In this example, kinetic energy of bulk flow and potential energy with respect to long-range external forces such as gravity are both considered to be zero. The first law of thermodynamics refers to the change of internal energy of the open system, between its initial and final states of <b>internal</b> <b>equilibrium.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Microspherulites are {{microscopic}} spherical particles with diameter {{less than}} two mm, usually in the 100 micrometre range, mainly consisting of mineral material (the Greek litos means [...] "stone").

50|$|If an {{initially}} isolated physical system, without {{internal walls}} that establish adiabatically isolated subsystems, is left long enough, it will usually reach {{a state of}} thermal equilibrium in itself, in which its temperature will be uniform throughout, but not necessarily a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, {{if there is some}} structural barrier that can prevent some possible processes in the system from reaching equilibrium; glass is an example.

50|$|A {{thermodynamic}} system {{consisting of a}} single phase {{in the absence of}} external forces, in its own <b>internal</b> thermodynamic <b>equilibrium,</b> is homogeneous. This means that the material in any small volume element of the system can be interchanged with the material of any other geometrically congruent volume element of the system, and the effect is to leave the system thermodynamically unchanged. In general, a strong external force field makes a system of a single phase in its own <b>internal</b> thermodynamic <b>equilibrium</b> inhomogeneous with respect to some intensive variables. For example, a relatively dense component of a mixture can be concentrated by centrifugation.|$|R
25|$|This is {{also the}} reason why the zeroth law of {{thermodynamics}} is stated explicitly. If three physical systems, A, B, and C are each not in their own states of <b>internal</b> thermodynamic <b>equilibrium,</b> it is possible that, with suitable physical connections being made between them, A can heat B and B can heat C and C can heat A. In non-equilibrium situations, cycles of flow are possible. It is the special and uniquely distinguishing characteristic of <b>internal</b> thermodynamic <b>equilibrium</b> that this possibility is not open to thermodynamic systems (as distinguished amongst physical systems) which are in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium; this is {{the reason why the}} zeroth law of thermodynamics needs explicit statement. That is to say, the relation 'is not colder than' between general non-equilibrium physical systems is not transitive, whereas, in contrast, the relation 'has no lower a temperature than' between thermodynamic systems in their own states of <b>internal</b> thermodynamic <b>equilibrium</b> is transitive. It follows from this that the relation 'is in thermal equilibrium with' is transitive, which is one way of stating the zeroth law.|$|R

50|$|Thermal {{equilibrium}} {{of a body}} {{in itself}} refers to the body when it is isolated.

It is not implied that it is necessarily in other kinds of <b>internal</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> For example, it is possible that a body might reach internal thermal equilibrium but not be in internal chemical equilibrium; glass is an example.|$|E
5000|$|The kidneys have an {{important}} role in maintaining health. When healthy, the kidneys maintain the body's <b>internal</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of water and minerals (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sulfate). The acidic metabolism end-products that the body cannot get rid of via respiration are also excreted through the kidneys. The kidneys also function {{as a part of the}} endocrine system, producing erythropoietin, calcitriol and renin. Erythropoietin is involved in the production of red blood cells and calcitriol plays a role in bone formation. Dialysis is an imperfect treatment to replace kidney function because it does not correct the compromised endocrine functions of the kidney. Dialysis treatments replace some of these functions through diffusion (waste removal) and ultrafiltration (fluid removal). Dialysis uses highly purified (also known as [...] "ultrapure") water.|$|E
