5|$|The {{transmission}} of the T-26 consisted of single-disc main dry clutch, a gearbox with five gears in the front part of the vehicle, steering clutches, <b>final</b> <b>drives</b> and band brakes.

25|$|The TRAXX P160 AC is the {{passenger}} {{version of this}} class, with a correspondingly higher top speed of 160km/h. A lower unsprung mass was achieved by using hollow shaft <b>final</b> <b>drives</b> instead of the axle hung motor arrangement of the 140km/h maximum speed versions. The bogies and drive unit {{are the same as}} used in the DBAG Class 146.0.|$|E
25|$|The WC was {{the first}} farm tractor to have rubber tires as {{standard}} equipment, and the first tractor tested on rubber in the Nebraska tractor tests. The pneumatic-rubber-tire-on-steel-wheel combination was more expensive to make than a steel wheel with cleats. To make rubber tires standard equipment while also keeping {{the cost of the}} tractor low, the WC's designers, C.E. Frudden and Walter Strehlow, gave the WC drop gearing at the rear (bull-gear-with-pinion <b>final</b> <b>drives),</b> which allowed row-crop ground clearance while having smaller-diameter drive wheels. Drop gearing had appeared many times before on earlier tractors, but never yet for this new reason—to minimize the amount of rubber needed for the tires.|$|E

25|$|Currently {{there are}} several {{companies}} manufacturing aftermarket internal combustion engine (ICE) motor conversion kits for conventional bicycles. These include both four-stroke and two-stroke gasoline engine designs. Among these, Golden Eagle Bike Engines currently produces a rear-engine (rack-mounted) kit using a belt to drive the rear wheel. Staton-Inc., a motorized bicycle manufacturer of long standing, also uses a rack-mount with either a tire roller-mount (friction drive) or a chain-driven, geared transmission. Other manufacturers produce kits using small two- or four-stroke gas engines mounted in the central portion of the bicycle frame, and incorporating various types of belt- or chain-driven transmissions and <b>final</b> <b>drives.</b> Some of these brands include Jiangdu Flying Horse Gasoline Engine Factory Ltd., EZ Motorbike Company, Inc., Mega Motors Inc., and Grubee Inc.|$|E
25|$|After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, the Badgers {{jumped to}} a 10–0 lead after freshman running back Montee Ball scored from 10 yards out. Then, {{in a scene}} reminiscent of Iowa's effort at Penn State three weeks earlier, the Hawks rattled off 20 unanswered points, while the defense intercepted Wisconsin QB Scott Tolzien three times. Also similar to the win over Penn State, Tolzien was picked off two times on Wisconsin's <b>final</b> <b>drives</b> that threatened to put Wisconsin in the game again. Unlike that night, Iowa was not trailing in the 4th quarter, they took a 17–10 lead early in the 4th and nearly scored once more up 20–10 in the red zone, but couldn't convert a 4th down. Despite this, the 10-point lead {{was more than enough}} for the Hawkeyes to win.|$|E

25|$|All four-speed manual {{transmissions}} {{were built}} at the Muncie, Indiana Allison plant. The 1984 production line saw two transmissions, a performance four-speed with a <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> ratio of 4.10, and an economy four-speed with a <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> ratio of 3.32. The V6 on the 1985 model {{and part of the}} 1986 production year came with a four-speed with a <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> ratio of 3.65. The lower-geared 4.10 four-speed transmission showed improved acceleration, but sacrificed fuel economy.|$|R
25|$|A {{total of}} 14 {{vehicles}} underwent this conversion. Like many M3 medium tanks in Australia, the Yerambas were normally fitted {{with an additional}} cast armour plate of between 38mm to 44mm thickness bolted over the transmission housing and <b>final</b> <b>drives</b> on {{the nose of the}} vehicle. All of the Yerambas produced were issued to the 22nd Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery between 1950 and 1952 and based at Puckapunyal. The regiment subsequently adopted the Royal Australian Armoured Corps black beret with the Royal Australian Artillery cap badge, and were issued with AFV crewman's rubberised canvas soled boots. However, it was subsequently disbanded in 1957 and the Yerambas disposed of after being declared obsolete. They were never used operationally. Despite the gruelling labour associated with maintaining them, the Yeramba was considered a very good weapon by its crews.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{compartment}} {{is located in}} the rear of the vehicle and consists of: a 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine developing 450hp, a main clutch, a gearbox, a <b>final</b> <b>drives,</b> and brakes. The suspension of the vehicle consists of five rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear, an idler at the front, and four track-return rollers. The BMD-3 is fitted with a new hydromechanical transmission with hydrostatic steering mechanism. This adjustable suspension gives a ground clearance between 130 and 530mm with 450mm being the default. This hydropneumatic suspension allows the BMD-3 to decrease its height to be able to board transport aircraft like the Il-76M. The ground clearance is adjusted by the driver and it takes 10 seconds to lower or raise the suspension. The maximum road speed is 70km/h and the maximum off-road speed is 45km/h. The vehicle can achieve an operational range of up to 500km on paved roads and can climb up to 60% gradient and move on a 30% side slope. The ground pressure exerted by the BMD-3 is 0.48 kg/cm2 with standard tracks and 0.32kg/cm2 with broader tracks.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{dimensions}} {{and weight of}} the BMD-3 are diminutive in comparison to its counterparts. The crew consists of a driver, a vehicle commander, and a gunner and holds four passengers. There are seats for mounted infantrymen {{in the middle of}} the hull, with one stowage rack for three 9M111 or 9M113 ATGMs. There are also three racks for ammunitions boxes and a filter-ventilation unit. The commander's seat is on the right of the turret and has a cupola with a hatch cover that opens forward, while the gunner's seat is on the left and has a single-piece hatch cover that opens to the front. Of the four passengers, two are seated at the front with the other two near behind the turret. A firing port is provided on each side of the BMD-3. Additional infantry can be seated for short distances to the immediate rear of the turret with the roof hatch open. The seats of the combat crew are fastened to the roof of the combat compartments to improve protection from IEDs and mines. The engine compartment is located towards the rear of the BMD-3 consisting of a 450hp (horsepower) 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine, main clutch, gearbox, <b>final</b> <b>drives</b> and brakes. A collective NBC protection system was provided by over-pressurization of the combat compartment via a filter-ventilation unit to insure the survivability of the crew in an environment contaminated by nuclear fallout.|$|E

[...] EDL is a part, or [...] "function", of the Bosch ESP8.0 Electronic Stability Programme, which also includes [...] "Anti-Slip Regulation" [...] (ASR) traction control system. [...] EDL does not 'lock' the differential in a traditional sense, but uses electronics to compare the speeds of the two wheels on an axle, and brakes any wheel that is sensed to have lost traction (by rotating faster than the opposite wheel, beyond normal accepted deviations). [...] This braking of a slipping wheel {{has the effect of}} transferring torque across the axle to the other wheel, which is assumed still to have traction.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its opening}} drive {{of the fourth}} quarter, Michigan drove deep into Purdue territory, but Jim Detwiler fumbled at the three-yard line and Purdue {{recovered}} the ball in its own endzone.

[...] Coach Elliott called for the two-point conversion; Timberlake carried the ball on an end run but was stopped short of the goal line. Michigan's defense forced punts on the next two Purdue drives, but Michigan was unable to score on its <b>final</b> <b>drives.</b> [...] The Wolverines fumbled on one drive and failed to convert a fourth down on the final drive.
