For some years the technology had problems from lack of power and motor resonance. These problems were solved with the advent of rare-earth hybrid motors, high voltage micro-stepping drives and incremental <b>encoder</b> <b>feedback.</b> The robots calibrate themselves by driving each axis slowly to a target sensed by a proximity detector. Incremental optical encoders then track along with the motors to check for errors. This is called closed loop control which differs from servo control in that the stepping motors run essentially an open loop — the loop is only closed {{at the end of each}} movement of the arm. ST’s latest arm, the R12 Mk2, has the encoders only as an option.|$|E

Results show that our proposed method can decrease drift error effectively compared to the original encoder and that it can achieve comparable PSNR to a conventional drift-error-resilient encoder.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{tries to}} unify the three classes of capacity-approaching codes: time-varying convolutional codes, turbo codes, and low-density parity-check codes. The structural properties of periodically time-varying convolutional codes are studied first. It is shown that every periodically time-varying convolutional encoder is equivalent to a time-invariant convolutional encoder. A method to find the time-invariant convolutional <b>encoder</b> with <b>feedback</b> equivalent to a periodically time-varying convolutional <b>encoder</b> with <b>feedback</b> is found. Based on the equivalence between periodically time-varying and time-invariant convolutional encoders, a new catastrophic condition for periodically time-varying convolutional encoders is derived. A new technique to convert a catastrophic periodically time-varying convolutional encoder into a noncatastrophic encoder is also presented. The average transfer functions of periodically time-varying convolutional codes {{and their relationship to}} the spectrum-thinning conjecture of periodically time-varying convolutional codes are discussed. ^ Time-varying convolutional codes are found to be compatible with the turbo iterative decoding algorithm and thus can be used to build good turbo codes. A time-varying turbo code, i. e., turbo code with periodically time-varying convolutional component codes, that outperforms some of the well-known turbo codes is constructed. This turbo code is found to have thinner distance spectrum than the other turbo codes. ^ To understand the relationship between turbo and low-density parity-check codes better, a general form of the generator and parity-check matrices of an arbitrary turbo code is derived. Turbo codes are then decoded by the sum-product algorithm based on their parity-check matrices. Guided by the general expression of the parity-check matrix of an arbitrary turbo code, turbo encoders with large memory and selected generator polynomials are used to generate turbo codes with low-density parity-check matrices. These codes can be decoded by the sum-product algorithm, whereas the turbo decoding algorithm is impractical due to the large encoder memory. The bit-error-rate performance of these turbo codes is still worse than that of the conventional low-density parity-check codes. This loss in performance may be justified by the largely decreased encoder complexity. ...|$|R

This system consists of three photovoltaic panels which will be analyzed in ME 374 Heat Power Laboratory. Students in this laboratory will examine the performance benefits of the solar panel as it tracks the sun versus when it remains at a fixed orientation. While tracking the sun, mechanical switches are used to ensure the solar panel system does not exceed the rotational limits. To find the correct orientation, the LabVIEW code calculates the location of the sun in terms of azimuth and elevation angles based on the date and time from the computer. These angles determine how the solar panel must be oriented so that it remains perpendicular to the sun’s rays. To ensure the panels are oriented properly, encoders attached to the motors communicate the rotational displacement of the motor shaft to the program.

30|$|Bitrate {{allocation}} In {{most of the}} DVC codecs (PDWZ/TDWZ), the bitrate of WZ {{frame is}} determined by exploiting the statistical correlation between the side information and original WZ frame. Due to the architectural constraint, the encoder does {{not have access to}} side information. Therefore, the accurate estimation of the number of parity bits that will be sufficient for decoding is very complex. This rate control problem is commonly addressed by using the <b>feedback</b> channel between <b>encoder</b> and decoder. In case of decoding failure, a request for more parity bits will be sent to <b>encoder</b> via <b>feedback</b> channel. However, the request is unable to inform the encoder the number of parity bits that should be sent. Sending redundant parity bit increases the transmission energy consumption, a situation that will be exacerbated in multihop WVSN scenario. On the other hand, architectures without feedback channel usually compute the side-information at encoder to predict the bitrate, which results in greater computational complexity (and associated energy consumption) at the encoder that consequently decreases the lifetime of the source node and the entire network.|$|R

We emphasize an example where the decoder alphabet lies in a space of beliefs on the source alphabet, and the additive cost function is a log likelihood ratio pertaining to sequential information gain. We also consider the inverse optimal control problem, where a fixed encoder/decoder pair satisfying statistical conditions is shown to be optimal for some cost function, using probabilistic matching.

The variable-gamma model with appropriate summed feedback was most accurate for describing encoding behavior of both cell types. The leaky integrator model, while useful for determining summed feedback parameters, was inadequate to account for underlying mechanisms of encoder activity. For the stretch receptor, two summed feedback processes were detected: one had a short time constant; the other, a long one. Appropriate tests indicated that the short time constant effect was from an electrogenic sodium pump, and the same is presumed for the long time constant summed feedback. Both feedbacks show seasonal and/or species variations. Short hyperpolarizing pulses inhibited the feedback from the long time constant process. The eccentric cell also showed two summed feedback processes: one is due to self inhibition, the other is postulated to be a short time constant electrogenic sodium pump similar to that described in the stretch receptor...|$|E
