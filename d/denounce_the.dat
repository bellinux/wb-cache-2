5|$|Harding's general {{election}} opponent was Ohio Attorney General Timothy Hogan, who {{had risen to}} statewide office despite widespread prejudice against Roman Catholics in rural areas. In 1914, the start of World War I {{and the prospect of}} a Catholic senator from Ohio increased nativist sentiment. Propaganda sheets with names like The Menace and The Defender contained warnings that Hogan was the vanguard in a plot led by Pope Benedict XV through the Knights of Columbus to control Ohio. Harding did not attack Hogan (an old friend) on this or most other issues, but he did not <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> nativist hatred for his opponent.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer {{suffers a}} back injury from the rodeo and sees a chiropractor, but does not follow his instructions. Later, Homer falls {{backwards}} onto a round garbage can at home and discovers that it solved his back problems. He makes a business out of his discovery, which proves {{to be a successful}} method of solving problems with pain, causing the chiropractic business decline until the chiropractors in town <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> method and destroy the garbage can at the Simpsons' home.|$|E

5|$|Ministers of {{the church}} {{reported}} that {{the site of a}} newly constructed temple in Silao was subject to harassment of its members, vandalism, and physical threats because of religious intolerance, which caused them to request increased police protection. In February 2012, seventy ministers of La Luz del Mundo from different nations appeared before Mexican authorities in Guadalajara to <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> lack of police protection for the church's residents in the city after a series of attacks left several members hospitalized.|$|E
5|$|The march {{originally}} was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition {{of blacks in}} the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. However, the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.|$|E
5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} in farm subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E
50|$|Three councils were held, two by Constantinople, one by Rome. Rome {{attempted}} {{to replace a}} seated Patriarch with one amenable to the Filioque dispute. The Orthodox responded by <b>denouncing</b> <b>the</b> replacement and excommunicating the pope convening <b>the</b> Roman council, <b>denouncing</b> <b>the</b> pope's attempt to control affairs outside the purview of Rome, and <b>denouncing</b> <b>the</b> addition of Filioque as a heresy. Each church recognizes its own council(s) as legitimate and does not recognize the other's council(s).|$|R

5|$|If {{this were}} the case, Helble {{concluded}} that the United States should tell Diệm that his regime must condemn {{the actions of the}} troops and punish the culprits. If Diệm refused, the United States should threaten to publicly condemn and distance itself from Saigon. With the US also decrying the use of troops against civilian protests, the South Vietnamese government complained that unlike their Saigon counterparts, the Huế police were not trained in riot control. Diệm's authorities requested that the Americans airlift 350 military personnel from Vũng Tàu in the far south to quell the protests in Huế, but the Americans refused. William Trueheart, {{who was in charge of}} the US Embassy, Saigon while Ambassador Frederick Nolting was on holiday, confronted Secretary of State Nguyễn Đình Thuận about the allegations of blister gas usage the next day. Thuận appeared to be astounded and asked Trueheart what blister gas was. Trueheart explained that the symptoms of the victims were consistent with those of mustard gas and passed on the US threat to <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> regime for the chemical attacks.|$|E
5|$|Leopold's {{decision}} to surrender was seized {{on by the}} British and French press who blamed him for the military situation. The Belgian government met in Paris on 26 May and invoked Article 82 of the Constitution, declaring the monarch unable to reign (dans l'impossibilité de régner), and resolved to continue the fight against Germany. The following day, Pierlot held an important meeting with the French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, in which the French premier called for the Belgian government to publicly <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> King and his surrender. Following the meeting, Pierlot gave a radio speech denouncing the King whom he accused of acting unconstitutionally and in sympathy with the Germans. Before being broadcast, Pierlot's speech was heavily edited by the French minister Georges Mandel to ensure a position favorable to the French. The denunciation of the King, who was popular across most strata of Belgian society {{and supported by the}} church, led to a big loss of public support and alienated Pierlot from his supporters and party.|$|E

25|$|MSF {{first began}} work in Srebrenica (in Bosnia and Herzegovina) {{as part of}} a UN convoy in 1993, one year after the Bosnian War had begun. The city had become {{surrounded}} by the Bosnian Serb Army and, containing about 60,000 Bosniaks, had become an enclave guarded by a United Nations Protection Force. MSF was the only organisation providing medical care to the surrounded civilians, and as such, did not <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> genocide for fear of being expelled from the country (it did, however, <b>denounce</b> <b>the</b> lack of access for other organisations). MSF was forced to leave the area in 1995 when the Bosnian Serb Army captured the town. 40,000 Bosniak civilian inhabitants were deported, and approximately 7,000 were killed in mass executions.|$|E

25|$|Muslim {{popular opinion}} {{on the subject of}} attacks on civilians by Islamist groups varies.
