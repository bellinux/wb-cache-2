50|$|During World War II, DayGlo {{products}} were extensively {{used by the}} U.S. military in applications where visibility was required. U.S. ground troops in North Africa identified themselves using daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>fabric</b> panels to prevent friendly fire bombings by pilots, and DayGlo paints were used on aircraft to prevent mid-air collisions. Navy air carriers used DayGlo's black light fluorescent paints to allow planes to land at night, an advantage that enemy pilots did not have. Military equipment manufacturers, particularly those of aircraft parts, employed DayGlo's Zyglo and Magnaglo processes to identify defects in metal fabricated parts.After the war, daylight fluorescent paints were used by advertisers to make their products more visible to consumers. Tide detergent became known for its fluorescent packaging beginning in 1959, but other products such as clothing, posters and hula hoops also used daylight fluorescent colors. Daylight fluorescent pigments were also used across safety applications such as construction cones, street signs and safety vests, due to their high visibility.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} specifies {{three classes}} {{of activities and}} the minimum quantity of fluorescent and retroreflective material to be worn in each class. In Class 1 activities there is a relatively low hazard from slow-moving vehicles, for example, in a parking lot. Garments must have retroreflective strips 1 inch wide and a minimum of 217 square inches of fluorescent material. Class 2 activities take place in proximity to vehicles moving up to 25 miles per hour, for example, railway workers or school crossing guards. The standard requires reflective bands of greater width and 755 square inches of conspicuously colored fabric. Class 3 activities take place near traffic moving faster than 25 miles per hour, for example, highway construction. The standard requires at least 1240 square inches of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>fabric,</b> and two-inch retrorefector bands. Only very large vests have enough area to meet this standard, so full sleeves may be required. A further class of garment is Class E high visibility pants, which, {{in conjunction with a}} Class 2 or Class 3 vest, are recommended by the standard for Class 3 activities.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{performers}} undergo a metamorphosis indicated by often dramatic costume changes; for instance, the urbanites' outfits begin in dark, muted blues, reds, and greens and end in white, fairy-like outfits. In the German wheel costumes, Lemieux accented dark colors with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{to provide a}} high contrast with the black lights used during this act. The performers were designed to appear as marionettes and to emphasize human anatomy. The costumes designed for the flying trapeze act are tribal and androgynous. They are elaborated with complex collars, head ornaments and tutu skirts for the males. Les Cons were inspired by the Pierrot, with simple, white outfits to depict their innocence.|$|R
40|$|A static {{field study}} was conducted, both {{during the day}} and at night, to examine the effect that color {{contrast}} within a safety vest has on noticeability. Fluorescent orange and yellow fabrics were matched with orange, yellow, silver, or white retroreflective trim to appear similar to a safety vest. The method of paired comparisons was used to develop a linear scale of how noticeable the various color combinations appeared under cluttered and uncluttered viewing conditions. The results indicate that color contrast within the safety vest, as well as relative to the environmental surround, affects judgments of noticeability. However, in the nighttime condition color contrast was not an identifiable attribute, as all the retroreflective materials used appeared white when illuminated. In the nighttime condition, the luminance of the retroreflective trim accounted for almost all {{of the variance in the}} noticeability judgments. The results of this study suggest that a design for safety apparel that includes a combination of fluorescent yellow and <b>fluorescent</b> orange <b>fabrics</b> (providing color contrast for the daytime) with silver/white micro-prismatic retroreflective trim (proving high luminance for nighttime) is likely to be the most noticeable combination in both daytime and nighttime conditions...|$|R
40|$|A new {{important}} application {{field of}} β-cyclodextrins is the textile dyeing technical process. Their ability to form inclusion complexes with textile dyes is {{guaranteed by the}} modification of physical and chemical properties. The possibility of host-guest associations between cyclodextrins and dyes allows modifications of features like: solubility, stability or even affinity of organic dyes for the textile materials. The production of fluorescent cellulosic materials is conditioned by the unavailability of dyes in market for these propose with a single exception of the Remazol Luminous Yellow FL. The aim of the work was to find out suitable method of dyeing fluorescent cellulosic fibers using available fluorescent dyes for the dyeing of synthetic fibers. Two different commercial β-cyclodrextrins, methylated and hydroxypropilated cyclodextrins, were tested in a dyeing process using Rhodamine B as model dye. The influence of process parameters such as pH, cationic agent, CD type and concentration were analysed. It {{was found that the}} two-step method, consisting of one impregnation process with CD-dye complexes, at alkaline pH and room temperature followed of a fixation step (180 ºC, 1 min) is the most convenient process to obtain <b>fluorescent</b> dyed <b>fabrics</b> with suitable performance. The obtained results demonstrate that the cotton could be dyed using β-cyclodextrins based process with good balance between washing fastness properties and mechanical properties of dyed fabrics.

50|$|The A set is {{the first}} {{passenger}} train {{in the world to}} use LED lamps for all lighting (except headlights) In doing so the designers managed to remove almost 800kg in reflectors and ballasts associated with fluorescent units, as well as reducing power consumption to around a quarter of that used by <b>fluorescents..</b> Woollen moquette <b>fabric,</b> a durable, vandal-resistant material first used in the OSCAR trains, Hunter Railcars, and later adopted in the refurbishments of both the Tangara and Endeavour railcars, is used to cover the train's seats. The seats were a groundbreaking design, using specially developed shock absorbers such that the reversing feature is damped (try reversing the seats quickly and then slowly) - this was a safety feature added to allow reversible seats which would contain passengers {{in the event of an}} accident. Detailed design of the train was completed in July 2009.|$|R
