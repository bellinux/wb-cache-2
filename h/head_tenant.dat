The exact place of his birth is unclear, though it likely {{occurred}} near {{the small town of}} Aghagurty that Carroll's father took as part of his name. Some of the family property near Aghagurty was obtained by a friend, Richard Grace, who made Daniel Carroll the <b>head</b> <b>tenant.</b> This action gave the family a livelihood, but the family continued to have limited means compared to their former status. It is likely that Charles Carroll was fostered by the wealthier Grace, who had no son; his greater resources could provide for the child's education.|$|E

40|$|Executive SummaryAn {{assessment}} of tenant {{experiences of the}} National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing (NPARIH) Property and Tenancy Management (PTM) reforms in the Northern Territory was undertaken {{on behalf of the}} Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Aff airs (FaHCSIA), in conjunction with the Northern Territory Government. The Allen Consulting Group implemented the project in collaboration with the Larrakia Nation Aboriginal Corporation. PTM reforms and the new Remote Rental Framework represent a signifi cant change for remote communities and follow a substantial investment in new, rebuilt and refurbished housing stock. The reforms extend urban public housing standards to remote communities with no previous requirement to enter into a formal undertaking on joint responsibilities relating to property and tenancy management. The undertaking relates to all aspects of sustaining the housing and nominates a <b>head</b> <b>tenant(s)</b> responsible for the house and damages. The objective of the project was to fill critical in formation gaps {{about the impact of the}} PTM reforms on tenants and communities at a relatively early stage in the reform process. Hearing from communities about their experience of the reforms provides important feedback to inform the ongoing development an d implementation of policy, program design and effective service delivery. This report outlines the findings of a survey of tenants in 10 0 households in selected remote Northern Territory communities, against background information about the roll out of th e reforms and local implementation involving over 3, 200 new, rebuilt and refurbished houses. Background information was obtained through review of policy and program documentation, and consultation with key government stakeholders and community service providers. Additional background was obtained through a targeted literature review that included relevant government reports and emerging research...|$|R

On 8 March 1744 Mackellar was promoted to engineer extraordinary and on 31 July 1751 to engineer in ordinary; on 1 Dec 1745 he was also appointed an ensign in Wynyard’s Regiment (4th Marines), presumably by purchase.

40|$|This book is {{designed}} to complement the author’s A New Land Law,integrating with that work in its simplified terminology, and emphasising a three-fold functional classification of leases – short residential tenancies, long residential leases and commercial leases. Rented housing is treated as a unified whole, with particular prominence being given to shorthold arrangements. The book includes reference to the changes to the allocation and homelessness regimes proposed by Part II of the Homes Bill 2000. It also considers {{the impact of the}} Human Rights Act 1998, the changes to repossession procedures implemented by the Woolf Reforms, and the year 2000 bumper crop of decisions on housing law. Leasehold tenure is undergoing dramatic changes. The book draws a functional distinction between long residential leases and rental arrangements, based on the registrability of long leases, their freedom from rent controls and security of tenure, special controls of management and forfeiture, and enfranchisement rights. Extensive coverage is given to the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Bill 2000, introduced into the House of Lords in December 2000, and promising improvements in the enfranchisement schemes, additional management controls, and a commonhold scheme. Topics on commercial leases (business and agricultural) given special attention include the reasonable recipient principle for the construction of notices, a decision on the effect on a sub-tenant of an upwards notice to quit by his <b>head</b> <b>tenant,</b> and Law Commission proposals on the Termination of Tenancies (1999).

40|$|This {{study has}} been carried out to {{determine}} the household fish consumption structure and purchase behaviors in urban areas of Van Province. The main data of this {{study has been}} compiled through questionnaires from 260 households. In the analysis of the data, frequency tables, chi-square independence test were used and the relationships between the quantity of fish consumption of the households and some socio–demographic categorical variables have been examined through f and t tests. It has been determined that 89. 2 % of the participating households consume fish while 10. 8 % do not. Nearly a third (35. 7 %) of the households that do not consume fish do so for the smell of the fish. 84. 1 % of the households consume fish in winter. 87. 2 % consume fresh fish while 40 % consume fish by frying. Mostly preferred fish are anchovy, trout and tarek respectively. It has been determined that the amounts of fish consumption per month per household and per person are 6. 3 kg and 1. 4 kg respectively.

His family have emigrated, but he has remained here on his estates. Then, too, you have many other military officers who have served.

6000|$|The same {{prospect}} of misery {{hung over the}} <b>head</b> of another <b>tenant</b> of this hardhearted lord of the soil. This was a tough true-blue Presbyterian, called Deans, who, though most obnoxious to the Laird on account of principles in church and state, contrived to maintain his ground upon the estate by regular payment of mail-duties, kain, arriage, carriage, dry multure, lock, gowpen, and knaveship, and all the various exactions now commuted for money, and summed up in the emphatic word rent. But the years 1700 and 1701, long remembered in Scotland for dearth and general distress, subdued the stout heart of the agricultural whig. Citations by the ground-officer, decreets of the Baron Court, sequestrations, poindings of outside and inside plenishing, flew about his ears {{as fast as the}} tory bullets whistled around those of the Covenanters at Pentland, Bothwell Brigg, or Airsmoss. Struggle as he might, and he struggled gallantly, [...] "Douce David Deans" [...] was routed horse and foot, and lay at the mercy of his grasping landlord just at the time that Benjamin Butler died. The fate of each family was anticipated; but they who prophesied their expulsion to beggary and ruin were disappointed by an accidental circumstance.|$|R
60|$|For a week, {{the dark}} {{covering}} of the Otsego {{was left to}} the undisturbed possession of two eagles, who alighted on the centre of its field, and sat eyeing their undisputed territory. During {{the presence of these}} monarchs of the air, the flocks of migrating birds avoided crossing the plain of ice by turning into the hills, apparently seeking the protection of the forests, while the white and bald <b>heads</b> of the <b>tenants</b> of the lake were turned upward, with a look of contempt. But the time had come when even these kings of birds were to be dispossessed. An opening had been gradually increasing at the lower extremity of the lake, and around the dark spot where the current of the river prevented the formation of ice during even the coldest weather; and the fresh southerly winds, that now breathed freely upon the valley, made an impression on the waters. Mimic waves began to curl over the margin of the frozen field, which exhibited an outline of crystallizations that slowly receded toward the north. At each step the power of the winds and the waves increased, until, after a struggle of a few hours, the turbulent little billows succeeded in setting the whole field in motion, when it was driven {{beyond the reach of the}} eye, with a rapidity that was as magical as the change produced in the scene by this expulsion of the lingering remnant of winter. Just as the last sheet of agitated ice was disappearing in the distance, the eagles rose, and soared with a wide sweep above the clouds, while the waves tossed their little caps of snow in the air, as if rioting in their release from a thraldom of five minutes’ duration.|$|R
60|$|There was {{not much}} to enliven the house at Folking during these days. Caldigate would pass {{much of his time}} walking about the place, {{applying}} his mind as well as he could to the farm, and holding up his <b>head</b> among the <b>tenants,</b> with whom he was very popular. He had begun his reign over them with hands not only full but free. He had drained, and roofed, and put up gates, and repaired roads, and shown himself to be an active man, anxious to do good. And now in his trouble they were very true to him. But their sympathy could not ease the burden at his heart. Though by his words and deeds among them he seemed to occupy himself fully, there was a certain amount of pretence in every effort that he made. He was always affecting a courage in which he felt himself to be deficient. Every smile was false. Every brave word spoken was an attempt at deceit. When alone in his walks,--and he was mostly alone,--his mind would fix itself on his great trouble, and on the crushing sorrow which might only too probably fall upon that loved one whom he had called his wife. Oh, with what regret now did he think of the good advice which the captain had given him on board the Goldfinder, and of the sententious, timid wisdom of Mrs. Callender! Had she,--his Hester, ever uttered to him one word of reproach,--had she ever shuddered in his sight when he had acknowledged that the now odious woman had in that distant land been in his own hearing called by his own name,--it would have been almost better. Her absolute faith added a sting to his sufferings.|$|R
60|$|Henri {{accordingly}} {{took the}} command; {{but it was}} a melancholy office that devolved upon him of dragging onward his broken and dejected peasants, half-starved, half-clothed, and followed by a wretched train of women, children, and wounded; a sad change from the bright hopes with which, not six months before, he had been called to the <b>head</b> of his <b>tenants.</b> Yet still his high courage gained some triumphs, which for a time revived the spirits of his forces and restored their confidence. He was active and undaunted, and it was about this time, when in pursuit of the Blues, he was attacked by a foot soldier when alone in a narrow lane. His right hand was useless, but he seized the man's collar with his 1eft, and held him fast, managing his horse with his legs till his men came up. He would not allow them to kill the soldier, but set him free, saying 'Return to the Republicans, and tell them that you were alone with the general of the brigands, who had but one hand and no weapons, yet you could not kill him'. Brigands was the name given by the Republicans, the true robbers, to the Royalists, who, in fact, by this time, owing to the wild life they had so long led, had acquired a somewhat rude and savage appearance. They wore grey cloth coats and trousers, broad hats, white sashes with knots of different colours to mark the rank of the officers, and red woolen handkerchiefs. These were made in the country, and were at first chiefly worn by Henri, who usually had one round his neck, another round his waist, and a third to support his wounded hand; but the other officers, having heard the Blues cry out to aim at the red handkerchief, themselves adopted the same badge, in order that he might be less conspicuous.|$|R
