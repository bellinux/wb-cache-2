25|$|The Tigrayans and Tigrinyas are {{descendants}} of early Semitic-speaking peoples whose {{presence in the}} region dates back to at least 2000 BC, based on linguistic evidence (and known from the 9th century BC from inscriptions). According to Ethiopian traditions, the Tigrayan nobility; i.e. that of the Tigray province of Ethiopia, trace their ancestry to the legendary king Menelik I, the child born of the queen of Sheba and King Solomon as do the priests of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (Ge'ez ካህን kāhin). Menelik <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> the first king of the Solomonic dynasty of rulers of Ethiopia that ended only with the deposing of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Nearly 10 {{years would}} elapse before the idea, given impetus by World War <b>I,</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> a reality. The new Naval Base was {{aided by the}} {{improvements}} remaining from the Exposition, the strategic location at Sewell's Point on Hampton Roads, and {{the large amount of}} vacant land in the area. The coal piers and storage yards of the Virginian Railway (VGN), built by William N. Page and Henry H. Rogers, and completed in 1909, was immediately adjacent to the Exposition site. The well-engineered VGN was a valuable link directly to the bituminous coal of southern West Virginia, which the Navy strongly preferred for its steam-powered ships.|$|E
500|$|In 1949, Dworsky was {{the first}} round draft pick of the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference. The Dons were the first {{professional}} football team in Los Angeles. Dworsky played eleven games with the Dons in 1949, his only season in professional football. Dworsky played linebacker and blocking back for the Dons and had one interception and one kick return for 14yards. The AAFC disbanded after the 1949 season, and Dworsky turned down an offer from the Pittsburgh Steelers {{to return to the}} University of Michigan where he graduated in 1950 with a degree in architecture. Dworsky later noted: [...] "It was a toss-up whether <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> a pro football player or an architect. Being a linebacker is good conditioning for a young designer. You learn to block the bull coming at you from all sides." ...|$|E

500|$|When the five-year-old Pedro awoke on 7 April 1831, {{beside him}} on the bed lay his father's {{imperial}} crown. Pedro I and his wife had already left Brazilian soil and boarded the British frigate Warspite. Pedro II wrote a letter of farewell to his father aided by Mariana de Verna. On receipt of this, a tearful Pedro I composed a reply, calling the little boy [...] "My beloved son, and my Emperor." [...] His father and stepmother remained on board the Warspite another five days before leaving for Europe, but they did not see the young emperor during that period … or ever again. For the remainder of his life, Pedro <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> distressed upon his children's absences and fretted about their futures. Pedro II missed his father and stepmother (who had assumed his mother's role), and this may account for his later lack of any emotional display in public. In fact, the [...] "sudden loss of his family was to haunt Pedro II throughout his life". Three of his sisters stayed behind in Brazil with Pedro II: Januária, Paula and Francisca.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, {{the track}} was {{released}} as the album's buzz single, {{not intended to}} be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond, but to generate reception and feedback. In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact I was talking about my wife when I made that record — and now my ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have those type of relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> divorced. I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place. Unfortunately, it did become a reality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{transfer}} to Chicago, during continued fieldwork in Arizona, MacNeish set out his future goals. [...] “First I {{would learn to}} dig well and skillfully, then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> able to analyze archaeological findings, and finally <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> a theoretician”. [...] It was during his fieldwork as an undergraduate and graduate student that he worked on his first goal. [...] At field schools across the United States, MacNeish absorbed the knowledge and techniques of anyone he worked with. [...] Synthesis of this knowledge came to fruition during fieldwork {{in the state of}} Tamaulipas in Mexico. [...] Here MacNeish made one of his important contributions to the field methods of archaeologists, fulfilling his first goal. [...] He pioneered a method of excavating caves that involved the stripping the strata off alternate squares from a vertical profile. [...] This allowed for greater detail and more meaningful divisions of an excavation. [...] Where many previous methods involved digging by arbitrary levels, the new method [...] dubbed the La Perre technique after the cave in which it was first developed [...] dug each distinct strata, or floor, separately.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps the exposition's most {{impressive}} display was on water rather than land. Ships of two squadrons commanded by Admiral Robley Evans formed a continuing presence off Sewells Point. The assembly included sixteen battleships, five cruisers, and six destroyers. The fleet remained in Hampton Roads after the exposition closed and became President [...] Roosevelt's Great White Fleet, which toured the globe {{as evidence of}} the nation's military might. Nearly every Congressman and Senator of prominence had attended the exposition, and Admirals in Norfolk urged the creation of a Naval Base at the exposition site. However, nearly 10 years would elapse before the idea, given impetus by World War <b>I,</b> <b>would</b> <b>become</b> a reality.|$|E
