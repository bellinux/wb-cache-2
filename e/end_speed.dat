2500|$|... 1983 {{was a year}} {{of major}} change for Speed. He was now driving for an {{established}} owner in Hoss Ellington, however on a limited schedule. The team showed promise {{early in the season}} scoring a fourth at Rockingham and a sixth at Darlington. It was at Talladega where Speed's life took a major change. Towards the race's <b>end,</b> <b>Speed</b> was leading the field with a chance to win his first Cup race. He was beaten at the end by Richard Petty and Benny Parsons. After the race, Speed decided to change his life and become a devout Christian. The week after Talladega, Speed scored another top ten with a sixth in the World 600 at Charlotte. Speed's final top ten of the season was the August Michigan International Speedway race with an eighth-place finish. Speed finished 27th in the points standings.|$|E
2500|$|The {{options for}} the car are very diverse, like all other Viper trims. One example is the ACR Extreme Aero Package, which was the same package used to help the car break a total of 14 lap records in the 14 tracks, despite what Dodge and many other critics say. The package {{included}} {{the addition of a}} removable extended front splitter extension, a new adjustable dual-element rear wing, four dive planes, six removable diffuser strakes, removable brake ducts, and removable hood louvers, and if removed, will reveal a hood gap. This helped the car produce an extra [...] of downforce in cornering, for a total of [...] of it. With this package, the car can top out at only [...] instead of [...] because of the massive downforce the car produces. At the top <b>end</b> <b>speed,</b> the car will produce [...] of downforce at acceleration, the most of any production car.|$|E
50|$|Tetsuro Kawajiri (retired): He is {{supposed}} to be a typical gyroballer in Japan. According to the book, the authors confirmed he threw a two-seam gyroball. It confuses the batter by giving the illusion that the ball is faster than it actually is, because of the greater difference between the start speed and <b>end</b> <b>speed.</b> The batter cannot adapt to the slower <b>end</b> <b>speed,</b> which is not what he expected.|$|E

50|$|Kawasaki {{machinery}} {{has been}} pivotal {{in the development}} of Supertwin racing. The racing machines are developed from the Kawasaki 650cc parallel twin commuter bike (ER6-n or ER6-f). The machines are then transformed through development into an 85 bhp race bike with top <b>end</b> <b>speeds</b> in excess of 150 mph.|$|R
50|$|Some {{composite}} propellers have interchangeable blades, {{which enables}} the blade pitch to be adjusted. Changing the blade pitch in different elevations {{can be very}} beneficial to a boater. Typically, using a lower pitch will provide better acceleration and a higher pitch enables better top <b>end</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
50|$|Queensland Rail {{decided that}} the last thirty 3600 class {{locomotives}} would be used on passenger and general freight work and thus were built with gearing allowing for a higher top <b>end</b> <b>speed</b> as the 3900 class. In 2003 a contract was awarded to Downer EDI to rebuild 18 as the 3550 class for coal line operation.|$|E
50|$|In the final, {{the start}} {{proved to be}} important, Pierre got out well with Thompson, Michelle-Lee Ahye and Asha Philip. The number 4 {{sprinter}} in the season Marie Jos√©e Ta Lou was literally left in the blocks, yet 5 steps into the race, she had drawn even with Schippers. After spotting the leaders a step, Schippers got into her superior top <b>end</b> <b>speed</b> and ran down everybody, except Pierre, Thompson losing silver in the last step.|$|E

50|$|In 1936, Cowell began {{studying}} engineering at University College London. Also in that year, she began motor-racing, winning her {{class at the}} Land's <b>End</b> <b>Speed</b> Trial in a Riley. She gained initial experience of the sport by sneaking into the area where cars were serviced at the Brooklands racing circuit, wearing mechanic's overalls, and offering help to any driver or mechanic who wanted it. By 1939, she owned three cars and had competed in the 1939 Antwerp Grand Prix.|$|E
5000|$|The Speed Demon: A {{convicted felon}} already put away by Birdman retaliates by {{creating}} a potion that gives him super speed. He runs around stealing money and jewels from various places. He then realizes that with his new power he cannot be defeated. Speed Demon captures Birdman and almost defeats him, but Birman comes out on top. In the <b>end</b> <b>Speed</b> Demon's speed causes his aging process to speed up rapidly and he becomes an old man, losing the battle.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{new threats}} were rising as Fixer resurfaced and {{recruited}} both MACH-IV and Blizzard {{to work with}} him on a top secret project, which was also run by Zemo. Meanwhile, Speed Demon was confronted by the new female Doctor Spectrum, who was out to reform the Squadron Sinister and take over the world. In the <b>end,</b> <b>Speed</b> Demon quit the Thunderbolts to join Dr. Spectrum while Nighthawk, the former Defender and member of the original Squadron Sinister, was offered membership on the Thunderbolts by Songbird.|$|E

50|$|The {{power turbine}} is connected, without a torque converter, through a gear {{reduction}} unit to an only moderately modified TorqueFlite automatic transmission. The {{flow of the}} combustion gases between the gas generator and free power turbine provides the same functionality as a torque converter but without using a conventional liquid medium. Twin rotating recuperators transfer exhaust heat to the inlet air, greatly improving fuel economy. Varying stator blades prevent excessive top <b>end</b> <b>speeds,</b> and provide engine braking on deceleration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{production}} of the Delica light commercial cab-over pickup began in July 1968. It received the chassis code T100, {{in line with the}} recently (January 1968) introduced [...] "T90" [...] Canter. Using a KE44 1,088 cc engine producing , its maximum payload was 600 kg and had a top <b>end</b> <b>speed</b> of 115 km/h. A year later, in line with consumer needs, a cargo van and a passenger van were added to the line-up. The passenger van, discontinued in 1976, was called the 'Delica Coach' and could seat nine people in three rows of seats. The engine was upgraded to [...] in 1969.|$|E
50|$|The heavy engine {{gave the}} car a {{reputation}} for being nose-heavy; the supercharged Studebaker engine that replaced the Packard engine in 1957 was heavier. Road tests of the time, many of which were conducted by racing drivers, seldom mentioned any handling issues in spite of the heavy front <b>end.</b> <b>Speed</b> Age magazine of July 1956 tested the Golden Hawk against the Chrysler 300B, Ford Thunderbird, and Chevrolet Corvette, finding that the Golden Hawk could out-perform the others comfortably in both 0-60 mph acceleration and quarter mile times. The fastest 0-60 reported in magazine testing was 7.8 seconds, while top speeds were quoted as 125 mph plus.|$|E
50|$|A Seven's {{top speed}} greatly {{depends upon the}} body configuration, engine power and gearing. Early models with low-powered engines had {{difficulty}} exceeding 90 mi/h km/h, although a race-prepared Seven was clocked at 127 mi/h km/h by Brausch Niemann through a speed-trap at the 1962 Natal Grand Prix. In addition, clamshell style wings tend to create drag and generate lift at higher speeds. Cycle guards help alleviate this tendency, and low height Brookland aeroscreens that replace the windscreen help improve top <b>end</b> <b>speed.</b> Sevens do suffer from front end lift at high speed, the nose creates more lift than downforce at speeds over around 70 mi/h km/h, although retro fitted 'winglets' may counter this lift.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{investigated}} the model and simulation of dynamic cutting forces for high <b>speed</b> <b>end</b> mills, performed frequency spectrum analysis of dynamic cutting forces, and propounded the model and failure criterion of high <b>speed</b> <b>end</b> mills with indexable inserts. According to results of modal analysis and stress field analysis, the safety prediction and experiment of high <b>speed</b> <b>end</b> mills for machining aluminum alloy were done. Results indicate that more teeth of cutter and greater cutting contact angle make the energy more dispersible, higher cutting speed and greater rake of cutter can depress dynamic cutting forces. The rigidity failure rotational speed is higher the strength failure rotational speed, the connection strength between cutter body and screw bolt affects directly the safety of cutter. The model of high <b>speed</b> <b>end</b> mills based on spectrum simulation for dynamic cutting forces, and the safety prediction based on finite element analysis should {{be applied to the}} development of high <b>speed</b> <b>end</b> mills as an effective means...|$|R

50|$|A {{virtualisation}} {{to render}} the blade pitch yawning is through car gears. Through an integer yaw pitch of 0-13 degree operating is same: low speed, and more power and acceleration by up gearing the leaver slide. The upper gear of normal cars is comparing to a propeller with a pitch angle of 17+. Good acceleration and top <b>end</b> <b>speed</b> is offered at 21 pitch. A pitch higher than 21 is dangerous because lowering shaft of gearbox back to #1 position stalls engine and blades may crack due to watter pressure. (read lugging of engine here!) The best estimate is that for every 2-inch pitch increase equal wide-opens thrust increase step of approximately 400 RPM. An increase in pitch will cause the rpm-gauge to drop, {{and an increase in}} pitch will raise RPM.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} and ongoing method of measuring vehicle speeds {{was introduced in}} South Australia in 2007 {{in order to assess}} the effects of speed reduction countermeasures and to monitor the speed behaviour of South Australian motorists over time. About 130 sites around South Australia have speed measurements taken for a one week period at the same time each year. This Report summarises the data collected in 2014 and makes comparisons with previous surveys and partial surveys dating back to 2002. Vehicle speeds on South Australian 50 km/h roads were lower in 2014 than in 2013. This continues a general downward trend in speeds on those roads since 2002 (although it is more pronounced in Adelaide than in rural areas). Vehicle speeds on South Australian 60 km/h roads were essentially unchanged in 2014 compared to 2013. However, unlike rural 60 km/h roads, the Adelaide 60 km/h roads have shown previous reductions in speed. Vehicle speeds on rural hills 80 km/h roads were lower in 2014 than in 2013 continuing a reduction in speeds on those roads starting in 2013. Vehicle speeds on 100 and 110 km/h rural roads were essentially unchanged in 2014 compared to 2013 with both these road types showing very little change since surveys on them began in 2006 (although examination of the upper <b>end</b> <b>speeds</b> suggests that high <b>end</b> <b>speeds</b> are becoming less common on these roads over time).

5000|$|The {{base engine}} fitted was the 1798 cc B-Series pushrod straight-4. The lay-out closely {{followed}} {{that of the}} predecessor model, but access to the alternator/water pump was greatly improved by exploiting the car's longer nose to fit a front-mounted radiator. [...] The basic design of the engine dated back to 1947 and the unit with a claimed output of 84 bhp was notably lacking in power, although torque was reasonable. The larger engine, fitted to upper models in the range, was a 2227 cc E-series SOHC straight-6. This was very smooth and a much more modern engine, with a published output figure of 110 bhp, but was still not hugely powerful. The Princess was a big car, and the engine choice gave lacklustre performance, not helped by the provision of only a 4-speed manual gearbox (a Borg-Warner automatic transmission was an option, but performance with this was by all accounts positively lethargic). A 5-speed gearbox might have improved top <b>end</b> <b>speed,</b> economy and NVH: alas BL funds never stretched this far in development.|$|E
5000|$|On December 5, 1990, Alomar and Joe Carter were {{traded to}} the Toronto Blue Jays in {{exchange}} for Fred McGriff and Tony Fern√°ndez. It was in Toronto that he developed into a premier offensive second baseman, combining a [...]300-plus batting average with above average power and high <b>end</b> <b>speed</b> on the bases. In 1993, Alomar had his best season with the Jays, producing 17 home runs, 93 RBI and 55 stolen bases, while batting [...]326, third in the league behind teammates John Olerud and Paul Molitor. He was a central figure in Toronto's World Series championships in 1992 and 1993; in Game 6 of the 1992 World Series, he scored the series-winning run on Dave Winfield's two-run double in the 11th inning. Alomar's game-tying, ninth-inning home run against Oakland relief ace Dennis Eckersley, in Game 4 of the 1992 American League Championship Series, {{is considered by many}} as the most important hit in the club's history, as the team's three previous trips to the ALCS had ended in disappointment; he was named the Most Valuable Player of the series. In each of his five seasons with the Blue Jays, Alomar was on the All-Star team and won the Gold Glove Award.
