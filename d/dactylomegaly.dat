40|$|A {{discussion}} of the history, clinical types and treatment of macrodactylism, illustrated by five cases. During the past fifty years, forty-six authors have published papers relating to certain hyperplastic lesions of the upper extremity producing macrodactylism. These papers encompass the surgical experience and histological observations of eighty-six cases of macrodactylism of the hand since 1925. Killinger (1925) reported the first bilateral case and reviewed forty-three prior cases of <b>dactylomegaly.</b> Barsky (1967) critically evaluated fifty-six cases, discarded seven cases as "unspecified " and added seven personal experiences. Tsuge (1967) reported on twelve cases, and reported upon an enlarged series of twenty-two hands in 1973. The review of available literature of hand cases has been complicated by...|$|E
40|$|Backgrounds: The {{efficacy}} of antioxidant supplementation and oxidative stress of gamma irradiation for and during pregnancy is poorly established. The present study aimed {{to detect the}} toxic effects of high dose of folic acid and / or gamma radiation on the placenta of pregnant rat and the liver of their fetuses. Material and Methods: Pregnant albino rats were divided into four groups. The first group served as a control, the second group received oral intake of folic acid (5 mg/kg) from the 5 th to 20 th day of gestation, the third group was irradiated with gamma radiation (3 Gy, as fractionated doses (1 Gy/ 3 times) on each 5 th, 10 th and 15 th days of gestation, the fourth group was imanaged with combined treatment. The pregnant rats were sacrified after 20 days of pregnancy and samples {{were taken from the}} blood, placenta and the fetal liver for the morphological, biochemical and electron microscopic studies. Results: The present results showed a significant elevation in serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in placental tissue of pregnant rats associated with an increase of phosphorus content in liver of fetuses. Fetal malformations including: protrusion, anotia, short neck <b>dactylomegaly,</b> subcutaneous haemorrhage, paralysis in the fore limbs and congested blood vessels. The ultrastructural changes revealed sever damage in the placenta following folic acid administration and / or exposure to whole body gamma radiation. Also the fetal liver showed an appearent signs of damage under the combined treatment. The obtained changes were represented by: dilatation of the blood sinsoids, swollen mitochondria, fragmented rough endoplasmic reticulum and necrosis. Conclusion: It could be concluded that administration of folic acid and/or exposure to gamma radiation during pregnancy induced morphological, biochemical and ultrastructural changes in both placenta of the pregnant rats and liver of their fetuse...|$|E
