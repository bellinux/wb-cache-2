25|$|In the United States military, each branch {{has its own}} flag, an {{organizational}} colour, sometimes also called a ceremonial flag. Each of these is 4ft 4in × 5ft 6in, some using 2.5-inch <b>gold</b> <b>fringe</b> during specific instances. The ceremonial flag is paraded with a National Colour of equal dimensions in a colour guard, with <b>gold</b> <b>fringe</b> as necessary. The National Color is never dipped in salute, but remains vertical at all times, while the organizational colours and any guidons are dipped as necessary. When the National Colour is not cased, all persons salute the Colors. The finial is a nickel or chrome-plated spearhead, though the Navy uses different finials on occasion.|$|E
25|$|Units of the Chilean Army carry {{one main}} Colour, {{known as the}} estandarte de combate (combat standard). This {{is the same as}} the {{national}} flag, but with an embroidered star and with the unit designation, honorific title, founding date and place, and, depending on the unit, other historic information and honours embroidered diagonally across the fly in gold.

25|$|The most {{immediately}} noticeable {{feature is}} a white cassock and zucchetto (skull cap). Only the Pope is permitted to wear a cassock made out of watered silk. The cassock {{used to have a}} train on it, but Pope Pius XII discontinued this custom. For convenience, the train could be folded up and fastened {{to the back of the}} cassock. He used to wear a tufted fascia (white sash-like belt fastened about the waist, the ends of which fall down past the knees and are often embroidered with the Pope's coat of arms), until Paul VI replaced it with a simpler fringed sash. Previously, the tufted fascia (terminating in gold tassels) was worn with choir dress, and the fringed fascia (terminating in a simpler <b>gold</b> <b>fringe)</b> was worn with ordinary dress.|$|E
25|$|Despite this redecoration, the East Room was {{nonetheless}} somewhat shabby by 1861. On April 18, 1861, about 60 militiamen from Kansas took up temporary {{residence in the}} East Room pending construction of barracks {{for them in the}} city. They did serious damage to the carpet, and sometimes shot bullets into the walls. Mary Todd Lincoln refurbished the room with damask drapes, lace curtains, wallpaper, and a new $2,500 carpet later that year. The wallpaper was heavy patterned velvet cloth paper from Paris in crimson, garnet, and gold, and supplied by William H. Carryl & Brother of New York. The floor covering was an Axminster carpet woven in Glasgow, Scotland. The largest loom in the world was needed to weave the carpet, which covered the entire floor. The drapes were crimson with heavy <b>gold</b> <b>fringe</b> and numerous gold tassels, while the lace curtains behind them were imported from Switzerland.|$|E

6000|$|It is Tuesday night, 29th July, {{this first}} night in Bohemia. The Official Gentlemen lead his Majesty to superb rooms, new-hung with crimson velvet, and the due <b>gold</b> <b>fringes</b> and tresses,--very grand indeed; but {{probably}} not so airy as we wish. [...] "This {{is the way the}} Kaiser lodges in his journeys; and your Majesty is to be served like him." [...] The goal of our journey is now within few miles. Wednesday, 30th July, 1732, his Majesty awakens again, within these crimson-velvet hangings with the <b>gold</b> tresses and <b>fringes,</b> not so airy as he could wish; despatches Grumkow to the Kaiser, who is not many miles off, to signify what honor we would do ourselves.|$|R

Both the Flag of Yugoslavia and {{the flag of the}} League of Communists of Yugoslavia were used as National Colours in parades. Unique colours were issued to the Navy, to YPA reserve units and the Territorial Defense Forces of the republics.|$|R
60|$|In {{his absence}} Hans wandered from one {{treasure}} chamber to another, sometimes {{trying to break}} off a little lump of gold, but never able to do it. After awhile his host came back, but so changed that Hans could not believe it was really he. His silken clothes were of the brightest flame colour, richly trimmed with <b>gold</b> <b>fringes</b> and lace; a golden girdle was round his waist, while his head was encircled with a crown of gold, and precious stones twinkled about him like stars in a winter's night, and in place of his wooden stick he held a finely worked golden staff.|$|R
25|$|Singaporean {{military}} colours of the Singapore Armed Forces {{are divided}} today into Service State Colours and Unit Regimental Colours. Until 1997 {{there were also}} Service Regimental Colours and Unit State Colours. The State Colours {{are similar to the}} Flag of Singapore but differ per service. But Regimental Colours are different, and they differ per unit or service arm (save for the flags of the Air Force and Navy that show their respective service colours instead and some SAF service-wide commands like the Military Police). Their common design is that of the regimental or command arms at the centre of the colour used. Both are <b>gold</b> <b>fringed</b> and are brought out on major occasions only.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>gold</b> <b>fringe</b> {{around the}} American flag, as {{displayed}} in many federal courts, designates them as Admiralty courts, which cannot hear other kinds of cases, or signal that the court is operating under martial law.

2500|$|The {{official}} flag is scarlet {{with the}} Corps emblem in gray and gold. It was adopted on 18 January 1939, although Marine Corps Order 4 had established scarlet and gold {{as the official}} colors of the Corps as early as 1925. The indoor/parade version is bordered by a <b>gold</b> <b>fringe</b> while the outdoor version is plain. It measures [...] on the hoist and [...] on the fly. In addition to the multi-colored battle streamers (measuring [...] by [...] wide) affixed {{to the top of}} the staff, the staff itself is covered with sterling silver bands engraved with the names of conflicts in which the Corps has been engaged.|$|E
2500|$|In the Army, most regiments, battalions of regiments, and {{separate}} battalions {{also have a}} stand of colours. The first is the National Color, which is a 36in × 48in version of the national flag trimmed with a 2.5in wide <b>gold</b> <b>fringe,</b> and {{is the equivalent of}} the Queen's Colour in the British Army. The second is the Organizational Colour, which is the equivalent of the Regimental Colour; this is the same dimensions as the National Color, but is of a single colour representing the branch of the service that the unit is from; each branch also has its own fringe colour, which the Organizational Colour is trimmed with. In the centre of the Colour is the eagle from the Great Seal of the United States, but with the regimental coat of arms in the shield. The eagle has in its beak a scroll bearing the regimental motto, with the crest of the regiment's coat of arms above it and the regiment's name below. Attached to the Organizational Color will be the campaign and unit citation streamers awarded to the individual unit – these are equivalent to the battle honours embroidered directly onto the colours of British and Commonwealth units. The Organizational Color was carried in lieu of a National Color until shortly before the Civil War, when the Stars and Stripes became the National Color. [...] Civil War era units sometimes carried alternative Organizational Colors based on their home state flags or of other designs.|$|E

The mottoes were different for every regiment (for example, those regiments made Guards in the Great Patriotic War bore the motto [...] "Death to the German invaders", Смерть Немецким захватчикам, Smyert' Nyemyetskim zahvatchikam). In some Guards Armies and Corps, different designs on the obverse and reverse were used. Even the Lenin portrait was different in these colours. All of them were <b>gold</b> <b>fringed.</b>|$|R
