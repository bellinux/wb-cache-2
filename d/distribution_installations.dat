50|$|The {{detonation}} {{will cause}} many secondary hazards. The intense {{heat of a}} nuclear explosion would produce fires throughout the immediate blast zone. Damaged buildings, downed power and phone lines, broken gas lines and water mains, and weakened bridges and tunnels are hazardous conditions that {{will need to be}} assessed {{depending on the type of}} industries present. For example, chemical or petroleum production, industrial storage facilities, and manufacturing operations could cause significant releases of hazardous materials. Environmental considerations such as nearby bodies of water, prevailing winds and the general type of terrain have to be considered for an emergency response and evacuation. An explosion in a large city would result in an estimated 450,000 to 700,000 displaced persons flooding into nearby states. The country’s economic impact would be hundreds of billions of dollars with the estimated time of recovery being decades. Furthermore, the electronic magnetic pulse (EMP), a high-voltage spike that radiates out from the detonation site, can disrupt the communication networks and electronic equipment within a 3-mile range from a 10-kiloton ground blast. The electrical power grid is likely to be damaged by the destruction of substations, power production facilities and <b>distribution</b> <b>installations.</b> The grid damage may cause power outages over wide areas and over several states. These outages should be repaired within several days to a couple of weeks. Communication systems would suffer similar damage and will likely be repaired within similar time frames. There will likely be significant damage to general public support infrastructures. These systems include transportation such as air, water, rail, highway, power generation and distribution facilities and food and fuel distribution points. There will be safety concerns about the reliability of many structures like dams, levees, nuclear power plants, hazardous material storage facilities and still standing tall buildings all of which could become additional hazards. Structures may be damaged that are used to provide essential services such as hospitals, schools, police and fire departments.|$|E

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the accelerated population and industrial growth in the Greater Buenos Aires (12, 500, 000 inhabitants), there was a intensive exploitation of the semiconfined aquifer (Puelche aquifer) wich generated extensive regional drawdown cones. In addition to the drastic declining of piezometric levels, an intrusion of saline water forced the closing of many exploitation wells. Another consequence of overexploitation was an acceleration of leakage from the phreatic aquifer through the aquitard,thus causing pollution with nitrates, HC´s and heavy metal and a strong drawdown of phreatic levels. In order to compensate for the deficit caused by the depletion situation, surface water from two treatment plants in the River Plate was imported since 1980 ´s. The closing of exploitation wells and the import of water brought about a rising of the phreatic surface when leakage ended, thus causing serious troubles such as waterlogging of underground facilities (parking lots, basements, power <b>distribution</b> <b>installations),</b> a situation that has become critical in many areas in the surroundings of Buenos Aires City...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: OSHA last issued {{rules for}} the {{construction}} of transmission and <b>distribution</b> <b>installations</b> in 1972. Those provisions are now out of date and inconsistent with the more recently promulgated general industry standard covering the operation and maintenance of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution lines and equipment. OSHA is revising the construction standard to make it more consistent with the general industry standard and is making some revisions to both the construction and general industry requirements. The final rules for general industry and construction include new or revised provisions on host employers and contractors, training, job briefings, fall protection, insulation and working position of employees working on or near live parts, minimum approach distances, protection from electric arcs, deenergizing transmission and distribution lines and equipment, protective grounding, operating mechanical equipment near overhead power lines, and working in manholes and vaults. - 2 -The revised standards will ensure that employers, when appropriate, must meet consistent requirements for work performed under the construction and general industry standards. The final rule also revises the general industry and construction standards fo...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. In the past, {{electricity}} in South Africa {{was taken for}} granted. This situation suddenly changed in January 2008, when the electricity supply system threatened to collapse. Energy efficiency was suddenly brought to the fore when steep tariff increases and consumption penalties were enforced on consumers. The mining sector is affected most severely. The expected tariff increments, together with consumption penalties, will drastically increase production costs. A number of mines {{will be forced to}} reduce production or even close in order to avoid these high costs. This will {{have a negative effect on}} the South African economy that relies heavily on mining to earn foreign exchange. In deep level mining, water reticulation is one of the primary consumers of electricity. The refrigeration plants, together with the underground water supply and underground dewatering systems are integrated to form a complete water reticulation system. This system uses up to 41. 9 % of the total energy consumption on a typical gold mine. It is used to extract hot water from the mine, refrigerate it and distribute the cold water back to underground mining levels. Work has been done on individual elements of dewatering and refrigeration systems to reduce electricity costs. However, no results could be found of an integrated control solution for all aspects of mine water reticulation. In this study novel techniques were developed to integrate, simulate, optimise and control all elements involved in the water reticulation system. This enables quick assessment of the effect of individual components on the complete system. By integrating all elements into a single system, components can now be optimally controlled without adversely affecting other parts of the system. These techniques were applied on Kopanang and Tshepong water reticulation systems. The results concluded that over and above conventional demand side management (DSM) initiatives, additional savings could be realised. An additional outcome was to develop generic models to evaluate and optimise any deep level mine dewatering system. These models were applied on a number of mine dewatering systems. By using these new techniques on only two mines, the average load was reduced by 2. 3 MW, which realises annual savings of more than R 3 -million (2008 tariffs). The new models should be applied on all deep level mines to optimise energy consumption on their water reticulation systems. The mining sector can save more than R 20 -million annually at 2008 tariffs. It is also suggested that this application be applied to other sectors, such as large water <b>distribution</b> <b>installations.</b> Doctora...|$|E
