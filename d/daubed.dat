5|$|Comstock's parents {{return home}} after the meeting to find the number 331 <b>daubed</b> on their son's bed in blood. The father, Tom Comstock (Michael Tomlinson) confides in Black that the number {{is that of the}} hotel room he had been using to carry on an extramarital affair, which Black persuades him to come clean about with his wife.|$|E
5|$|The {{court was}} shown {{extensive}} video footage of Tomlinson and Harwood on the day. Harwood was seen trying to arrest {{a man who}} had <b>daubed</b> graffiti on a police van, then joining a line of officers who were clearing Royal Exchange Passage. Harwood pushed a man who blew a vuvuzela at him, then appeared to push a BBC cameraman who was filming the arrest of another man. The footage showed Harwood push a third man out of the way, and shortly after this (the passageway now almost empty) the officers reached Tomlinson.|$|E

25|$|Only in the Post-Classic era {{did this}} {{practice}} become as frequent as in central Mexico. In the Post-Classic period, {{the victims and}} the altar are represented as <b>daubed</b> in a hue now known as Maya Blue, obtained from the añil plant and the clay mineral palygorskite.|$|E
25|$|On 8 March 1966, {{students}} {{managed to}} ransack the foreign ministry, {{and held it}} for five hours. They <b>daubed</b> slogans, one accusing Subandrio of murdering the generals, and drew graffiti showing Subandrio as a Pekingese dog (a reference to his perceived closeness to communist China) or hanging from gallows.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} that the Greeks had painted their temples influenced the later {{development of the}} style. The archaeological dig at Aegina and Bassae in 1811–12 by Cockerell, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, and Karl Haller von Hallerstein had disinterred painted fragments of masonry <b>daubed</b> with impermanent colours. This revelation was a direct contradiction of Winckelmann's notion of the Greek temple as timeless, fixed, and pure in its whiteness.|$|E
25|$|During the {{following}} years both Bachman and <b>Daub</b> worked in sound production at their Trauma Studios in Pennsylvania for groups such as Turmoil and Living Sacrifice. Later, Bachman continued in his medical studies, while <b>Daub</b> kept working in the music industry. Later in the 1990s, <b>Daub</b> began playing drums in a female-fronted progressive metal band called Fountain of Tears.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known type of infill, called opus craticum by the Romans, was a wattle and <b>daub</b> type construction. Opus craticum is now confusingly {{applied to}} a Roman stone/mortar infill, also. Similar methods to wattle and <b>daub</b> were also used and known by various names, such as clam staff and <b>daub,</b> cat-and-clay, or torchis (French), to name only three.|$|R

[...] <b>Daub</b> acquired yet another [...] "title of sorts" [...] back when the Mayor of Baden-Baden congratulated her upon winning the Miss Germany title in his city. He wanted to kiss <b>Daub</b> on the mouth, but she turned to the side. The Frankfurt evening newspaper then ran the headline, [...] "Miss Germany was a fridge." [...] <b>Daub</b> explained that she didn't just kiss everyone.|$|R
25|$|Two desecrations of Holocaust memorials, in Jelgava {{and in the}} Biķernieki Forest, {{took place}} in 1993. The delegates of the World Congress of Latvian Jews who came to Biķernieki to commemorate the 46,500 Jews shot there, were shocked {{by the sight of}} swastikas and the word Judenfrei <b>daubed</b> on the memorial. Furthermore, Articles of antisemitic content {{appeared}} in the Latvian nationalist press. The main topics of these articles were the collaboration of Jews with the Communists in the Soviet period, Jews tarnishing Latvia's good name in the West, and Jewish businessmen striving to control the Latvian economy.|$|E
25|$|Their {{traditional}} {{communities were}} organised hamlets, where their dwellings were circular huts {{with a high}} peak, furnished with a mud sleeping-platform, jars of grain and a sunk fireplace. The women <b>daubed</b> the walls with mud, decorating them with geometrical or conventional designs in red, white or grey. The men were skilled hunters, using nets and spears. They also kept goats, sheep and cattle. The women were also accomplished agriculturists, growing and processing a variety of food crops, including millet, simsim, groundnuts, peas, sorghum, vegetables, etc. In war, the men used spears and long, narrow shields of giraffe or ox hide.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} {{of discrimination against}} Muslims include the desecration of 148 French Muslim graves near Arras. A pig's head was hung from a headstone and profanities insulting Islam and Muslims were <b>daubed</b> on some graves. Destruction and vandalism of Muslim graves in France were seen as Islamophobic by {{a report of the}} European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. A number of mosques have also been vandalized in France over the years. On 14 January 2015 it was reported that 26 mosques in France had been subject to attack since the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris.|$|E

50|$|An {{extension}} on {{the brush}} building idea is the wattle and <b>daub</b> {{process in which}} clay soils or dung, usually cow, are used to fill in and cover a woven brush structure. This gives the structure more thermal mass and strength. Wattle and <b>daub</b> {{is one of the}} oldest building techniques. Many older timber frame buildings incorporate wattle and <b>daub</b> as non load bearing walls between the timber frames.|$|R
50|$|The finish {{is one of}} combed <b>daub</b> {{and this}} survives well {{on the west side}} of the {{partition}} truss. Elsewhere, the remains of the decorative finish, behind later work and below structural elements indicate that much if not all of the garret rooms were decorated in combed <b>daub</b> from the outset. Combed <b>daub</b> survives on the east projecting gable, overlain by later additions and below the stub tie-beam of the partition truss.|$|R
25|$|On December 31, 13 JDL {{members were}} arrested {{after a series}} of coordinated actions against Soviet {{property}} in Manhattan and at Kennedy Airport intended to protest the treatment of Jews in the Soviet Union. Several youths painted slogans on a Soviet airliner, two of them handcuffed themselves to the airliner, while others <b>daubed</b> the words “Am Yisroel Chai” (the Nation of Israel Lives) on the plane’s doors. A similar slogan was painted {{on the walls of the}} office of Tass, the Soviet news agency, in Rockefeller Plaza, which was invaded by Rabbi Kahane and four other JDL members. The rest of the demonstrators were taken into custody after invading the midtown offices of the Soviet tourist bureau.|$|E
25|$|The Cubists are {{not waiting}} for the war to end to recommence {{hostilities}} against good sense. They are exhibiting at the Galerie Poiret naked women whose scattered parts are represented in all {{four corners of the}} canvas: here an eye, there an ear, over there a hand, a foot on top, a mouth below. M. Picasso, their leader, is possibly the least disheveled of the lot. He has painted, or rather <b>daubed,</b> five women who are, if the truth be told, all hacked up, and yet their limbs somehow manage to hold together. They have, moreover, piggish faces with eyes wandering negligently above their ears. An enthusiastic art-lover offered the artist 20,000 francs for this masterpiece. M. Picasso wanted more. The art-lover did not insist.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, some jam {{sessions}} {{with a group}} of musicians in London had resulted in two albums' worth of material, unofficially released without Vangelis' permission in 1978, titled Hypothesis and The Dragon. Vangelis succeeded in taking legal action to have them withdrawn. A more successful project was his scoring of wildlife documentary films in the early 1970s made by French filmmaker Frédéric Rossif. The first soundtrack L'Apocalypse des animaux was released in 1973. In 1972, the student riots of 1968 provided the inspiration for an album titled Fais que ton rêve soit plus long que la nuit (Make Your Dream Last Longer Than the Night), comprising musical passages mixed with news snippets and protest songs; some lyrics were based on graffiti <b>daubed</b> on walls during the riots. He also did music for the 1973 Henry Chapier film Amore.|$|E

25|$|The {{bombing of}} the 13th-century Orthodox monastery Sveti Atanasij {{in the village of}} Lesok is {{considered}} a war-crime by some. However, no one has ever claimed responsibility for the attack and Albanian guerrilla officials have dismissed all responsibility and placed the blame on Macedonian special forces, saying it was another poor attempt to link the NLA to Islamic extremism. However, upon closer inspection, it was discovered that near the rubble that had once {{been one of the most}} revered religious sites for the Macedonian Orthodox Church, there lay a dead donkey, its bloated body <b>daubed</b> with red paint spelling out the letters UÇK, the Albanian abbreviation for the rebel National Liberation Army. This incident is disputed to this day and the monastery is now under-going reconstruction. On the other hand, the Macedonian forces themselves destroyed a mosque in the village of Neprosteno. The mosque was rebuilt in 2003 with funding from the EU.|$|E
500|$|In October 2007, {{the sides}} of the stones facing the road were <b>daubed</b> in white paint with the slogans [...] "Read family court hell" [...] and [...] "F4J". [...] "F4J" [...] was also painted on to the side of Dorset's Hardy Monument. The activist group Fathers4Justice—whose acronym is [...] "F4J"—denied any responsibility, {{condemned}} the action, and suggested that the slogans had been painted on by unknown individuals in an attempt to discredit the group. Concern about the vandalism was expressed by the National Trust, the local landowner, and the Dolmen Grove Druids.|$|E
500|$|Another human {{victim is}} later {{found on a}} farm, {{alongside}} another dead horse. The phrase [...] "thank you" [...] is <b>daubed</b> on a nearby wall. The North Dakota police set up an anonymous phone number to appeal for information, which Borgsen uses to taunt Black by describing the pleasure he derives from killing. Black consults with a veterinarian, Claudia Vaughan (Jo Anderson), about the case, and learns that the area {{is home to a}} Premarin farm—estrogen for pharmaceutical use is derived from the urine of mares which are kept pregnant, their foals killed for meat to be exported. Black feels the killer may have been raised on one of these farms.|$|E

During these excavations, NIOT reported finding two paleochannels flanked by rectangular and square basement-like features. Artifacts were recovered by means of dredging, including pottery sherds, microliths, wattle and <b>daub</b> remains, and hearth materials. These artifacts were sent for dating at the laboratories of Manipur University and Oxford University. The wattle and <b>daub</b> remains are composed of locally available clay, reed, husk, pottery pieces, and pieces of fresh water shell. The wattle and <b>daub</b> also shows evidence of partial burning.|$|R
500|$|Following apartheid's collapse, Woods raised {{funds to}} {{commission}} a bronze statue of Biko from Naomi Jacobson. It was erected {{outside the front}} door of city hall in East London on the Eastern cape, opposite a statue commemorating British soldiers killed in the Second Boer War. Over 10,000 people attended the monument's unveiling in September 1997. In the following months it was vandalised several times; in one instance it was <b>daubed</b> with the letters [...] "AWB", an acronym of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, a far-right Afrikaner paramilitary group. In 1997, the cemetery where Biko was buried was renamed the Steve Biko Garden of Remembrance. The District Six Museum also held an exhibition of artwork marking the 20th anniversary of his death by examining his legacy.|$|E
500|$|Black {{travels to}} Garry's {{home with a}} deputy, Kevin Reilly (Steve Bacic). <b>Daubed</b> in blood on the kitchen window are the numbers [...] "1 28 15", which Reilly notes {{no one has been}} able to understand. Black also listens to a {{recording}} of Garry's confession, which details the murders meticulously. Black convinces Garry's attorney to allow him an interview, insisting he will be entirely impartial. Garry tells Black he had planned the murders for some time, motivated by hatred for his wife and monetary concerns. Black refutes this, pointing out that Garry had carved a wooden angel as a gift for his wife that same day, using the chisel that was the murder weapon. Smith, realizing that Black does not believe Garry to be guilty, dismisses him from the case.|$|E
500|$|The film's music mostly {{conveys a}} sense of power, energy, and brutality, yet [...] tender moments occur. The sounds of oboes and string {{instruments}} accompany Conan and Valeria's intimate scenes, imbuing them with {{a sense of}} lush romance and an emotional intensity. [...] According to MacDonald, Poledouris deviated from the practice of scoring love scenes with tunes reminiscent of Romantic period pieces; instead, Poledouris made Conan and Valeria's melancholic love theme unique through his use of [...] "minor-key harmony". David Morgan, a film journalist, heard Eastern influences in the [...] "lilting romantic melodies". [...] Page Cook, audio critic for Films in Review, describes Conan the Barbarians score as [...] "a large canvas <b>daubed</b> with a colorful yet highly sensitive brush. [...] There is innate intelligence behind Poledouris's scheme, and the pinnacles reached are often eloquent with haunting intensity." ...|$|E

40|$|Determining {{probable}} firing {{temperatures of}} <b>daub</b> recovered from archaeological sites provides opportunities {{to interpret the}} design and/or function of prehistoric structures. This paper critiques some of the methods for determining firing temperatures of <b>daub,</b> and presents a case study using samples from a secure depositional context at the Iron Age archaeological site of Noen U-Loke, in northeast Thailand. Adopting a multimethod approach, the paper examines relationships between color, micro- and macro-inclusions, elemental and mineralogical composition, physical form, and temperature, {{through the application of}} ICP-MS, XRD analysis, magnetic susceptibility, and light microscopy. The important methodological point here is that the combined interpretation of independent measures provides a better estimate of the original firing temperatures of the archaeological material than has hitherto been possible. Initial examination implied that our samples were fired, in antiquity, at low temperatures, and concluded a nonindustrial source for the <b>daub.</b> We suggest that determining maximum temperatures for this original firing will provide the clearest discrimination between possible types of features (e. g., housing, kiln/furnace) from which the <b>daub</b> originally came. The results of our study indicate that the archaeological <b>daub</b> samples have been exposed to a range of temperatures from 200 °C to 1000 °C. It seems highly likely, therefore, that the <b>daub</b> was derived from a spatially complex structure, such as an industrial kiln or furnace, which has experienced a range of firing temperature...|$|R
