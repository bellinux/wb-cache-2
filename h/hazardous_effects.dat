25|$|Aviation {{controllers}} {{are often}} occupied with multiple tasks {{at the same}} time, and <b>hazardous</b> <b>effects</b> can occur when prospective memory fails. In an accident in 1991, a tower controller in an airport forgot a step in a simple procedure and that led to two planes crashing into each other, killing a number of passengers and crew. An analysis of over 1300 fatal aviation accidents from 1950-2009 showed that the majority were due to pilot error: 50% attributed to pilot error, 6% due to non-pilot human error, 22% to mechanical failure, 12% to bad weather, 9% to sabotage, and 1% to other causes.|$|E

500|$|Drawing from {{research}} performed {{to assess the}} safety of the RHIC collisions, the LHC Safety Study Group, a group of independent scientists, performed a safety analysis of the LHC, and released their findings in the 2003 report Study of Potentially Dangerous Events During Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC. The report concluded that there is [...] "no basis for any conceivable threat". Several of its arguments were based on the predicted evaporation of hypothetical micro black holes by Hawking radiation and on the theoretical predictions of the Standard Model with regard to the outcome of events to be studied in the LHC. One argument raised against doomsday fears was that collisions at energies equivalent to and higher than those of the LHC have been happening in nature for billions of years apparently without <b>hazardous</b> <b>effects,</b> as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays impact Earth's atmosphere and other bodies in the universe.|$|E
2500|$|The {{potentially}} <b>hazardous</b> <b>effects</b> of methylglyoxal require {{regulation of}} the reactions with this substrate. [...] Synthesis of methylglyoxal is regulated by levels of DHAP and phosphate concentrations. [...] High concentrations of DHAP encourage methylglyoxal synthase to produce methylglyoxal, while high phosphate concentrations inhibit the enzyme, and therefore the production of more methylglyoxal. [...] The enzyme triose phosphate isomerase affects the levels of DHAP by converting glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) into DHAP. [...] The usual pathway converting GAP to pyruvate starts with the enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( [...] 711-13). [...] Low phosphate levels inhibit GAP dehydrogenase; GAP is instead converted into DHAP by triosephosphate isomerase. Again, increased levels of DHAP activate methylglyoxal synthase and methylglyoxal production ( [...] 711-13).|$|E

Environmental pollution {{has been a problem}} at the Rochdale factory with acknowledged cases of asbestos-related cancer caused by environmental exposure." [...] Laurie Kazan Allen, Editor of the British Asbestos Newsletter, said: [...] "This landmark decision has ramifications for Rochdale Council regarding the Spodden Valley asbestos factory site. There is now a clear legal principle that local authorities hold a duty of care to protect communities from the <b>hazardous</b> <b>effects</b> of disturbing contaminated land. Since at least the 1960s there has been clear evidence that the inhalation of asbestos fibres, even in low quantities, can cause terminal cancer decades after initial exposure. Rochdale Council must take heed of this historic decision and act to protect local people." ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>hazardous</b> <b>effect</b> of {{electric}} and magnetic fields on biological systems {{is the subject}} of considerable debate. Traditional methods have failed to provide a correlation between the fields and biological effects. A model is presented that solves this conflict. The model is a composite energy approach that identifies the classical, thermal electromagnetic interaction as well as a completely independent electric and independent magnetic component. An overview of the biological investigations is presented. These include studies on cells, organisms, and epidemiology studies on people. The discussion involves the potential risks and methods of mitigating the risks...|$|R

30|$|Contamination and {{subsequent}} pollution {{of the environment}} by toxic heavy metals have become an issue of global concern due to their sources, widespread distribution and multiple effects on the ecosystem. Heavy metals are generally present in agricultural soils at low levels. Due to their cumulative behaviour and toxicity, however, they have a potential <b>hazardous</b> <b>effect</b> not only on crop plants but also on human health (Uwah et al. 2009). Therefore, a comprehensive study related to the assessment of levels of essential and toxic metals of plants and soil where the plant has grown is crucial with respect to {{human health and the}} quality of its products.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS) {{in the development of}} mouse embryo, effects of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and erythrocytes were studied in vitro. Oocytes were fertilized and 2 -cell-cleaved embryos were cultured in {{the presence or absence of}} either erythrocytes, SOD or catalase. Under standard culture conditions, the fertilization and cleavage rates were 77. 4 and 12. 5 %, respectively. In the presence of xanthine and xanthine oxidase, those rates decreased to 28. 2 and 4. 5 %, respectively. The <b>hazardous</b> <b>effect</b> of ROS was completely inhibited by erythrocytes. These results suggested that small amounts of erythrocytes might effectively degrade ROS during the development of cultured embryos...|$|R

30|$|The {{negative}} allometric growth {{between the}} length and weight of fish {{in the present study}} {{may be due to the}} presence of single and combined nanoparticles of Pb and TiO 2 in the fish diets. These compounds might have caused the disproportionate growth of fish given that dietary Lead (Pb) exposure has been shown to generate a significant inhibition of growth in rockfish (Kim & Kang, 2015). In addition, <b>hazardous</b> <b>effect</b> of nanoparticles induced growth restriction in Mystusvittatus (Chatterjee, Bhattacharjee, & Lu, 2014). Similar observation was found in the present study for nTiO 2; furthermore, the combination of binary compounds also showed relatively low allometric values suggesting that the addition of nTiO 2 to Pb causes retardation of growth.|$|R
40|$|Attention {{is given}} to the initial results of {{systematic}} investigations of the potentially <b>hazardous</b> <b>effect</b> of heavy rain, ice, and frost accretion on aircraft wings. In the laminar region of an airfoil, roughness interferes with smooth flow and tends to encourage transition from laminar to turbulent flow upstream of its normal point of occurrence. In the airfoil's turbulent region, roughness considerably worsens the turbulent friction coefficient, thereby increasing the drag coefficient. Consequent dramatic decreases of maximum lift coefficient at high angles of attack lead to premature stall. Such decreases in stall angle destroy the safety margin of an aircraft approaching stall. An assessment {{is given to}} the state of knowledge in this field of research...|$|R

30|$|RSC {{values were}} {{calculated}} {{to determine the}} <b>hazardous</b> <b>effect</b> of CO 3 and HCO 3 on the water quality for agricultural purpose (Eaton 1950; Richards 1954). According to USSL diagram, an RSC value < 1.25  meq/L is probably safe for irrigation. If it is > 2.5  meq/L, it is not suitable for irrigation. In our study area, in post-monsoon, 80  % places were safe, 10  % of places are marginal and 10  % are unsuitable. In the pre-monsoon season, all the values fall in the safe zone. These studies show that one sample is unsuitable for irrigation, because of the low permeability of the soil during the post-monsoon season. This shows {{that there must be}} localized and seasonal pollution which reduce the crop yield in that area.|$|R
