500|$|There {{was this}} huge scandal that {{originally}} [...] "Halo" [...] {{was meant to}} go to Leona. That was never the case... That song was written for Beyoncé. What happened was that Beyoncé waited long enough to record that song... I thought {{this would be a}} brilliant first single for Leona, which it would have... What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, [...] "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if you like it enough to consider it".

500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what happened to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital.

[...] She later {{went on to say that}} she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story.

But what I {{want to say to}} you, if you will give me the opportunity, is this: The first few evenings after your arrival here were very pleasant ones indeed--for me. You talked to me, and I found more pleasure in our conversation than I have ever done in anything else in my life. There, that is being frank, is it not? I hoped that we might be friends; indeed, {{it seemed to me that}} we were certainly going to be so. I do not wish to offend you by any apparent exaggeration, but I must say that it made a considerable difference to my interest in life. That is putting it mildly. Where you have found the time to read and think so much, of course, I cannot tell. It is not my business. Only, I know that it makes your companionship very pleasant for me. You see I am trying to be as matter-of-fact as possible--do please give me credit for that. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why you have altered your manner to me; why we cannot be friends?

5000|$|From about 1950 he was {{the obvious}} leader of a [...] "school", {{somewhat}} unusually {{in the context of}} British mathematics. The successor to the school of mathematical analysis of G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood, it was also more narrowly devoted to number theory, and indeed to its analytic side, as had flourished in the 1930s. This implied problem-solving, and hard-analysis methods. The outstanding works of Klaus Roth and Alan Baker exemplify what this can do, in diophantine approximation. Two reported sayings, [...] "the problems are there", and [...] "I don't care how you get hold of the gadget, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how big or small it is", sum up the attitude, and could be transplanted today into any discussion of combinatorics. This concrete emphasis on problems stood in sharp contrast with the abstraction of Bourbaki, who were then active just across the English Channel.|$|E

40|$|I {{begin this}} {{paper with a}} very Australian media parable about a man called I will call X. This story {{illustrates}} my theme of how the media can manipulate, or at least attempt to manipulate public opinion on crime and criminal justice matters. 1 I then move to a discussion on {{the courts and the}} media, and finally some suggestions on {{what can be done to}} alleviate the current problems. The tale begins simply enough, with a report in our local Queensland (Australia) newspaper, the Murdoch owned Courier Mail, on May 28 2007 that a local radio announcer X had been violently attacked 2 ̆ 2 bashed 2 ̆ 2 overnight in Brisbane 2 ̆ 7 s CBD. His injuries were said to be a broken nose, cracked cheekbone, and fractured skull. Although released from intensive care, he remained in hospital. A message from his radio station asked for privacy during his recuperation. All that was known at that stage therefore was that he had sustained head injuries in some sort of altercation. The next day, May 29, the Courier Mail reported an interview with X where he said 2 ̆ 2 I have no recollection of it, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why? 2 ̆ 2. The report stated that he had been found in the street by a passerby and taken to hospital where he was heavily sedated. He is also reported to have said 2 ̆ 2 I love this city and I 2 ̆ 7 ve always felt safe, yet from what I have heard today about the number of incidents, it 2 ̆ 7 s not good. From now on, when I go out I will think more about where and what I am doing and have my wits about me 2 ̆ 2. And further in the story: 2 ̆ 2 I don 2 ̆ 7 t want to talk about what sort of people they are, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what was going through their head. I am just lucky it 2 ̆ 7 s not more serious. I was feeling sorry for myself early this morning and then you realise you didn 2 ̆ 7 t lose your life and how lucky you are 2 ̆ 2. Brisbane 2 ̆ 7 s Lord Mayor was reported as saying that the attack on X was a 2 ̆ 2 horrifying situation 2 ̆ 2, but that safety in the city had improved in recent years. It is relevant at this point to note that the Courier Mail had been leading a campaign to have the defence of accident reviewed, after several high profile cases where accused persons have been acquitted by a jury of homicide charges after killing people in street attacks, and relying on the accident defence in that the deaths were not foreseeable, given the nature of the attack...|$|E
