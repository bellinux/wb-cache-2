Additionally, purified DNA from any source that performed known functions and was judged to be non-toxic could be cloned with available vectors in low risk containment facilities.|$|E

25|$|In November 1657 Henry {{himself was}} made lord-deputy; but before {{this time he}} had refused a gift of {{property}} worth £1500 a year, basing his refusal {{on the grounds of}} the poverty of the country, a poverty which was not the least of his troubles.
