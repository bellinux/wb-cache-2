5|$|Development of {{the game}} began {{after the release of}} Killer Instinct 2, and was {{intended}} to be a real-time strategy game known as Wild Cartoon Kingdom during early stages. As time progressed, the game shifted from a Walt Disney World-influenced racing game to a unique title named Pro-Am 64, in which Nintendo had no involvement with. Due to the delays of Banjo-Kazooie, Rare felt that they needed a stronger intellectual property to attract a wider audience <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> scheduled to release before Christmas 1997, thus making the decision to revolve a game around the character of Diddy Kong.|$|E

5|$|Expectations for Schenn {{were high}} {{heading into the}} 2009–10 season. During {{training}} camp, Toronto Head Coach Ron Wilson named {{him as one of}} the team's top four defencemen. As the season progressed, however, Schenn's play was disappointing, and Wilson kept him out of the line-up <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>game</b> in October and again for a three-game stretch in December.
