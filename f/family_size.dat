40|$|Genetic {{adaptation}} to captive environments {{is likely to}} reduce the reproductive fitness of endangered species when they are reintroduced into natural environments. Equalization of <b>family</b> <b>sizes</b> is predicted to halve genetic {{adaptation to}} captivity as it removes selection among families and is recommended in captive management of threatened species. This prediction was evaluated by comparing the reproductive fitnesses of replicate populations of Drosophila maintained using either equal (EFS) or variable <b>family</b> <b>sizes</b> (VFS) for 25 generations in captivity under uncrowded conditions on a medium containing CuSO₄. After 25 generations, EFS populations produced 8. 8 % more offspring per pair than their outbred base population on CuSO₄ medium, while VFS produced 17. 5 % more. Consequently, the rate of genetic adaptation to captivity in EFS was about half that in VFS, as predicted. In simulated ‘wild’ conditions (crowded, competitive conditions on medium lacking CuSO₄), both treatments showed much lower reproductive fitness than their outbred base population, the reductions being 38 % in EFS populations and 43 % in VFS populations. Surprisingly, reproductive fitness of the two treatments {{did not differ significantly}} under these conditions. These results raise doubts about the ability of equalization of <b>family</b> <b>sizes</b> to reduce genetic deterioration that adversely affects reintroduction success for captive populations of endangered species. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Treating mRNA {{transcript}} abundances as quantitative {{traits and}} examining {{their relationships with}} clinical traits have been pursued by using an analytical approach of quantitative genetics. Recently, Kraft et al. presented a family expression association test (FEXAT) for correlation between gene expressions and trait values with a family-based (sibships) design. This statistic did not account for biological relationships of related subjects, which may inflate type I error rate and/or decrease power of statistical tests. In this article, we propose two new test statistics based on a variance-components approach for analyses of microarray data obtained from general pedigrees. Our methods accommodate covariance between relatives for unmeasured genetic effects and directly model covariates of clinical importance. The efficacy and validity of our methods are investigated by using simulated data under different sample <b>sizes,</b> <b>family</b> <b>sizes,</b> and <b>family</b> structures. The proposed LR method has correct type I error rate with moderate to large sample <b>sizes</b> regardless of <b>family</b> structure and <b>family</b> <b>sizes.</b> It has higher power with complex pedigrees and similar power to the FEXAT with sibships. The other proposed FEXAT(R) method is favorable with large <b>family</b> <b>sizes,</b> regardless of sample <b>sizes</b> and <b>family</b> structure. Our methods, robust to population stratification, are complementary to the FEXAT in expression-trait association studies...|$|R

40|$|There {{are some}} 7 000 {{languages}} {{in the world}} (Gordon, 2005). A language family {{is defined as a}} (possibly one-member) set of languages that which have been shown, in publication, using orthodox comparative methodology (Campbell, 2004) to stem from a common ancestor. One classification which aims to consistently follow this definition recognizes the ca 7 000 languages to fall into some 400 families (Hammarström, 2007). As is also the case for alternative classifications, the ca 400 families are of very unequal size. In fact, we can observe the <b>family</b> <b>sizes</b> 1 to follow a power-law distribution (Wichmann, 2005). In other words, there are very many tiny families and a few very large families, as shown on the next page. Explaining Language <b>Family</b> <b>Sizes</b> There are two main trends in explaining why some families are big and some are small; a) one that observes that some big families can be associated with a technological advantage, most often agriculture, and thus hypothesize that such families are big and the rest are small (Bellwood and Renfrew, 2002), and b) one that observes that stochastic branching processes (which seem like reasonable simplifications of how real-world language families come about through human migration), are expected to yield just the kind of power-law distributions that we observe with language <b>family</b> <b>sizes</b> (Wichmann, 2005; Arnold and Bauer, 2006). In this talk we will not explore the merits of the a) -theories since it is too big a question for a talk.
