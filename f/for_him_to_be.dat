5|$|This {{was enough}} <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{selected}} in the Australian XI for a match against the Englishmen, in what was effectively a Test dress rehearsal. Rain curtailed the match, and the game did not reach the second innings; Harvey made 22 in his only opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Before {{and during}} their marriage, Crawford worked to promote Tone's Hollywood career, but Tone was {{ultimately}} {{not interested in}} being a movie star and Crawford eventually wearied of the effort. After Tone reportedly began drinking and becoming physically abusive, she filed for divorce, which was granted in 1939. Crawford and Tone much later rekindled their friendship and Tone even proposed in 1964 that they remarry. When he died in 1968, Crawford arranged <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cremated and his ashes scattered at Muskoka Lakes, Canada.|$|E
5|$|Booth {{worked his}} way into the company with a string of false claims about his influence, and finally became {{chairman}} of the Board of Directors by claiming that {{it was the only way}} to avoid Gruban being interned due to his German origin. As soon as this happened, he cut Gruban out of the company, leaving him destitute, and eventually arranged <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interned. Gruban successfully appealed against the internment, and brought Booth to court.|$|E

5|$|Glee club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) {{believes}} he has found the face of Jesus in a grilled cheese sandwich, he asks for three prayers to be granted: for the school football team to win a game, for his girlfriend Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) to let him touch her breasts, and <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reinstated as quarterback. When his first prayer comes true, he asks the glee club {{to join him in}} honoring Jesus through song.|$|E
5|$|Jagadish, {{a captain}} in the Indian Army, returns to Mumbai from Kashmir. On his arrival, his parents and younger sisters force him to see Nisha, who they choose <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married to. At the bride-viewing ceremony, Jagadish makes up excuses to avoid marrying her, which {{includes}} commenting about her being old-fashioned. On the contrary, Nisha is a college-level boxer, who is completely modern in her outlook. Jagadish realises this and proposes to her, which after initial refusal, she reciprocates.|$|E
5|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{originally}} created Shikamaru {{in order}} <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the only winner {{of an early}} Naruto arc: the Chunnin Exams, based on his high intelligence. However, recommendations from his editors resulted in Kishimoto to interrupt the fighting tournament between the ninjas in order {{to focus on a}} recently new introduced villain, Orochimaru. Nevertheless, Shikamaru ends becoming the only ninja from the original test to achieve a higher rank during Part I of the series.|$|E

5|$|Steven J. Hayes (born May 30, 1963, in Homestead, Florida) {{was found}} guilty on 16 of 17 counts related to the home {{invasion}} murders on October 5, 2010.

Blue on December 2, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The curial {{cardinals}} {{entered the}} conclave seeking to elect Gregorio Barbarigo as pope. Leopold I, the Holy Roman Emperor, considered {{him to be}} an unacceptable choice {{because he was a}} Venetian. While Leopold did not formally exclude Barbarigo, he did not wish <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elected. In addition to Leopold, the Spanish ambassador in Rome worked against Barbarigo's election, and Louis XIV of France opposed it because of the wishes of his allies.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins as}} Sukartono (Tono), a Dutch-trained doctor, {{and his wife}} Sumartini (Tini), {{residents}} of Batavia (modern day Jakarta), are suffering a marital breakdown. Tono is busy treating his patients, leaving no time <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with Tini. In response, Tini has become active in numerous social organisations and women's groups, leaving her little {{time to deal with}} household work. This further distances Tono from her, as he expects her to behave like a traditional wife and be waiting for him at home, with dinner ready, when he returns from work.|$|E
50|$|A Mr Robert Thom is {{recorded}} as having encountered McWheelan who overtook {{him at a}} time that would have allowed <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> near Fortacres {{at the time of the}} murder.|$|R

5|$|When Bellingham {{received}} {{news of his}} forthcoming trial {{he asked}} Harmer to arrange <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> represented in court by Brougham and Peter Alley, the latter an Irish lawyer {{with a reputation for}} flamboyance. Confident of his acquittal, Bellingham refused to discuss the case further with Harmer, and spent the afternoon and evening making notes. After drinking a glass of porter, he went to bed and slept soundly.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Karan Soni portrays Dopinder, a {{taxi driver}} who befriends Deadpool, and Jed Rees portrays a {{recruiter}} for Ajax. X-Men co-creator Stan Lee and Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld make cameo appearances as a strip club emcee and a patron of Weasel's bar, respectively. Rob Hayter makes a cameo appearance as Bob, Agent of Hydra, a recurring character in the comics alongside Deadpool. The rights for Bob are owned by Marvel Studios, who did not give permission <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in the film, so his comic history and connections to the organization Hydra are not referenced in the film. He is instead explained as a former special forces operative like Wilson. Wolverine star Hugh Jackman was very supportive of Deadpool, and of it making fun of himself and his character, and {{is seen in the}} film via his People's Sexiest Man Alive magazine cover.|$|E
5|$|By {{the next}} day, Mackay {{realised}} {{that the position}} could not be held. He personally kept the enemy at bay with his rifle while new barricades were constructed. When he was satisfied with {{the security of the}} new position he reported to the battalion commander, who sent him to have his wounds dressed. Mackay's injuries were severe enough <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evacuated to Malta and then England, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, by which time it had been withdrawn to Egypt. For his actions at Lone Pine, Mackay was nominated for the Victoria Cross. He was overlooked for the award, although he was later mentioned in despatches.|$|E

5|$|Engin Raghip's {{solicitor}} was now Gareth Peirce– who had {{represented the}} Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, prominent cases of miscarriage of justice– and his barrister Michael Mansfield. Peirce applied for leave to appeal. She began to explore Raghip's mental state, arguing that his confession {{could not be}} relied upon, and arranged <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> examined by Dr. Gísli Guðjónsson of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, a specialist in suggestibility; Guðjónsson concluded that Raghip was unusually suggestible, with a mental age of between 10 and 11. Silcott was again represented by Barbara Mills and Braithwaite by Steven Kamlish. Mills noted the lack of photographic or scientific evidence, and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire {{on the deck of}} the Tangmere block, given that he was renting a shop there.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after he}} became a bishop Burnell kept a mistress, Juliana. Rumours {{circulated}} that she bore him four sons, {{and that he had}} a number of daughters, all of which Burnell denied. He kept a magnificent household, sufficient <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to host a parliament at his home in Acton Burnell in autumn 1283. He married off a number of young female relatives, rumoured to be his daughters, to noblemen. Amabilla Burnell married a member of a royal justice's family, and a Joan Burnell {{was the subject of a}} guarantee to the bishop that the son of William of Greystoke would marry her. A William Burnell was dean of Wells Cathedral, and was named as one of the bishop's executors. Robert Burnell's eventual heir was his nephew, Philip.|$|E
5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E
5000|$|Apart from Jón Páll Sigmarsson, he {{has also}} cited Zydrunas Savickas as someone he has deep admiration <b>for,</b> believing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the [...] "strongest strongman ever". His {{favourite}} strongman event is Natural stone loading.|$|R

5|$|He played {{three of}} England four {{qualification}} {{games for the}} 1958 FIFA World Cup: a 5–1 victory over the Republic of Ireland, and the 5–2 and 4–1 wins over Denmark. On 15 May 1957, Matthews became the oldest player ever to represent England, when at 42 years and 104 days old he turned out for the victory over the Danes in Copenhagen. Despite calls by the press <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> included in the 1958 World Cup squad, this time the selectors did not bow to the pressure. Yet at 23 years, nobody would ever enjoy a longer career with the England team.|$|E
5|$|In 1108, Ranulf {{was dragged}} {{into the middle of}} the ongoing dispute between Archbishop Anselm and the newly {{appointed}} Archbishop of York, Thomas over whether or not Thomas should profess obedience to Anselm. Because Anselm refused to consecrate Thomas without a profession, and Thomas refused to profess, Thomas was unable to consecrate bishops himself. Ranulf wrote to Anselm, asking that he might act as Thomas' surrogate and consecrate Thurgot as Bishop of St Andrew's. In September 1108, Anselm wrote to Ranulf forbidding anyone but Thomas or Anselm himself to consecrate Thurgot or any other bishops. Later, Ranulf tried to bribe King Henry to take Thomas' side. Thurgot had been prior of the cathedral chapter at Durham, but had disagreed with Ranulf, who arranged <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elected to St Andrew's as a solution to the quarrel.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Sanders {{took over}} the lease of the Pure Oil filling station {{on the other side}} of the road, due to its greater {{visibility}} for motorists. He then began to sell fried chicken. To improve his skills, Sanders took an eight-week restaurant-management course at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration. By 1936, his business had proved successful enough <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon. In 1937, Sanders expanded his restaurant to 140 seats, and in 1940 purchased a motel across the street, the Sanders Court & Café.|$|E
