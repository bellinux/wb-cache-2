The results show the great importance of the drying conditions onto the flavour quality and flavour intensity. A steam treatment of unroasted cocoa may cause flavour problems if the cocoa nibs are not sufficiently dried before roasting.

Irrigation did not affect free acidity, peroxide number and fatty acid composition of oils. The oleic acid ranged from 74. 3 to 77. 5 % of total fatty acids in oils from dry-farmed and irrigated trees, respectively. Irrigation decreased total phenols and ortho-diphenols of oils from black ripe fruits (but not of those from green-black fruits) and increased several volatile compounds related to oil flavours.

The final version is available from Elsevier via [URL] quality of the same meat samples from different animal types cooked at two end-point cooking temperatures (55 ?C and 74 ?C) was evaluated by trained panels in France and the United Kingdom. Tenderness and juiciness scores were greater at 55 than 74 ?C, irrespective of the animal type and location of the panel. The UK panel, independently of animal type, gave greater scores for beef flavour (+ 7 to + 24 %, P < 0. 001) but lower scores for abnormal flavour (? 10 to ? 17 %, P < 0. 001) at 74 ?C. Abnormal flavour score by the French panel was higher at 74 ?C than at 55 ?C (+ 26 %, P < 0. 001). Irrespective of the data set, tenderness was correlated with juiciness and beef flavour.

For studying the contribution of Amadori-compounds fru-phe and fru-leu (fructose-leucine) were roasted at 145 centigrades. The roasted flavours contained a lot of key compounds of cocoa flavour. If cocoa was moist-thermally treated and dried the level of Amadori-compounds could be raised and the roasted aroma intensified. Amadori-compounds obviously contribute the flavour formation in cocoa.

The scientific literature of factors influencing sensory quality of wholegrain foods is rather scarce.

This review deals with factors that differentiate the sensory properties of wholegrain and bran-rich foods from those of refined cereal foods. Key findings and conclusions: Wholegrain and bran contain flavour-active compounds, flavour precursors and resistant cell wall structures causing changes in flavour and texture during processing. In wholegrain foods, different chemical constituents contribute to bitterness. <b>Increased</b> knowledge on <b>flavour</b> formation has led to the possibility to not only measure but actually also design the flavour.

40|$|Abstract:- Parboiling {{is a set}} of {{operations}} needed for the production of a gelatinized product. Scientifically it is a thermal treatment process done on rice and other cereals. Water and heat are two essential elements to transform the natural cereal into “parboiled ” cereal. In rice, it is done to produce gelatinized or parboiled rice. Parboiling, if examined carefully has other scientific benefits beyond easy milling and reducing broken grains. Unfortunately, the technology has received little attention in terms of research as far as food processing or preservation is concern. As part of an ongoing research to assess the extent to which parboiling affect the migration of vitamin B 1, a preliminary survey was conducted between October, 2012 and December, 2012 in the three northern regions of Ghana to elucidate the scientific principles behind the practice and to what extend processors understand these principles. This work also aimed at high lighting the practice so as to encourage people to adapt indigenous technologies which may have more beneficial health effects. Eighty (80) processors in the three northern regions drawn by purposive sampling methods were interviewed using structured and semi structured questionnaires. The results showed that 100 % of the people engaged in parboiling business are women with over 70 % of them having no formal education and therefore are unaware of any effects of parboiling on nutritional elements. It became clear that parboiling <b>increased</b> the <b>flavour</b> and taste of the rice thus making it attractive to eat. However, the respondents only mentioned less broken grains, easy dehusking, ease of cooking, increase quantity, better prices, and parboiling being a norm as some of the reasons why they carry out rice parboiling.

The test drink was an uncarbonated peach-flavoured iced tea served in visually identical drink cans (330 ml). Participants preselected as "sweet likers" evaluated the minimally sweetened flavoured drink (conditioned stimulus, CS) in the same state (hungry or sated) in which they consumed the test drink at home. Overall, liking for the CS <b>flavour</b> <b>increased</b> in participants who consumed the SUCROSE drink, however, this increase in liking was significantly larger when tested and trained hungry than sated, consistent with a flavour-nutrient model. Overall increases in pleasantness for the CS flavour in participants who consumed the SUCROSE drink when sated or the ASPARTAME drink independent of hunger state, suggest that flavour-flavour learning also occurred. These results are discussed in light of current learning models of flavour preference...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies found}} that {{caffeine}} consumers acquired a liking for the flavour of novel caffeinated drinks when these drinks were consumed repeatedly in a caffeine-deprived, but not nondeprived, state. Expression of this acquired liking appeared acutely sensitive to current caffeine deprivation state, {{but the use of}} between-subjects designs confounded interpretation of those studies. The present study evaluated these findings further using a within-subject design, with one flavour paired with caffeine (CS +) and the second with the absence of caffeine (CS-). During four CS + and four CS- training days, 32 moderate caffeine consumers alternatively consumed a novel flavoured drink a CS + paired with caffeine and a CS- flavour paired with placebo. Participants evaluated both drinks before and after training in two motivational states: caffeine deprived and nondeprived. As predicted, pleasantness ratings for the caffeine-paired <b>flavour</b> <b>increased</b> overall. However, this acquired liking was only significant when tested in a caffeine-deprived state. These data are consistent with a conditioned-flavour preference model and imply that expression of acquired liking for a novel caffeinated flavour depends on the need for the effects of caffeine at the time when the drink is evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Flavour {{development}} in cheese {{is affected by}} the integrity of Lactococcus lactis cells. Disintegrated cells enhance for instance the enzymatic degradation of casein to free amino acids, while integer cells are needed to produce specific flavour compounds from amino acids. The impact of the cellular activity of these integer cells on flavour production remains to be elucidated. In this study we investigated whether lactose-deprived L. lactis cells that use arginine as an alternative energy source can extend cellular activity and produce more specific flavours. In cheese experiments we demonstrated that arginine metabolising cells survived about 3 times longer than non-arginine metabolising cells, which suggests prolonged cellular activity. Cellular activity and flavour production of L. lactis was further studied in vitro to enable controlled arginine supplementation. Comparable with the results found in cheese, the survival rates of in vitro incubated cells improved when arginine was metabolised. Furthermore, elongated cellular activity was reflected in 3 – 4 -fold <b>increased</b> activity of <b>flavour</b> generating enzymes. The observed prolonged cellular activity resulted in about 2 -fold higher concentrations of typical Gouda cheese flavours. These findings provide new leads for composing starter cultures that will produce specific flavour compound...|$|R
