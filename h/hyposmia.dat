50|$|<b>Hyposmia</b> is {{a reduced}} ability to smell and to detect odors. A related {{condition}} is anosmia, {{in which no}} odors can be detected. Some {{of the causes of}} olfaction problems are allergies, nasal polyps, viral infections and head trauma.

50|$|The {{changes in}} {{olfactory}} function {{can be placed}} into three categories: (1) anosmia, the inability to smell; (2) <b>hyposmia,</b> a reduced ability to smell; or (3) dysosmia, where olfactory signals are incorrectly processed. Most chemicals at lower concentrations cause a degree of <b>hyposmia</b> while at higher concentrations anosmia is the result. Dysomia is less commonly observed, however, cases of fish becoming attracted to metal-contaminated waters have been studied and examined.|$|E

50|$|Total lack {{of sense}} of smell (anosmia) or {{markedly}} reduced sense of smell (<b>hyposmia).</b> This is the defining feature of Kallmann syndrome; it is not seen in other cases of HH. Approximately 50% of HH cases occur with anosmia and can be termed as Kallmann syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|A related term, <b>hyposmia,</b> {{refers to}} a {{decreased}} ability to smell, while hyperosmia {{refers to a}}n increased ability to smell. Some people may be anosmic for one particular odor. This is known as [...] "specific anosmia". The absence {{of the sense of}} smell from birth is called congenital anosmia.|$|E
50|$|Olfactory {{dysfunction}} can be quantitative and/or qualitative. Quantitative smell disorders {{refer to}} disorders {{in which there}} is complete or partial loss of olfaction. Anosmia, the complete loss of olfaction, and <b>hyposmia,</b> the partial loss of olfaction are the two disorders classified as quantitative because they can be measured. Qualitative smell disorders can’t be measured and refer to disorders {{in which there is}} alternation or distortion in the perception of smell. Qualitative disorders include parosmia (also called troposmia) and phantosmia. The term dysosmia refers to a qualitative olfaction disorder and include both parosmia and phantosmia. Olfactory dysfunction including anosmia, <b>hyposmia,</b> and dysosmia can be either bilateral or unilateral on either nostril. Anosmia only on the left nostril would be termed unilateral left anosmia while bilateral anosmia would be termed total anosmia.|$|E
50|$|Fortunately for {{patients}} afflicted with parosmia, symptoms usually decrease with time. Although there are instances of parosmia affecting patients for {{years at a}} time, this {{is certainly not the}} majority of cases. There have been experiments done to treat parosmia with L-Dopa, but besides that there are no current treatments other than inducing anosmia or <b>hyposmia</b> {{to the point where the}} odors are negligible.|$|E
50|$|Kallmann {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} genetic hormonal condition that {{is characterized by a}} failure to start or a failure to complete puberty. It is also accompanied by a lack of sense of smell (anosmia) or a highly reduced sense of smell (<b>hyposmia).</b> The condition can occur in both males and females but is more commonly diagnosed in males. Left untreated, patients with Kallmann syndrome will almost invariably be infertile.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that not all {{patients}} of Parkinson's disease exhibit phantosmia. Only one half of the patients suffering from anosmia and <b>hyposmia</b> perceive their deficit, even when they are specifically asked to do so. According to a study by Doty et al., 72% of the patients with olfactory disorders are not aware of their deficit, hence making it harder for physicians and specialists to truly rely on the reliability of phantosmia as a biomarker.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{permanent}} <b>hyposmia</b> and anosmia are upper respiratory infections. Such dysfunctions show no change over time and can sometimes reflect damage not only to the olfactory epithelium, but also to the central olfactory structures as a result of viral invasions into the brain. Among these virus-related disorders are the common cold, hepatitis, influenza and influenza-like illness, as well as herpes. Most viral infections are unrecognizable because they are so mild or entirely asymptomatic.|$|E
50|$|Esthesioneuroblastoma {{will first}} {{frequently}} present as a nasal mass. The most common {{signs and symptoms}} of esthesioneuroblastoma are nasal obstruction (70%) and epistaxis (50%). Less common symptoms include <b>hyposmia</b> (loss of smell), headache, rhinorrhea, vision loss, proptosis, facial pain, diplopia (double vision), masses in the neck and changes in mental status. Esthesioneuroblastoma occurs in the upper nasal cavity, near the optic nerves and optic chiasm. Thus, tumor growth can impinge nerve function and result in vision loss and diplopia. As the tumor metastasizes to the oral cavity, there can be tooth pain and tooth mobility.|$|E
5000|$|Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is an anionic {{detergent}} {{that has}} more than one probable mode of action. The interaction of SLS with mucus, proteins, and membranes result in multiple possible modes of action. [...] The depression in olfactory sense (<b>hyposmia)</b> at low concentrations caused by interaction with mucus is most often a result of the disruption of mucus layers of the olfactory bulb causing avoidance behavior in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). [...] Additionally, SLS can reversibly and irreversibly alter protein structure because they act to solubilize the lipid bilayer of membranes and denature proteins. This can lead to decreased enzyme activity, changes in permeability and altered transport characteristics of membranes.|$|E
50|$|Olfactory {{problems}} {{can be divided into}} different types based on their malfunction. The olfactory dysfunction can be total (anosmia), incomplete (partial anosmia, <b>hyposmia,</b> or microsmia), distorted (dysosmia), or can be characterized by spontaneous sensations like phantosmia. An inability to recognize odors despite a normally functioning olfactory system is termed olfactory agnosia. Hyperosmia is a rare condition typified by an abnormally heightened sense of smell. Like vision and hearing, the olfactory {{problems can}} be bilateral or unilateral meaning if a person has anosmia {{on the right side of}} the nose but not the left, it is a unilateral right anosmia. On the other hand, if it is on both sides of the nose it is called bilateral anosmia or total anosmia.|$|E
50|$|Dysosmia is a {{disorder}} described as any qualitative alteration or {{distortion of the}} perception of smell. Qualitative alterations differ from quantitative alterations, which include anosmia and <b>hyposmia.</b> Dysosmia can be classified as either parosmia (also called troposmia) or phantosmia. Parosmia refers to a distortion {{in the perception of}} an odorant. Odorants smell different from what one remembers. Phantosmia refers to the perception of an odor when there's no actual odorant present. The cause of dysosmia still remains a theory. It is typically considered a neurological disorder and clinical associations with the disorder have been made. Most cases are described as idiopathic and the main antecedents related to parosmia are URTIs, head trauma, and nasal and paranasal sinus disease. Dysosmia tends to go away on its own but there are options for treatment for patients that want immediate relief.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{olfactory}} {{disorders such as}} <b>hyposmia</b> and anosmia {{have been}} found to be a symptom of mood disorders (depression). However, it is not known what olfactory disorders occur and if they are indeed a symptom of a depressive disorder.It has been found that phantosmia may be an early sign of the neurodegenerative disease Parkinson's disease. It may also be a sign of an intracranial hemorrhage (brain tumours or epilepsy).Other studies have also found that the symptoms of phantosmia have been alleviated after the patient has been treated for depression. Another case of a 70-year-old male reported that his first abnormal symptoms were irregular bowel movements. After this the patient developed irregular eye movements and had developed a sleep and behavior disorder after this he developed phantosmia; which was described to be as [...] "stinky and unpleasant". The patient did not display the following symptoms: loss of awareness, confusion, automatisms, convulsive seizures, auditory/visual hallucinations.|$|E
5000|$|Studies on {{pesticides}} and olfaction in fishes {{have looked at}} neurophysiological effects, behavioral effects, and reproductive effects. Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are neurotoxins that cause acetylcholinesterase inhibition in fish. Acetyl cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides are known to cause <b>hyposmia.</b> Acetylcholinesterase plays an essential role within the olfactory epithelium related to mucous production. Diazinon, an organophosphate, was found to disrupt olfactory pheromone signals that induced antipredator behavior, such as predator avoidance. It also disrupts homing behavior in Chinook salmon at environmentally-relevant concentrations. Fewer diazinon-treated chinook returned to the hatchery than control fish.Studies have found that olfactory sensory neurons {{do not respond to}} certain pesticides. Fish did not detect chlorpyrifos, esfenvalerate, and atrazine using their sense of smell and did not avoid waters contaminated with these chemicals. This contrasts metals, which elicits an avoidance response in fish. Round-up was only avoided at concentrations that caused acute lethality. Ovulating female salmon release a pheromone in their urine. After detection by the olfactory system of mature male salmon parr, plasma sex steroids and milt increase. [...] A synthetic pyrethroid pesticide, cypermethrin, reduced or inhibited normal olfactory system response in males to the priming effect of these pheromones. Atrazine, carbofuran and diazinon were also found to reduce olfactory detection of female priming pheromones by male Atlantic salmon parr.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} 10 weeks of normal {{embryonic}} development the GnRH releasing neurones migrate from their original {{source in the}} nasal region and end up inside the hypothalamus. These neurones originate {{in an area of}} the developing head, called the olfactory placode, that will give rise to the nose; they then pass through the cribriform plate, along with the fibres of the olfactory nerves, and into the rostral forebrain. From there they migrate to what will become the hypothalamus. Any problems with the development of the olfactory nerve fibres will prevent the progression of the GnRH releasing neurones towards the brain. If the GnRH releasing neurones are prevented from reaching the hypothalamus no GnRH will be released, so in turn no FSH or LH will be released which results in the failure of puberty and deficient production of testosterone in men, and oestrogen and progesterone in women. In KS the olfactory nerve fibres are interrupted in the frontonasal region, and the olfactory bulbs are missing or not fully developed, which gives rise to the additional symptom of lack of sense of smell (anosmia) or strongly reduced sense of smell (<b>hyposmia).</b> In other forms of CHH the olfactory nerves and olfactory bulbs develop correctly, so there is a normal sense of smell and the migration of the GnRH releasing neurones is not affected, but some hypothalamic defect prevents GnRH from being released, or alternatively, the hormone is released but cannot stimulate the cells of the pituitary gland because the hormone receptor is absent or not functional. The genes that have been implicated in KS or CHH play a part in the generation, migration, or activity of these GnRH releasing neurones, or in the ability of GnRH to stimulate FSH and LH production.|$|E
40|$|Olfactory {{dysfunction}} is {{an important}} public health problem in the United States, with approximately 14 million elderly Americans having chronic olfactory impairment.

Most of the current olfactory detection tests are targeted at Western populations. The exact relationship between <b>hyposmia</b> and cognitive impairment is unknown. The {{purpose of the study was}} to find bromines that can effectively identify olfactory dysfunction and investigate the relationship between <b>hyposmia</b> and cognitive function in early, non-demented, drug-naïve patients with PD in the People’s Republic of China. Methods: Sixty-three early, non-demented, drug-naïve patients with PD and 55 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The T&T olfactometer and a Chinese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were applied to assess subjects’ olfactory and cognitive functions. Patients with PD also completed the Modified Unified Parkinson’s disease-rating scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. Results: Patients with PD had lower scores of visuospatial and executive function (p= 0. 000), attention (p= 0. 03), and delayed recall (p= 0. 001) than controls. β-phenylethyl alcohol (floral smell, smell of rose petals) and isovaleric acid (smell of sweat, stuffy socks) were more sensitive for identifying <b>hyposmia</b> in patients with PD than three other odors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that impaired visuospatial and executive function was associated with <b>hyposmia</b> (p= 0. 013), but was independent of other PD-associated variables. Conclusion: <b>Hyposmia</b> was common in early, non-demented, drug-naïve PD patients. β-Phenylethyl alcohol and isovaleric acid were more superior for identifying <b>hyposmia</b> in early non-demented Chinese patients with PD. <b>Hyposmia</b> was associated with impaired visuospatial and executive function in patients with PD.

The purpose of {{present study was to}} explore whether the combination of olfactory test and TCS of SN could enhance the differential diagnostic power in Chinese patients with PD. Methods Thirty-seven patients with PD and twenty-six patients with essential tremor (ET) were evaluated on 16 -item odor identification test from extended version of sniffin’ sticks and TCS of SN. The frequency of <b>hyposmia</b> and SN hyperechogenicity in each group was compared. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the two clinical biomarkers were analyzed. Results The frequency of <b>hyposmia</b> in patients with PD was significantly higher than in patients with ET (62. 2 % VS. 3. 8 %, P [*]=[*] 0. 000). The frequency of SN hyperechogenicity in patients with PD was significantly higher than in ET subjects (48. 6 % VS. 15. 4 %, P [*]=[*] 0. 006). The combination of <b>hyposmia</b> and SN hyperechogenicity (if either one or both present) discriminated patients with PD from ET with a sensitivity of 78. 4 % and 29. 7 %, specificity of 80. 8 % and 100 %, PPV of 85. 3 % and 100 %, and NPV of 72. 4 % and 50. 0 %, respectively.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleIntroduction Parkinson’s disease (PD), especially in the early stage, is sometimes difficult to differentiate from essential tremor (ET) [1]. Accumulating evidence suggested that olfactory dysfunction, substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity on transcranial sonography (TCS) might be risk markers of PD [2, 3], which was helpful for making early and differ-ential diagnosis. However, the diagnostic value of each item is often limited [4, 5]. Recently, A few studies suggest that combination of TCS and <b>hyposmia</b> might play complementary roles for the discrimination of PD from ET and other movement disorders [6, 7]. Since the prevalence of <b>hyposmia</b> in Chinese PD patients is lower than those in Western countries [8], whether the com-bination of <b>hyposmia</b> and SN hyperechogenicity could improve differential diagnostic value of Chinese patients with PD merits investigation. Therefore, we conducted a pilot study to explore the value of combined olfactory test and TCS of SN for the differential diagnosis of PD in Shanghai, China...|$|E
40|$|Objective: <b>Hyposmia</b> {{may occur}} {{simultaneously}} with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) {{as a specific}} phenotype in Parkinson's Diseases (PD), of which the disease progression is fast. In the study, we tried to identify whether the genotypic characteristics could participate in the co-occurrence of <b>hyposmia</b> and RBD in PD patients. Methods: 152 PD patients were recruited from the Department of Neurology, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine from 2011 to 2016, with comprehensive clinical assessment performing. Two SNPs of SNCA (rs 11931074 and rs 894278) in 105 patients were also analyzed. Results: Overall, 84 of 152 PD patients (55. 3 %) were diagnosed with RBD after PSG evaluation. After regression analysis, higher levels of three parts of UPDRS and SCOPA-AUT scores were all associated with increased risk of RBD in PD patients, respectively. While for olfactory function, we didn't find significant correlation between <b>hyposmia</b> and RBD in PD patients. However, we found that {{in the group of}} minor G allele of rs 894278, patients with lower score of SS- 16 had a 4. 76 -fold risk of suffering from RBD in patients (95 % CI: 1. 39 – 16. 67; p = 0. 013). Furthermore, we analyzed SNP associated gene expression by eQTL analysis in Genevar database and found that GG genotype of rs 894278 was associated with higher levels of α-synuclein in Nerve tissue (p = 1. 5 E- 8) while TT genotype of rs 11931074 was associated with higher levels of α-synuclein in Brain (p = 0. 0082), which suggesting a potential functional relevance with different symptoms of PD. Conclusions: <b>Hyposmia</b> was associated with RBD in PD patients with the minor G allele of rs 894278, which represent one specific subtype of PD.

40|$|Gender {{differences}} in dopaminergic related neurodegenerative diseases have hardly been studied until now. It is generally accepted that more {{men than women}} suffer from Parkinson's disease. One of the most prevalent symptoms in Parkinson's patients, <b>hyposmia,</b> does not show gender differences, while normally the sense of smell is better developed in females. Whether the change in dopamine in the olfactory bulb contributes equally to <b>hyposmia</b> in male and female Parkinson's patients is the subject of the present study. In a stereological study the total number of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons in the olfactory bulbs of male and female Parkinson's patients and age-matched controls has been estimated. The present stereological study shows that the number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells in control females is significantly lower than those in control males. The number of dopaminergic cells in the olfactory bulbs of both male and female Parkinson's patients equals that of healthy males of the same age group. We therefore conclude that the <b>hyposmia</b> in Parkinson's disease patients cannot simply be ascribed to dopamine in the olfactory bulb. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Patients {{undergoing}} {{any type}} of nasal surgery may experience degrees of postoperative olfactory dysfunction. We sought to investigate "when" the olfactory function recovers to its preoperative levels. Methods In this cohort design, 40 of 65 esthetic open rhinoplasty candidates with equal gender distribution, who met the inclusion criteria, were assessed for their olfactory function using the Smell Identification Test (SIT) with 40 familiar odors in sniffing bottles. All the patients were evaluated for the SIT scores preoperatively and postoperatively (at week 1, week 6, and month 6). Results At postoperative week one, 87. 5 % of the patients had anosmia, and the rest exhibited at least moderate levels of <b>hyposmia.</b> The anosmia, which was the dominant pattern at postoperative week 1, resolved and converted to various levels of <b>hyposmia,</b> {{so that no one}} at postoperative week 6 showed any such complain. At postoperative week six, 85 % of the subjects experienced degrees of <b>hyposmia,</b> almost all being mild to moderate. At postoperative six month, the olfactory function had already reverted to the preoperative levels: no anosmia or moderate to severe <b>hyposmia.</b> A repeated ANOVA was indicative of significant differences in the olfactory function at the different time points. According to our post hoc Benfronney, the preoperative scores had a significant difference with those at postoperative week 1, week 6, but not with the ones at month 6.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{described}} <b>hyposmia</b> after laryngectomy. The most common mechanism invoked is {{a reduction in}} nasal airflow, leading to elevated olfactory detection thresholds. Children with nasal obstruction {{have been shown to}} also have elevated olfactory detection thresholds linked to reduced nasal airflow. A child with a tracheotomy is in some degree similar to a laryngectomee. These patients will have variable amounts of nasal airflow reduction proportional to the degree of suprastomal obstruction. Our concern was that this alteration in nasal airflow may cause <b>hyposmia.</b> Furthermore, if the olfactory system requires adequate early stimulation for normal development [as is the case with vision and hearing], tracheotomy would be suspected to cause persistent <b>hyposmia</b> even after decannulation. Thus decreased olfactory sensitivity, delayed olfactory experience, or both could interfere with a child's ability to recognize and identify odor stimuli. We studied children aged 4 to 16 years with upper airway obstruction requiring tracheotomy and compared their abilities to identify familiar odorants with those of a large group of normal control children.

40|$|Background: Calcium {{plays an}} {{integral}} role in olfactory signal transduction, including feedback inhibition. Sodium citrate {{acts as a}} calcium sequestrant and when applied intranasally, reduces free calcium available for feedback inhibition, which should theoretically improve olfaction. We aimed to investigate the utility of intranasal sodium citrate in improving the olfactory function of hyposmic patients, by performing this prospective placebo controlled, single-blinded trial. Methodology: Monorhinal olfactory testing for odour identification and threshold was performed in hyposmic patients using “Sniffin’ Sticks”, before and after treatment. Treatment consisted of sodium citrate solution application to the olfactory cleft. Sodium chloride solution {{was applied to the}} contralateral olfactory cleft, which therefore acted as placebo control. Patients were blinded to the side of sodium citrate application, and side of treatment was randomized between patients. Results: 57 patients participated in the trial, aged 22 - 79. Causes of <b>hyposmia</b> included: post-viral (7); posttraumatic (10); sinonasal (30) and idiopathic (10). Compared with placebo, there was significant improvement in the identification scores of participants with post-viral <b>hyposmia,</b> following sodium citrate treatment.
