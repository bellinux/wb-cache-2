500|$|On May 12, 2009, Eminem {{released}} his sixth studio effort, Relapse, {{which included a}} song titled [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad".

I'm not playing, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> back, you punk." [...] After the song's release, Cannon went on his website, defending Carey and expressing his disgust at his comments. Following Cannon's comments, Eminem responded sarcastically. He clarified that the song was actually [...] "wishing the couple the best", and that it was a misunderstanding. In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well. He later commented that he respected Cannon for his response, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the music}} video began {{during the week of}} January 25, 2010, in Los Angeles. It was filmed at Universal CityWalk by {{director}} Ray Kay, who had previously directed videos for Beyoncé Knowles, Lady Gaga, Alexandra Burke, and Cheryl Cole, among others. Ludacris said that the video [...] "is like a 2010 version of Michael Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel"." [...] Bieber said that the video [...] "will capture the song's message of trying to woo back a girl." [...] In explaining the concept of the video, Bieber said, [...] "It starts off, I really like this girl, but we didn't [...] along; we couldn't be together. Basically <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> back and [...] kind of going through the whole thing. I'm chasing her around, trying to get her, and she's kind of playing hard to get, but I'm persistent. I keep going." [...] The video premiered exclusively on Vevo on Friday, February 19, 2010. Singer and actress Jasmine Villegas portrays Bieber's love interest in the video. Bieber's friends, Young Money artists Drake and Lil Twist also appeared in the video, along with Tinashe and jerkin' crew The Rangers.|$|E
500|$|From {{the year}} 2001 onwards, Eminem {{claimed to have}} dated Carey for six months {{throughout}} the gloomy times in her life. Carey denied ever having {{been involved with the}} rapper in a personal relationship, claiming that they had only met a handful of times, and it was professional. Subsequently, he referred to Carey in several of his songs in a negative light, claiming to have been angered by her not admitting to seeing him. On Charmbracelet, Carey included a song titled [...] "Clown", which critics suggested was aimed at Eminem. [...] "Clown"'s lyrics were described as [...] "languidly sinister" [...] by Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, and read: [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / When you know very well we never even touched each other." [...] In 2005, during concerts on the rapper's Anger Management Tour, he began playing voice-mails and recordings that were reportedly left by Carey. One of the messages said: [...] "I heard you were getting back with your ex-wife. Why won't you see me? Why won't you call me?". After playing the excerpt, Eminem would pretend to be sick before launching into his song [...] "Puke". On May 12, 2009, Eminem released his sixth studio album Relapse, which included the song [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad". The song's lyrics suggested Eminem was still in love with Carey and [...] "wanted her back": [...] "I want another crack at ya" [...] and [...] "Nick Cannon better back the f**k up. I'm not playing, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> back, you punk." [...] After the song's release, Cannon went on his website, defending Carey and expressing his disgust at the rapper's comments: ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of his primary defeat, Mfume was {{believed}} to be considering running for mayor of Baltimore in 2007, though he had not publicly expressed interest in such a run. On November 13, 2006, Mfume told a Baltimore-area radio station that [...] "I don't have any plans to run for mayor. She 's worked for and deserves an opportunity to lead. ... <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to succeed. I want the city to be united. I think at this point we owe her at least the opportunity to try to lead it." [...] In late 2010, he was again rumored to be considering a run in the Baltimore mayoral election, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} as UN Ambassador, Stevenson often {{traveled}} around the country promoting the United Nations in speeches and seminars. On these trips, he frequently faced opposition and protests from groups skeptical of the United Nations, such as the right-wing John Birch Society. In October 1963 Stevenson spoke in Dallas, Texas, where he was shouted down by unruly protestors led by retired General Edwin Walker's [...] "National Indignation Convention". At one point a woman hit Stevenson {{on the head with}} a sign, leading Stevenson to remark [...] "is she animal or human?", and telling a policeman [...] "I don't want her to go to jail, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to go to school." [...] Afterwards, Stevenson warned President Kennedy's advisers about the [...] "ugly and frightening" [...] mood he had found in Dallas, but Kennedy went ahead with his planned visit to Dallas in late November 1963.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Garner {{became an}} artist {{ambassador}} for Save the Children, promoting national literacy, nutrition and early education efforts. Since 2014, Garner {{has served on}} the board of trustees for Save the Children, the United States branch of the British children's charity, advocating for early education. She had been an ambassador for six years, and frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years. In 2011 she partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children. In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: [...] "My husband and I have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary Clinton have {{to make the world a}} better place for everyone." [...] In 2014, she joined the Invest in Us campaign., and in January 2015, she appeared in A Path Appears, a PBS documentary which focuses on rural poverty among children in West Virginia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to be cute but not beautiful. She {{looked like}} a young girl. I gave her a {{substantial}} overbite, her eyes were wide, her body was slim, she wasn't particularly busty. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to look almost elven, {{so that when you}} see {{her for the first time}} wearing full-make up and dressed in a provocative outfit where you know she's just been in bed with Deathstroke that it does jab you a bit. [...] "Whoa, good God! This little girl is a slut!" ...|$|R

2500|$|For {{the spiritual}} ancestor, a male {{character}} named Old Man River was originally envisioned, and Gregory Peck {{was cast in}} the role. However, Peck realized the character {{ought to be a}} maternal figure and reluctantly turned down the role. Conceived as a Tree of Life whose seasonal changes would frame the story, Grandmother Willow grew out of a concept sketch of a sawed-off tree with a branch pointing to its right drawn by Grant, which would serve as a narrator that would [...] "remember back to Pocahontas 300 years earlier". Grant would continue to protest to have the tree be more a character within the story, and her character flowered into the idea of a grandmotherly spiritual adviser to Pocahontas. Because of Katzenberg's opposition to having Grandmother Willow in the story, Grant assisted fellow veteran story artist Burny Mattinson with coming up tree puns such as [...] "My bark is worse than my bite", [...] "The roots of all problems", and [...] "They're barking up the wrong tree." [...] Mattinson reluctantly added them to his pitch for the next morning, and during the story meeting, he exclaimed, [...] "Everybody loved it! All of a sudden: 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> in!' 'Let's build her part bigger!'" [...] The character Nakoma was also created to serve as the voice of reason and the practical woman.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't. Never {{mind about}} the damned notice. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> more than anything.—And the more I look at these naked lines, the more <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her.</b> It's a sort of fine sharp feeling, like these curved lines. I don't know what I'm saying—but do you think she'd have me? Has she seen these pictures?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There!" [...] says Miss Grant, [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> {{to see you}} in your braws {{like the}} lass of Limekilns. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to see what I could make of you, when I buckled to the job in earnest!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Papa did not understand, {{but the boy}} explained. [...] "She can't not {{never see}} them now," [...] he sobbed, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> to see them, and they has pockets!" ...|$|R
60|$|It was borne in upon me {{that somehow}} it was {{different}} now from the old days before Lop-Ear and I had gone on our adventure-journey. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>I</b> knew that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her.</b> And she knew it, too. That was why she would not let me come near her. I forgot that she was truly the Swift One, {{and that in the}} art of climbing she had been my teacher. I pursued her from tree to tree, and ever she eluded me, peeping back at me with kindly eyes, making soft sounds, and dancing and leaping and teetering before me just out of reach. The more she eluded me, the more <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to catch <b>her,</b> and the lengthening shadows of the afternoon bore witness to the futility of my effort.|$|R

60|$|CUSINS. Yes, a confession. Listen, all. Until I met Barbara I thought {{myself in}} the main an honorable, truthful man, because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> the {{approval}} of my conscience more than <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> anything else. But the moment I saw Barbara, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> {{far more than the}} approval of my conscience.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Lambert looked away. [...] "I {{tried to}} reason with <b>her,</b> Anthony. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to 'sit for council,' but she's so crazy to get away she will not do it. She will hardly speak to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So all I {{could do}} was {{to go back to}} the other room, and tell him that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to go to sleep, and that he must not call out to her until I told him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Before I {{had asked}} her to be my wife I had promised to be her brother. And so I will, if she should ever want a brother. I am not going to desert her because she will not do what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to do, or be what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to be. She understands that. There is to be no quarrel between us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{understand}} because you're blind. She's sinned, and {{she must}} suffer. I know what she'll endure. She'll be starved and tortured and humiliated. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to accept the punishment of man as a sacrifice to God. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> to accept it joyfully. She has an opportunity which is offered to very few of us. God is very good and very merciful." ...|$|E

60|$|I can {{remember}} now {{my sense of}} frustration by her unresilient reply. I should have perceived then that for her my ardour had no quickening fire. But how was I to know?
