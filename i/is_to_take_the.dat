5|$|Information {{from the}} sense organs is {{collected}} in the brain. There {{it is used to}} determine what actions the organism <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take.</b> <b>The</b> brain processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment. Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} results, it generates motor response patterns. These signal-processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary goal}} of any bowler <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> wicket of the batsman. The {{secondary}} goal is to prevent the batsman scoring runs. The latter is often a route to the former as a batsman deprived of runs will often become frustrated and {{is more likely to}} attempt risky shots to score. In addition, stopping the batsman from scoring keeps the same batsman at the crease to face consecutive balls which may be formed into a tactical sequence.|$|E
25|$|Neural field {{models are}} another {{important}} tool in studying neural oscillations {{and are a}} mathematical framework describing evolution of variables such as mean firing rate in space and time. In modeling the activity {{of large numbers of}} neurons, the central idea <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> density of neurons to the continuum limit, resulting in spatially continuous neural networks. Instead of modelling individual neurons, this approach approximates a group of neurons by its average properties and interactions. It is based on the mean field approach, an area of statistical physics that deals with large-scale systems. Models based on these principles have been used to provide mathematical descriptions of neural oscillations and EEG rhythms. They have for instance been used to investigate visual hallucinations.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years, {{they were more}} {{interested}} in the acoustics of speech. For instance, they were looking at the differences between /ba/ or /da/, but now research has been directed to the response in the brain from the stimuli. In recent years, there has been a model developed {{to create a sense of}} how speech perception works; this model is known as the Dual Stream Model. This model has drastically changed from how psychologists look at perception. The first section of the Dual Stream Model is the ventral pathway. This pathway incorporates middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal sulcus and perhaps the inferior temporal gyrus. The ventral pathway shows phonological representations to the lexical or conceptual representations, which is the meaning of the words. The second section of the Dual Stream Model is the dorsal pathway. This pathway includes the sylvian parietotemporal, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, and premotor cortex. Its primary function <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> sensory or phonological stimuli and transfer it into an articulatory-motor representation (formation of speech).|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong {{attended}} the day's meetings. The Program of Seminars ends {{on this day}} and delegates discussed {{about the future of}} global economy, poverty and the future of Asia. Ministers {{of the members of the}} International Monetary Fund approved a plan to give more powers and voting rights to People's Republic of China, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey. This vote had 90.6% of the members supporting the move. However, the IMF remains dominated by Europe, the United States and Japan. China has less power in the IMF, although its economy is larger than Belgium and Netherlands combined. The IMF and World Bank have been criticised by Brazil, Argentina, Asian and African nations for prescribing severe belt-tightening measures during their economic crisis. The American government sees the reform of the IMF to redress global economic imbalances, which were cited as one of the biggest menaces to world growth. The IMF is stepping up in its financial surveillance through multilateral consultations to make it more effective and relevant. The World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said that the poor should not be abandoned because their governments are weak, otherwise the people would be penalised twice. The IMF and World Bank see the need to combat corruption in developing countries. The World Bank will work with developing countries by working with countries or offered through projects on the countries itself. Wolfowitz said that the issue of governance is being addressed, and the most important thing <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> principles in the paper, applying it in terms of budget allocation. Matters may be complicated due to lack of political will. He added that working with developing countries is a starting point and must work with banks, global organisations and other governments to stop corruption in their nations. African nations also called for more voting rights in the IMF for countries in their continent, at forums held in Africa itself.|$|E

If the body has ceased to exist but the purpose continues, the gift has not failed. Incorporated bodies on the other hand can possess property, and as such, as said by Buckley J in Re Vernon's Will Trust, [...] "A bequest to a corporate body ... takes effect simply as a gift to that body beneficially, unless there are circumstances which show that the recipient <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> gift as a trustee." ...|$|E
