5|$|In 1955, Abbe {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom. He went at {{the invitation}} of the London Judo Society (LJS), and was the first master to teach aikido in the UK. That year, he demonstrated aikido at the LJS and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Abbe came to experience two problems at the LJS: first, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> students there were more concerned with competition than his theories, and second, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> students did not treat him with the appropriate respect for someone of his rank and experience in the martial arts. According to the International Budo Council (IBC), he founded the IBC in 1955.|$|E
5|$|On March 20, 2009 the Pumpkins' website {{announced}} that Chamberlin {{was leaving the}} band. Chamberlin released a blog stating that he left as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band would not further his commitment to music.|$|E
5|$|Van Damme {{redesigned}} {{his final}} fight with Stallone, with the latter's approval. Van Damme {{was unhappy with}} the scripted fight, which had his character running away and only a brief confrontation between the pair. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> audience wanted a longer fight scene between the two actors.|$|E
60|$|Giles did not {{contradict}} him, though <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gentleman was wrong.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two waiters {{exchanged}} glances. He {{looked at}} them,--a mistake again--and got hotter.|$|R
60|$|The Adjutant's {{expression}} puzzled him. <b>He</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{man was not}} unfriendly, and now {{he looked}} disappointed.|$|R
5|$|Cheney's {{views on}} NATO {{reflected}} his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social {{development in the}} former Eastern Bloc countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} Akitoshi Kawazu {{was pleased}} by Famitsus rating but {{admitted that he}} thought the game was not perfect; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> storyline did not meet some fans' expectations. Kawazu expressed his frustration and regrets regarding the storyline, citing creative differences between the PlayOnline and Final Fantasy Tactics members of the development team.|$|E
5|$|Jaz Rignall of USgamer {{revisited}} Titanfall in late 2015 {{and found}} the game still worthy of its original praise, though he noted that its technical details—namely graphics and framerate—showed some age. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game's content issues, apart from the light campaign, were resolved by the free additional maps. Overall, Rignall said that Titanfall {{had been replaced by}} newer shooter games.|$|E
5000|$|The king {{went on to}} say <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{strongly}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Commons {{should not}} foster dissension upon him and: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so," [...] and Roger sighed again. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> {{mine was}} not found, matters would look pretty blue {{at home for}} all concerned.|$|R
60|$|Blood {{contained}} {{himself with}} difficulty. One of these fine days, <b>he</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>that</b> for <b>the</b> sake of humanity he must slit the comb of this supercilious, arrogant cockerel.|$|R
5|$|On November 23, 2004, Downey {{released}} his debut musical album, The Futurist, on Sony Classical, {{for which he}} designed the cover art and designed the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio. The album received mixed reviews, but Downey stated in 2006 that he probably will not do another album, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> energy he put into doing the album was not compensated.|$|E
5|$|A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, {{attended}} the open cabildo but, {{in a letter}} to the priest Julián S. de Agüero, said that he had some doubts which were shared by other people close to him. He feared that, no matter which party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it as a result of the aforementioned manipulation of the guest list.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro had {{significant}} input into {{certain parts of}} the film; for example, he suggested a simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut a scene in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.|$|E
60|$|Lisle did {{not reply}} to this. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> had <b>the</b> grim choice been imposed upon his companion, the man would have taken the course he had indicated.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that,</b> given <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} of higher education, {{there were many}} fields in which deaf people could excel. He published many articles on {{the education of the}} deaf.|$|R
60|$|As soon as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sky was {{brightening}} {{to remain}} so, Matt untied Billy, and harnessed {{him to the}} wagon once more.|$|R
5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially hesitant {{to accept the}} offer as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> audience {{would not want to}} see him as the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, he decided to take up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his complexion and nativity.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{started the}} 1967 season with Columbus. He {{believed}} {{that he was not}} on the major league club because the Pirates already had a number of African American players; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team did not want to alienate white fans. Ellis was sent down to the Macon Peaches of the Southern League, which Ellis believed was due to the length of his hair. Ellis said that he was promoted back to Columbus after shaving his head. He had a 2–0 win-loss record with Macon and a 5–7 record with Columbus.|$|E
5|$|From the beginning, Welensky was {{involved}} {{in the creation of the}} Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. He had earlier wanted an amalgamation of Northern and Southern Rhodesia with a constitution similar to that of Southern Rhodesia (that had granted responsible government to the white Rhodesians). After the British Government rejected this idea, he set about the creation of a federation, and against his judgement, the small colony of Nyasaland was included. His main wish for amalgamation, and later federation, was primarily so the complementary economic strengths of the Rhodesias could be put to best use. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> colonies were missing out on the post-war economic boom.|$|E
6000|$|Vereker {{thought a}} moment, but wasn't so disconcerted as I had feared: <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> harm was done it only served him right. [...] "It doesn't matter--don't worry." ...|$|R
60|$|Davy at once complied, {{and related}} all <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reader already knows, in a deep, serious tone of voice, for <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> captain <b>he</b> had a {{sympathetic}} listener.|$|R

5|$|Historian Wilhelm Levison, {{writing in}} 1946, was sceptical about the {{authenticity}} of this charter. In particular, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two separate addresses were incongruous and suggested that the first address, occurring before the preamble, may have been inserted by someone familiar with Bede to echo Eadbald's future conversion (see below). A more recent and more positive appraisal by John Morris argues that the charter and its witness list are authentic because it incorporates titles and phraseology that {{had fallen out of}} use by 800.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Duncan Wood, the BBC's Head of Comedy, {{watched a}} comedy on {{television}} called The Misfit. Impressed by writer Roy Clarke's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom, Wood offered Clarke {{the opportunity to}} write a sitcom. Clarke nearly turned the job down as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents {{in the prime of}} their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Peter Mandelson was {{appointed}} as the Labour Party's director of communication; previously, {{he had worked}} in television broadcasting. He helped the party become increasingly effective at communication and more concerned with its media image, especially with non-partisans. Mandelson headed the Campaigns and Communications Directorate, established in 1985, and initiated the Shadow Communications Agency. He oversaw Labour's relationship with the media and believed {{in the importance of}} the agenda-setting role of the press. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> agenda of the press (broadsheets in particular) would influence important political broadcasters. In government, Mandelson {{was appointed}} minister without portfolio to co-ordinate the various government departments. In 1998, accused of financial impropriety, he resigned as a cabinet minister.|$|E
60|$|At any rate, now <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> {{satisfied}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{child was}} safe, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Leridans were impervious to threats or bribes which might land {{them on the}} guillotine.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a relief}} to him to edge his way quietly into another group of guests where <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> talk would be of quite another kind.|$|R
60|$|The captain spoke animatedly, for <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that,</b> with <b>the</b> {{prospect}} of a long dark winter before them, it was of <b>the</b> greatest importance <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spirits of the men should be kept up.|$|R
5|$|In early 1934, Hitler {{and other}} Nazi leaders became {{concerned}} that Röhm was planning a coup d'état. Röhm had socialist and populist views, {{and believed that}} the real revolution had not yet begun. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> SA—now numbering some three million men, far dwarfing the army—should become the sole arms-bearing corps of the state, and that the army should be absorbed into the SA under his leadership. Röhm lobbied Hitler to appoint him Minister of Defence, a position held by conservative General Werner von Blomberg.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil was {{developed}} {{over the course of}} one year and two months as part of an exclusivity deal between Capcom and Nintendo. It was directed by Shinji Mikami, who also designed and directed the original Resident Evil. Mikami decided to produce a remake because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original had not aged well enough and that the GameCube's capabilities could bring it closer to his original vision. The game retains the same graphical presentation, with 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds. However, the quality of the graphics was vastly improved. The remake also features new gameplay mechanics, revised puzzles, additional explorable areas, a revised script, and new story details including an entire subplot cut from the original game.|$|E
5|$|Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' {{president}} of basketball operations, {{stated in the}} final Vancouver season {{that the company was}} losing US$40million per season. These numbers were questioned by Richard Peddie, CEO of the Raptors, as the Grizzlies had a salary cap of US$48million. Retrospectively, Heisley stated that he lost US$87million on owning the Grizzlies, although that included a US$30million relocation fee to the NBA. Versace stated that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team did not get sufficient support from the business community. Colin Jones, University of Victoria professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team was losing so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. He also noted that the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.|$|E
60|$|Oh! None. How had {{he struck}} Nedda? And Felix {{looked at his}} little {{daughter}} with a certain humble curiosity. <b>He</b> always <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young instinctively knew {{so much more than}} he did.|$|R
60|$|The {{telephone}} rang off. Tommy put back the receiver {{with a sigh}} of relief. His opinion of Julius's power of hustling was high. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> instinctively <b>that</b> <b>the</b> American would arrive in time.|$|R
50|$|Huang {{initially}} {{supported the}} creation of the Republic of China under Yuan Shikai's leadership. However, the new government became a great disappointment to Huang. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> despite <b>the</b> Progressive Party's rhetoric it was still a corrupt organization.|$|R
