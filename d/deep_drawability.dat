The remainder are indistinguishable from the polycrystalline mass, which is mostly of γ orientations.

This α recrystallization deteriorates the <b>deep</b> <b>drawability</b> of IF steel and since the process requires deformation banding a natural explanation of the optimum rolling reduction for good drawability is provided.

Findings: The paper shows variation in the blankholding force required {{for the elimination of}} wrinkling and thelimiting drawing ratio with sheet thickness. The blankholding force required for the elimination of wrinklingincreased rapidly as the sheet thickness decreased.

40|$|Within each {{columnar}} grain of a metallic film, {{the resistance to}} dislocation glide varies in function of {{the orientation of the}} slip plane with regard to the grain long axis. Plastic slip is impeded across grain boundaries and this contributes to the anisotropy of the overall mechanical response. A simplified (Taylor-type) crystal plasticity model is proposed that accounts for such effect of grain shape on the slip system selection. Assuming that dislocation density gradients are normal to the grain boundaries, backstresses developed at the onset of plasticity are estimated based on two definitions of the effective grain boundary spacing "seen" by individual slip systems. The first one reduces to the mean area-to-perimeter ratio of cross-sections of the grain cut parallel to the slip plane. Closed-form expressions of the average backstresses developed inside grains with spheroidal shapes are introduced in the crystal hardening law.

It is often observed that the forming conditions remaining unchanged, sheets having similar tensile properties do not always show similar drawability in press working. It was therefore thought that strain and strain path dependent change in the normal anisotropy of two sheets could {{hold the key to}} this behaviour. Hence studies were undertaken to ascertain as to whether such a strain path dependent change in the anisotropy does occur. While in the literature, strain dependent change in anisotropy has been investigated, dependence on the strain path has not been reported. Studies on the strain dependent variation in texture of non-ferrous materials (Al alloys and brass in particular) have been widely, reported. Literature on the strain and strain path dependence of texture and the anisotropy of steel sheet is not easily available. An experimental program was therefore undertaken to stretch the sheet in-plane to different strain levels for each of the five strain paths considered. Two strain paths characterised the negative minor strain and two characterised biaxial tension. The fifth one was close to plane strain. Special tooling with a 200 nun diameter flat (but relieved) bottom punch was fabricated. Specimens for R-value, texture and Modul-(r) over bar measurements were all cut from the flat, in-plane stretched (punch bottom) region of the sheet. Results indicated significant dependence of the R-value and texture on the strain and strain path. The R-values were found to decrease with increasing strain in all the three methods of testing. The rate of decrease was found to be strain path dependent. The inferences from the mechanical measurements of R-value based on the ASTM procedure and those predicted from texture measurements were in excellent agreement. Thus texture studies throw light on macroscopic mechanical behaviour (strain and strain path dependent variation in anisotropy). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In the {{automotive}} industry, {{more and more}} it is compulsory to develop new grades of stainless steels, such as high resistant Martensitic Stainless Steels (MA-SS) and Ferritic Stainless Steels (FSS) in order to realise certain or many complex deep drawn pieces. For these grades, resistance spot welding (RSW) is the most widespread process used largely for {{many parts of the}} car body in {{the automotive}} industry. This paper aims to characterise mechanical behaviour (toughness) of the different steel grades under dynamic test conditions. Design/methodology/approach: A special crash test device is used in different temperatures and the simulated crash tests are performed at a constant speed of 5. 52 m/s. Findings: The specimen is submitted to impact tensile test at different temperatures. According to testing temperature, fracture mode varies: At low temperatures, brittle fracture occurs: due to stress concentration, fracture always occurs in the notched section. At high temperatures, the specimen fails by ductile fracture. Toughness of the steel sheets (base metals, BM or welded parts) is well compared at different materials and test conditions. Research limitations/implications: Evaluation of welded thin sheets submitted to the dynamic loading in order to correlate in real service conditions in order to realize a useful correlation between the transition temperature and <b>deep</b> <b>drawability</b> can be used for evaluating of the welding conditions and also of the material characteristics. For detail study, this type of the test needs a standard formulation. Practical implications: This is a new conception of specimen and of the impact/crash machine. It is widely used in automotive industry for practical and economic reason to give rapid answers to designer and also steel makers for ranking the materials. Originality/value: New developed test called impact crash test for evaluating the toughness of thin welded joints (tailored blanks) / mechanical assemblies in high formability steel sheets for stamping submitted to dynamic loads such as experienced in real crash tests...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} small strain {{deformation}} behaviors of IF steels were studied. The role of solute phosphorus in affecting the small strain yielding behavior {{was investigated in}} two IF steels containing 20 ppm and 600 ppm bulk P levels. The role of crystallographic texture in affecting the small strain unloading or springback behavior was theoretically modeled to identify those textures which would impart minimum variability in springback of IF steel sheets. The addition of solute P brings about solid solution strengthening, the magnitude of which {{was determined to be}} 2. 38 MPa/ 0. 01 wt % P. The segregation of solute P to ferrite grain boundaries brings about extensive grain boundary hardening (GBH), which results in a substantial increase in the Hall-Petch slope, ky. Based upon the results from Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), tensile testing and hardness measurements, the increase in the Hall-Petch slope due to phosphorus segregation is quantified to be ~ 18. 6 MPa. ƒÝm 1 / 2 /at% P segregated. Grain boundary hardening is postulated to be caused by a combination of dislocation forest hardening and the pinning of these grain boundary dislocations by segregated solute P. Additionally, the role of FeTiP and FeTiNbP precipitates in affecting the strength of IF steels has been studied in Ti-bearing and (Ti+Nb) -bearing IF steels. The presence of large volume fractions of grain boundary phosphides results in a decrease in the strength due to scavenging of solute P at the grain boundaries. Theoretical modeling proved that gamma-fiber texture components exhibit isotropic springback behavior in the plane of the sheet on account of their high in-plane elastic isotropy, whereas, alpha and epsilon fiber components exhibit highly anisotropic springback behavior in plane strain bending applications. FEM modeling in draw-bend test applications shows that sheet steels with high elastic moduli and low yield strengths along the axis of the draw-bend test specimen exhibit minimum springback. Thus, the presence of high volume fractions of gamma fiber components in IF steel sheets provides excellent <b>deep</b> <b>drawability</b> as well as isotropic in-plane springback behavior...|$|E
40|$|Nondestructive {{characterization}} (NDC) {{of materials}} is a technology of increasing application by industrial users for process {{monitoring and control}} {{as well as in}} predictive maintenance procedures integrated in plant lifetime management systems. The main reason for this fact in materials processing is the need for a better process understanding and mastering in order to produce quality according to a zero-defect-principle and the objective to reduce non-conformities compared with a given quality specification. This means: Integration of NDC by use of intelligent sensors into monitoring and control systems to predict mechanic properties and to detect and document their discontinuities. For lifetime management of components in plants NDC is asked to support lifetime prediction procedures which have to be observed if lifetime extension is an objective to reduce costs. NDC-technology, which {{in the last two decades}} was mainly pushed by research and development in different national and international programs now is matured for a wider range of applications. Micro-magnetic techniques have a special advantage to be applied for the mentioned objectives, because micro-magnetic intrinsic properties and mechanic properties are influenced by the same microstructure parameters and their changes as well as in volume fraction as well as in morphology and distribution during material processing and material degradation procedures. Furthermore they are sensitive for load-induced and residual stresses. However, their application is restricted to ferromagnetic materials and/or ferromagnetic material phases. The contribution will introduce in the information content of the different techniques which contribute with redundancy and diversity to NDC of microstructures by discussing examples of process integration of NDE in steel industry, i. e. the online determination of yield strength and <b>deep</b> <b>drawability</b> parameters of cold rolled steel strips in a hot dip galvanizing line. The special emphasis of the contribution is to give characteristic examples which illuminate mainly the gain in economical benefit. Due to the fact that in all European countries the construction of new nuclear power plants has been radically decreased since the 1970 'ies, the nuclear power plants being currently in operation in European countries have reached at least the half of their design lifetime. The continuation of the operation of aging nuclear power plants in Europe is an economical solution for energy production but the safety aspects of aging structures are getting even more importance in the future. First NDC-approaches are discussed, documenting the micro-magnetic ability for fatigue (LCF and HCF) monitoring, detection and characterization of toughness reduction and embrittlement...|$|E
