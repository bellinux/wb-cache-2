Lindsey is remembered as the coach who resigned quietly after failing to produce a winning team. Lindsey's record (19-19-6) was not that shabby, however. His players were small in size and number and the schedules they faced were too difficult for such a small squad. Lindsey's 1929 Sooners team defeated Nebraska, 20-7, marking the worst defeat the Cornhuskers saw <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> Six team in two decades.

500|$|Overall, {{reviews of}} the film were highly positive. Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman awarded the film an [...] "A" [...] grade, hailing the film as a [...] "procedural thriller for the {{information}} age" [...] that [...] "spins your head in a new way, luring you into a vortex and then deeper still." [...] Nathan Lee in his review for The Village Voice wrote that director Fincher's [...] "very lack of pretense, coupled with a determination to get the facts down with maximum economy and objectivity, gives Zodiac its hard, bright integrity. As a crime saga, newspaper drama, and period piece, it works just fine. As an allegory {{of life in the}} information age, it blew my mind." [...] Todd McCarthy's review in Variety praised the film's [...] "almost unerringly accurate evocation of the workaday San Francisco of 35â€“40 years ago. Forget the distorted emphasis on hippies and flower-power that many such films indulge in; this is the city as it was experienced by most people who lived and worked there." [...] David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek magazine, wrote, [...] "Zodiac is meticulously crafted â€“ Harris Savides's state-of-the-art digital cinematography has a richness indistinguishable from film â€“ and it runs almost two hours and 40 minutes. Still, the movie holds you in its grip from start to finish. Fincher boldly (and some may think perversely) withholds the emotional and forensic payoff we're conditioned to expect <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> studio movie." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film 4 stars out of a possible 4, writing: [...] "The film is a police procedural crossed with a newspaper movie, but free of most of the cliches of either. Its most impressive accomplishment is to gather a bewildering labyrinth of facts and suspicions over a period of years, and make the journey through this maze frightening and suspenseful." [...] Ebert also praised the casting (critical in an ensemble film) and, as a longtime columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times, asserted Zodiac was [...] "intriguing in its accuracy" [...] in showing the operation of a major newspaper.|$|E
500|$|Australia won the toss. The match {{began in}} damp conditions, {{and before the}} pitch began to dry, at which point it would become {{extremely}} difficult for batting, the Australian opening batsmen scored 135 in 90 minutes; Australia's total reached 173 for one wicket at lunch, and Victor Trumper scored a century in that time. MacLaren was subsequently criticised for allowing Australia to score so quickly, but claimed that his carefully planned strategy was rendered obsolete when Trumper began to strike {{the ball out of}} the ground. MacLaren commented: [...] "I couldn't very well have had a man fielding in the bloody practice ground, now could I?" [...] The bowlers recovered the situation to some extent, and following a century from Jackson, England trailed by 37 runs after the first innings. In the second innings, Australia collapsed to the England bowlers, but Tate dropped a crucial catch while stationed by MacLaren {{at the edge of the}} field. MacLaren also received criticism for this, as Tate was unaccustomed to fielding on the boundary. Gibson notes that MacLaren [...] "later spent much breath defending himself on this point"; although it is not clear how Tate came to be movedâ€”a later interpretation is that MacLaren moved Tate there rather than ask an amateur player to cross the field for a few deliveriesâ€”most commentators agree that this was the turning point of the match. England were left needing 124 runs to win. MacLaren opened the batting, having batted at number four in the first innings, and tried to score quickly, but was caught <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hit. According to Gibson, he returned to the dressing room in fury, throwing his bat across the room and saying that he had [...] "thrown away the match and the bloody rubber [...] ". Gibson suggests that the implication that only MacLaren could have guided England to victory must have had a demoralising effect on the remaining batsmen, and speculates that he felt guilty over the composition of a team that looked likely to lose. Gibson comments: [...] "This does not say much for MacLaren as a captain. Indeed, it has always seemed to me a shocking performance, from the choice of the team to the chuck of the bat." [...] Wickets continued to fall and Tate, the last batsman, was bowled when England needed four runs to win.|$|E
