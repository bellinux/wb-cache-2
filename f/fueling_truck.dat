50|$|Aircraft refuelers can {{be either}} a {{self-contained}} <b>fuel</b> <b>truck,</b> or a hydrant <b>truck</b> or cart. <b>Fuel</b> <b>trucks</b> are self-contained, typically containing up to 10,000 US gallons of fuel and have their own pumps, filters, hoses, and other equipment. A hydrant cart or truck hooks into a central pipeline network and provides fuel to the aircraft. There is a significant advantage with hydrant systems when compared to <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks,</b> as <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks</b> must be periodically replenished.|$|R
40|$|The Alternative Motor Fuel Act of 1988 {{requires}} the U. S. Department of Energy to demonstrate and evaluate alternative fuels usage in the United States. DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory is conducting the Alternative <b>Fuel</b> <b>Truck</b> Evaluation Project to compare alternative fuel and diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks.</b> Information for the comparison comes from data {{collected on the}} operational, maintenance, performance, and emissions characteristics of alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks</b> being used in vehicle fleets and comparable diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks</b> servings as controls within the same fleets. This report highlights the start-up experience and presents the lessons learned from a project that operated a fleet of liquefied natural gas (LNG) refuse haulers in Washington, Pennsylvania...|$|R

For example, the Clean Air Action Plan being {{implemented by the}} Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach includes a Clean Truck Program to introduce newer and/or alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks</b> for drayage.|$|R

50|$|As a {{landlocked}} nation, Nepal imports {{all of its}} petroleum {{supplies from}} India. Roughly 300 <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks</b> enter from India on a normal day, but this has dwindled to a sporadic passage of 5-10 <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks</b> daily {{since the start of}} the crisis, though shipments of perishables like fruits and vegetables have generally been allowed to pass.Moreover, India had also been stopping some Nepalese trucks at the Kolkata harbour. The blockade choked imports of not only petroleum, but also medicines and earthquake relief material.|$|R
50|$|Henderson Field {{was also}} {{very close to the}} thinly-held lines of the U.S. First Marine Division, so {{security}} was always a concern. There were no <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks,</b> aircraft hangars, or repair buildings. Damaged aircraft were cannibalized for spare parts, and with no bomb hoists, all aircraft munitions had to be hand-loaded onto the warplanes. Fuel, always critically low, had to be hand pumped out of 55 gallon drums. Even after the arrival of <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks,</b> aviation gasoline still had to be hand-pumped into the trucks.|$|R

50|$|In practice, {{the supply}} {{vehicles}} would mainly move by road {{and meet with}} the tanks at predetermined rendez-vous points. Refuelling was relatively quick as the Vulcano could theoretically pump 565 litres in fifteen minutes. To completely refill a heavy tank would normally take about forty to sixty minutes. The trailer fuel reservoirs could themselves be replenished by the company <b>fuel</b> <b>truck</b> carrying 3600 litres of petrol. The company supplies could again be restocked from battalion stocks, moved by trucks loaded with fifty litre fuel drums. This method of distribution ensured a sufficient fuel supply on the tactical level, but was too cumbersome for strategic movements: if large distances had to be covered on track, the tanks would be directly refuelled from <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{goal of the}} program is to install underground fuel hydrants at airports. These would eliminate the need for <b>fuel</b> <b>trucks,</b> an important source of mobile emissions. The Voluntary Airport Low Emission Program was established under the Vision 100 Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act of 2003.|$|R

5000|$|After {{leaving the}} boneyard, guests {{were told that}} they would be {{entering}} a [...] "live" [...] movie set while the cast was on break. The tram would then move into an area known as Catastrophe Canyon, a rocky area with a <b>fuel</b> <b>truck</b> and water tanks inside of it. While the tram was stopped, filming starts suddenly. An earthquake shakes the tram and causes the <b>fuel</b> <b>truck</b> to explode, sending a fire ball into the air. Then a flood of water comes rushing down from the canyon and from above the tram. When the earthquake subsides and the water stops, the set would then begin to reset for the next tram and the host on the tram tells guests how it was done as the tram travels behind the set to show the back of the production.|$|R
