5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Clydesdale blood {{was added to}} the Irish <b>draught</b> breed in an attempt to improve and reinvigorate that declining breed. However, these efforts were not seen as successful, as Irish <b>Draught</b> breeders thought the Clydesdale blood made their horses coarser and prone to lower leg defaults. The Clydesdale was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} Gypsy Vanner horse, developed in Great Britain. The Clydesdale, along with other <b>draught</b> breeds, was also used to create the Australian <b>Draught</b> Horse. In the early 20th century, they were often crossed with Dales ponies, creating mid-sized <b>draught</b> horses useful for pulling commercial wagons and military artillery.|$|E

5|$|On 6 November, Thunderer {{was sold}} for scrap to Messrs, Hughes, Bolckow & Co. for £66,150. She was too deep in <b>draught</b> to enter their {{scrapyard}} in Blyth {{and so was}} partially stripped down at Rosyth. Even so, she grounded at the Blyth harbour entrance on 24 December. After she was refloated on 30 December, {{she went back to}} Rosyth to be further lightened, as her <b>draught</b> was still too deep to allow her to enter Blyth. She was towed from Rosyth on 12 April 1927 and reached Blyth two days later to finish demolition.|$|E
5|$|The Clydesdale is a {{breed of}} <b>draught</b> horse named for and {{derived from the}} farm horses of Clydesdale, a county in Scotland. Although {{originally}} {{one of the smaller}} breeds of <b>draught</b> horses, it is now a tall breed. Often bay in color, they show significant white markings due to the presence of sabino genetics. The breed was originally used for agriculture and haulage, and is still used for <b>draught</b> purposes today. The Budweiser Clydesdales {{are some of the most}} famous Clydesdales, and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British Household Cavalry. They have also been used to create and improve other breeds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Draught</b> beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport <b>draught</b> beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E

5|$|In 1868, the Scottish {{shipbuilder}} John Elder {{published an}} article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area {{that needed to be}} protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a shallower <b>draught</b> and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its <b>draught.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced <b>draught,</b> which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much <b>draught</b> and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Large, heavy horses, {{weighing}} from , {{the ancestors}} of today's <b>draught</b> horses, were used, particularly in Europe, from the Middle Ages onward. They pulled heavy loads like supply wagons and were disposed to remain calm in battle. Some historians believe they may have carried the heaviest-armoured knights of the European Late Middle Ages, though others dispute this claim, indicating that the destrier, or knight's battle horse, was a medium-weight animal. It is also disputed whether the destrier class included <b>draught</b> animals or not. Breeds at the smaller end of the heavyweight category may have included {{the ancestors of}} the Percheron, agile for their size and physically able to manoeuvre in battle.|$|E

5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow <b>draught</b> was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the launch}} ceremony, the {{builders}} {{had planned to}} have Great Britain towed to the Thames for her final fitting out. Unfortunately, the harbour authorities had failed {{to carry out the}} necessary modifications to their facilities in a timely manner.

5|$|From the 14th to the 16thcentury, Finnish {{horses were}} {{exported}} to Russian and Germany in such quantities that eventually {{restrictions on the}} number of exports were set. The Finnish horses exported to Russia in early 19thcentury influenced the development of the Vyatka horse. In the 19thcentury and early 20thcentury, horses of Finnish origin were used in creating many Baltic and Russian agricultural <b>draught</b> breeds, such as the Tori Horse and the Lithuanian <b>Draught.</b> In most cases, these breeds were developed by crossbreeding Finnish horses on small local horses, thus increasing size. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Finnhorse was also used in the breeding of the Estonian horse. The heavy Mezen horse was bred with both the Finnhorse and the Estonian Horse, until its stud book was closed in the 1950s. Traces of Finnhorse influence is found in other Soviet and Russian work horse breeds, in the mid-20thcentury, Finland exported 15,000 horses to Soviet Russia as part of its war indemnity. In the 1960s and 1970s, pony-sized Finnhorses were also used to improve quality and broaden the gene pool of the Norwegian Nordlandshest, which had become highly inbred by the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (FES) is a stout {{produced}} by the Guinness Brewery, an Irish brewing company owned by Diageo, a drinks multinational.

The extra hops were intended as a natural preservative for the long journeys the beer would take by ship.|$|E
