In 1992, when the IRS starting tracking {{the people who make}} the most money, the 400th richest person in America made $24 million. Then In 2007, the 400th richest human produced $138 million (or $87 million, inflation-adjusted). These riches have come from capital gain, and the rich keep making more money. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>question</b> and debate in politics whether or not the rich need more tax cuts or need to pay more taxes.|$|E

5000|$|Since the {{introduction}} of a public compulsory school system for children of both sexes in 1842, education for females had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>question</b> of debate for politicians as well as in intellectual circles: while the new school system allowed every male the opportunity to go from compulsory education to secondary education and finally university, the public school system were closed for females after 5th grade. Except for private teachers, only two educational institutions were open to females after puberty: the free pauper schools, which taught poor girls professions, and the girls' schools for students from the middle and upper classes. These existing girls schools were normally more or less equivalents to finishing schools, with the goal to make the student a [...] "lady", and they were forcefully criticized for their shallow and [...] "useless" [...] education. In 1842, only five girls' schools offered a more serious academic education: Wallinska skolan in Stockholm, Askersunds flickskola in Askersund, och Fruntimmersföreningens flickskola, Kjellbergska flickskolan and Societetsskolan.|$|R

25|$|The {{constitution}} was further amended in 2005, creating a two-vote electoral system, with single member plurality seats and proportional representative seats, and abolishing the National Assembly, transferring {{most of its}} former powers to the Legislative Yuan, and leaving further amendment voting to public referendums. The issue of formally declaring the independence of Taiwan <b>is</b> also <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> constitutional <b>question.</b> Arms purchases from the United States <b>are</b> still <b>a</b> controversial political question, with the Pan-Green Coalition camp favoring the purchase, and the Pan-Blue Coalition opposing it.|$|R
5000|$|But {{even more}} than this, as {{conceived}} by its founder, Fernand Oury, Institutional Pedagogy <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> calling into <b>question</b> of the institutional context itself. Thus the classroom <b>is</b> never <b>a</b> presupposed and static setting. The movement of Institutional Pedagody is thus in direct opposition to the prevailing trends of education prior to the late 1960s, almost all of which tended to homogenize socio-cultural differences amongst learners, psycho-social factors in learning and most important {{the presence of the}} [...] "unconscious" [...] in the classroom itself.|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the regular}} season, <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>question</b> {{hanging over the}} Virginia Tech Hokies {{football}} team was whether or not star quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year at the school. The National Football League requires that players be {{at least three years}} out of high school before they are eligible for the NFL Draft. Vick, who had not played during his freshman year at the school, would be three years out of high school in the spring following the Gator Bowl.|$|R
40|$|Violence {{against women}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> major global public health issue, and {{experiencing}} violence has substantial {{consequences for the}} lives of abused women. This study aims to illustrate experiences of abuse and its influence on mental ill health among women seeking general psychiatric care. Ten women seeking general psychiatric care in southern Sweden participated in a qualitative interview study. Content analysis resulted in four categories: Living in fear that persistently influences the substance of life, living {{with the sense of}} being worthless, living with <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>question</b> about who you are and living between hope and despair. The theme evolving from the analysis was: Being vulnerable and without protection in a frightful reality that limits one’s possibilities of living and being the person one wishes to be. The results showed that the women described their mental ill health {{not only in terms of}} depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation and self-harm, but also in relation to feelings of hope and despair, fear, worthlessness and living with <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>question</b> about who they are. The abuse reduces freedom of action, and leads to feelings of insecurity, of not having any boundaries, isolation, and self-contempt and a need to escape. This study provides knowledge of abused women self-reported mental ill health in relation to abuse...|$|R
5000|$|The Softwire {{exists on}} two planes: simple, adventurous tales {{of a young}} boy {{discovering}} his purpose in life; and complex, compelling renditions of corruption and oppression, and their effect upon the human spirit. The overriding premise behind the series is the maturation of Johnny T as he struggles to overcome an abusive domination which pushes him to fulfill his destiny as a leader, and as a guardian. Positive themes which are explored include: compassion, perseverance, fear, family, kindness, cruelty, self-reliance and the power of positivism. <b>A</b> <b>constant</b> <b>question</b> posed <b>is</b> whether <b>a</b> person can retain his sense of ethics when consistently exposed to situations of desperate adversity.|$|R

By contrast, the Markan Jesus has no ‘inescapably divine’ demeanour. His unassuming presence, his hurried walk and his interactions with people of low public standing and honour place <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>question</b> markover his identity. Paradoxically, his purposeful walk in obscurity, which ends on the cross, reveals his true character as the suffering Son of God who ransoms his life for many. The risen Jesus, whose divine nature Mark does not express {{in terms of a}} glorified body, continues his enigmatic walk before his disciples en route to Galilee. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{observations}} {{indicate that the}} universe is dominated by dark energy with negative pressure, one possibility for which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cosmological <b>constant.</b> If the dark energy <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cosmological <b>constant,</b> <b>a</b> fundamental <b>question</b> is: Why has it become relevant at so late an epoch, making today the only {{time in the history of}} the universe at which the cosmological constant is of order the ambient density. We explore an answer to this question drawing on ideas from unimodular gravity, which predicts fluctuations in the cosmological constant, and causal set theory, which predicts the magnitude of these fluctuations. The resulting ansatz yields a fluctuating cosmological ``constant'' which is always of order the ambient density. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, LaTe...|$|R
