5|$|Due to {{symptoms}} of low mood and energy, individuals with depression may {{be likely to}} have behaviors that are counter to good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts of caffeine during the day.

30|$|<b>For</b> <b>individual</b> credit, Desai et al. 1996 used a {{multi-layer}} perceptron neural network (i.e., {{a mixture of}} expert neural networks) <b>for</b> <b>individual</b> credit and found that neural network models outperform linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression models. Davis et al. 1992 studied the decision accuracy of decision trees and a {{multi-layer perceptron}} neural network <b>for</b> <b>individual</b> credit. The authors concluded that a comparable level of decision accuracy was obtained with the decision trees and the multi-layer perceptron neural network methods. Piramuthu 1999 employed a multi-layer perceptron neural network and a neural-fuzzy model to predict credit scoring <b>for</b> <b>individual</b> credit and indicated that neural networks obtain superior results. West 2000 used five neural network models: multi-layer perceptron, mixture-of-experts, radial basis function, learning vector quantization, and fuzzy adaptive resonance <b>for</b> <b>individual</b> credit. The author demonstrated that both the mixture-of–experts and radial basis function neural network models were superior to other models, and logistic regression was the most accurate of the traditional methods. Baesens et al. 2003 a clarified the neural network decisions by explanatory rules that capture the learned knowledge embedded in the networks <b>for</b> <b>individual</b> credit, and concluded that neural network rule extraction and decision tables were powerful management tools to build advanced and userfriendly decision-support systems for credit-risk evaluation. Lee et al. 2006 argued that the {{classification and regression tree}} (CART) and multi-variate adaptive regression splines (MARS) <b>for</b> <b>individual</b> credit outperformed ANNs.|$|R

Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when reporting a test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of each test publisher when reporting IQ score ranges.|$|E

If credit incentives do not change, opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem.
