500|$|When Lawrence {{was first}} told he should meet Mars he was {{reluctant}} to do so since he did not even have money for bus fare. Keith Harris, drummer for The Black Eyed Peas, told him: [...] "Whatever it costs you to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> I'll reimburse you." [...] Lawrence responded: [...] "Just give me five dollars back for the bus." [...] The pair began collaborating, writing songs for Mars, but they received many rejections from labels. On the verge of giving up, they received a call from Brandon Creed, who was looking for songs for a reunited Menudo. He liked their song [...] "Lost", which was written for Mars. The duo did not want to give the song away, but when they were offered $20,000 for it they agreed. The sale of this song allowed them to continue working, and Mars and Lawrence decided that they would write and produce songs together for other artists. Eventually, Creed became Mars' manager for nine years.|$|E

Dershowitz told him that he would not attend if it was a [...] "victory party", and von Bülow assured him that it was only a dinner for [...] "several {{interesting}} friends". Norman Mailer attended the dinner where, among other things, Dershowitz explained why the evidence pointed to von Bulow's innocence. As Dershowitz recounted, Mailer grabbed his wife's arm and said: [...] "Let's <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> I think this guy is innocent. I {{thought we were going to}} be having dinner with a man who actually tried to kill his wife. This is boring." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{about the}} same. He can't evade what will come, you know, at any moment. He was up here the other day. Why, the {{pulsation}} was as plain--why, the entire arch of the aorta-- What! you <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>here?</b> Good-by." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I {{suppose there}} will be some ships along with troops soon," [...] Jim said. [...] "It would take them a {{fortnight}} or three weeks to get ready, and another fortnight to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> Perhaps they waited a week or so to see whether the Egyptians were going to cave in before they began to get ready; but at any rate there ought to be troops here in another fortnight." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That is so, Matteo, and {{for that}} reason, {{it is clear that}} it is we, not the sailors, who must cut through the planks above. There are no {{divisions}} in the forecastle, and it will be, therefore, absolutely impossible to cut through into it, without being perceived long before a hole is made of a sufficient size to enable us to <b>get</b> <b>out.</b> <b>Here</b> we may succeed better, for fortunately we know the exact plan of the cabins above us, and can choose a spot where we should not be likely to be noticed." ...|$|E

'At any rate, Dorothy,' {{the latter}} said, 'I must {{ask him to}} dinner; {{there will be no}} {{occasion}} for him to interfere farther in the matter, so far as I can see, and I should think that after your manner to him he will not be inclined to do so; still, it is impossible, after the pains he has taken in the matter, not to acquaint him with what has occurred here.

This land looked good to us. We cleared it, an' broke it, an' made the roads, an' built the cities. And there was plenty for everybody. And we went on fightin' for it. I had two uncles killed at Gettysburg. All of us was mixed up in that war. Listen to Saxon talk any time what her folks went through to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> an' get ranches, an' horses, an' cattle, an' everything. And they got 'em.
