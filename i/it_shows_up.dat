5|$|The unrooted {{cladogram}} to {{the right}} shows the relationship between various subgenera and classes {{as defined by the}} analysis of Rivadavia et al. in 2002. The monotypic section Meristocaulis {{was not included in the}} study, so its place in this system is unclear. More recent studies have placed this group near section Bryastrum, so it is placed there below. Also of note, the placement of the section Regiae in relation to Aldrovanda and Dionaea is uncertain. Since the section Drosera is polyphyletic, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> multiple times in the cladogram (*).|$|E

25|$|According to {{the history}} {{published}} by Omala Caldron on its website, the Daughters of Mokanna formed in 1919, in Rock Island, Illinois. This coincides with the secession of Amoo from Chicago and the founding of their own Supreme Caldron. They go one to describe how the ritual was decided upon and list the first four Daughters of Mokanna Caldrons – Amoo No. 1, Mohassan No. 2, Ankara, No. 3, and Zal No. 4. This would lead one to believe that Hapac was No. 5 as listed in the newspaper accounts. However, no account is given {{as to what happened}} to Koom Caldron No. 3, except that <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> as participating in the Daughters of Mokanna national Convention in 1922. What remains unclear is when the Illinois group officially dropped the Witches and became Daughters; this has to be somewhere between 1920 and 1922.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} aspects of the axiom of choice is the large number of places in mathematics that <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up.</b> Here are some statements that require the axiom of choice {{in the sense that they}} are not provable from ZF but are provable from ZFC (ZF plus AC). [...] Equivalently, these statements are true in all models of ZFC but false in some models of ZF.|$|E
2500|$|By 1516 he {{had given}} the {{portrait}} to Margaret of Austria, Habsburg Regent of the Netherlands, when <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> as the first item in an inventory of her paintings, made in her presence at Mechelen. [...] The item says (in French): [...] "a large picture which is called Hernoul le Fin {{with his wife in}} a chamber, which was given to Madame by Don Diego, whose arms are {{on the cover of the}} said picture; done by the painter Johannes." [...] A note in the margin says [...] "It is necessary to put on a lock to close it: which Madame has ordered to be done." [...] In a 1523–4 [...] Mechelen inventory, a similar description is given, although this time the name of the subject is given as [...] "Arnoult Fin".|$|E
2500|$|While unofficial, the Rally Squirrel {{became an}} {{unexpected}} phenomenon during the 2011 postseason. [...] Making its [...] "debut" [...] in Game 3 of the NLDS on Oct 4, a squirrel ran across home {{plate in the}} middle of a pitch from Roy Oswalt of the Phillies to the Cardinals' Skip Schumaker. [...] The Cardinals would win Game 4 and subsequently Game 5 (Oct. 7) in Philadelphia to advance to the NLCS, symbolizing the squirrel's [...] "role" [...] in the victory. [...] The squirrel was popularized as [...] "Buschie the Rally Squirrel" [...] As a tribute to the popularity of the squirrel, a small depiction of the Rally Squirrel is also included on the official World Series rings the team received. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> under the [...] "STL" [...] logo on the side of the ring.|$|E

2500|$|Polypropylene {{is liable}} to chain {{degradation}} from exposure to heat and UV radiation such as that present in sunlight. Oxidation usually occurs at the tertiary carbon atom present in every repeat unit. A free radical is formed here, and then reacts further with oxygen, followed by chain scission to yield aldehydes and carboxylic acids. In external applications, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> as a network of fine cracks and crazes that become deeper and more severe with time of exposure. For external applications, UV-absorbing additives must be used. Carbon black also provides some protection from UV attack. The polymer can also be oxidized at high temperatures, a common problem during molding operations. Anti-oxidants are normally added to prevent polymer degradation. [...] Microbial communities isolated from soil samples mixed with starch {{have been shown to}} be capable of degrading polypropylene.|$|E
2500|$|The {{consonant}} ÿ (...) is recently extinct, and was {{a distinct}} consonant from y (...) [...] It has changed into y or w (...) depending on the phonological environment, with w next to rounded vowels and labialized consonants, and y elsewhere. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> as a g occasionally in placenames derived from Tlingit during {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, as well as in some broad transcriptions by earlier anthropologists, e.g. [...] "Gan Gulihashee Hit" [...] for Ÿan Ÿuliháshi Hít [...] "Drifted Ashore House" [...] as recorded by Olson, today written Yan Wuliháshi Hít. Because the use of y versus w is predictable from context where it was originally a ÿ, this graph is used consistently in linguistic transcription, but not in ordinary writing. Note that this consonant has been erroneously referred to as [...] "gamma", confused with the similar [...] which is however the voiced velar fricative, not an approximant.|$|E
2500|$|In {{patients}} with a clinical suspicion for Tay–Sachs disease, with any age of onset, the initial testing involves an enzyme assay to measure the activity of hexosaminidase in serum, fibroblasts, or leukocytes. [...] Total hexosaminidase enzyme activity is decreased in individuals with Tay-Sachs as is the percentage of hexosaminidase A. [...] After confirmation of decreased enzyme activity in an individual, confirmation by molecular analysis can be pursued. [...] All {{patients with}} infantile onset Tay–Sachs disease have a [...] "cherry red" [...] macula in the retina, easily observable by a physician using an ophthalmoscope. This red spot is a retinal area that appears red because of gangliosides in the surrounding retinal ganglion cells. The choroidal circulation is showing through [...] "red" [...] in this foveal region where all retinal ganglion cells are pushed aside to increase visual acuity. Thus, this cherry-red spot is the only normal part of the retina; <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> {{in contrast to the}} rest of the retina. Microscopic analysis of the retinal neurons shows they are distended from excess ganglioside storage. Unlike other lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., Gaucher disease, Niemann–Pick disease, and Sandhoff disease), hepatosplenomegaly (liver and spleen enlargement) is not seen in Tay–Sachs.|$|E
50|$|The eclipse {{was visible}} in southeastern Australia which {{included}} New South Wales {{which included the}} modern southeast portion, most of present-day Victoria and present-day Australian Capital Territory, the time the southernmost part of southern Australia (now a state), at the time also called New Holland and the island of Tasmania, there <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> to 15% obscurity.

5000|$|The eclipse {{took place}} in Northern Antarctica and the Pacific within the 180th {{meridian}} and the International Date Line. In Antarctica, <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> to 1.3% obscuration of the sun, <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> to 2.3% obscuration in the Pacific offshore. The greatest eclipse was in the Atlantic off the shore of Antarctica some 25 miles (40 km) south of the Antarctic Circle at 66.8 S & 174.5 E at 11:58 (11:58 PM local time the same day). [...] As the moon moved towards the right on the Moon, {{in that part of}} Antarctica north of the South Pole at the 180th meridian, it was seen as it was moved towards the right as the axis spun at around the 66th parallel south.|$|R
2500|$|DAI is {{difficult}} to detect since it does not show up well on CT scans or with other macroscopic imaging techniques, though <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> microscopically. [...] However, there are characteristics typical of DAI {{that may or may}} not show up on a CT scan. [...] Diffuse injury has more microscopic injury than macroscopic injury and {{is difficult}} to detect with CT and MRI, but its presence can be inferred when small bleeds are visible in the corpus callosum or the cerebral cortex. [...] MRI is more useful than CT for detecting characteristics of diffuse axonal injury in the subacute and chronic time frames. [...] Newer studies such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging are able to demonstrate the degree of white matter fiber tract injury even when the standard MRI is negative. [...] Since axonal damage in DAI is largely a result of secondary biochemical cascades, it has a delayed onset, so a person with DAI who initially appears well may deteriorate later. [...] Thus injury is frequently more severe than is realized, and medical professionals should suspect DAI in any patients whose CT scans appear normal but who have symptoms like unconsciousness.|$|E
2500|$|But, Angus Batey from Yahoo! Music UK & Ireland graded {{the album}} seven stars {{out of ten}} commenting, [...] " [...] this is a cogent, compact and really quite good record, one that mixes upbeat, perhaps {{slightly}} clinical R with uber-ballads and occasional snatches of {{what appears to be}} an attempt at intimacy." [...] Craig Seymour ofAtlanta Journal and Constitution reviewed the album gave a favorable review stating, [...] "On Just Whitney, her first album since 1998, Houston comes off as everything she wasn't during her recent TV interview with Diane Sawyer: warm, lucid, open and sharp. Keysha Davis of BBC gave a favorable review commenting, [...] "With one of the exceptional voices in contemporary music, her latest album, aptly titled Just Whitney sees the diva return to her former glory with a combination of high-voltage ballads and smooth-liqueur R [...] Whitney's return to big ballads will hopefully ensure that this pop princess will be able to lead {{the rest of her life}} like a clichéd fairy tale - happily ever after." [...] Mike Bell from Jam! Showbiz, was also favorable in his review, saying [...] "Maybe because of everything that's happened in her past, maybe because of the sideshow, she has the ability to give the songs real feeling, real life." [...] In addition, he stated that her voice was in fine form, [...] "showcasing those incredible pipes that launched a thousand imitators." [...] He concluded by saying, [...] "And <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> all of those followers with recent releases ㅡ including Mariah Carey and Celine Dion ㅡ because not only does Houston have the lungs, but she has the soul." ...|$|E

It is a volcano cone thrust up out of deep sea, with a segment of the crater wall broken out. This gives sea {{entrance}} to the crater itself, and makes a fine sheltered harbour. And that's all. Nothing lives there. The outside and the inside of the crater are too steep. At one place, inside, is a patch of about a thousand coconut palms. And that's all, as I said, saving a few insects. No four-legged thing, even a rat, inhabits the place. And it's funny, most awful funny, with all those coconuts, not even a coconut crab. The only meat-food living was schools of mullet in the harbour--fattest, finest, biggest mullet I ever laid eyes on.|$|E

60|$|This {{night the}} woman of his belittling deprecations was {{thinking}} how great and good her husband was. But over them both there hung a deeper shade than the shade which Angel Clare perceived, namely, the shade of his own limitations. With all his attempted independence of judgement this advanced and well-meaning young man, a sample product of the last five-and-twenty years, was yet the slave to custom and conventionality when surprised back into his early teachings. No prophet had told him, {{and he was not}} prophet enough to tell himself, that essentially this young wife of his was as deserving of the praise of King Lemuel as any other woman endowed with the same dislike of evil, her moral value having to be reckoned not by achievement but by tendency. Moreover, the figure near at hand suffers on such occasion, because <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> its sorriness without shade; while vague figures afar off are honoured, in that their distance makes artistic virtues of their stains. In considering what Tess was not, he overlooked what she was, and forgot that the defective can be more than the entire.|$|E
