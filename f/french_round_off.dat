30|$|The <b>rounding</b> <b>off</b> of real numbers can {{be either}} {{deterministic}} or random. In deterministic, the highest real value for a virtual node is <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> to 1. In random algorithms, a random number is drawn {{and if this is}} lower than the value of the real variable, then the real value is <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> to 1.|$|R

30|$|Each of {{the four}} {{algorithms}} consists of three steps: node mapping, link mapping and definition of paths for transfer of the required images. For each step two procedures defines: how to round the real values off to binary ones and when such <b>rounding</b> <b>off</b> should take place. In node mapping, the first procedure defines which variable will be <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> to 1 since only one Xn,m,ican be set to 1 for each virtual node m. The second procedure determines whether or not all the other variables values should be <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> to 1. There are two options {{for each of these}} two procedures with their combinations defining the four different algorithms proposed.|$|R
40|$|In the capacitated {{version of}} the Divide and Conquer {{algorithm}} for lot sizing in multi-stage production/inventory problems, feasibility is often lost when the reorder intervals are <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> to powers of two. We propose a new algorithm for <b>rounding</b> <b>off</b> the reorder intervals which always produces a feasible policy. We {{have shown that the}} relative increase in cost that occurs when the intervals are <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> using this algorithm cannot exceed 44 %, and that for systems with a single capacity machine (including the ELSP), the cost increase cannot exceed 6 %. Computational experience with industrial data sets indicates that the algorithm performs very well. production planning, lot sizing: heuristics, capacity constraints...|$|R
