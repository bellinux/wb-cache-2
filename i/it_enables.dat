In this paper, we study the relationship of organizational ambidexterity and <b>IT</b> <b>enabled</b> agility. Based on a case study with a German car manufacturer we find that (1) entrepreneurial agility impedes exploitative concepts, (2) adaptive agility impedes exploratory concepts and (3) ambidextrous organizations exhibit structures {{that allow them to}} transfer results from exploratory to exploitative activities through <b>IT</b> <b>enabled</b> agility. Our findings suggest that exploitative concepts require <b>IT</b> <b>enabled</b> agility mechanisms that are incompatible with those for exploratory concepts, and oppositely. We found that knowledge transfer between business units often occurs, but is yet not fully integrated from an organizational perspective. We highlight the need for ambidextrous organizations to facilitate permeable boundaries with <b>IT</b> <b>enabled</b> agility by offering a transfer...|$|R

A 2007 publication in the Journal of Molecular Biology relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the villin protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.|$|E

40|$|<b>IT</b> <b>enabled</b> {{products}} {{are the result}} of a fusion of IT with the core functionalities of any product or device around us. This fusion is leading to numerous benefits and advantages that are just beginning to appear. However, with the increasing number and sophistication of vulnerabilities and threats in <b>IT,</b> the <b>IT</b> <b>enabled</b> products have also come in the line of fire. Due to the critical and diverse nature of these products, it is important that a holistic security framework exists that addresses security in the early phases of product development. The current state of security in <b>IT</b> <b>enabled</b> products strongly suggests this need along with the efforts of industry leaders in respective fields. In this thesis, the author has made an effort to address security in the <b>IT</b> <b>enabled</b> products by proposing a new framework based on the Balanced Scorecard. The proposed framework uses the concept of the four views and other characteristics of the Balanced Scorecard and it has a strong focus on security. The proposed framework has been evaluated by Prof. James E. Goldman; the chair of this thesis committee and its application has also been demonstrated to one of the discussed case examples of security failures. From this research, it has been concluded that the proposed framework can indeed effectively address security in the <b>IT</b> <b>enabled</b> products. ...|$|R
