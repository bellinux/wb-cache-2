25|$|Sandbox detection: is a {{particular}} behavioural-based detection technique that, instead of detecting the behavioural fingerprint at run time, it executes the programs in a virtual environment, logging what actions the program performs. Depending on the actions logged, the antivirus engine can determine <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> is malicious or not. If not, then, the program is executed in the real environment. Albeit this technique has shown to be quite effective, given its heaviness and slowness, it is rarely used in end-user antivirus solutions.|$|E
25|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} men who choose active {{surveillance}} for early stage tumors eventually have signs of tumor progression, and they may need to begin treatment within three years. Men that choose active surveillance avoid the risks of surgery, radiation, and other treatments. The risk of disease progression and metastasis (spread of the cancer) may be increased, but this increase risk appears to be small <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> of surveillance is followed closely, generally including serial PSA assessments and repeat prostate biopsies every 1–2 years depending on the PSA trends.|$|E
25|$|In February 2004 Nikolai Moiseyev, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of Russian Federal Space Agency (FSA) told journalists that the Kliper project had been included in the Russian federal space program for 2005-15. At that point he announced that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> is implemented successfully the first launch may even take place in five years' time. Kliper had been developed since 2000 and reportedly relied heavily on research studies as well as proposals for a small Russian lifting body spacecraft from the 1990s. Externally its design was comparable to the cancelled European minishuttle Hermes or the NASA study X-38. It was planned to be the successor to the veteran spacecraft Soyuz, which has been built in various modifications since 1961.|$|E
50|$|Denotational {{semantics}} concerns {{itself with}} finding more appropriate models (called domains) to model programming language {{concepts such as}} function types. It turns out that restricting expression to the set of computable functions is not sufficient either <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>programming</b> language allows writing non-terminating computations (which is <b>the</b> case <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>programming</b> language is Turing complete). Expression must be restricted to the so-called continuous functions (corresponding to continuity in the Scott topology, not continuity in the real analytical sense). Even then, the set of continuous function contains the parallel-or function, which cannot be correctly defined in all programming languages.|$|R
5000|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> target <b>program</b> {{picks up}} <b>the</b> value from a [...] "random" [...] {{location}} in memory (one it doesn't 'own' usually), it may for example be nulls (X"00") {{in almost every}} normal situation and <b>the</b> <b>program</b> works OK. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> monitoring <b>program</b> shifts <b>the</b> load point, it may pick up say X"FF" [...] and the logic would cause different results during a comparison operation.

25|$|Most type-safe {{languages}} {{include some}} form of dynamic type checking, even if {{they also have a}} static type checker. The {{reason for this is that}} many useful features or properties are difficult or impossible to verify statically. For example, suppose that a program defines two types, A and B, where B is a subtype of A. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> tries to convert a value of type A to type B, which is known as downcasting, then the operation is legal only if the value being converted is actually a value of type B. Thus, a dynamic check is needed to verify that the operation is safe. This requirement is one of the criticisms of downcasting.|$|E
25|$|Responding to the {{criticism}} regarding accusations by several media executives (including Viacom CEO Phillippe Dauman and former Fox Entertainment Group chief operating officer Chase Carey) that it failed to count viewers watching television programs on digital platforms, Nielsen {{executive vice president of}} global product leadership Megan Clarken stated in an April 2015 summit by the Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement that the company is able to count digital viewers in audience and demographic reports, but are unable to do so under the current set of rules devised by networks and advertising industries last revised in 2006. As such, Nielsen can only count viewership for television-originated broadcasts, and must exclude viewers who watch programs on digital platforms <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> does not have an identical advertising load or a linear watermark.|$|E
25|$|For any Type A {{program which}} are {{considered}} to be a high risk of not complying, the OMB Circular A-133 requires that the auditor to perform a compliance audit on that program. For a Type A program that is considered to be of low risk, then the auditor is not required to perform a compliance audit, although the OMB Circular A-133 allows the auditor to do so if he/she chooses to. Although the risk assessment is performed by the auditor based on his/her judgment, the OMB Circular A-133 does have two requirements for a program to be considered low risk. First, the program must have been audited at least once in the last two years, and second, the program must have no audit findings when it was last audited. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> does not comply with either of these two requirements, it is automatically considered as high risk.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{analysis is}} that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>programming</b> language does not define the semantics of concurrent accesses to shared variables (in this case [...] ) without use of synchronization, then {{the solution is}} unsatisfactory for that reason, without needing to explicitly demonstrate a race condition.|$|R

25|$|In reality, for MACSOG, {{the point}} was moot. Suspicions abounded within the {{organization}} that Operation Timberwork had been penetrated by communist dich van agents. The intelligence returns from the northern agent teams had been strangely lax and {{more than three-quarters of}} the agents inserted had been captured either during or not long after their arrival. The fact that SOG had slavishly followed the CIA's failed formula for three years was not considered a contributing factor. The unit was more concerned over Washington's continuous rejection of one of the original goals of the operation, the formation of a resistance movement by possible dissident elements within North Vietnam. Washington's stated goal in the conflict was a free and viable South Vietnam, not the overthrow of the Hanoi regime. The conundrum was what would happen <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> had succeeded. The best possible outcome would have been a repeat of the ill-fated Hungarian uprising of 1956, brutally crushed by the Soviet Union, and about which the U.S. could do nothing.|$|E
25|$|Introduced predators, in {{particular}} foxes, {{are a significant}} threat to the ground-nesting colonial seabirds and shorebirds of the Summerland Peninsula. Foxes were introduced to Phillip Island in 1907 and while various control methods have been implemented since 1918 none were successful. Fox monitoring and control is difficult as foxes have high breeding productivity, are wary of humans, highly mobile, ecologically adaptable and their 'surplus kill' hunting behaviour can kill up to 30 penguins a night. In 2007 PINP established a dedicated fox eradication program {{with the aim of}} removing all foxes from Phillip Island and as a result there has been a decline in penguin moralities by foxes on the peninsula from 125 killed in 2007/2008 to five killed in the subsequent four years. In 2012 there was an estimated 11 foxes remaining across the whole of Phillip Island, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> is successful Phillip Island will be the largest island from which red foxes have been eradicated.|$|E
