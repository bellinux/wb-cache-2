In some species the lining consists of small woody objects such as bark <b>flakes</b> <b>and</b> seed husks, while in others it includes the moss, grass, hair and feathers typical of passerine birds.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, baby carrots or mini-carrots (carrots {{that have been}} {{peeled and cut into}} uniform cylinders) have been a popular ready-to-eat snack food {{available}} in many supermarkets. Carrots are puréed and used as baby food, dehydrated to make chips, <b>flakes,</b> <b>and</b> powder, and thinly sliced and deep-fried, like potato chips.|$|E
5|$|All nuthatches {{appear to}} store food, {{especially}} seeds, in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark <b>flakes,</b> <b>and</b> these caches are remembered {{for as long}} as 30 days. Similarly, the rock nuthatches wedge snails into suitable crevices for consumption in times of need. European nuthatches have been found to avoid using their caches during benign conditions in order to save them for harsher times.|$|E

5|$|Rose or mint {{water is}} a drink {{commonly}} added to Palestinian sweets and dishes. However, {{it is also a}} popular drink on its own, and is seen as refreshing in the heated summers. Herbs such as sage can also be boiled with water to create a drink that is sometimes used for medicinal purposes. A warm drink made from sweetened milk with salep garnished with walnuts, coconut <b>flakes</b> <b>and</b> cinnamon, is known as sahlab and is primarily served during the winter season.|$|E
5|$|The Close {{owes its}} origins to {{a grant of}} land and {{buildings}} by Walter de Hulle, a canon of Wells Cathedral, {{for the purpose of}} accommodating chantry priests; however the land is likely to have been used for a long period before the construction of the close, as prehistoric flint <b>flakes</b> <b>and</b> Romano-British pottery shards were recovered from the garden of number four during work to construct an extension.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} {{has nine}} or more subspecies which breed {{in different parts}} of its range in temperate Eurasia. This species is found in woodlands of all kinds, but where it overlaps with the short-toed treecreeper in western Europe it {{is more likely to be}} found in coniferous forests or at higher altitudes. It nests in tree crevices or behind bark <b>flakes,</b> <b>and</b> favours introduced giant sequoia as nest sites where they are available. The female typically lays five or six pink-speckled white eggs in the lined nest, but eggs and chicks are vulnerable to attack by woodpeckers and mammals, including squirrels.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{entered the}} Americas through Beringia, and {{evidence}} documents {{their interactions with}} Columbian mammoths. Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce lithic <b>flakes</b> <b>and</b> cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old cleaver choppers made from a mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a flake knife made from a long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object made from a mammoth femur; the object is thought to be a shaft wrench, a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} assess the sensory textural properties, consumer acceptability and instrumental-sensory correlates of <b>flaked</b> <b>and</b> formed beef steaks. In Experiment 1, the effects of additions of NaCI, TPP and soy isolate on the texture of steaks were examined using a trained texture profile panel, and the texture of these steaks was {{compared to that of}} intact muscle (ribeye) steaks. Results showed large differences between the <b>flaked</b> <b>and</b> formed samples and the ribeye steak, as contrasted to small differences among the <b>flaked</b> <b>and</b> formed samples treated with different levels of NaCI, TPP and/or soy isolate. In Experiments 2 and 3 the effect of flake size on the texture of <b>flaked</b> <b>and</b> formed beef was examined. In Experiment 2, instrumental shear data and SEM data were col lected and compared to the sensory data. In Experiment 3, a comparison was made of the texture of these products to both ribeye steak and ground beef patties. Systematic differences in a variety of textural attributes were observed as a function of flake-size. In general, the smallest flake-size produced a texture most like ground beef, whereas certain intermediate <b>and</b> large <b>flake</b> sizes produced a texture most like whole muscle steak. Simple and multiple linear regression equations were established between sensory and shear stress measures on these steaks, and these data, combined with the SEM data, suggested that tenderization of these meats is attributable to mechanical disruption of the tissue and not to an enzymatic process. In Experiment 4, a consumer test was conducted to assess the effect of flake -size on the acceptability of <b>flaked</b> <b>and</b> formed steaks, and to assess consumer perception of the similarity of the texture of these products to other beef products. Although few significant differences in the acceptability of the <b>flaked</b> <b>and</b> formed products were observed, maximal acceptability ratings were found for the intermediate flake sizes. In addition, it was found that consumers do not associate the texture of <b>flaked</b> <b>and</b> formed steaks with any one of a variety of traditional beef products...|$|R

25|$|Biological {{sources of}} air {{pollution}} are also found indoors, as gases and airborne particulates. Pets produce dander, people produce dust from minute skin <b>flakes</b> <b>and</b> decomposed hair, dust mites in bedding, carpeting and furniture produce enzymes and micrometre-sized fecal droppings, inhabitants emit methane, mold forms on walls and generates mycotoxins and spores, air conditioning systems can incubate Legionnaires' disease and mold, and houseplants, soil and surrounding gardens can produce pollen, dust, and mold. Indoors, the lack of air circulation allows these airborne pollutants to accumulate more than they would otherwise occur in nature.|$|E

25|$|In prehistoric times, chert {{was often}} used as a raw {{material}} {{for the construction of}} stone tools. Like obsidian, as well as some rhyolites, felsites, quartzites, and other tool stones used in lithic reduction, chert fractures in a Hertzian cone when struck with sufficient force. This results in conchoidal fractures, a characteristic of all minerals with no cleavage planes. In this kind of fracture, a cone of force propagates through the material from the point of impact, eventually removing a full or partial cone; this result is familiar to anyone who has seen what happens to a plate-glass window when struck by a small object, such as an air gun projectile. The partial Hertzian cones produced during lithic reduction are called <b>flakes,</b> <b>and</b> exhibit features characteristic of this sort of breakage, including striking platforms, bulbs of force, and occasionally eraillures, which are small secondary flakes detached from the flake's bulb of force.|$|E

25|$|Friction {{extrusion}} {{was invented}} at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended {{primarily as a}} method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as <b>flakes</b> <b>and</b> chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.|$|E
500|$|Scenes {{featuring}} {{the main characters}} at Rura Penthe were filmed on a soundstage. Massive fans blew dusty fake snow that, according to Shatner, got into [...] "every orifice", as well as into the camera. Creating a fake blizzard was challenging; two types of plastic snow were mixed together to provide <b>flakes</b> <b>and</b> powdery accumulation. Camera magazines were changed off the stage {{so that there was}} no chance the snow could get into the film; crewmembers found the snow in their socks for weeks afterwards.|$|E
