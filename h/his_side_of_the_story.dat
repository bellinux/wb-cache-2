5|$|Potential presidential {{candidates}} are vetted by an unelected three-member Presidential Elections Committee ("PEC"). The PEC is not constitutionally obliged to give reasons behind its decisions to award or deny {{a certificate of}} eligibility. Its decision {{is not subject to}} legal or political scrutiny, and its verdict is final. There has been criticism of how Andrew Kuan, who applied to be a candidate in the 2005 presidential election, was denied a certificate of eligibility. Before the PEC could reach a decision on the matter, he was reportedly discredited though statements from various people which were published in the media that alleged incompetence and cast doubt on his character. Subsequently, Kuan was denied a certificate, the PEC stating that his seniority and responsibility as the Jurong Town Corporation's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to the experience of a chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board or a company with a paid-up capital of at least $100 million, as required by the Constitution. There is no legal requirement for the PEC to interview prospective candidates, and it did not do so to allow Kuan to explain <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> As a result, the unopposed incumbent S.R. Nathan was declared the President for a second term.|$|E
25|$|In {{the light}} of this vindication of the patriarch’s behaviour, {{an attempt was made}} by the monastery's {{superior}} Yohannan Gwera to put <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> He travelled to Rome, accompanied by the monks Mikha'il Jammala and Peter, and eventually obtained a papal audience. The response of the Vatican authorities to the monks' complaints was lukewarm. They were assured that their allegations would be investigated but were also censured for their disobedience.|$|E
25|$|During her {{travels in}} the United States, Langtry became an American citizen and on May 13, 1897, {{divorced}} her husband, Edward Langtry, in Lakeport, California. Her ownership {{of land in}} America was introduced in evidence at her divorce to help demonstrate to the judge {{that she was a}} citizen of the country. In June of that year Edward Langtry issued a statement giving <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> which was published in the New York Journal.|$|E

25|$|Macleod {{returned}} to Scotland in 1928 to become Regius Professor of Physiology (in succession {{to his former}} teacher, Prof. John Alexander MacWilliam who retired in 1927) and later Dean of the University of Aberdeen Medical Faculty. Between 1929 and 1933 {{he was also a}} member of the Medical Research Council. He wrote a report on the discovery in 1922 to explain <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> but otherwise refrained from active involvement in controversy about credit. Banting hated him passionately, and the two never spoke again.|$|E
25|$|Braithwaite {{pleaded not}} guilty, but despite {{evidence}} from other prisoners that confirmed <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> a general court martial of five British Army officers, convicted him of mutiny and conferred {{a sentence of}} death by firing squad. The three other soldiers on trial, all Australians, received the same sentence. The decision of the court martial {{was sent to the}} commander of the British Expeditionary Force, General Douglas Haig, for approval but was accompanied by a recommendation from the convening officer that the sentences be reduced to a 10-year term of imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|Pat Garrett, smarting {{from local}} outrage over his {{shooting}} of the Kid, wanted to present <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and hoped {{to turn a}} profit as well on the American public's fascination with the notorious outlaw. Consequently, he published his account of Bonney's life, The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid, in 1882. It was credited to Garrett, but the first fifteen chapters were a concoction of factual material mixed with fabrications, written by Roswell's postmaster, Ash Upson, an itinerant journalist. The remaining chapters, written in a more restrained style, are generally accurate, and were likely composed by Garrett himself. The book failed to find a wide audience and sold just a few copies; nevertheless, although filled with many errors of fact, The Authentic Life served afterwards as the main source for most books written about the Kid until the 1960s. Thus was established the mythic stature of Pat Garrett as the heroic lawman in pursuit of the villainous but romantic desperado, Billy the Kid.|$|E

25|$|Weyl also {{discusses}} {{claims of}} Fokker's outright plagiarism or taking sole {{credit for the}} work of his staff, first designer Martin Kreuzer and later Reinhold Platz. For example, contemporary German documents for the E.V/D.VIII refer to Fokker as 'the designer' but Weyl and other authors now suggest that Platz was the real design genius behind the Dr.I, D.VII and D.VIII. There may be some truth in this as Platz recalled to Weyl that he attended high level meetings alongside Fokker but was never introduced or referred-to as the designer and often never even spoke. Yet when Fokker fled Germany it was Platz who immediately took over the German works on Fokker's behalf. Fokker later moved Platz to the Netherlands, as head designer, when the post-war German operation collapsed which indicates Platz really did play a greater design role than Fokker admits. Weyl uncharitably suggests that Platz's role at the Fokker D.VIII crisis meetings was to take the blame if anything was wrong and not receive credit. How much of this interpretation is {{based on the fact that}} Platz was still alive to tell <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> in 1965, and Fokker was not, is unclear.|$|E
25|$|On the January 20 {{episode of}} Raw, Eric Bischoff made an {{announcement}} about how Stone Cold Steve Austin {{walked out on}} Vince McMahon {{during the summer of}} 2002 with no explanation and {{that he would like to}} give Steve Austin an opportunity to give <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> Bischoff also invited Steve Austin to make an appearance at next month's No Way Out. The following week, Bischoff stated that Austin has agreed to tell his story in the Raw magazine. On the February 3 episode of Raw, Bischoff headed to Texas, to sign Austin to the Raw brand. But, he was unsuccessful in doing so, as he couldn't locate Austin anywhere. The following week on Raw, Bischoff (kayfabe) fired Jim Ross, after Bischoff stated that it was Ross' fault that Austin hasn't signed yet to the brand. Vince McMahon, who the previous week stated he would fire Bischoff and Chief Morley for the way they were running Raw the last couple of weeks, asked Bischoff if he'd signed Austin yet, which prompted Bischoff to say No. J.R. informed McMahon that Austin would be at No Way Out, which led to McMahon booking a match between Bischoff and Austin for the pay-per-view.|$|E
500|$|After his {{retirement}} from the military, Bostock went into journalism {{and become an}} aviation correspondent for The Herald. He wrote {{a series of articles}} criticising the Air Force's organisation and presenting <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of RAAF Command, motivated partly by his belief that the official history of Australia in World WarII would fail to adequately cover it. The articles caused considerable controversy and prompted the Minister for Air, Arthur Drakeford, to make a formal response in Federal Parliament, labelling Bostock's allegations [...] "malicious and unjustified".|$|E

[...] In spite of the denial of immunity, Waddle elected to testify for the court. [...] Waddle stated later that he felt he needed to testify because he had promised some of the Ehime Maru family members that he would do so, he had heard that Greeneville crew expected him to, and he wanted to get <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> into the record.|$|E
500|$|Late in his life, Alf wrote a {{manuscript}} detailing {{his life story}} which he bequeathed to John. It was Alf's attempt {{to fill in the}} lost years when he had not been in contact with his son, and to explain that it was Julia, and not Alf, who had broken up their marriage. John later commented: [...] "You know, all he wanted was for me to hear <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> which I hadn't heard." [...] By 1976, Alfred was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer and Pauline contacted John via Apple Corps {{to make sure that he}} was aware that his father was dying. John sent a large bouquet of flowers to the hospital and phoned Alf on his deathbed, apologising for his (John's) past behaviour. On 1 April 1976, Alf Lennon died in Brighton.|$|E
500|$|He {{established}} himself in central midfield over the New Year with [...] "a string of impressive performances". However, on 12 March 2013 {{he missed a}} pre-match team meal, but claimed he made his own way for the match against Bristol Rovers, only to be informed {{that he was not}} in the matchday squad when he was just five minutes away from Bristol. He took to Twitter to put <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> across, and an angry Micky Adams responded by saying Burge's tweets were [...] "absolute nonsense and he's going to be disciplined". Burge was suspended for two weeks for breaking the club's [...] "social media guidelines" [...] after club management claimed he refused to apologise for the incident. On 12 April 2013, with three games left of the season, Burge left the club by mutual consent. Club chairman Paul Wildes stated that [...] "this has been a difficult decision for both parties". Vale secured promotion into League One {{at the end of the}} 2012–13 season, and users of fan site One Vale Fan voted him their Player of the Season.|$|E

500|$|After {{yet another}} attack at the Krusty Krab by Plankton, SpongeBob asks Mr. Krabs why they hate each other. Mr. Krabs tells <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> {{in a series}} of flashbacks. In the flashback, Mr. Krabs and Plankton were best friends from birth, and did {{everything}} together. One day, they get enough money to buy a burger from Stinky's Burgers, which, despite having horrible food and being located in a landfill, is very popular among the local children due to being the only place in town to get a burger. When Stinky refuses to give them a burger Plankton and Krabs decide to go into the burger business themselves, and create their own burger, but no one wants to try it. They then find out that the local health department closed Stinky's, so the two open [...] "Plabs Burgers" [...] at the dump, which the children are now forced to eat at, despite it being even worse than Stinky's. Plankton says that they are now ruling the children. Mr. Krabs argues that it should be about satisfying the customers, rather than power. Soon they get into an argument, and Krabs is ejected into a dump pile and tells Plankton that he will one day regret this.|$|E

2500|$|Metzger filed a {{petition}} with the Supreme Court of Israel to protest Mazuz's public declaration, alleging that his image {{had been destroyed}} without {{a chance to tell}} <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> and accusing Mazuz of engaging in [...] "child-like" [...] tactics. Metzger's lawyer charged that Mazuz's report on Metzger contained unverifiable information, and that it constituted a personal attack on the rabbi without giving him the benefit of a defense or hearing. The petition requested that the second half of Mazuz's 30-page report, in which he harshly attacked Metzger's conduct and recommended his removal, be stricken from the record.|$|E
2500|$|At seventeen, {{inspired}} by punk zines and [...] "too many" [...] viewings of Pump Up the Volume, Brown started Punch, an underground student newspaper that raised a commotion by running a piece evaluating the school's teachers {{based on a}} survey of hundred students Brown interviewed. He ended up getting disciplined by the school's principal while the entire episode raised enough controversy to be featured on Metro Morning, a CBLA-FM radio programme then-hosted by Andy Barrie, where young Brown got invited to give <b>his</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> Based on the publicity it received via the controversy, the paper expanded to become a Toronto-wide underground project that ran for a few years.|$|E
