During the U.S. automotive industry crisis of 2008–10, he opposed a bailout of the industry in the form of direct government intervention, and argued that a managed bankruptcy of struggling automobile companies should instead be accompanied by federal guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector.</b>|$|E

Moran also authored a law that allows a federal worker’s unused sick leave to count toward their annuity.

The NFPB's mission, to which the NFR contributes, is to ensure the survival, conservation, and increased public availability of America's film heritage.

5|$|On 20 April 2005, the Norwegian Ski Federation's board supported, with 13 against 1 vote, {{to build}} both a normal {{and a large}} hill at Rødkleiva and to close Vikersundbakken. However, the {{following}} day Svarstad Haugland stated that the government supported keeping Vikersundbakken rather than building a new venue in Rødkleiva. Clas Brede Bråthen responded that the federation hoped to build the venue with grants <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> such as naming rights, and used Color Line Stadion in Ålesund {{as an example of}} a venue that had generated significant funding from corporate sponsors. A majority of the county chapters supported Vikersundbakken, with only 4 of 19 chapters supporting Rødkleiva. The Norwegian Ski Federation's national convention voted on 28 May with a large majority to place first a normal hill and then a ski flying hill at Rødkleiva.|$|E

When Walker testifies about Underwood's role in the Chinese money laundering, Underwood takes the stand in his own defense and stuns the committee by resigning the presidency. When Claire demands an explanation, Underwood reveals that his resignation was part of a plan to ensure that they control the country for years to come: Claire from the White House, he <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector.</b> To tie up loose ends, he has Macallan and Harvey killed.|$|E

The 150 million pesos ($5.3 million) spent on hosting the pageant was funded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors,</b> with sponsors such as Nestlé, Kodak and Hertz. Some of the expected sponsorship money did not eventuate, leading the shortfall to be covered by the government.

5|$|In 2000, Malawi's Ministry of Health and Population began {{developing}} {{a plan to}} distribute antiretroviral drugs to the population, and, as of 2003, there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in Malawi. The Lighthouse, a trust in Lilongwe that fights HIV/AIDS, provides antiretroviral drugs {{at a cost of}} 2,500 kwacha per month. Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre provides antiretroviral therapy through its outpatient department, and Médecins Sans Frontières distributes antiretroviral drugs to patients for free in the Chiradzulu and Thyolo Districts. Many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs, particularly in cities; however, very few patients can afford to receive drugs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> in Malawi. In addition, private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs, and, therefore, this practice is not closely monitored. Finally, some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through the health insurance policies provided by their employers, but this practice is not widespread.|$|E
5|$|BART {{ridership}} {{has grown}} rapidly since 2010, mirroring strong {{economic growth in}} the Bay Area. In 2015, the system was carrying approximately 100,000 more passengers each day than it had five years earlier. High gasoline prices also contributed to growth, pushing ridership to record levels during 2012, with the system recording five record ridership days in September and October 2012. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, BART recorded an average weekday ridership of 423,395, the second-highest in its history, but a 2.3% drop from 2016. Ridership growth began to slow in late 2016, and dropped by 1.7% in October 2016 from the prior year. The line to the San Francisco International Airport lost riders, while ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft grew by a factor of almost six or nearly 500% at the airport during 2014–2016. BART planners believe that competition from Uber and Lyft is reducing overall ridership growth and BART's share of SFO airport transit. Some see the decline in transit use in large U.S. cities as part of a national trend, linked to changes in commute patterns, the fall in gasoline prices since 2014, and competition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> in the form of ride-sharing services.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{months of the}} Chamorro administration, social {{programs}} including free bus tokens for the education sector, pensions {{for the elderly and}} disabled, child care and child development services, and health care initiatives were cut. By 1991 the austerity measures adopted by Chamorro's administration were leading to massive strikes. Chamorro chose to recognize the workers' right to 25% of the shares of privatized state enterprises despite of the disapproval that generated both at home and abroad. The Sandinistas, who had removed some of the businesses <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> during their administration were not in favor of privatization, but they were in favor of workers sharing in the revenues. The far-right of her own coalition was against making labor compromises of any kind. The US embassy and United States Agency for International Development both voiced displeasure at the concessions and speed with which the economic plan was being implemented. In spite of the other programs implemented, inflation was reduced by the renegotiation of the country's debt (called for by the Lacayo Plan). Through negotiations, Nicaragua was able to obtain a writedown of 75% of their international debt on the condition that they had no arrears. As noted previously, the US assisted Nicaragua in paying off the past-due debt to the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank through bridge loans and negotiating a 95% writedown of debts owed to Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These measures provided the means to end hyperinflation and reopen monetary markets, but they were overshadowed by high unemployment, underemployment and an overall recession. The trade deficit rose and GNP declined, and overall, low wages, reductions of education and health services caused poverty to escalate, and social tensions to rise.|$|E
