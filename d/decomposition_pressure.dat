40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{evaluation}} of critical requirements of organometallic chemical vapor deposition (OMCVD) at elevated pressure for a channel flow reactor in a microgravity environment. The objective of using high pressure is to maintain single-phase surface composition for materials that have high thermal <b>decomposition</b> <b>pressure</b> at their optimum growth temperature.

Based on ground based observations we present an optimized reactor design for OMCVD at high pressure and reduced gravity.

30|$|While {{several studies}} of note have already {{examined}} {{the effect of}} pre-treatment of ATM and the correlation between MoS 2 HDS activity by varying gaseous environment (e.g., H 2 S/H 2) and Mo precursors as well as reducing and sulfiding conditions, little work {{has focused on the}} influence of <b>decomposition</b> <b>pressure</b> (Liang et al. 1986; Zhang and Vasudevan 1995; Alonso et al. 1998; Afanasiev 2010). As a general rule, pressure increases are known to decrease the rate of thermal decomposition; however, other influences have been observed. In their study of nitramine compounds, Piermarini et al. found a change in decomposition mechanism above a certain pressure (Piermarini et al. 1987). In addition, Criado et al. studied the decomposition of CaCO 3 and observed a shift towards higher decomposition temperatures with increasing CO 2 pressure (Criado et al. 1995).|$|E
30|$|We {{have shown}} herein {{the role played}} by both time and {{pressure}} for reductive thermal decomposition of ATM for the formation of MoS 2 and their subsequent impact on HDS activity. The influence of decomposition time serves to both enable an increase in surface area as well as an increased likelihood of sintering. Pressure increases slow down thermal decomposition by limiting gaseous by-product diffusion {{while at the same time}} facilitating the collapse of produced pores. Based on FT-IR vibrational energies, FT-IR spectral analysis shows that catalysts prepared at higher pressures have weaker Mo-S bonds (378  cm− 1) than those prepared at lower pressure (385  cm− 1). Evidence from XRD indicates both time and pressure induce interlayer rotation of stacks along both the a- and c-axes and that ATM <b>decomposition</b> <b>pressure</b> plays a role in determination of MoS 2 layer stacking. Using XRD-derived values for crystallite sizes, theoretical surface area values were determined; the changes evident lead us to conclude that agglomeration is occurring. Optimal conditions were found producing a catalyst with weak Mo-S bonds, the largest (theoretical) surface area and largest pore volume which unsurprisingly resulted in the highest HDS activity of model dibenzothiophene. It was found that catalytic activity increased with a decrease in theoretical surface area, with 5 - 1, 000 having the highest activity per unit area. Samples prepared at low pressures yielded no detectible HYD product, but this increased in samples prepared at higher <b>decomposition</b> <b>pressure.</b> An optimal system was found which gave the lowest HYD:DDS ratio, again 5 - 1, 000. There is no doubt that there are other parameters which can impact both morphology and catalytic activity, such as ramp rates and variously substituted thiomolybdates; we have shown that the role of decomposition time and pressure for ATM-derived MoS 2 can in fact be a useful tool in optimizing catalyst synthesis with certain morphologies and activities.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION The use of {{computer}} simulations as an optimal design tool which lessens the costs {{in time and}} effort in experimental and physical testing has become prevalent in aerospace design (e. g., {{the design of the}} Boeing 777) and development of automotive mass production items.

30|$|According to the {{reaction}} mechanism, for every mole of ATM that decomposes, four moles of gaseous products are produced (2 NH 3 and 2 H 2 S). Based on the starting concentration of ATM, it was calculated {{that there was}} a pressure increase of approximately 15 psig above the H 2 injected upon reaching decomposition temperature; no attempt was made to correct for this during catalyst preparation. In general, throughout this paper, the H 2 <b>decomposition</b> <b>pressures</b> applied are termed as low (20 psig), medium (500 psig), and high (1, 000 psig), and it is only against the pressure trend that meaningful conclusions are obtained, not the actual value itself.

40|$|The {{vaporization}} of {{the nine}} compounds of Zn, Cd and Hg with S, Se and Te has been investigated by mass spectrometry. The typical process is the decomposition into gaseous metal atoms and diatomic group 6 B molecules. Small amounts of polymeric species of sulphur were observed in the vapour above HgS and considerable amounts of polymeric selenium molecules above HgSe; HgTe yields Hg(g) and solid Te. No gaseous group 2 B- 6 B molecules were observed; their concentration is below 1 part in 103 - 105. Estimates of dissociation energies are made {{and the possibility of}} observing these molecules is discussed. <b>Decomposition</b> <b>pressures</b> of all nine compounds were measured by the Knudsen method and corresponding enthalpy and entropy data deduced and compared with literature data.

30|$|The {{increase}} in HYD:DDS ratio, as confirmed by chromatographic analysis, can be partially explained by a possible {{increase in}} the number of rim sites available due to interlayer rotation of the layers of MoS 2 in the stacks. Another possibility is that the reduced agglomeration from samples prepared at higher <b>decomposition</b> <b>pressure</b> simply exposes more rim sites to the DBT molecule. Of the samples which produce the hydrogenated DBT, 5 - 1, 000 has one of the lowest HYD:DDS ratios (0.15) compared to say 3 - 500 (0.32). Thus, not only does 5 - 1, 000 have a more active surface for HDS of DBT, but it also has a higher preference towards the DDS pathway compared to HYD which leads to the assumption that the exposure of rim sites for MoS 2 prepared from reductively decomposed ATM can be optimized by varying decomposition time and pressure.|$|E
30|$|Since FT-IR spectra are of {{the bulk}} material, {{it could be argued}} that there is an {{increase}} in the concentration of weaker (longer), more reactive Mo-S bonds produced with increasing <b>decomposition</b> <b>pressure.</b> While this finding is intuitively unappealing as one would reasonably expect a shortening of bond lengths with increase in pressure (Pietosa et al. 2008), a possible explanation is that pressure induces structural changes which in turn induce creation of new catalytically active sites. Though recent investigations of MoS 2 nanoclusters using direct space DFT calculations have found that an increase in S atom coordination of Mo atom results in increasing Mo-S bond lengths (McBride and Head 2009), no such investigations were carried out in this study. Work is ongoing with a view to quantifying the interlayer rotations observed using XRD and the creation of new catalytically active sites and the unique FT-IR shifts observed through the preparation of more ATM-derived MoS 2 using more discreet changes in decomposition pressures.|$|E

A similar trend was observed for TPV of MoS 2 samples (Figure  3) in that the greatest increase in TPV was for the 5 -h series and the lowest was for the 7 -h series and likewise a decrease in TPV for the high-pressure 7  h series compared to that for the 5 -h series (e.g., compare 5 - 500 with 7 - 500 and 5 - 1, 000 with 7 - 1, 000).|$|E

40|$|The {{decomposition}} of cyclotramethylenetetranitramine (HMX) in the {{solid and liquid}} phase was studied by isothermal and nonisothermal heating at atmospheric <b>pressure.</b> <b>Decomposition</b> rates of solid HMX changed with sample size and gaseous environment. Kinetic parameters were obtained from weight loss measurements in the temperature range 229 C - 269 C. These tests also yielded highly porous solid residues. Qualitative aspects of solid and liquid phase {{decomposition of}} HMX with additives were also investigated in isothermal and nonisothermal tests...|$|R
