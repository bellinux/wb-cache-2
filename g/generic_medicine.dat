40|$|Objectives: This study aims {{to conduct}} a {{descriptive}} analysis of the policy environment surrounding the <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> retail market in Portugal. The policy analysis focuses on supply-side measures (i. e. market access, pricing, reference-pricing and reimbursement of <b>generic</b> <b>medicines)</b> and demand-side measures (i. e. incentives for physicians to prescribe, for pharmacists to dispense and for patients to use <b>generic</b> <b>medicines).</b> Methods: The policy analysis {{was based on an}} international literature review. Also, a simulation exercise was carried out to compute potential savings from substituting <b>generic</b> for originator <b>medicines</b> in Portugal using IMS Health data. Results: Portugal has developed a successful <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> market by increasing reimbursement of <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> (until October 2005), by introducing a reference-pricing system, by encouraging physicians to prescribe by international non-proprietary name (INN), and by allowing generic substitution by pharmacists. However, the development of the <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> market has been hindered by the existence of copies, pricing regulation, certain features of the reference-pricing system, weak incentives for physicians to prescribe <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> and a financial disincentive for pharmacists to dispense <b>generic</b> <b>medicines.</b> Increased <b>generic</b> substitution would be expected to reduce public expenditure on originator medicines by 45 %. Conclusions: The development of the Portuguese <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> market has mainly been fuelled by supply-side measures. To support the further expansion of the market, policy makers need to strengthen demand-side measures inciting physicians to prescribe, pharmacists to dispense and patients to use <b>generic</b> <b>medicines...</b>|$|R

Use of <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> has been increasing in recent years, primarily as a cost saving measure in healthcare provision. <b>Generic</b> <b>medicines</b> are typically 20 to 90 % cheaper than originator equivalents.

40|$|<b>Generic</b> <b>medicines</b> offer equally {{high-quality}} {{treatment as}} originator medicines do at much lower prices. As such, {{they represent a}} considerable opportunity for authorities to obtain substantial savings. At the moment, the pharmaceutical landscape is changing and many pharmaceutical companies have altered their development and commercial strategies, combining both originator and generic divisions. In spite of this, the <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> industry is currently facing a number of challenges: delayed market access; the limited price differential with originator medicines; the continuous downwards pressure on prices; and the negative perception regarding <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> held by some key stakeholder groups. This could jeopardize the long-term sustainability of the generic manufacturing industry. Therefore, governments must focus on demand-side policies, alongside policies to accelerate market access, as the <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> industry will {{only be able to}} deliver competitive and sustainable prices if they are ensured a high volume.

40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the general practitioners' (GPs') knowledge and perceptions towards <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> in a northern state of Malaysia. Method A postal cross-sectional survey involving registered GPs in Penang, Malaysia was undertaken. A 23 -item questionnaire was developed, validated and administered on the GPs. Eighty-seven GPs responded to the survey (response rate 26. 8 %). Results The majority of the respondents (85. 1 %) claimed that they actively prescribed <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> in their practice. On the other hand, only 4. 6 % of the respondents correctly identified the Malaysia's National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau's bioequivalence standard for generic products. There were misconceptions among the respondents about the concepts of "bioequivalence", "efficacy", "safety", and "manufacturing standards" of <b>generic</b> <b>medicines.</b> GPs in this survey believed that a standard guideline on brand substitution process, collaboration with pharmacists, patient education and information on safety and efficacy of <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> were necessary to ensure quality use of generics. Furthermore, advertisements and product bonuses offered by pharmaceutical companies, patient's socio-economic factors as well as credibility of manufacturers were factors reported to influence their choice of medicine. Conclusion Although it appeared that GPs have largely accepted the use of <b>generic</b> <b>medicines,</b> they still have concerns regarding the reliability and quality of such products.

40|$|AIM: To descriptively {{analyze the}} policy {{environment}} surrounding the Polish <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> retail market. METHOD: The policy analysis {{was based on}} an international literature review. Also, a simulation exercise was carried out to compute potential savings from substituting <b>generic</b> for originator <b>medicines</b> in Poland using IMS Health pharmaceutical intelligence data. RESULTS: Poland has a mature, high-volume, low-value <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> market, primarily driven by the establishment of the reference price at the price of the cheapest medicine in combination with pricing regulation and the low level of medicine prices. The practice of discounting in the distribution chain implies that the National Health Fund and patients do not capture the potential savings from a <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> market where companies compete on price. This high-volume market has benefited in the past from the limited availability of originator medicines and a short data exclusivity period, even though there are no incentives for physicians to prescribe <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> and a financial disincentive for pharmacists to dispense <b>generic</b> <b>medicines.</b> Increased <b>generic</b> substitution would be expected to reduce public expenditure on originator medicines by 21 %. CONCLUSION: To develop a competitive and sustainable market, Poland needs to consider moving away from competition by discount to competition by price. This could be achieved by replacing maximum distribution margins by fixed margins. Also, Poland may wish to raise reference prices as a temporary measure to boost market entry for medicine classes with few <b>generic</b> <b>medicines.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 {{passed into}} law in July 2013 and legislated for generic {{substitution}} in Ireland. The aim {{of the study was}} to ascertain the knowledge and perceptions of stakeholders i. e. patients, pharmacists and prescribers, of <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> and to <b>generic</b> substitution with the passing of legislation. METHODS: Three stakeholder specific questionnaires were developed to assess knowledge of and perceptions to <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> and <b>generic</b> substitution. Purposive samples of patients, prescribers and pharmacists were analysed. Descriptive quantitative and qualitative analyses were undertaken. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 762 healthcare professionals and 353 patients were recruited. The study highlighted that over 84 % of patients were familiar with <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> and are supportive of the concept of generic substitution. Approximately 74 [*]% of prescribers and 84 [*]% of pharmacists were supportive of generic substitution in most cases. The main areas of concern highlighted by the healthcare professionals that might impact on the successful implementation of the policy, were the issue of bioequivalence with <b>generic</b> <b>medicines,</b> the computer software systems used at present in general practitioner (GP) surgeries and the availability of branded generics. The findings from this study identify a high baseline rate of acceptance to <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> and <b>generic</b> substitution among patients, prescribers and pharmacists in the Irish setting. The concerns of the main stakeholders provide a valuable insight into the potential difficulties that may arise in its implementation, and the need for on-going reassurance and proactive dissemination of the impact of the generic substitution policy. CONCLUSION: The existing positive attitude to <b>generic</b> <b>medicines</b> and <b>generic</b> substitution among key stakeholders in Ireland to generic substitution, combined with appropriate support and collaboration should result in the desired increase in rates of prescribing, dispensing and use of <b>generic</b> <b>medicines...</b>|$|R
