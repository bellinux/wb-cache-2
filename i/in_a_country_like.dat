25|$|The {{strength}} of Guizot’s oration was his straightforward style of speaking. He {{was essentially a}} ministerial speaker, far more powerful in defence than in opposition. Nor was he less a master of parliamentary tactics and of those sudden changes and movements in debate which, as in a battle, sometimes change the fortune of the day. His confidence in himself, and {{in the majority of}} the chamber which he had moulded to his will, was unbounded; and long success and the habit of authority led him to forget that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> France there was a people outside the chamber elected by a small constituency, to which the minister and the king himself were held responsible.|$|E
25|$|This {{could be}} a reason why {{environmental}} Kuznets curves {{have been found to}} be applicable to only certain types of pollutants. Yandle et al. argue that the EKC has not been found to apply to carbon because most pollutants create localized problems like lead and sulfur, so there is a greater urgency and response to cleaning up such pollutants. As a country develops, the marginal value of cleaning up such pollutants makes a large direct improvement to the quality of citizens' lives. Conversely, reducing carbon dioxide emissions does not have a dramatic impact at a local level, so the impetus to clean them up is only for the altruistic reason of improving the global environment. This becomes a tragedy of the commons where it is most efficient for everyone to pollute and for no one to clean up, and everyone is worse as a result (Hardin, 1968). Thus, even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> the US with a high level of income, carbon emissions are not decreasing in accordance with the EKC.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of the concert, Archbishop of Singapore, William Goh, {{expressed}} his dissatisfaction over the performance, claiming: [...] "Many have expressed their concern and even {{outrage at the}} performer’s disrespectful use of Catholic and other Christian symbols during her performances.

Goh later explained {{that it was not}} possible to be permissive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> Singapore with multi-racial and religious segments, since artistic express might be construed as disrespectful among active practitioners of a particular religion.

Karim refused to travel with the other Indians and appropriated the maid's bathroom for his exclusive use. On a visit to Coburg, he refused to attend the marriage of Victoria's granddaughter Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, because her father, Victoria's son Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, assigned him a seat in the gallery with the servants. Confronted by the opposition of her family and retainers, the Queen defended her favourite. She wrote to her private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby: [...] "to make out that the poor good Munshi is so low is really outrageous & <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> England quite out of place... She has known 2 Archbishops who were sons respectively of a Butcher & a Grocer...

2500|$|There {{are three}} systems of social {{stratification}} {{which are the}} caste system, estates system, [...] and class system. Castes system usually ascribed to children during birth whereby one receives the same stratification as of that of their parents. The caste system {{has been linked to}} religion and thus permanent. For example, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> India and Philippines person born in a poor family, they are supposed to remain poor also in their entire lifetime. The houses they live and the states they come from are the visible indicators. The stratification may be superior or inferior and thus influences the occupation and the social roles assigned to a person. Estate system is a state or society where individuals in this state were required to work on their land to receive some services like military protection, proper houses. Communities ranked according to the nobility of their lords. The class system is about income inequality and socio-political status. People can move the classes when they increase their level of income or if they have authority. People are expected to maximize their innate abilities and possessions. Social stratification characteristics include its universal, social, ancient, it’s in diverse forms and also consequential.|$|E

[...] Muti, breaking with opera protocol and the strict conventions of composer Verdi himself, turned to the audience and delivered a small speech, referring to the severe budget cuts announced by the Berlusconi government which would particularly affect the funding of the arts. He spoke of the need to keep culture alive in Italy, prompted, as he later stated, by the belief that [...] "killing culture <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> Italy is a crime against society. Culture is the spiritual glue that holds a people together." [...] He then invited the audience to participate in an encore of the [...] "Va, pensiero" [...] chorus – the invitation and the encore also a break from tradition for an opera performance. The opera audience stood up and sang along with the on-stage chorus. Muti recalls that [...] "80 percent of the audience knew the lyrics" [...] and sang along, while [...] "some members of the chorus were in tears." ...|$|E
