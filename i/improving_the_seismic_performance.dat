40|$|The {{results of}} a {{numerical}} investigation into the efficiency of glass fibre reinforced polymers (GFRPs) in <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of an 8 -storey moment resisting reinforced concrete building are presented. In order to assess {{the effect of the}} transverse reinforcement, the building is detailed with different levels of transverse reinforcement representing well-confined and poorly-confined conditions. Although GFRP wrapping of columns at critical regions is the main retrofitting technique considered in this study, the effect of increasing the beam ductility on the seismic performance of a structure is also evaluated for the code-compliant building. The retrofitting strategy aims to provide both columns and beams with more ductility and energy dissipation instead of increasing the lateral strength. The load–displacement curves obtained from pushover analysis of the frames are then used in the seismic assessment using a capacity spectrum approach (the N 2 method). The results confirm that GFRP wraps is capable of <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> and ductility of the poorly-confined structure substantially, compared to the original structure. However, it was found that using FRP composites in order to increase the ductility of code-compliant building only, was not that effective...|$|E

The 2003 Bam earthquake again highlighted the urgent need to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of buildings in Iran.

40|$|Abstract: Most {{losses of}} life and wealth in {{developing}} countries during earthquakes are due {{to the collapse of}} adobe houses. In spite of this, after considering differ-ent socioeconomic reasons and the availability of other alternate solutions, it is expected that these types of struc-tures will continue to be built for the decades to come, especially in developing countries. Seismic deficiencies of adobe structures are caused by their inelastic and brittle behavior and by weakness of the mortar. Reinforcement for adobe structures should be inexpensive, locally avail-able, and easy to construct. In this context, hemp, jute, and straw have been selected to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>seismic</b> resis-tance of adobe block. Cement has been selected to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> strength characteristics of the mortar. Uniaxial test results showed that jute and straw effectively incorpo-rate ductility in the adobe, but hemp is not effective to incorporate ductility in adobe. However, the strength of straw-reinforced adobe is significantly lower than that of jute-reinforced adobe. It means that jute is the best option among these fibers to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>performance.</b> Adobe reinforced with 2 % jute is the most effective to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of adobe block. Jute length should be 1 – 2 cm (0. 4 – 0. 8 in.) for <b>the</b> best <b>seismic</b> <b>performance.</b> With <b>the</b> use of jute or jute and cement together, the strength of the mortar can be increased.

30|$|But a few lessons became “Lessons Learned” {{and contributed}} to {{earthquake}} disaster risk reduction in some places. A good example of such “Lesson Learned” with high impact on loss consequences is the 1998 Fandoqa earthquake in Iran. The good seismic performance of the reinforced buildings and structures significantly lowered the death toll and the building destruction (Maheri et al. 2005). The lesson of <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>performance</b> of the adobe building construction was implemented after this area had experienced two devastating earthquakes in 1981. The first earthquake—Golbaf earthquake—occurred on 11 June 1981 with a Mw of 6.6 and caused 1400 fatalities and 3000 injuries. The second earthquake—Sirch earthquake—of Mw 7.0, occurred on 28 July 1981 and 1300 people were killed, 1000 were injured, and 25 villages were destroyed (Berberian 2005). The building reconstruction after the 1981 earthquake disasters resulted in reinforced buildings that did not suffer major damages and collapse after the 1998 Fandoqa earthquake. This was accomplished in simple and economical ways by improving the connections between the main load carriers and other structural elements of the buildings (Maheri et al. 2005).|$|E

The effectiveness of the dissipative friction device was numerically assessed on different typologies of precast structures by performing nonlinear dynamic analyses. The results of the numerical investigations showed that the introduction of the devices caused an increase of the dissipative capacity of the buildings. The plastic deformation concentrated inside the device, protecting the columns from severe damage. A significant reduction of top displacements was observed and the formation of the plastic hinges at the column base was delayed with respect to the unprotected structures.
