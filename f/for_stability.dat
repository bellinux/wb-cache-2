5|$|A {{more radical}} {{development}} was the synthesis in 2006 of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene by Bertrand's group. In this compound, which is stable at room temperature, the carbene atom {{is connected to}} two carbon atoms, in a three-member ring that retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated {{that the presence of}} heteroatoms next to the carbene is not necessary <b>for</b> <b>stability,</b> either.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these physiological processes, the body possesses a number of compensatory mechanisms to maintain function {{in the presence of}} residual paralysis. These include the use of weaker muscles at a higher than usual intensity relative to the muscle's maximal capacity, enhancing athletic development of previously little-used muscles, and using ligaments <b>for</b> <b>stability,</b> which enables greater mobility.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} {{some results}} about <b>stability</b> <b>for</b> {{a class of}} linear point-delayed systems and how to compute these results. This work uses some theorems on <b>stability</b> <b>for</b> delayed systems due to Mori [1 – 3]. Our method consists basically in finding extensions of such results {{to the case of}} an approximate representation of the linear delayed system, i. e., under which circumstances <b>stability</b> <b>for</b> an approximate representation of the delayed system implies <b>stability</b> <b>for</b> the exact (real) delayed system. Sufficient conditions <b>for</b> asymptotic <b>stability</b> of linear delayed systems are greatly simplified and straightforwardly computed under Taylor series representation of the system state equations. Conditions under which asymptotic <b>stability</b> <b>for</b> the approximate system implies asymptotic <b>stability</b> <b>for</b> the real system are also outlined in the paper...|$|R
5|$|The {{concept of}} an underwire {{can be traced to}} an 1893 patent that {{describes}} a breast supporting device using a rigid plate under the breasts <b>for</b> <b>stability.</b> The modern underwire bra was designed in the 1930s, and gained widespread popularity by the 1950s. As of 2005, underwire bras were the largest and fastest growing segment of the bra market. A bra without an underwire is a softcup bra.|$|E
5|$|A pair of {{experimental}} atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the National Institute of Standards and Technology {{has set a}} record <b>for</b> <b>stability.</b> NIST physicists reported in the August 22, 2013 issue of Science Express that the ytterbium clocks' ticks are stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion (1 followed by 18 zeros), roughly 10 times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks. The clocks would be accurate within a second for a period comparable {{to the age of}} the universe.|$|E
5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering {{the root of}} a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within {{the root of the}} tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth <b>for</b> <b>stability.</b> At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the root. The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the root apex.|$|E

By constructing a set of time-varying Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional combined with Newton-Leibniz formula, a switching rule <b>for</b> exponential <b>stability</b> of switched recurrent neural networks with interval time-varying delay has been presented and new sufficient conditions <b>for</b> the exponential <b>stability</b> <b>for</b> the system have been derived in terms of LMIs.|$|R

5|$|Different {{combinations}} of players, gongs and mallets {{can be used}} for playing the agung: two players with each assigned their own gong or just one. When playing alone, the agung player could either play both gongs with the player holding the higher-pitched gongs face-to-face, with the lower one held at an angle by an assistant <b>for</b> <b>stability,</b> or just one gong. The latter style, common among downriver Maguindanaos in Simuay, who consider this style an old one, uses only the higher-pitch gong for it, unlike the lower-pitched gong, is considered the lead gong, therefore having primary importance. An example of this is when single gong agungs are used during a tagunggo piece.|$|E
5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft <b>for</b> <b>stability</b> or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
5|$|Most of them {{unscrewed}} at {{once and}} 530kilograms (1170lb) of rope were lost, while the three explorers could simultaneously be seen to dump 210kilograms of sand overboard to get the basket clear of the water. Seven hundred and forty kilograms (1630lb) of essential weight was thus lost {{in the first few}} minutes. Before it was well clear of the launch site, the Eagle had turned from a supposedly steerable craft into an ordinary hydrogen balloon with a few ropes hanging from it, {{at the mercy of the}} wind; its crew had no means to direct it to any particular goal and had too little ballast <b>for</b> <b>stability.</b> Lightened, the balloon rose to 700meters (2300ft), an unimagined height, where the lower air pressure made the hydrogen escape all the faster through the eight million little holes.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{condition}} which is both necessary and sufficient <b>for</b> quadratic <b>stability</b> of an uncertain/nonlinear system. This condition is a linear matrix inequality in the Lyapunov matrix and a multiplier matrix associated with the uncertain/nonlinear terms. It is known that this condition is sufficient <b>for</b> quadratic <b>stability.</b> The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate that it is also a necessary condition, and hence is not a conservative condition <b>for</b> quadratic <b>stability.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|River otters swim by quadrupedal paddling, forelimb paddling, {{alternate}} hind-limb paddling, simultaneous hind-limb paddling, or {{body and}} tail dorsoventral undulation. The tail, which is stout and larger in surface area than the limbs, is used <b>for</b> <b>stability</b> while swimming and for short bursts of rapid propulsion. While swimming at the surface, the dorsal {{portion of the}} river otter's head, including nostrils, ears, and eyes, is exposed above water. It must remain in motion to maintain its position at the surface.|$|E
5|$|When swimming, baleen whales rely {{on their}} {{flippers}} for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Flipper movement is continuous. While doing this, baleen whales use their tail fluke to propel themselves forward through vertical motion while using their flippers for steering, much like an otter. Some species leap out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Because of their great size, right whales are not flexible or agile like dolphins, and none can move their neck because of the fused cervical vertebrae; this sacrifices speed <b>for</b> <b>stability</b> in the water. The hind legs are enclosed inside the body, and {{are thought to be}} vestigial organs. However, a 2014 study suggests that the pelvic bone serves as support for whale genitalia.|$|E
5|$|The HNC, {{which had}} representatives {{from a wide}} range of social groups, {{selected}} the aging civilian politician Phan Khắc Sửu as chief of state, and Suu chose Trần Văn Hương as prime minister, a position that had greater power. However, Khánh and the senior generals retained the real power. At the same time, a group of Catholic officers were trying to replace Khánh with their co-religionist, General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, and the incumbent was under pressure. During 1964, South Vietnam had suffered a succession of setbacks on the battlefield, in part due to disunity in the military and a focus on coup plotting. In the meantime, both Saigon and Washington were planning a large-scale bombing campaign against North Vietnam in an attempt to deter communist aggression, but were waiting <b>for</b> <b>stability</b> in the south before starting the air strikes.|$|E
