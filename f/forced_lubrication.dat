500|$|For reasons {{including}} expected hostilities with Japan, requiring travel {{across the}} Pacific Ocean, long operational range was a recurrent theme in all US battleship designs. [...] As an experiment, these ships received different powerplants. Delaware received triple-expansion reciprocating engines, while North Dakota was fitted with Curtiss direct drive steam turbine engines. Both ships had 14 Babcock & Wilcox boilers, both original power plants were rated at and both ships {{were capable of}} reaching 21 knots. Chief Constructor Washington L. Capps predicted North Dakota would have a 25 percent shorter radius than Delaware at 16 knots and 45 percent less at 14 knots, based on tank tests and the known performance of steam turbines at that time. This estimate was proved true during the ships' trial runs in 1909. Also, because Delawares engine bearings were equipped with <b>forced</b> <b>lubrication</b> instead of a gravity-fed system, {{she was able to}} steam at full speed for 24 hours without any need for engine repair. This would normally have been unthinkable as reciprocating engines were known generally to shake themselves apart if run at full power for long. However, this penchant for reliability came under question in the late 1930s as battleships with reciprocating engines performed poorly in the Pacific. By 1915, more powerful and efficient geared turbines had been installed in North Dakota to replace her Curtiss turbines. [...] These provided [...] horsepower, some [...] greater than her original engines.|$|E

50|$|An oil shear brake has {{a series}} of {{friction}} discs and steel plates similar to the clutches in an automobile automatic transmission. The shaft carrying the friction discs {{is attached to the}} load through a coupling. A piston pushes the stack of friction discs and steel plates together creating shear in the oil between the discs and plates applying a torque. Torque control can be pneumatic or hydraulic. <b>Force</b> <b>lubrication</b> maintains a film of oil between the surfaces to eliminate wear. Reaction is smooth to zero RPM without stick-slip. Loads up to hundreds of thermal horsepower can be absorbed through the required <b>force</b> <b>lubrication</b> and cooling unit. Most often, the brake is kinetically grounded through a torque arm anchored by a strain gauge which produces a current under load fed to the dynamometer control. Proportional or servo control valves are generally used to allow the dynamometer control to apply pressure to provide the program torque load with feedback from the strain gauge closing the loop. As torque requirements go up there are speed limitations.|$|R

50|$|Oil {{pressure}} {{is an important}} factor in the longevity of most internal combustion engines. With a <b>forced</b> <b>lubrication</b> system (invented by Frederick Lanchester), oil is picked up by a positive displacement oil pump and forced through oil galleries (passageways) into bearings, such as the main bearings, big end bearings and camshaft bearings or balance shaft bearings. Other components such as cam lobes and cylinder walls are lubricated by oil jets.|$|E
50|$|Typically a <b>forced</b> <b>lubrication</b> {{systems have}} a {{lubricant}} flow higher {{than what is}} required to lubricate satisfactorily, in order to assist with cooling. Specifically, the lubricant system helps to move heat from the hot engine parts to the cooling liquid (in water-cooled engines) or fins (in air-cooled engines) which then transfer it to the environment. The lubricant must be designed to be chemically stable and maintain suitable viscosities within the temperature range it encounters in the engine.|$|E

40|$|Deep {{drawing is}} one of the most used sheet metal forming {{processes}} in the production of automotive components, LPG bottles and household goods, among others. The formability of a blank depends on the process parameters such as blank holder <b>force,</b> <b>lubrication,</b> punch and die radii, die-punch clearance, in addition to material properties and thickness of the sheet metal. This paper presents a numerical study made on the deep drawing of LPG bottles. In particular, the application of both variable blank holder forces and contact friction conditions at specific location during deep drawing are considered. The numerical simulations were carried out with DD 3 IMP FE code. A variable blank holder force strategy was applied and the numerical results were compared with results from other blank holder force schemes. It is evident that the proposed variable blank holder force scheme reduces the blank thinning when compared to other schemes; the friction coefficient also has a significant influence on the stress-strain distribution.

This allowed them to produce double-acting engines that were more compact than single-acting. Where a single cylinder engine could replace a small twin cylinder engine, this was also a useful cost saving. Although some steam generating sets remained in use well into the 1980s, these were almost all of the Belliss and Morcom double-acting type.|$|E
50|$|Green's {{continued}} to design motorcycle engines too, using cylinders similar to, though smaller than, those on their prize-winning aero-engine, having similar rubber-sealed copper jackets and removable overhead valve mechanisms {{designed to protect}} the cylinders from damage by broken valves, and <b>forced</b> <b>lubrication</b> throughout. In 1914, Motor Cycle magazine reported on a Zenith motorcycle supplied with the 'new' 964cc (8HP) V-twin Green engine, of 85mm bore and stroke.

40|$|We use {{analytical}} {{theory and}} numerical simulation {{to study the}} role of short-range hydrodynamics (<b>lubrication</b> <b>forces)</b> in determining the lifetime of colloidal bonds. Such insight is useful in understanding many aspects of colloidal systems, such as gelation, nucleation, yielding, and rejuvenation, and as a paradigm for diffusion-controlled dissociation reactions in liquids. Our model system consists of spherical particles with an attractive square-well potential of variable width δ. We find that the predicted colloidal bond lifetimes can be substantially increased upon the inclusion of <b>lubrication</b> <b>forces,</b> to an extent {{that depends on the}} attraction range. An analytical law is derived that predicts this enhancement {{as a function of the}} well width, in quantitative agreement with simulation data. For sufficiently short-ranged attraction, <b>lubrication</b> <b>forces</b> dramatically enhance the drag on two bonded particles, leading to reduced effective diffusion coefficients and, hence, longer bond lifetimes. This effect disappears upon an increase in the width of the attractive wells beyond a length scale comparable to the particle diameter. The simulation further suggests that the role of <b>lubrication</b> <b>forces</b> becomes less important as confinement is increased, i. e., upon approaching the supersaturation limit, ϕ ≈ 0. 5, where caging effects become important. Our findings complement recent studies of the role of long-range hydrodynamic interactions, contributing to a comprehensive description of the subtle link between hydrodynamics and bonding in attractive colloids.

40|$|International audienceA {{hydrodynamic}} model {{is used for}} numerical simulations of a polymer solution in a dip-coating-like experiment. We focus on the regime of small capillary numbers where the liquid flow is driven by evaporation, {{in contrast to the}} well-known Landau-Levich regime dominated by viscous <b>forces.</b> <b>Lubrication</b> approximation is used to describe the flow in the liquid phase. Evaporation in stagnant air is considered (diffusion-limited evaporation), which results in a coupling between liquid and gas phases. Self-patterning due to the solutal Marangoni effect is observed for some ranges of the control parameters. We first investigate the effect of evaporation rate on the deposit morphology. Then the role of the spatial variations in the evaporative flux on the wavelength and mean thickness of the dried deposit is ascertained, by comparing the 2 D and 1 D diffusion models for the gas phase. Finally, for the very low substrate velocities, we discuss the relative importance of diffusive and advective components of the polymer flux, and consequences on the choice of the boundary conditions...|$|R

A shell from Scharnhorst, which did not explode, passed through the Director Control Tower, killing eleven men and putting the tower out of action.

The ball joints which gave flexibility to the steam and exhaust pipes were located immediately under and concentric with the pivot centres and were served by <b>forced</b> <b>lubrication</b> from Wakefield mechanical lubricators. Two 8 ft lubricators, one on each engine unit, supplied one feed to each cylinder and each steam chest, two to the ball joints and two to the tail-end extensions of the piston rods.

40|$|The role of {{interactions}} between close {{particles in the}} shear thickening of concentrated colloids is examined by using a Stokesian dynamics simulation of model systems. The interactions are repulsive thermodynamic <b>forces</b> and <b>lubrication</b> <b>forces.</b> Three different models are contrasted in their thickening behavior: Brownian spheres, polymer coated spheres, and Hookian spheres. Respectively, they show: a "mild" continuous thickening, a "strong" continuous thickening, and a strain thickening with loss of steady state. The relationship of order-disorder transitions and thickening is examined. Depending on the volume fraction and range of repulsive forces, thickening can be observed with or without an order-disorder transition at its onset. The different thickening responses arise from the dependence of the relaxation time of close particle contacts on interparticle gap. A time-scale based criterion for strong thickening is proposed {{and supported by the}} simulations. A simple theoretical model based the motion of a pair of particles leads to this criterion, but also predicts the mild thickening of Brownian spheres. It gives a simple fitting of flow curves which includes the details of the interparticle interactions. (C) 2004 The Society of Rheology. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} role of {{hydrodynamic}} interactions in the collective behaviour of collections of microscopic active particles suspended in a fluid.

Hence we are able to systematically show that <b>lubrication</b> <b>forces</b> when the particles are very close to each other play as important a role as long-range hydrodynamic interactions in determining their many-body behaviour. We find that motility-induced phase separation is suppressed by near-field interactions, leading to open gel-like clusters rather than dense clusters.

30|$|The {{tangential}} {{component of}} the immersed particle contact force is simplified and modeled such as for dry particle collisions. A friction coefficient of 0.2 typical for dry sand is used (Itasca 2004). Joseph and Hunt (2004) concluded that tangential component of particles submerged in fluid at the contact point {{is similar to a}} dry system, but with a lower friction coefficient due to the lubrication effects. However, for collisions of rough particles at increasing tangential Stokes number, the friction coefficient rises to a value that approximates the dry friction coefficient (Joseph and Hunt 2004). However, because of the <b>lubrication</b> <b>force</b> that increases as particles approach each other, complete particle surface contact is almost impossible to occur for particles submerged in fluid with higher viscosity when tangential friction is activated. This principle, for example, governs the lubrication of ball bearings (Davis et al. 1986). Turbulent flow is accounted for in the DEM–CFD code and depending on the CFD mesh size particles are caught by different velocity streamlines, which can further promote collision frequency and particle agglomeration. The particle radius is crucial for the relationship between drag force and normal particle contact <b>force</b> with <b>lubrication.</b>|$|R
