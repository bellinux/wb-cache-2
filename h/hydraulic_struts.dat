50|$|Paul Magès (1908-1999) {{is known}} for his {{invention}} of the first self-leveling automobile suspension, known as hydro-pneumatic suspension. This system replaced conventional steel springs with an adaptive system of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>struts,</b> resulting in a motoring experience that felt like no other automobile of the era.|$|E
50|$|On cars {{where the}} trunk release is {{electronically}} operated, {{it can be}} triggered to open by {{a button on the}} remote. Conventionally, the trunk springs open with the help of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>struts</b> or torsion springs, and thereafter must be lowered manually. Premium models, such as SUVs and estates with tailgates, may have a motorized assist that can both open and close the tailgate for easy access and remote operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} carriage {{is constructed}} {{from a combination}} of bolted aluminium and 4130 steel tubing. Inflight steering is accomplished via a weight-shift tilt-bar that actuates the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. On the ground the aircraft has lever-controlled nosewheel steering. The factory-provided canopy is an Apco Ram Air with an area of 550 sq ft. The landing gear incorporates independent <b>hydraulic</b> <b>struts</b> for suspension. The aircraft is factory-supplied {{in the form of an}} assembly kit that requires 50 hours to complete.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a backstepping based fuzzy logic (FL) scheme for the active control of vehicle {{suspension}} systems using the two-degrees of freedom or 1 / 4 car model. The full dynamics of a novel <b>hydraulic</b> <b>strut</b> are considered. The servo-valve dynamics are also included. A fuzzy logic system is used to estimate the nonlinear <b>hydraulic</b> <b>strut</b> dynamics. The backstepping fuzzy logic scheme is shown to give superior performance over passive suspension and active suspension control using conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) schemes. The FL system is adapted {{in such a way}} as to estimate on-line the unknown hydraulic dynamics and provide the backstepping loop with the desired servo-valve positioning so that the scheme becomes adaptive, guaranteeing bounded tracking errors and parameter estimates. A rigorous proof of stability and performance is given and a simulation example verifies performance. Unlike standard adaptive backstepping techniques, no linear-in-the-paramete [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Land Rover {{developed}} a different {{system for the}} Range Rover in the early 1970s. The Range Rover {{was intended to be}} as comfortable on the road as a normal saloon car yet as capable of heavy off-road use as a traditional Land Rover. This highlighted the contradiction in suspension design as the Range Rover used all-round long-travel coil springs. If these were kept soft to maintain comfort they would compress too much under a heavy payload, restricting axle travel when off-road and compromising handling. Land Rover {{developed a}} self-energising <b>hydraulic</b> <b>strut</b> as part of the rear suspension.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike other {{motorcycles}} {{that offer}} detachable side or top cases for storage, the PC800 has an integral waterproof trunk under the pillion (passenger seat). The passenger seat {{is attached to}} a single trunk lid that hinges upward to reveal two storage areas that straddle the rear wheel [...] - [...] with sufficient capacity to carry [...] "two full-face helmets and two medium-sized gym bags", or [...] "two grocery bags", or [...] "four plastic bags full of groceries, along with a small bag of dog food." [...] The trunk lid is held up by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>strut</b> and is controlled by a release mechanism under the lockable fuel filler door.|$|R
5000|$|The UZZ32 {{was the top}} of {{the line}} 30 series, {{featuring}} all of the options available on the UZZ31 and the addition of four-wheel steering and a complex, computer-controlled hydraulic Toyota Active Control Suspension. This did away with conventional springs and anti-roll (stabiliser) bars in favour of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>struts</b> controlled by an array of sensors (such as yaw velocity sensors, vertical G sensors, height sensors, wheel speed sensors, longitudinal and lateral G sensors) that detected cornering, acceleration and braking forces.|$|E

The system worked well and gave an unusually controlled yet smooth ride with no body roll. However, the additional weight and power requirements of the system affected straight-line performance somewhat.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{design for a}} Stewart {{platform}} (or hexapod), an apparatus which performs positioning tasks with high accuracy. The platform, which is supported by six <b>hydraulic</b> telescopic <b>struts,</b> provides {{six degrees of freedom}} with 1 μm resolution. Rotations about user defined pivot points can be specified for any axis of rotation with microradian accuracy. Motion of the platform is performed by changing the strut lengths. Servo systems set and maintain the length of the struts to high precision using proportional hydraulic valves and incremental encoders. The combination of hydraulic actuators and a design which is optimized in terms of mechanical stiffness enables the platform to manipulate loads of up to 20 kN. Sophisticated software allows direct six–axis positioning including true path control. Our platform is an ideal support structure for a large variety of scientific instruments that require a stable alignment base with high-precision motion...|$|R
40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} {{method is}} presented for non-intrusively measuring hydraulic fluid level in aircraft struts {{in the field}} quickly and easily without modifying the strut or aircraft. The technique interrogates the strut with ultrasonic waves generated and received by a removable ultrasonic transducer hand-held {{on the outside of}} the strut in a fashion that inthe presence or absence of hydraulic fluid inside the strut. This technique was successfully demonstrated on an A- 6 aircraft strut on the carriage at the Aircraft Landing Dynamics Research Facility at NASA Langley Research Center. Conventional practice upon detection of strut problem symptoms is to remove aircraft from service for extensive maintenance to determine fluid level. No practical technique like the method presented herein for locating <b>strut</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fluid level is currently known to be used...|$|R
40|$|International audienceKelvin cell foams are an {{idealization}} of replication foams and nowadays {{are also}} materialized for various industrial purposes. There are several works dealing with thermo-hydraulic properties of foams {{in relation to}} their structure. The thermo-hydraulic behavior of open-cell foams depends on their microscopic structure. Various ideal periodic isotropic structures of tetrakaidecahedron shapes with constant cross section of the ligament having circular, square, diamond, hexagon, and star strut shapes with various orientations are studied. Computer aided design (CAD) modeling has been used to produce various shapes in the porosity range from 60 to 95 %. A generalized analytical model has been proposed in order to obtain geometrical parameters correctly as they have substantial influence on thermal and <b>hydraulic</b> phenomena, where <b>strut</b> geometry is of primary importance. Various relationships between different geometrical parameters and porosities are presented. The analytical results are compared with experimental data from the literature. An excellent agreement has been observed between the predicted correlations, data obtained from CAD measurements, and experiments...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} gate machinery {{consisted of}} a huge drive wheel, powered by an electric motor, to which was attached a connecting rod, which in turn attached {{to the middle of}} the gate. These mechanisms were replaced with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>struts</b> beginning in January 1998, after 84 years of service. The gates are hollow and buoyant, much like the hull of a ship, and are so well balanced that two [...] motors are enough to move each gate leaf. If one motor fails, the other can still operate the gate at reduced speed.|$|E
5000|$|Following a {{familiar}} pattern with Glas new model launches, {{it was nearly}} a year later, in July 1966, that new V8s started {{to emerge from the}} Glas plant at Dingolfing. The 2580 cc engine produced a claimed maximum power output of 110 kW (150 PS), which was sufficient to take the full four-seater up to a maximum speed of 198 km/h (123 mph) where conditions on the country's rapidly growing Autobahn highway network allowed. Thanks to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>struts</b> developed by Boge, this was the first production car in Germany to feature self-levelling suspension. Failure to match the targeted 200 km/h (126 mph) maximum speed were attributed to [...] "problems" [...] involving the carburetors.|$|E

However, it is necessary to sufficiently analyze the electrohydraulic drive structure by providing suitable models to ensure that the struts have the characteristics required for these applications. This article presents the model structure while providing an overview on requirements and structures of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>struts</b> with special emphasis on the non-linearities of the line and ways of compensating for it.

40|$|International audienceThe thermo-physical {{behavior}} of open-celled metal foams {{depends on their}} microscopic structure. An ideal periodic isotropic structure of tetrakaidecahedron shape i. e. Kelvin cell is studied. The geometrical parameters of casted metal foams are obtained using iMorph (in-house code). We have proposed an analytical model {{in order to obtain}} geometrical parameters correctly as they have substantial influence on thermal and <b>hydraulic</b> phenomena, where <b>strut</b> geometry is of primary importance. Various relationships between different geometrical parameters and porosities are presented. The analytical results are fully compared with the experimental data in the literature and measured morphological data. The relationship of geometrical parameters with physical properties such as effective thermal conductivity is equally important. The range of solid to fluid phase conductivity ratios (lambda(s) /lambda(f)) studied is from 10 to 30, 000 and for different porosities (80 - 95 %). A modified correlation term, F is introduced in order to take account of thermal conductivities of constituent phases using electrical resistor model. An excellent agreement has been observed between the predicted correlation and experimental data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made to determine the landing characteristics of a 1 / 4 -scale dynamic model of the Apollo spacecraft command module using two different active (heat shield deployed prior to landing) landing systems for impact attenuation. One landing system (configuration 1) consisted of six <b>hydraulic</b> <b>struts</b> and eight crushable honeycomb struts. The other landing system (configuration 2), consisted of four <b>hydraulic</b> <b>struts</b> and six strain straps. Tests made on water and the hard clay-gravel composite landing surfaces simulated parachute letdown (vertical) velocities of 23 ft/sec (7. 0 m/s) (full scale). Landings made on the sand landing surface simulated vertical velocities of 30 ft/sec (9. 1 m/s). Horizontal velocities of from 0 to 50 ft/sec (15 m/s) were simulated. Landing attitudes ranged from - 30 'degrees to 20 degrees, and the roll attitudes were O degrees, 90 degrees, and 180 degrees. For configuration 1, maximum normal accelerations at the vehicle center of gravity for landings on water, sand, and the hard clay-gravel composite surface were 9 g, 20 g, and 18 g, respectively. The maximum normal center-of-gravity acceleration for configuration 2 which was landed only on the hard clay-gravel landing surface was approximately 19 g. Accelerations for configuration 2 were generally equal to or lower than accelerations for configuration 1 and normal...|$|E
