5|$|During the {{transition}} from MS-DOS to Windows, the success of Microsoft's product Microsoft Office allowed the company to gain ground on application-software competitors, such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Novell, an owner of WordPerfect for a time, alleged that Microsoft used its inside knowledge of the DOS and Windows kernels and of undocumented Application Programming Interface features to make Office perform better than its competitors. Eventually, Microsoft Office became the dominant business suite, with a market share far exceeding that of its competitors. In March 1992, Microsoft released Windows 3.1 along with its first promotional campaign on TV; the software sold over three million copies in its first two months on the market. In October, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 was released with integrated networking abilities such as peer-to-peer file and printing sharing. In November, Microsoft released {{the first version of}} their popular <b>database</b> <b>software</b> Microsoft Access.|$|E

2500|$|Data storage became better {{organized}} {{after the}} development of relational <b>database</b> <b>software</b> that allowed data to be stored in different tables. [...] For example, a theoretical airline may have numerous tables such as: airplanes, employees, maintenance contractors, caterers, flights, airports, payments, tickets, etc. each containing a narrower set of more specific information than would a flat file, such as a spreadsheet. [...] These tables are related by common data fields called keys. (See: Relational model) Data can be retrieved in various specific configurations by posing a query without having to pull up a whole table. [...] This, for example, {{makes it easy to}} find a passenger's seat assignment by a variety of means such as ticket number or name, and provide only the queried information. [...] See: SQL ...|$|E

2500|$|Whilst Interactive fiction {{became a}} {{standard}} product for many software companies. By 1982 Softline wrote that [...] "the {{demands of the}} market are weighted heavily toward hi-res graphics" [...] in games like Sierra's The Wizard and the Princess and its imitators. Such graphic adventures became the dominant form of the genre on computers with graphics, like the Apple II. By 1982 Adventure International began releasing versions of its games with graphics. The company went bankrupt in 1985. Synapse Software and Acornsoft were also closed in 1985. Leaving Infocom as the leading company producing text-only adventure games on the Apple II with sophisticated parsers and writing, and still advertising its lack of graphics as a virtue. The company was bought by Activision in 1986 after the failure of Cornerstone, Infocom's <b>database</b> <b>software</b> program, and stopped producing text adventures a few years later. Soon after Telaium/Trillium also closed.|$|E
2500|$|The Firefox {{project has}} {{undergone}} several name changes.

Phoenix was renamed due to trademark issues with Phoenix Technologies; the replacement name, Firebird, provoked an intense response from the Firebird <b>database</b> <b>software</b> project. In response, the Mozilla Foundation stated that the browser would always bear the name Mozilla Firebird to avoid confusion. After further pressure, on February 9, 2004, Mozilla Firebird became Mozilla Firefox. The name Firefox was said to be derived from a nickname of the red panda, which became the mascot for the newly named project. For the abbreviation of Firefox, Mozilla prefers Fx or fx, though it is often abbreviated as FF.|$|E
