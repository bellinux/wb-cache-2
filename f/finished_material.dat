5|$|Although {{previous}} {{attempts to}} create a Simpsons film had been made, they failed {{due to the lack}} of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually in 2001, producers James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, Al Jean, Richard Sakai and Mike Scully began development of the film, and a writing team consisting of Brooks, Groening, Jean, Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, George Meyer, David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, Matt Selman, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was re-written over a hundred times, and this rewriting continued after the animation had begun in 2006. Consequently, hours of <b>finished</b> <b>material</b> was cut from the final release, including cameo roles from Erin Brockovich, Minnie Driver, Isla Fisher, Kelsey Grammer and Edward Norton. Hanks and Green Day appeared in the final cut as themselves.|$|E

500|$|Red Headed Stranger is the 18th studio album by American outlaw {{country singer}} Willie Nelson. After the wide {{success of his}} {{recordings}} with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson {{signed a contract with}} Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the [...] "Tale of the Red Headed Stranger", a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the <b>finished</b> <b>material</b> to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sessions}} for Village Green {{took place in}} a rough period for the group. In early 1968 legal and family issues slowed Ray Davies' songwriting and the song [...] "Wonderboy", released in April, was the first single since The Kinks' success not to enter the NME Top 30.

30|$|In {{the field}} tests, {{it must be}} noted that the floor impact sound {{insulation}} performance of the voided slab systems was performed without any floor <b>finishing</b> <b>material</b> or covering. The floors of apartment housing in South Korea commonly use standard floor finishings and structures for interlayer noise prevention, which generally consist of gypsum panels, lightweight porous concrete, side insulation, and finishing mortar. Additionally, it is reported that carpets and other soft resilient floor <b>finishing</b> <b>material,</b> such as carpet with rubber underlay, would be useful for reducing the influence of impact sound levels. However, the floor of this field test was bare, which means the <b>finishing</b> <b>material</b> or any type of noise resilient layers would be applied on top of the voided slab system. If the floor impact sound insulation performance test could be conducted after applying the construction <b>finishing</b> <b>materials</b> on top of the voided slab system, the floor impact sound insulation performance might be slightly better than that of the bare floor without finishing.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} noted that a panacea {{to the problem of}} housing in Nigeria is the {{persistent}} increase in the prices of building materials. This in turn increases cost of construction due to increase in prices of petroleum products which results in variation and fluctuation of market prices of materials for construction projects. Finishings materials are exceptionally affected because they carry significant cost proportion of building projects. In view of this, the paper was aimed at examining the influence of petroleum price increase on the prices of some selected building <b>finishing</b> <b>materials</b> in Niger State from 2006 - 2012 in the light of high construction cost in the Nigerian Construction Industry. The data collected were based on three basic <b>finishing</b> <b>materials,</b> which are floor tiles, gloss/emulsion paints and ceiling boards, with different alternatives for each <b>finishing</b> <b>material.</b> Correlation and Regression Analyses used to analyze the collected data showed some level of high significance between the independent variable (regulated petroleum prices) and the dependent variables (<b>finishing</b> <b>materials)</b> i. e. Coefficient of Determination of values ranging from 61 % to 90 %. It was concluded that increase in the regulated price of petroleum products accounts for high cost of <b>finishing</b> <b>materials</b> in building projects. One of the recommendations from the study included the need for a better regulating price system to adequately monitor price with regard to building materials...|$|R

As a result of this, the {{residential buildings}} have faced lack of ventilation and resulted in poor indoor air quality of buildings. In addition, recently gradually increased using of construction materials containing chemical components has made indoor air worse. International organization, government and public association have presented permissible emission standard of volatile organic compounds of construction materials and recommendation standard of indoor air quality in order to solve indoor air pollution problems. In Korea, the traditional floor heating system, ONDOL has been mainly used for house heating.

Moreover, we have reviewed [2] the state-of-the art research on composite materials made from recycled waste glass. Here, {{in this paper we}} focus on two novel designs of composite materials, first, a cube block, and, then, of control beams made from recycled tin-glass (TG). In cube blocks TG is placed inside its core, and in control beams TG is placed in three different orientations. There are two main categories of products which can be created by applying those two novel designs; structural <b>materials</b> and <b>finishing</b> <b>materials.</b> For structural materials, we propose a new method of placing a cover of metal on top of the TG when it is fully-immersed in the concrete.
