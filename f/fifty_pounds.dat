25|$|After {{a number}} of rejections, Emily's Wuthering Heights and Anne's Agnes Grey were {{accepted}} by the publisher Thomas Cautley Newby, but Charlotte's novel was rejected by every publisher to whom it was sent. Charlotte was not long in completing her second novel, Jane Eyre, which was immediately accepted by Smith, Elder & Co. {{and became the first}} of the sisters' novels to appear in print. While Anne and Emily's novels 'lingered in the press', Jane Eyre was an immediate and resounding success. Anne and Emily were obliged to pay <b>fifty</b> <b>pounds</b> to help meet their publishing costs. Their publisher, urged on by the success of Jane Eyre, published Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey in December 1847. They sold well, but Agnes Grey was outshone by Emily's more dramatic Wuthering Heights.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} {{vitality of}} pagans led Marcian, who became emperor {{of the east}} in 450 upon the death of Theodosius II, to repeat earlier prohibitions against pagan rites. Marcian decreed, in the year 451, that those who continued to perform the pagan rites would suffer the confiscation of their property and be condemned to death. Marcian also prohibited any attempt to re-open the temples and ordered {{that they were to}} remain closed. In addition to this, in order to encourage strict enforcement of the law a fine of <b>fifty</b> <b>pounds</b> of gold was imposed on any judge or governor, as well as the officials under him, who did not enforce this law. However, not even this act by Marcian had the desired effect, as his successor Leo I the Thracian will have to issue a new anti-pagan law in 472.|$|E
25|$|Skybus charged extra {{fees for}} almost {{everything}} {{other than the}} ticket itself. This is common among European low-cost carriers, but was almost unheard of at the time among major US carriers. Carry-on baggage (one bag plus one personal item) was free, but checked bags incurred an additional charge. The first two bags less than <b>fifty</b> <b>pounds</b> were $10 each online or $12 each at the counter, with each additional bag after two incurring a charge of $50 per bag. Overweight baggage, those weighing over fifty but under seventy-five pounds, was charged an extra $25, and all bags over seventy-five pounds were not accepted. Skybus did not through-check luggage onto connecting flights. Customers connecting on Skybus flights in Columbus were required to collect any checked luggage, then re-check it in Columbus for the second flight. Even though Skybus did not through-check luggage, delayed luggage was a continuing problem for its outsourced ground crews.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{spent six}} weeks in the hospital, {{receiving}} marginal care in a dirty, wet environment. [...] A prolonged attempt to set the fractures on his right arm, done without anesthetic, was unsuccessful; he received an operation on his broken leg but no treatment for his broken left arm. [...] He was temporarily taken to a clean room and interviewed by a French journalist, François Chalais, whose report was carried on the French television program Panorama in January 1968 {{and later in the}} U.S. on the CBS Evening News. [...] The film footage of McCain lying in the bed, in a cast, smoking cigarettes and speaking haltingly, would {{become one of the most}} widely distributed images of McCain's imprisonment. [...] McCain was observed by a variety of North Vietnamese, including renowned Vietnamese writer Nguyễn Tuân and Defense Minister and Army commander-in-chief General Võ Nguyên Giáp. [...] Many of the North Vietnamese observers assumed that McCain must be part of America's political-military-economic elite. [...] Now having lost <b>fifty</b> <b>pounds</b> (twenty-three kilograms), in a chest cast, covered in grime and eyes full of fever, and with his hair turned white, in early December 1967 McCain was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp on the outskirts of Hanoi nicknamed [...] "the Plantation". He was placed in a cell with George [...] "Bud" [...] Day, a badly injured and tortured Air Force pilot (later awarded the Medal of Honor) and Norris Overly, another Air Force pilot; they did not expect McCain to live another week. Overly, and subsequently Day, nursed McCain and kept him alive; Day later recalled that McCain had [...] "a fantastic will to live".|$|E

2500|$|Bradley Nutting {{makes the}} {{argument}} {{that it was the}} early Golden Age pirates raping and pillaging of several Muslim pilgrims in 1695 that was initially responsible for the flood of legislation in the early eighteenth century. [...] Following Henry Avery's capture of the mogul ship quote, the East India Company petitioned the Privy Council in 1696 to issue a proclamation of arrest. A reward of <b>fifty</b> <b>pounds</b> was offered for Avery's crew, while five-hundred pounds was offered for Avery himself. Those incidences lead to the Piracy Act of 1700. The legislation took two years to pass after repeated pressures from the East India Company and the Board of Trade. There was now authorization to set up vice-admiralty courts throughout the colonies with legal authority to carry out sentencing. The first notable pirate to be brought to trial with this new set of laws was Captain Kidd. Kidd was denied an adequate defense, as well as the ability to review documents he claimed would exonerate him. Ironically, he was acquitted of piracy, but convicted of murder. Regardless, he was executed and his body was hung in chains over the River Thames for years.|$|E
