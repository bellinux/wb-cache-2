5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that it felt so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that <b>he</b> <b>respects</b> it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E

Others are less complimentary and in the BBC series The Way We Cooked in an episode dedicated to Cradock and Graham Kerr, Keith Floyd and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, amongst others, disparaged her methods and cooking skill.

Julieta is racked by the loss and her attempts to find Antía are unsuccessful. The only contact she has is a blank card on her 19th, 20th and 21st birthdays. After the latter she is enraged and destroys most traces of her daughter in her life, moving from her apartment. She visits Ava, who has multiple sclerosis and is dying. Ava tells her that Antía knew about the argument that precipitated Xoan's death and blamed Julieta and Ava, and that she had ultimately internalised guilt about this because she was away at camp at the time. At Ava's funeral, Julieta meets Lorenzo and the two embark on a happy relationship, which distracts Julieta from her loss. She tells him nothing of Antía and <b>he</b> <b>respects</b> that she has some secrets in her life.|$|E

25|$|The savage, like ourselves, {{feels the}} oppression of his {{impotence}} before the powers of Nature; but having in himself nothing that <b>he</b> <b>respects</b> more than Power, {{he is willing to}} prostrate himself before his gods, without inquiring whether they are worthy of his worship. Pathetic and very terrible is the long history of cruelty and torture, of degradation and human sacrifice, endured in the hope of placating the jealous gods: surely, the trembling believer thinks, when what is most precious has been freely given, their lust for blood must be appeased, and more will not be required. The religion of Moloch — as such creeds may be generically called — is in essence the cringing submission of the slave, who dare not, even in his heart, allow the thought that his master deserves no adulation. Since the independence of ideals is not yet acknowledged, Power may be freely worshipped, and receive an unlimited respect, despite its wanton infliction of pain.|$|E

Whatever one thinks of the over-the-top bravado rapping, the tracks and beats Dre assembled are beyond reproach". The Chronic brought G-funk to the mainstream – a genre defined by slow bass beats and melodic synthesizers, topped by P-Funk samples, female vocals, and a laconic, laid-back lyrical delivery referred to as a [...] "lazy drawl". The album takes its name from a slang term for premium grade cannabis, chronic. The album cover is an homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers. Robert Christgau said that, although he [...] "can't stand" [...] it, <b>he</b> <b>respects</b> The Chronic [...] "for its influence and iconicity".|$|E

Michael's cab to the airport then arrives, and Michael departs the office after one last look at the employees, exiting silently. His cab pulls out of the parking lot just as Pam is pulling in. At the airport, Michael asks the camera crew to inform him if the documentary ever airs, then turns over his microphone, quipping one last [...] "That's what she said" [...] about how good it will feel to [...] "get this thing [...] off [...] chest".

500|$|On April 26, 2016, Deadline {{reported}} that Aml Ameen abruptly left production {{a couple of}} episodes into filming of the second season over a conflict with Lana Wachowski that started during the table read for the season and progressively got worse.

Subsequent to Ameen's departure, the role of Capheus was recast to Toby Onwumere after a seven-day auditioning process. Onwumere watched a few episodes of the show to prepare for his audition, as he had not seen it before. The actor said about his approach to the character: [...] "My duty [...] not to emulate exactly what [...] has done, ... but just to give it my own spin, and kind of do my own thing, and just give this character the same essence, but ... maybe a different life and a different take on it." [...] Earlier in April, Kick Gurry, who had played parts in the Wachowskis' Speed Racer and Jupiter Ascending in the past, revealed he had been cast in the second season, after Lana called to inform him that they had a written a role specifically for him. In May, Deadline reported Ben Cole had been cast as Todd, a sensate who would rather be [...] "normal". In September, Sylvester McCoy reportedly revealed he filmed three or four episodes of the second season of a Netflix show, later identified to be Sense8, and has signed to appear in further seasons if he is wanted. Martin Wuttke, who had minor roles in Cloud Atlas, also joined the cast in the second season.|$|E

You appreciate someone who respects the game like he does, respects the people he plays with and against, and obviously his results speak for themselves." [...] In a Sports Illustrated cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, [...] "Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers." [...] Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; {{at the time of his}} retirement, he was the only active player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson's retired number. Speaking about Rivera's connection to her husband, Robinson's widow Rachel said, [...] " [...] carried himself with dignity and grace, and that made carrying the number a tribute to Jack... I've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something special to it." [...] Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, Selig said: [...] "Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity.

500|$|A {{teenager}} {{struggling to}} find his place in life ever since his parents disappeared {{when he was a}} child. A spider bites him {{on the back of his}} neck, giving him spider-powers.

[...] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, [...] "I was thinking of my history and thinking of the kid at school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people– including myself– and who I constantly tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to". Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said <b>he</b> <b>respects</b> Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he [...] "was blown away by his interpretation." [...] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man. On accepting the role Garfield explained, [...] "I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to." [...] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is [...] "a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit." [...] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible. When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine [...] "a better actor in the suit", which he described as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight. When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.|$|E
