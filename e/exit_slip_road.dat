The site was {{served by a}} large, internal railway system which left the Manchester to Crewe mainline prior to Handforth railway station. The site of the exchange sidings and junction is {{at the rear of}} the Pets At Home offices on Epsom Avenue. The depot had its own shunting locomotives, which were stored in an engine shed that stood at the Wilmslow bound <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> for the Handforth Dean shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|Junction 28 of the M5 {{lies within}} the parish of Cullompton {{and a short}} {{distance}} from the town centre. Other major road links are the A373 to Honiton and the former A38 to Exeter which runs through the town, and is now the B3181. In 2001 61.6% of people living in Cullompton travelled to work by car or van and 83% of households had at least one car. In October 1969 a bypass was completed but after only five years this was upgraded to form part of the M5. Since this time traffic coming from the south of Cullompton to the M5 junction has had to pass through the centre of the town. There are now problems with air quality in the town and Mid Devon District Council have made the whole of the built up area in Cullompton an Air quality management area. Traffic on the <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> leaving the M5 northbound often backed up onto the motorway, so the Highways Agency and Devon County Council made junction improvements by widening roads, introducing traffic lights and reopening the left hand lane of the northbound slip road, at a cost of Â£1.3m. This cost was covered by businesses moving to Cullompton.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2014 the N7 flyover and <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> {{to replace}} the {{at-grade}} signal controlled crossing were opened. This eliminated the last signal-controlled crossing on the N7/M7 route between the M50 and Limerick.|$|R
50|$|Initially service {{areas were}} located between {{junctions}} (on-line sites), having their own entry and <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>roads,</b> {{with a separate}} site for each direction of travel, though a recent trend has been to locate service areas instead at junction sites: the two most recent openings, Wetherby and Beaconsfield, are examples: they are located at A1(M) junction 46, and M40 junction 2 respectively.|$|R
2500|$|Just over [...] after {{junction}} 6 the motorway {{passes to}} within 100 metres of St Giles Church, Tetsworth and [...] farther on meets {{the first of}} three junctions in close succession. Junction 7 is a restricted junction with the A329 serving Thame and the A40. Access is limited allowing exit for only northbound traffic and entry only for southbound traffic. The <b>exiting</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> on the southbound M40 at J7 is for [...] "Works Traffic Only" [...] to a depot. A <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> exists to allow traffic from the A329 to join the M40 north but is closed to traffic by a gate: this traffic must therefore follow the A40 to Junction 8, [...] to the north.|$|R

50|$|The {{operating}} company must also pay {{the full cost}} of constructing the entry and <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and all other features required for safe access to motorway services, as well as the motorway services facility itself. In other countries, the authority responsible for the highway tends to subsidise these costs on the grounds that these areas are partly a public service to drivers. The leases provide that motorway services must operate 24 hours a day, and the costs of providing utilities and services are high. With very few customers in the early morning, they need to earn the money in other ways.|$|R
25|$|At Newlands Cross a flyover and <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> {{replaced}} the at-grade signal controlled crossing in November 2014. This eliminated the last signal-controlled crossing on the N7/M7 route between the M50 and Limerick. Traffic for Clondalkin {{to the north}} and Tallaght to the south leave the N7 by <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> connecting to the R113. The N7 continues southwards to bypass Citywest, Saggart, Rathcoole, Kill and Johnstown in County Kildare. These locations are all served with grade-separated interchanges which were constructed as part of the upgrade works completed in the mid-2000s. The old junctions consisted of traffic lights with a break in the dual-carriageway median. The three lane section ends at junction 9 (Naas, Sallins) with a left hand lane-drop/lane-gain for traffic leaving/entering here.|$|R

25|$|These roundabouts do {{not form}} a {{complete}} circle {{and have a}} raindrop or teardrop shape. They appear at U.S. Interstate interchanges to provide a free-flowing left turn to the on-ramps and {{eliminating the need for}} turn signals and lanes. Since the entry and <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> are one-way, a complete circle is unnecessary. This means that drivers entering the roundabout from the bridge do not need to give way, and that prevents queuing on narrow, two-lane bridges. These roundabouts have been used at dumbbell roundabout junctions, replacing traffic signals that are inefficient without a turning lane. Several junctions along Interstate 70 near Avon, Colorado use teardrop roundabouts.|$|R
2500|$|Starting at the {{northern}} end, the motorway starts in Wallasey at the <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> from the Kingsway Tunnel from Liverpool. It loops round the north west of Birkenhead and then runs south as a dual 3-lane route between Upton, Woodchurch {{in the west and}} Prenton. From junctions 1 to 3 it runs parallel to the Borderlands railway line. It crosses this line south of junction 3. From this junction it proceeds south to the west of Bebington through junction 4 and then further south for [...] (where it crosses the Wirral railway line), before narrowing to dual 2 lanes and turning sharply to the east. At junction 5, traffic for Wales can take the A41, A550 & A494 to join the A55 near Ewloe. The road passes north and then east of Hooton, then to the east of Overpool and Wolverham and with Ellesmere Port to the west.|$|R
50|$|The crash {{occurred}} on the motorway <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> connecting the westbound M4 motorway to the northbound (clockwise) M25 motorway, at approximately {{the point where the}} <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> merges with the <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> from the eastbound M4. At this point the <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> is on a downhill gradient with a right turn with decreasing radius, necessitating a posted advisory speed limit of 40 mph.|$|R
50|$|The {{services}} are situated {{on a narrow}} strip of land between the Bristol to Exeter railway line and the motorway at junction 28, and are accessible from the M5, A373 and B3181 roads. The junction at the southbound <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> is a very simple design with low traffic capacity. Unusually the service area is signed from the northbound carriageway but not from the southbound one, to reduce congestion at the low capacity service station, although it is readily accessible from both directions.|$|E
50|$|The A1 and A41 {{converge}} as {{they enter}} Mill Hill at Fiveways Corner, this section {{is known as the}} Watford Way. The dual carriageway passes through Mill Hill, and the routes diverge at Apex Corner (officially Northway Circus). The M1 motorway was built through the western part of Mill Hill in 1967. There is a disused southbound <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> which passes under the Watford Way and which covers part of the old railway between Mill Hill East and Edgware Town.|$|E
50|$|The old Swansea Tram system {{extended}} up the Swansea valley {{as far as}} Llanllienwen Road {{where there}} was a halt. With the building of the M4 motorway in 1973 the geography of Ynysforgan changed dramatically. The motorway essentially cut the village in two resulting in the demolition of the old Sunday School which stood (roughly) {{in the vicinity of the}} M4 <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> straight on from Clydach Road and a new Sunday school was built at the top of Garth View and Christopher Road.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} project has brought fresh {{knowledge of the}} efficiency and traffic quality of <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> at multilevel junctions. The results were obtained from observations of the traffic flow at <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to urban expressways (Class B). Various types were studied: single-lane <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to two-lane and three-lane main roads (type E 1 /E 2) and two-lane <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to two-lane main roads (type E 4 /E 5). Speeds were always restricted to 80 km/h or 100 km/h at the measuring points observed.

25|$|The {{northbound}} entry <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> at Lancaster (junction 34) {{was unusually}} short, presenting problems for traffic joining the motorway. The M6 crosses the River Lune {{at this point}} and unless the bridge had been made wider, there was no space to build a longer <b>slip</b> <b>road.</b> This junction was upgraded from an earlier emergency-vehicles-only access point, which explains the substandard design. The construction of the Heysham to M6 Link Road (The Bay Gateway) has completely re-modelled this junction with a wide additional bridge over the River Lune and other works repositioning <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> with new acceleration lanes to modern standards.|$|R

50|$|Weinberg {{was sentenced}} on 24 June 2008. On re-appearing at Aylesbury Crown Court, {{it became known}} that Weinberg had {{returned}} from holiday the day before, and chose to stay up alone all night drinking. The court {{was told that the}} following day Weinburg drove a National Express coach on a regular service from Birmingham to Stansted Airport. While travelling southbound on the M1, Weinberg overtook a lorry on the approach to a motorway junction. He then cut back in front of the lorry, and claimed to have mistaken the service station entry slip road for that of the actual junction <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road.</b> As the coach entered the slip road, its tachograph showed that the coach was travelling at 57 mph. It then hit a kerb, and passengers reported the coach 'took off'. It then rolled on to its side, sliding into a lamp-post and a tree.|$|E
50|$|On the 11th, about least 10 cm of {{snow fell}} in some areas, and strong winds caused {{drifting}} in places across Kent and East Sussex. Snow also fell in Sheffield, Berkshire, Brighton and the Grampian Mountains. Dover's coastguard helped dig out a stranded ambulance in the town. Kent County Council said all primary routes and secondary routes where possible had been gritted on Wednesday afternoon {{ahead of the}} snow showers. Kent Fire and Rescue Service said it was helping some motorists stuck in snow drifts {{in parts of the}} county including Margate, Dover and Lydd. Chief Inspector Simon Black, of Kent Police, said that all main routs were passable, but some were down to a single snow-free lane and BBC Radio Kent said that drivers should make essential journeys. Also 4 of its 4x4 vehicles were helping to transfer staff and patients to and from hospitals in Eastbourne and Hastings, in East Sussex.

40|$|Weaving {{sections}} {{are formed}} when a merge area is closely {{followed by a}} diverging area, or when an entry slip road is closely followed by an <b>exit</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> and the two are joined by an auxiliary lane. Driving in the weaving section involves complex car-following and lane-changing interactions. This paper presents two empirical data collection and data extraction processes based on traffic surveillance camera and loop detector measurements. It examines {{the quality of the}} extracted data, and highlights the possible sources of measurement errors considering that the speed and acceleration are varied significantly. This paper proposes locally weighted regression method for data cleaning and presents example results to demonstrate the method by combining the two data sources. The study succeeds in identifying some key driving characteristics of vehicles in the weaving section. We found that 25. 25 % of the weaving movements took place in the first 50 - 100 meters from the point of merge. Around 30 % of the total traffic involved in one lane-changing movement. Meanwhile, the transit time for the driver with more than one lane-changing is 4. 09 sec in average. The appearance of auxiliary lane in the weaving section provides further opportunity to delay the lane-changing, which affects the traffic performance...|$|E
