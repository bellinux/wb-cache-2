5|$|The westernmost {{portion of}} what is now NY251 between NY383 in Scottsville and the {{junction}} of River and Quaker Roads south of the village was once part of Route15, an unsigned legislative route assigned by the New York State Legislature. Route15 was extended northward from its original terminus in Caledonia to Scottsville via River Road on July24, 1911; however, it was realigned on March1, 1921, to enter Scottsville on modern NY383 instead. When the first set of posted routes were assigned in New York in 1924, this piece of modern NY251 did not receive a designation. Another section did, however, as the portion extending from Mendon east to Victor was designated as part of NY15. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY15 was rerouted between Victor and Pittsford to <b>follow</b> <b>current</b> NY96. The former routing of NY15 from Victor to Mendon became part of NY251, a new highway extending from NY15 in Victor to NY33 in Gates via Chili and Scottsville. West of Scottsville, NY251 was routed on modern NY383 and NY386.|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} modern NY247 between Potter and Rushville was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY52, an east–west route extending from Dansville to Geneva via Naples and Middlesex, in the mid-1920s. From Naples to Geneva, NY52 mostly followed what is now NY245. NY52 was realigned in the late 1920s to <b>follow</b> <b>current</b> NY245 from Middlesex to Rushville, bypassing modern NY364 and NY247. Although all {{of what is now}} NY247 was state-maintained by 1926, no other designations were assigned to the highway until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E
25|$|On September 1, 2016, Apple {{announced}} that starting September 7, {{it would be}} removing old apps that do not function as intended or that don't <b>follow</b> <b>current</b> review guidelines. Developers will be warned and given 30 days to update their apps, but apps that crash on startup will be removed immediately. Additionally, app names registered by developers cannot exceed 50 characters, {{in an attempt to}} stop developers from inserting long descriptions or irrelevant terms in app names to improve the app's ranking in App Store search results. App intelligence firm Sensor Tower revealed in November 2016 that Apple, as promised from its September announcement of removing old apps, had removed 47,300 apps from App Store in October 2016, a 238 percent increase of its prior number of average monthly app removals.|$|E

500|$|On {{the turnpike}} {{extension}} alignment proposed in 1994, Route 92 {{was to begin}} at a trumpet interchange with U.S. Route 1 in South Brunswick. The interchange would have also served access to Schalks Crossing Road (Middlesex CR 683). The highway was {{to head to the}} southeast and cross under Perrine Road, which was proposed to have a brand new overpass and a westbound interchange. (There was also to be an eastbound entrance ramp from Perrine Road.) After curving to the east, Route 92 was to enter Plainsboro, cross the New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor Line and Devil's Brook, and then re-enter South Brunswick. [...] The route was to continue eastward, passing to the north of McCormack Lake and begin following Friendship Road until the intersection with Miller Road. Route 92 was to turn to the southeast along with Friendship Road and cross through a toll station. It would have entered a large interchange with U.S. Route 130 and an access route to Friendship Road. Route 92's interchange with Route 130 was to be a cloverleaf interchange and from there, the highway was to <b>follow</b> <b>current</b> day Route 32 through Monroe Township. There, the highway was to continue southeastward, interchanging with local roads and continuing through an interchange with County Route 535 before merging into Interchange 8A with the New Jersey Turnpike, where Route 92 was to end.|$|E

2500|$|Developers have {{multiple}} options for monetizing their applications, ranging from free, free with in-app purchases, and paid.

Major changes introduced in the following months include ads in search results, a new app subscription model, and the ability for developers to respond to customer reviews. Additionally, Apple began a process to remove old apps that do not function as intended or that don't <b>follow</b> <b>current</b> app guidelines, with app research firms noticing significant numbers of app removals from the store. Furthermore, with the release of iOS 11 in September 2017, App Store received a complete design overhaul, bringing a greater focus on editorial content and daily highlights, as well as a design similar in style to several of Apple's built-in iOS apps.|$|E
