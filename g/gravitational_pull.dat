5|$|Io's {{main source}} of {{internal}} heat comes from the tidal forces generated by Jupiter's <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull.</b> This external heating differs from the internal heat source for volcanism on Earth, which {{is a result of}} radioactive isotope decay and residual heat from accretion. In the Earth, these internal heat sources drive mantle convection, which in turn causes volcanism through plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{speculates that}} the {{predicted}} planet {{is most likely}} an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture of rock and ice with a small envelope of gas. Based on its size, the considerable <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in subsurface oceans with liquid water in nearby moons. Subsurface oceans have been discovered on the moons Enceladus (water), Dione (possibly water), and subsurface water is postulated for Neptune's largest moon Triton, and possibly also found on Europa.|$|E

5|$|In the 1840s, the French {{mathematician}} Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics {{to analyse}} perturbations in {{the orbit of}} Uranus, and hypothesised that they were caused by the <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> of a yet-undiscovered planet. Le Verrier predicted the position of this new planet and sent his calculations to German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle. On 23 September 1846, the night following his receipt of the letter, Galle and his student Heinrich d'Arrest discovered Neptune, exactly where Le Verrier had predicted. There remained some slight discrepancies in the giant planets' orbits. These were taken to indicate the existence of yet another planet orbiting beyond Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Space Travel is {{an early}} video game {{developed}} by Ken Thompson in 1969 that simulates travel in the solar system. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> of the astronomical bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{equivalence}} between gravitational and {{inertial effects}} {{does not constitute}} a complete theory of gravity. When it comes to explaining gravity near our own location on the Earth's surface, noting that our reference frame is not in free fall, so that fictitious forces are to be expected, provides a suitable explanation. But a freely falling reference frame {{on one side of}} the Earth cannot explain why the people on the opposite side of the Earth experience a <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> in the opposite direction.|$|E

50|$|In the game, series protagonist Jetman must {{manoeuvre}} {{his small}} craft through caverns of various planets whilst searching for {{pieces of the}} Golden Warpship. The game is presented in a horizontal side-view environment and has ranging <b>gravitational</b> <b>pulls</b> for each planet, which subjects Jetman's craft to various forms of inertia. Similar to its predecessors, Jetman must keep his craft topped up with fuel in order to progress through levels.|$|R
50|$|NGC 4676, or the Mice Galaxies, are two spiral {{galaxies in}} the {{constellation}} Coma Berenices. About 290 million light-years away, they began the process of colliding and merging about 290 million years ago. Their name refers to the long tails produced by tidal action—the relative difference between <b>gravitational</b> <b>pulls</b> on the near and far parts of each galaxy—known here as a galactic tide. It {{is a possibility that}} both galaxies, which are members of the Coma cluster, have experienced collision, and will continue colliding until they coalesce.|$|R
5|$|The more matter {{there is}} in the Universe, the {{stronger}} the mutual <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> of the matter. If the Universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the Universe contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has just the right mass density of about 5 protons per cubic meter which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer limit}} of the Oort cloud defines the cosmographical {{boundary}} of the Solar System {{and the extent of}} the Sun's Hill sphere. The outer Oort cloud is only loosely bound to the Solar System, and thus is easily affected by the <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> both of passing stars and of the Milky Way itself. These forces occasionally dislodge comets from their orbits within the cloud and send them toward the inner Solar System. Based on their orbits, most of the short-period comets may come from the scattered disc, but some may still have originated from the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|Tidal flexing kneads Europa's {{interior}} and ice shell, which becomes {{a source of}} heat. Depending {{on the amount of}} tilt, the heat generated by the ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than the heat generated by the flexing of Europa's rocky core in response to <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> from Jupiter and the other moons circling that planet. Europa's seafloor could be heated by the moon's constant flexing, driving hydrothermal activity similar to undersea volcanoes in Earth's oceans.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{in the mid}} 19th century, James Croll {{published}} {{calculations of}} how the <b>gravitational</b> <b>pulls</b> of the Sun, Moon, and planets subtly affect the Earth's motion and orientation. The inclination of the Earth’s axis and the shape of its orbit around the Sun oscillate gently in cycles lasting {{tens of thousands of}} years. During some periods the Northern Hemisphere would get slightly less sunlight during the winter than it would get during other centuries. Snow would accumulate, reflecting sunlight and leading to a self-sustaining ice age. Most scientists, however, found Croll’s ideas—and every other theory of climate change—unconvincing.|$|R

The algorithm generated was commercialized with the ISTU (Isometric Strength Testing Unit) Functional Capacity Evaluation System, which simulates tasks such as lifting a heavy box or pushing a cart and evaluates the exertion expended. It also identifies the muscle group that limits the subject's performance. It is an effective tool of personnel evaluation, selection and job redesign...|$|R
5000|$|After {{development}} {{switched to}} Solar Jetman, the Pickford brothers received little input from Rare, with Ste Pickford later speculating that the Stamper brothers had {{confidence in their}} abilities, despite being entrusted with their most [...] "revered" [...] series. In a retrospective interview, Ste Pickford stated that he drew inspiration for the mechanics of Solar Jetman from a ZX Spectrum game, Scuba Diving, admitting that the <b>gravitational</b> <b>pulls</b> of Jetman's pod were reminiscent of the way a scuba diver manoeuvred. Development of Solar Jetman lasted around a year and started from a standard two-man team to a workforce of several people as the game eventually grew larger in scale.|$|R
5|$|When first discovered, Sedna {{was thought}} to have an unusually long {{rotational}} period (20 to 50 days). It was initially speculated that Sedna's rotation was slowed by the <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> of a large binary companion, similar to Pluto's moon Charon. A search for such a satellite by the Hubble Space Telescope in March 2004 found nothing, and subsequent measurements from the MMT telescope suggest a much shorter rotation period of about 10 hours, more typical for a body of its size.|$|E
5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} {{new stars}} {{in the night sky}} (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E
5|$|First {{predicted}} {{shortly before}} the Voyager 1 flyby, the heat source for Io's volcanism comes from tidal heating produced by its forced orbital eccentricity. This differs from Earth's internal heating, which is derived primarily from radioactive isotope decay and primordial heat of accretion. Io's eccentric orbit leads to a slight difference in Jupiter's <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> on the satellite between its closest and farthest points on its orbit, causing a varying tidal bulge. This variation {{in the shape of}} Io causes frictional heating in its interior. Without this tidal heating, Io might have been similar to the Moon, a world of similar size and mass, geologically dead and covered with numerous impact craters.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} known for {{thousands}} of years that the waters of coastal seas ebb and flow on a daily basis. This oscillation is widely thought to be from the <b>gravitational</b> <b>pulls</b> of the Moon and Sun. Here we propose that, the Earth’s curved motions about the centre of mass of the Earth-Moon system and about the Sun may generate centrifugal effect to stretch the Earth’s body along the direction of equator; the majority of the Earth’s surface is covered with water, this makes the Earth look like being submerged in the water; the deformed Earth, together with the Earth’s daily rotation, makes the Earth’s each part regularly rise from and fall into the water. The rise and fall of related part result in the fall and rise of water level. ...|$|R
50|$|A notable {{feature of}} Damocles is its {{inclusion}} of relatively detailed celestial mechanics {{into the game}} physics. While the game also features less standard physics (e.g. teleportation), it includes a detailed representation of the Gamma System and even includes a simplified form of special relativity. To cross the solar system in reasonable (to the player) time, time dilation occurs. However, given that the player has {{only a few hours}} to save Eris, extended periods at near-light speed are unwise. One of the game's many solutions even involves manipulating various planetary bodies in order {{to make use of the}} changes in <b>gravitational</b> <b>pulls</b> to divert the Damocles comet. From an aesthetic point of view, the inclusion of celestial physics allows the player to experience attractively-rendered sunrises and sunsets while on planet surfaces as well as various satellite occultations.|$|R
50|$|The game also {{implemented}} {{an early}} physics engine where approaching a planet's <b>gravitational</b> field <b>pulls</b> the player towards it; if the player gets {{caught in a}} gravity field, they must accelerate out of the gravity field in a close-up view. The game also uses a radar that displays the relative positions of the player and enemies {{as well as the}} destination.|$|R
5|$|Harrington died in January 1993, {{without having}} found Planet X. Six months before, E.

When Neptune's newly determined mass {{was used in the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental Ephemeris (JPL DE), the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a PlanetX, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 that {{can be attributed to the}} <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} solar missions to date has been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995. Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009. It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010. Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch. Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery {{of a large number of}} comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, and sent {{thousands}} of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull.</b> Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the inner Solar System. The evolution of the outer Solar System also appears to have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{calculate}} {{the effect of}} the Earth-Moon (EM) system on the freefall motion of LISA test masses.

We then evaluate the effects of these perturbations (up to the 6 th harmonics) on the relative motions between each test masses couple, finding that they range between 3 mm and 10 pm for the 2 nd and 6 th harmonic, respectively. If we take the LISA sensitivity curve, as extrapolated down to 10 − 6 Hz in [1], we obtain that a few harmonics of the EM system can be detected in the Doppler data collected by the LISA space mission. This suggests that the EM system gravitational near field could provide an additional crosscheck to the calibration of LISA, as extended to such low frequencies...|$|R

The results helped verify that Gliese 3634 was an ideal target for a planet search using the radial velocity method (in which the <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> of a planet on its star is measured by observing the resulting Doppler shift), as stellar activity would not overly mask or mimic Doppler spectroscopy measurements. It was also confirmed that Gliese 3634 is neither a binary star nor a quickly rotating star, common false positives when searching for transiting planets. Gliese 3634 was observed two weeks later for ten consecutive nights. Analysis of the resulting data found that the radial velocity variations most likely indicated {{the existence of a}} planet.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probable}} that the planet is composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet orbits on the same plane as Kepler-9b, a second and larger gas giant located in the Kepler-9 system.

The <b>gravitational</b> <b>pull</b> that each planet has on the other, known as orbital resonance, keeps the planets in a stable orbit.

A survey starting in late 2000 and conducted using three medium-size telescopes found thirteen new moons orbiting Saturn at a great distance, in eccentric orbits, which are highly inclined to both the equator of Saturn and the ecliptic.
