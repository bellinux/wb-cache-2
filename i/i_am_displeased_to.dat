60|$|Joh. You make so many difficulties, <b>I</b> fear <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I thank you," [...] {{returned}} Dick; [...] "and since <b>I</b> <b>am</b> little {{likely to}} follow these great fortunes, I will even say farewell. I will not pretend <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>displeased</b> <b>to</b> think myself upon the road to fortune; but I will not pretend, neither, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> over-sorry {{to be done with}} it. Command and riches, they are brave things, to be sure; but a word in your ear--yon duke of yours, he is a fearsome lad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ingratitude to the worthy bridge {{not to do}} so. Man is a noble fellow, and {{in an age of}} satirists, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>displeased</b> <b>to</b> {{find one}} who has {{confidence}} in him, and bravely stands up for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{did that}} shake {{of the head}} mean?" [...] said he. [...] "What was it meant to express? Disapprobation, I fear. But of what? What had <b>I</b> <b>been</b> saying <b>to</b> <b>displease</b> you? Did you think me {{speaking}} improperly, lightly, irreverently on the subject? Only tell me if <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> Only tell me if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong. <b>I</b> want to <b>be</b> set right. Nay, nay, I entreat you; for one moment put down your work. What did that shake of the head mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Bidding adieu to {{the kind}} J. J., and leaving him to pursue his art, in that silent serious {{way in which he}} daily laboured at it, we drove to Fitzroy Square hard by, where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>displeased</b> <b>to</b> show the good old hospitable James Binnie the young lady who bore my name. But here, too, we were disappointed. Placards wafered in the windows {{announced}} that the old house was to let. The woman who kept it brought a card in Mrs. Mackenzie's frank handwriting, announcing Mr. James Binnie's address was [...] "Poste-restante, Pau, in the Pyrenees," [...] and that his London agents were Messrs. So-and-so. The woman said she believed the gentleman had been unwell. The house, too, looked very pale, dismal, and disordered. We drove away from the door, grieving to think that ill-health, or any other misfortunes, had befallen good old James.|$|R
60|$|Author. You say well. But no man of honour, genius, or spirit, {{would make}} the mere love of gain, the chief, far less the only, purpose of his labours. For myself, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>displeased</b> <b>to</b> find the game a winning one; yet while I pleased the public, I should {{probably}} continue it merely {{for the pleasure of}} playing; for I have felt as strongly as most folks that love of composition, which is perhaps the strongest of all instincts, driving the author to the pen, the painter to the pallet, often without either the chance of fame or the prospect of reward. Perhaps I have said too much of this. I might, perhaps, with as much truth as most people, exculpate myself from the charge of being either of a greedy or mercenary disposition; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not, therefore, hypocrite enough to disclaim the ordinary motives, on account of which the whole world around me is toiling unremittingly, to the sacrifice of ease, comfort, health, and life. I do not affect the disinterestedness of that ingenious association of gentlemen mentioned by Goldsmith, who sold their magazine for sixpence a-piece, merely for their own amusement.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am,' said he, 'a crossbow-man in {{the service}} of a noble count, in whose castle <b>I</b> <b>was</b> brought up. Not long ago my master went on a journey, and brought back with him, amongst other treasures, the {{portrait}} of a fair maiden so sweet and lovely that I lost my heart at first sight of it, and could think of nothing but how I might seek her out and marry her. The count had told me her name, and where she lived, but laughed at my love, and absolutely refused to give me leave to go in search of her, so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> forced to run away from the castle by night. I soon reached the little town where the maiden dwelt; but there fresh difficulties awaited me. She lived under the care of her mother, who was so severe that she was never allowed to look out of the window, or set her foot outside the door alone, and how to make friends with her I did not know. But at last I dressed myself as an old woman, and knocked boldly at her door. The lovely maiden herself opened it, and so charmed me that I came near forgetting my disguise; but I soon recovered my wits, and begged her to work a fine table-cloth for me, for she is reported to be the best needlewoman in all the country round. Now <b>I</b> <b>was</b> free to go and see her often under the presence of seeing how the work was going oil, and one day, when her mother had gone to the town, I ventured to throw off my disguise, and tell her of my love. She was startled at first; but I persuaded her to listen to me, and I soon saw that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> her, though she scolded me gently for my disobedience to my master, and my deceit in disguising myself. But when I begged her to marry me, she told me sadly that her mother would scorn a penniless wooer, and implored me to go away at once, lest trouble should fall upon her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had it {{out last}} night with my mother," [...] he said. [...] "I dreaded the scene, for she takes things terribly hard. She does n't scold nor storm, {{and she does n't}} argue nor insist. She sits with her eyes full of tears that never fall, and looks at me, when I displease her, as if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a perfect monster of depravity. And the trouble <b>is</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born <b>to</b> <b>displease</b> her. She does n't trust me; she never has and she never will. I don't know what I have done to set her against me, but ever since I can {{remember}} <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> looked at with tears. The trouble is," [...] he went on, giving a twist to his moustache, [...] "I 've been too absurdly docile. <b>I</b> 've <b>been</b> sprawling all my days by the maternal fireside, and my dear mother has grown used to bullying me. I 've made myself cheap! If <b>I</b> <b>'m</b> not in my bed by eleven o'clock, the girl is sent out to explore with a lantern. When I think of it, I fairly despise my amiability. It 's rather a hard fate, to live like a saint and to pass for a sinner! I should like for six months to lead Mrs. Hudson the life some fellows lead their mothers!" ...|$|R
25|$|David's action <b>was</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> the Lord, {{who sent}} Nathan the prophet to reprove the king.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to say {{anything}} which <b>is</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> you, uncle, but I fear that you would never have proved Frank's innocence." ...|$|R
50|$|Captain Fellows: A happy Englishman {{who works}} on a banana {{plantation}} who <b>is</b> <b>displeased</b> <b>to</b> find that the priest has taken refuge in his barn.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fanny,' {{returned}} Mr Dorrit, 'I <b>am</b> amazed, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>displeased</b> by this--hum--this capricious and unintelligible {{display of}} animosity towards--ha--Mrs General.' ...|$|R
60|$|The old rogue made {{a humorous}} grimace; and {{although}} Dick <b>was</b> <b>displeased</b> <b>to</b> lie under so great favours to so equivocal a personage, he was yet unable to restrain his mirth.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is, <b>is</b> she? But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>displeased</b> {{that she}} should {{undertake}} to put constructions on my acts that no attention or words of mine will justify." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was the offence. She {{has been}} {{breaking}} her heart all this time, {{because she was}} sure, from your manner, that you <b>were</b> <b>displeased</b> <b>to</b> see them alone with her--eating bon-bons, I believe, and therefore took them away." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bulgakov {{was aware}} that the story might <b>be</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> the {{authorities}} - after presenting the story at a literary evening in late 1924, {{he wrote in his}} diary: 'Is it a satire? Or a provocative gesture? ... I'm afraid that <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> hauled off ... for all these heroic feats.' ...|$|R
60|$|Pray do {{not believe}} that the least {{intentional}} neglect has prevented me from calling on you, or that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not sincerely desirous to avail myself of any opportunity of cultivating your friendship. I venture to say this to you in an unaffected and earnest spirit, and I hope it will not <b>be</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> you.|$|R
60|$|Janet {{looked a}} little {{surprised}} to see me lying stiffly on the sofa (<b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid to move lest it should <b>be</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> my aunt), but went on her errand. My aunt, with her hands behind her, {{walked up and down}} the room, until the gentleman who had squinted at me from the upper window came in laughing.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Thank you again. I {{will walk}} round to the Corner with you, if you don’t object; I {{have plenty of}} time before my company come; and I want to say a word to you, which I think you will not <b>be</b> <b>displeased</b> <b>to</b> hear.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think a boy {{who uses}} bad {{language}} of any kind, does what he knows is wrong. He breaks God's commands. He does what he knows would <b>be</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> his parents, and he sets a bad example. He does wrong, therefore, and justly deserves punishment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is said," [...] old Gnob piped on, [...] "that he has harkened to {{the speech}} {{of the white man}} up at the Big House, and that he bends head to the white man's god, and, moreover, that blood <b>is</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> the white man's god." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{effect of}} these {{approaches}} is disputable. It <b>is</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> many, from its formality; but we are persuaded that it is right, {{because it is a}} national style, and therefore has in all probability due connection with scene and character: and this connection we shall endeavor to prove.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Tufton grunted {{again as}} if to signify that such unpunctuality <b>was</b> {{altogether}} <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|To this Sir Gawaine made reply: [...] "Sir, I {{perceive}} that thou hadst great excuse for thy blow. Ne'theless, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>displeased</b> that thou shouldst have struck that knight. Now I make demand of thee what is thy name and condition?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The description, {{given in}} the legend of Sir Owain, of the {{terrestrial}} paradise, at which the blessed arrive, after passing through purgatory, omits gillyflowers, though it mentions many others. As the passage is curious, and the legend has never been published, many persons may not <b>be</b> <b>displeased</b> <b>to</b> see it extracted-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Some, {{including}} {{the leadership of}} the Society of St Pius X, hold that it is in principle valid as a sacramental rite but maintain that the revisions in the liturgy <b>are</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> God, and that it is often celebrated improperly to the extent of being sacramentally invalid. They therefore generally refuse to attend it.|$|R
50|$|In the DVD commentary, Lurie {{notes that}} the {{original}} plan was to film in Arkansas, but funding issues forced the filming to happen in Jamaica, where Waits was already on vacation. Lurie claimed that following their trip to Jamaica, Tom Waits <b>was</b> <b>displeased</b> <b>to</b> {{the point that he}} did not speak to Lurie for two years afterwards.|$|R
50|$|In 1472, Şahsuvar was deposed {{and later}} {{executed}} by the Mamluks and Shah Budak once again was appointed as the new bey. However Ottomans <b>were</b> <b>displeased</b> <b>to</b> {{see the end of}} their candidate. They supported Bozkurt (or Alahüddevle), a third brother of Shah Budak to throne. In 1480 Bozkurt defeated Shah Budak and became the new bey.|$|R
5000|$|One {{point that}} is often raised {{in this regard is}} his line that <b>was</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> his liberal friends on the Jewish {{question}} (Die Judenfrage, 1843).Bauers later article [...] "Jews abroad" [...] (Das Judentum in der Fremde) in [...] "Staats- und Gesellschaftslexicon" [...] was even more radical and extensive, mixing arguments of racism, religion and [...] "voelkisch" [...] ideology.|$|R
60|$|The editor believes, {{his readers}} will not <b>be</b> <b>displeased</b> <b>to</b> see a Bond of Manrent, granted by this border freebooter to the Scottish warden {{of the west}} marches, {{in return for the}} gift of a feudal {{casualty}} of certain lauds particularized. It is extracted from Syme's Collection of Old Writings, MS. penes Dr. Robert Anderson, of Edinburgh.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{wonder who}} you are," [...] he said, aloud, {{with all his}} old lazy urbanity. [...] "I suppose it's no use trying to {{throttle}} you {{in order to find}} out; it would <b>be</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> pass the night with a corpse. Besides <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> the corpse. I've got no matches and I've smashed my torch, so I can only speculate. Who could you be, now? Let us think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Good-bye,' I said, {{extending}} my own. 'It <b>is</b> {{not that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>displeased</b> with you; {{but there is}} no place in this expedition for--let us say, the Señorita Phoebe.' I said this with a smile, trying to smooth the thing for him. 'May you have better luck, companero.' ...|$|R
25|$|Some of them argue that, unlike earlier reforms, the {{revision}} of 1969-1970 which replaced the Tridentine Mass with the Mass of Pope Paul VI represented a major {{break with the}} past. They consider that {{the content of the}} revised liturgy is, in Catholic terms, seriously deficient and defective; some hold that it <b>is</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> God, and that no Catholic should attend it.|$|R
50|$|Although {{he had not}} yet taken {{even the}} minor holy orders, he was {{nominated}} bishop of Couserans (Gascony) by the king on December 28, 1641, but Pope Urban VIII refused to give his sanction. It was only after Marca had formally denied those propositions contained in De concordia which <b>were</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> Rome that he was proclaimed in the consistory (January 13, 1648).|$|R
50|$|The {{book ends}} abruptly, but its object is accomplished. Jonah is silenced; {{he can make}} no reply; he can only confess that he is entirely wrong, and that God is righteous. He learns the lesson that God would have all men saved, and that that narrow-mindedness which would exclude heathen from his kingdom <b>is</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> him and alien from his design.|$|R
50|$|Some {{critics of}} the {{referendum}} attack the use of closed questions. A difficulty which can plague a referendum of two issues or more is called the separability problem. If one issue is in fact, or in perception, related to another on the ballot, the imposed simultaneous voting of first preference on each issue can result in an outcome that <b>is</b> <b>displeasing</b> <b>to</b> most.|$|R
