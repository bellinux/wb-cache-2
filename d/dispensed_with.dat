5|$|Pratchett's {{earliest}} Discworld novels {{were written}} largely to parody classic sword-and-sorcery fiction (and occasionally science-fiction); as the series progressed, Pratchett <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> parody almost entirely, and the Discworld series evolved into straightforward (though still comedic) satire.|$|E

5|$|The modern name 'Arbroath' {{became more}} common in the mid-19th century, the older name being largely <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> {{by the time of the}} first edition of the Ordnance Survey Maps. However, {{variants}} of 'Arbroath' had been used since the 17th century, including 'Arbroth' and Aberbreth.|$|E
5|$|A new {{construction}} technique {{was employed to}} save weight. Previous battlecruisers were built {{with a combination of}} transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> the transverse frames and used only the longitudinal ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|E

5|$|According to Penton, Rutherford's austerity—evidenced by his {{distaste for}} Christmas, {{birthday}} parties and other popular customs that {{were described as}} of pagan origin or that encouraged creature worship and {{were not to be}} observed—led in turn to austerity becoming a part of Witness life. In 1938, he directed that singing be <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> at congregation meetings; singing was reinstated soon after his death.|$|E
5|$|As Emperor, Domitian quickly <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> {{the republican}} facade {{his father and}} brother had {{maintained}} during their reign. by moving the centre of government (more or less formally) to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. In his view, the Roman Empire was to be governed as a divine monarchy with himself as the benevolent despot at its head.|$|E
5|$|As a self-governing body, the {{orchestra}} selects the conductors with whom it works. At some stages in its history, it has <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> a principal conductor and worked only with guests. Among conductors with {{whom it is}} most associated are, in its early days, Hans Richter, Sir Edward Elgar, and Sir Thomas Beecham, and in more recent decades Pierre Monteux, André Previn, Claudio Abbado, Sir Colin Davis, and Valery Gergiev.|$|E

5|$|By 1967 {{many in the}} LSO {{felt that}} Fleischmann was seeking to exert too much {{influence}} on {{the affairs of the}} orchestra, and he resigned. Kertész, too, was <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> when he sought control of all artistic matters; his contract was not renewed when it expired in 1968. His successor as principal conductor was André Previn, who held the post for 11 years – at 2013 the longest tenure of the post to date.|$|E
5|$|Later British super-dreadnoughts, principally the , <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> the midships turret, so {{weight and}} volume were freed for larger, oil-fired boilers. The new 15-inch (381-mm) gun gave greater {{firepower}} {{in spite of}} the loss of a turret, and there were a thicker armour belt and improved underwater protection. The class had a 25-knot (46-km/h) design speed, and they were considered the first fast battleships.|$|E
5|$|The post-war years saw the Echo drop Shipping Gazette {{from its}} main title-piece, {{following}} a redesign in 1959. Instead, the paper {{became known as}} Echo Sunderland for several years, although the name Sunderland Echo and Shipping Gazette continued to be printed in much smaller type above the new title. A further title-piece redesign in 1972, however, <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> the words Shipping Gazette and introduced an illustration of Wearmouth Bridge alongside the title Echo Sunderland.|$|E

5|$|The {{small size}} and {{independence}} of the laser modules allowed the huge NIF building to be <b>dispensed</b> <b>with.</b> Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact arrangement. In baseline designs, the modules were stacked in 2-wide by 8-high groups in two rings {{above and below the}} target chamber, shining their light through small holes drilled into the chamber to protect them from the neutron flux coming back out.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their trucks with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only {{reduced the number of}} trucks under the train, but it also <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> the need for couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s the {{installation}} of overhead electrification commenced between London Euston and both Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly. Phase 1 comprised electrification between Crewe and Liverpool and Manchester. Phase 2 involved the extension southwards from Crewe to London. The massive proportions of the Coronation Class resulted in their prohibition from operating under those wires. Camden's allocation was now run down (the remaining locomotives being transferred to nearby Willesden (1A)), whilst Polmadie's was <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> entirely. The bulk of the class was situated at either Crewe North or Carlisle, the Kingmoor shed (12A, 68A from 1958) now being used in addition to Upperby.|$|E

5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E
5|$|Some United States Army Air Forces {{aircraft}} used {{a variation}} of the British camouflage schemes (mostly on aircraft originally built to RAF orders) but most USAAF aircraft did not use multiple shades on the top side of the aircraft. Instead, most were camouflaged in olive drab above and neutral gray below, though some had the edges of flying surfaces painted in medium green. In the later stages of the war camouflage was often <b>dispensed</b> <b>with,</b> both to save time in manufacturing and to reduce weight, leaving aircraft with a natural metal finish.|$|E
5|$|The Mellotron {{became more}} popular after the Beatles used it on several tracks.

Later models such as the M400, the best selling model, <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> the accompaniments and some sound selection controls {{in order to be}} used by touring musicians. The instrument became less popular in the 1980s due to the introduction of polyphonic synthesizers and samplers, despite a number of high-profile uses from Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and XTC.|$|E
