Fifth-order WENO scheme and third-order TVD Runge-Kutta method are employed to discretize Euler equations with chemical reaction source {{in space and}} time respectively, and parallel high resolution code is developed.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} identifying the feedback ratios in a buck converter with <b>pulse</b> <b>width</b> modulation and an inert output filter, with {{the ultimate goal of}} minimizing the duration of the transient processes.
