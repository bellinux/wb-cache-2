5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{detection}} and identification <b>of</b> new congenital <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> glycosylation continues {{at a rapid}} pace. Sine June 2003, four new congenital <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> glycosylation have been reported, making a total of 20 diseases (on average nearly 1 disease per year since the first report in 1980; 12 <b>of</b> these congenital <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> glycosylation were identified in the past 6 years). RECENT FINDINGS: Three of these newly discovered CDG are caused by defects in early steps of dolichol-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis. Affected patients have a neurologic or a multisystem disease. The fourth new CDG is a completely new CDG type caused by a defect in an endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi shuttle protein carrying multiple glycosyltransferases and nucleotide-sugar transporters. SUMMARY: <b>Disorders</b> <b>of</b> nearly all organs and systems have been reported {{and continue to be}} reported in congenital <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> glycosylation. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that congenital <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> glycosylation be considered in any child with an unexplained clinical syndrome. status: publishe...|$|R

The New Zealand government provided about $80million (1988NZD) to the east coast region of the North Island for assisting in cyclone damage. $8million was used to create an East Coast Forestry Conservation Scheme, which was set to protect forests and prevent erosion. A study was taken five years after the storm, consisting of a group of 112people who were evacuated or received monetary assistance in response to the cyclone; the study showed 12% of the respondents as experiencing Posttraumatic stress <b>disorder,</b> <b>of</b> which they reported a general lack of assistance and public support.|$|E

5|$|An ongoing {{question}} is whether RAD should {{be thought of as}} a <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E

5|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age. The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present {{for more than six}} months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.|$|E
5|$|Crystals {{are often}} {{idealized}} as being perfectly periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron density is perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform F(q) is zero except when q {{belongs to the}} reciprocal lattice (the so-called Bragg peaks). In reality, however, crystals are not perfectly periodic; atoms vibrate about their mean position, {{and there may be}} <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width and there may be significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X-rays that fall between the Bragg peaks.|$|E

40|$|Obesity is an {{important}} risk factor for hypertensive <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy, but most cases <b>of</b> hypertensive <b>disorders</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy occur in women of normal weight.

5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication.

A person with a <b>disorder</b> <b>of</b> fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet.
