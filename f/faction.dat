5|$|According to {{the tally}} of Cardinal Charles de Lorraine-Guise {{in his letter}} to Henry II, once the twelve {{participating}} French cardinals reached Rome, twenty-three cardinals were aligned in the French <b>faction,</b> twenty-two in the Imperial <b>faction,</b> and four neutral; thus Guise judged it impossible for either <b>faction</b> to garner the necessary two-thirds simply by persuading neutral cardinals. In addition, eleven Italian cardinals whom Guise counted among the French <b>faction</b> were only likely to vote for a fellow Italian, making the three favorites of Henry IILouis de Bourbon de Vendôme, Jean de Lorraine, and Georges d'Amboiseunfeasible. The non-French cardinal protector of France, d'Este, would then have been the choice of Henry II; Catherine de' Medici preferred her cousin Giovanni Salviati, who was extremely unacceptable to the Imperial <b>faction</b> and the Farnese.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{original}} Rome: Total War, Europa Barbarorums strategic campaign sees the player take control of a particular <b>faction</b> and then compete for territory and resources against all the other factions, which are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The player is presented with a map of Europe, North Africa and the Near East in which territory is divided into 200 provinces, each of which contains a province capital, which will at any given point be controlled either by the player's <b>faction,</b> a rival playable <b>faction,</b> or the non-playable Eleutheroi <b>faction,</b> which represents the world's minor kingdoms, regional powers and rebel states. If a <b>faction</b> should at any point find itself not in control of any provinces, it is eliminated from the game. Gameplay is turn-based, each turn representing the passage of three months on the campaign map (unlike the six months of {{the original}} Rome: Total War) and alternating between the player managing their empire and the artificial intelligence making all the other factions' moves. A key game mechanic of the campaign map is the annexation of territory, which is done province-by-province, either by successfully besieging the province capital, or by acquiring it from another <b>faction</b> through diplomacy. Once a <b>faction</b> has acquired a province, they may construct buildings in the province capital which either enable the recruitment of certain military units or grant various bonuses to the city such as greater resilience during a siege or a decreased likelihood of the province rebelling. Provided the city contains the appropriate buildings, the player may recruit military units in the city {{at the same time as}} undertaking construction projects. The aim of the game is to acquire a specified number of provinces and/or eliminate specified rival factions (in Europa Barbarorum particular victory conditions differ for each <b>faction),</b> whilst avoiding being eliminated by the other factions.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the large}} number of factions created for the game, {{developers}} reintroduced the reputation system that was first used in Fallout 2 and had been absent in Fallout 3. Much like Karma, a player's standing with a <b>faction</b> can change depending on how they interact with them and what decisions they make. If, for example, players help a <b>faction,</b> their reputation with them improves in all locations controlled by that faction; opting to kill their members will cause a loss of reputation. The type of reputation the player has with each <b>faction</b> affects how non-player characters (NPCs) behave towards them; a good reputation might make completing some quests easier, provide discounts with the faction's vendors, and cause <b>faction</b> members to offer gifts; a bad reputation may lead to the <b>faction</b> refusing to help the player or attacking them on sight, or sending thugs after the player.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the Liberal Party, MPs were all independent, although often grouped themselves into loose <b>factions.</b> Some of these <b>factions</b> were occasionally referred to as [...] "parties", but were vague and ill-defined. In the history of Parliament, <b>factions</b> were formed around a number of different views [...] - [...] at one time, centralism and provincialism were the basis of <b>factions,</b> while at another time, <b>factions</b> were based on geographical region. Towards the 1880s, however, <b>factions</b> had gradually become stabilised along lines of liberalism and conservatism, although the line between the two was by no means certain.|$|R
5|$|Between 1812 and 1816 {{divisions}} {{developed between}} an Unitarist <b>faction</b> centred on Buenos Aires and a Federalist <b>faction</b> in the provinces, which {{eventually led to}} a series of civil wars that ended with the conquest of Buenos Aires by Federalist caudillos at the Battle of Cepeda in 1820.|$|E
5|$|Europa Barbarorum {{has seen}} some {{significant}} changes to its campaign {{over the course}} of its development. The Yuezhi <b>faction,</b> included in early releases of the modification, was subsequently dropped. Earlier releases of Europa Barbarorum also featured player alerts representing the major stages of the breakup of the Seleukid <b>faction,</b> if that collapse occurred in the game. However, such features became impossible to implement after the SPQR <b>faction</b> of the original game, used in Europa Barbarorum for scripting purposes, was removed from the mod in exchange for the kingdom of Saba.|$|E
5|$|For {{the coup}} to be successful, the {{military}} committee needed {{to gain the}} support {{of some of the}} Syrian officer corps. The collapse of the UAR, coupled with mutinies, purges and transfers left the officer corps in complete disarray and open to anti-government agitation. At the time, the officer corps was split into five different factions; the Damascus <b>faction</b> which supported the ancien régime, supporters of Akram al-Hawrani, a Nasserist <b>faction,</b> a Ba'athist <b>faction</b> and a group of independents. The Damascus <b>faction</b> was the enemy of the military committee because of their support for Nazim al-Kudsi's regime and the Hawranist were considered as rivals because of their stance against pan-Arabism. The Nasserists became allies of the Ba'ath, even while they supported Gamal Abdel Nasser and the reestablishment of the UAR.|$|E

5|$|Amondson's {{activism}} attracted notice {{from the}} Prohibition Party, {{which had been}} divided into two factions in 2003. In 2004, Amondson received the presidential nomination of the larger <b>faction.</b> On Election Day, he tallied over a thousand votes and finished in third place in several Louisiana parishes. With {{the death of the}} other <b>faction</b> leader in 2007, the party reunified. In 2008, Amondson again received the party's presidential nomination, but fell short of his 2004 vote total. He died in 2009 after suffering a stroke.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two kinds}} of <b>factions</b> in the game, those are 'Reputation Factions' and 'Crafting Guilds'. Reputation <b>Factions</b> are <b>factions</b> that {{generally}} only inhabit a specific region of the game, such as the Men of Bree who are present in Bree-land; each have a main location where the player can purchase goods and services from the faction's vendors, some of which are only accessible at higher reputation levels. Some <b>factions</b> also possess a vendor where the player can barter faction-specific items awarded from quests or instances for unique items such as armour or weaponry. The ability to gain reputation with Reputation <b>Factions</b> is open to all players who have purchased the content for the region these <b>factions</b> are present in. Crafting Guild <b>factions</b> however, are available only to players who belong to a specific crafting vocation, and a player can only gain reputation with any one of the several Crafting Guild <b>factions</b> at any one time. Crafting Guild <b>factions</b> also have locations that the player can visit to barter for guild-unique goods, including valuable crafting recipes for specific professions.|$|R
40|$|The {{struggle}} between Damasus and Ursinus in 366 A. D. is {{very helpful in}} order to detect ecclesiastical <b>factions</b> in Rome {{in the fourth century}} A. D.

While recent studies tried to identify senatorial <b>factions</b> and ecclesiastical <b>factions,</b> this paper suggests that Damasus'episcopal leadership (juridically recognized by the Roman administration which legalized Damasus'popular acclamation and disapproved Ursinus'turpe convicium) shiows that his pars was able to gain support also in different senatorial <b>factions.</b> 'Parties' and unity of the Christian populus set out the 'political' creteria of the Roman bishop...|$|R
40|$|<b>Factions</b> have {{dominated}} Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) {{since its inception}} in 1995. During these postwar years, <b>factions</b> have been portrayed as institutionalized structures used for the distribution of party positions, cabinet appointments, and campaign funds. However, {{little is known about the}} influence of <b>factions</b> after the LDP's 1993 split and Japan's 1994 electoral reforms. Both scholars and the public believed these two colossal events would eliminate the LDP's need for <b>factions.</b> Nevertheless, <b>factions</b> continue to flourish in the LDP and significantly impact Japanese politics. This paper will provide an update on the recent activities of the LDP's <b>factions</b> and their impact in areas such as cabinet appointments. Ultimately, I will argue that <b>factions</b> have become institutionalized in the LDP through a combination of historical precedents, party size, and Japan's unique group structure...|$|R
5|$|Around 120,000 {{men were}} mobilised during the conflict, and of these about 3,500 were killed. In the end, the victorious {{imperial}} <b>faction</b> abandoned its objective to expel foreigners from Japan and instead adopted {{a policy of}} continued modernization {{with an eye to}} eventual renegotiation of the Unequal Treaties with the Western powers. Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial <b>faction,</b> the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.|$|E
5|$|As a result, a {{coalition}} between the undisciplined Army <b>faction</b> headed by Deodoro and the Positivist <b>faction</b> headed by Constant was formed and directly {{led to the}} 15 November 1889 republican coup.

5|$|Both rivals {{together}} with their adherents defended the legality of their elections. In October 1159 cardinals of both obediences produced the manifests to the Emperor Frederick in favour of their elects. The “Alexandrine” manifest was subscribed by twenty three cardinals, while that of Victorine <b>faction</b> only by five. Supporters of Victor IV, admitting {{that they were in}} minority, justified their action {{by the fact that the}} opposite <b>faction</b> broke the rule of unanimity and – in consequence – the election of Rolando was invalid. The opposite party claimed that the principle of unanimity had been breached by the obstructive conduct of merely three cardinals of the Imperial <b>faction,</b> who stubbornly refused to recognize the candidate desired by the rest of the Sacred College.|$|E
40|$|Four-person groups {{attempted}} to reach unanimous agreement on four high- and four low-importance 6 -point attitudinal scales. Continuous monitoring {{of each group}} member's current position permitted a social transition scheme (STS) analysis {{of a number of}} process questions which arise when groups must choose among several ordered alternatives. Members of extreme <b>factions,</b> members of submajority plurality <b>factions,</b> and nearby <b>factions</b> exerted greater attraction than moderate <b>factions,</b> members of subplurality <b>factions,</b> and distant <b>factions,</b> respectively. The latter effect was attributable, in part, to majority <b>factions</b> making small concessions to distant minority <b>factions</b> to prompt reciprocation and progress toward concensus. Groups were more likely to reach unanimous agreement and comparable shifts in opinion occurred more rapidly on the less important issues than on the more important issues. However, the present within-groups manipulation of issue importance exerted little effect on the group decision-making process. A number of explanations and applications of these effects are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Barbarian <b>factions</b> {{have both}} {{distinct}} advantages and disadvantages.

5|$|Clements {{never again}} sought an elected office after his defeat by Morton, though he {{remained}} active in state politics {{and continued to}} lead the anti-Chandler <b>faction</b> of his party. From 1957 to 1959, {{at the insistence of}} Lyndon Johnson, he served {{as executive director of the}} United States Senate Democratic Campaign Committee and helped ensure the election of a fourteen-seat Democratic majority in the Senate. He considered running for governor again in 1959, but ultimately decided against it. Without Clements in the race, the anti-Chandler <b>faction</b> was unable to unite behind either former candidate Bert T. Combs or former Louisville mayor Wilson Wyatt. Clements united the <b>faction</b> behind Combs, making Wilson Wyatt their candidate for lieutenant governor and promising him support for later races. Combs defeated the Chandler candidate, Harry Lee Waterfield in the Democratic primary and went on to win the general election.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, two-time former {{governor}} and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler {{had already begun}} his campaign for a third term as governor. The anti-Chandler <b>faction</b> became concerned that, {{if they did not}} name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the <b>faction</b> were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience. Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler <b>faction</b> to back Breathitt, and Ward never became a candidate.|$|E

40|$|Conflict between <b>factions</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as an important factor explaining different procedures of candidate selection. However, the question of what drives <b>factions</b> in choosing certain procedures over others remains under-theorized. This article argues that, when ranking their preferences for candidate selection procedures, <b>factions</b> are influenced by their electoral strategy. While clientelistic <b>factions</b> will push for candidate selection procedures that subordinate themselves to the logic of clientelistic exchange networks, programmatic <b>factions</b> will try to maximize the effectiveness of formal regulations. To demonstrate this relationship, the article studies the recent development of political parties in Taiwan and South Korea, where programmatic <b>factions</b> have ‘outsourced’ the authority to nominate candidates to external actors, thereby moving it beyond the reach of internal patron–client networks. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{world for}} each Phoenix Point {{campaign}} will populate {{by means of}} procedural generation. Just to survive, players will need to locate and acquire scarce resources and make smart strategic choices in how they obtain and use the resources. Players {{will not have a}} global reach initially, so they will have to expand thoughtfully. How players acquire resources can have dynamic ramifications for their relations with non-player human <b>factions.</b> Players can engage in open hostilities with other havens by either raiding them for resources or conquering their bases. Players can exploit the conflicts of other <b>factions</b> through kidnappings, sabotage, assassinations, and military coups. Players also can pursue more diplomatic options such as mediating conflicts between <b>factions,</b> defending havens from attacks of aliens or rival <b>factions,</b> forming alliances, or trading. Resource scarcity compels players to deal with non-player <b>factions</b> one way or another, or else the <b>factions</b> will deal with the players. How players choose to interact with other <b>factions</b> will determine substantially the narrative that players experience in their gameplay. Meanwhile, non-player <b>factions</b> will fight or ally with each other regardless of what players do.
