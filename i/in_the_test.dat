5|$|Collingwood's {{form in the}} 2009 World Twenty20 tournament wasn't good: in five innings, {{managing}} just 63 runs.

Going into the 2009 Ashes, indeed, he was relishing his best-ever run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> side, having hoarded three centuries in his last twelve innings.|$|E
5|$|The new ball rule {{also meant}} that spin bowling was less {{effective}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tests,</b> so Australia only used one full-time spinner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tests,</b> off spinner Johnson, until his omission in favour of leg spinner Ring. Together they took only eight wickets.|$|R

5|$|Despite his {{ineffectiveness}} against South Africa, Kartik was {{retained in}} the ODI squad, but after conceding 64 runs from nine overs in the first ODI loss against Pakistan, he was replaced in early-2006 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> and ODI squad by 17-year-old legspinner Piyush Chawla and off-spinner Ramesh Powar respectively.|$|E
5|$|Despite these performances, Kartik was {{retained}} for the ODI tour of Pakistan with Harbhajan still injured, taking five wickets at 32.80 at {{an economy}} of 5.46.

Kartik was also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> squad, but saw not action as India opted to field only Kumble and took the series 2–1.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Test {{team was}} touring South Africa in 1949–50, {{creating}} opportunities for young players back home. This was especially true {{with respect to}} fast bowling, as Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, Australia's two leading pacemen, were from New South Wales and were in South Africa. In addition, Ernie Toshack, who had been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> team since World War II, had broken down.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick {{started the}} Sri Lanka tour with a century against a Sri Lanka 'Colts XI'.

5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E
5|$|A {{string of}} big scores and {{a record number}} of catches during the 1968–69 season earned Chappell the Australian Cricketer of the Year award. Against the touring West Indies, Chappell hit 188 not out, 123, 117, 180 and 165 before the New Year. Two of these centuries came <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> series, when Chappell's average for 548 runs was 68.50. Chappell was {{elevated}} to number three in the batting order and became a less-frequent bowler; he was also appointed vice-captain of the team.|$|E
5|$|After the 1934 tour, Woodfull and Ponsford—Australia's first-choice opening pair—retired, leaving {{vacancies}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> team. Fingleton scored {{four centuries}} {{and was the}} leading run-scorer during the 1934–35 domestic season to earn a recall to the Australian team for the 1935–36 tour of South Africa. From that point onwards until the outbreak of World War II, he opened the batting with his New South Wales partner Bill Brown. With Bradman absent due to illness, it was the happiest time of Fingleton's career, and he scored centuries in three consecutive innings as Australia won {{each of the last}} three Tests by an innings. In the Fourth Test, he and Brown put on the first double century opening partnership for Australia in a Test.|$|E

Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.|$|E
5|$|Brown was a Queensland {{selector}} from 1950–51 to 1959–60, and an Australian selector in 1952–53 after defeating New South Wales' Chappie Dwyer in an election. He was {{the first}} Queenslander in 23 years {{to serve as a}} national selector. His brief tenure as a national selector was marked by abuse and harassment from parochial Queenslanders, upset that he did not include his fellow statesmen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> team. Brown's sports store was vandalised and he resigned as a selector within a year. In 1992, Brown was elected a life member of the Queensland Cricket Association, and in 2000 was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for his services to cricket.|$|E
5|$|Despite a low-scoring {{start to}} the 2003 English cricket season, in which he passed 40 only once in his first seven innings of the season, he kept his place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> side for the visit of the touring Zimbabweans. Batting at number five in both Tests, Key failed to make much of an impact, scoring 18 runs in the first match and four in the second. He had reason to feel aggrieved at his first Test dismissalumpire Steve Bucknor gave him out caught behind, despite Key not hitting the ball.|$|E

5|$|Despite his struggles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> arena, Brown {{had success}} in the tour matches as an opener. He scored 1,448 runs at 57.92 in all {{first-class}} matches, ranking fourth in both the aggregates and averages. He scored eight centuries, second only to Bradman, including 200 against Cambridge University. However, Brown gained criticism for his slow batting. Following his omission from the Test team, Brown batted in a highly circumspect manner to increase the reliability and volume of his scoring. A very occasional off spin bowler, Brown took his career first-class best of 4/16 in his only stint with the ball, against the South of England.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton had a {{prolific}} 1933–34 Australian {{season in which}} he scored 655 runs at 59.54 with two centuries and four fifties. He scored 105 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> trial for Richardson's XI and then struck 145 against arch-rivals Victoria in the last match of the season; New South Wales were unable to force a victory and thus ceded the Sheffield Shield to their southern neighbours. He had scored 76 in the return match {{earlier in the season}} and added 33 and 78 against the Rest of Australia.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} his good form into 2002, where his run-scoring earned him {{an invitation to}} play for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the Sri Lankans. He scored 77 in a drawn match, and would later that season make his Test match debut against India. However, following his Test debut, he only passed 50 on one further occasion that year. He would maintain his place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> side against Zimbabwe the following year, despite only scoring one innings of note129 against the Cambridge students. However, after being dropped from the side, Key's form seemed to improve: he scored 140 against Nottinghamshire to set up a Kent victory, and consistently scored around 40runs per innings {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Regression <b>testing</b> is <b>the</b> {{process of}} {{executing}} all {{or some of}} <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> that already have been conducted {{to ensure that no}} new errors have been introduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previously <b>tested</b> code. It is very expensive technique. To reduce the cost of regression technique and to increase <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>testing</b> process we can prioritize <b>the</b> <b>test</b> cases. To date there are number of techniques have been proposed for test case prioritization to achieve <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> objective early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> process. One such objective is the increase rate of fault detection early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> process. All these techniques are based on code coverage and focus on finding the maximum no of faults rather than severity of faults. In this paper we have proposed a new approach which considers the severity of faults based on requirement prioritization. Aim is to find the severe faults early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> process and hence {{to improve the quality of}} the software according to customer point of view. Experiment results indicate that our prioritization approach frequently yields faults with high severity...|$|R
