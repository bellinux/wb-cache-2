5|$|The eye-sockets of Tyrannosaurus are {{positioned}} {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. While predatory theropods in general had binocular vision {{directly in front of}} their skull, tyrannosaurs had a significantly larger area of overlap. Jack Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators (the principal exceptions are primates, which need it for leaping from branch to branch). Unlike Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight. In Gorgosaurus specimens, the eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. In Daspletosaurus, this was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

Because {{they are the}} rarest of the white blood cells (less than 0.5% of the total count) and share physicochemical properties with other blood cells, they are difficult to study.

Allott then cites Bridges and Eliot as views that he sympathizes with, and he believes that the poem [...] "is neither unflawed nor the best of odes, but to me it illustrates better than any other Keats's possession of poetic power in conjunction with what was for him an unusual artistic detachment, besides being a remarkable poem in its own right. This may be another way of saying that it is the most architectural of the odes, as it is certainly the one that culminates most dramatically." ...|$|E

[...] However, in the 1957 centenary symposium, several leading admirers of Elgar express {{reservations}} about one or both symphonies. In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in The Gramophone, [...] "For some reason few people seem to like the two Elgar symphonies equally; each has its champions and often they {{are more than a}} little bored by the rival work." [...] The critic John Warrack wrote, [...] "There are no sadder pages in symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and trombones twice softly intone a phrase of utter grief", whereas to Michael Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and angst and is marked instead by a [...] "benevolent tranquillity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ivanhoe {{closed in}} July, when {{the opera house}} closed for the summer {{at the end of}} the opera season. [...] When the house re-opened in November, after a delay, Carte {{produced}} André Messager's La Basoche (with David Bispham in his first London stage performance) alternating in repertory with six more performances of Ivanhoe (which ran at a substantial loss this time), and then La Basoche alone, closing in January 1892. [...] Though praised, La Basoche could not fill the large house, and losses were mounting. [...] Carte had commissioned new operas from Cowen, Herman Bemberg, Hamish MacCunn and Goring Thomas. [...] Although Bemberg's opera Elaine was finished, and Cowen's Signa would be completed in March, Carte evidently had decided that producing these would be impracticable or too expensive and that he could not make a success of the new house. [...] The Pall Mall Gazette wrote, [...] "The question, then, uppermost is whether Londoners really want English opera at all.... Mr D'Oyly Carte is to be pitied, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how he can continue to throw his operatic pearls before those who do not value them.

2500|$|Mrs Williams is Aubrey's mother-in-law. [...] In HMS Surprise, Maturin {{describes}} her as [...] "a deeply stupid, griping, illiberal, avid, tenacious, pinchfist, a sordid lickpenny and a shrew". <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any likeness {{of the mother}} in the daughter. Despite being stingy and obsessed with money, she is quite credulous and snobbish, which leads her to get involved in, for example, an illegal bookmaking operation, where she loses {{a great deal of}} her fortune and is threatened with arrest. When Aubrey is flush with funds after returning from The Mauritius Command, he takes care of her debts, so she again owns Mapes Court free and clear, but she prefers to lease it out and live with Sophia and her grandchildren at Ashgrove Cottage. Her harsh ways drive servants away until Aubrey staffs his household with seamen who are immune to her words, and keep up the house as they would a ship. When Aubrey is found guilty in a fraud on the stock exchange (in The Reverse of the Medal), then makes a fortune in prizes on the shake-down cruise of Surprise as a letter of marque (in The Letter of Marque), she is pleased, but believes him guilty as charged, and would do the same herself if she had the chance, as one must always guard one's capital. Mrs Williams dies in an accident when the coach in which she is riding, driven by her niece Diana Villiers-Maturin, overturns.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was born}} in the outer {{district}} of Kath, the capital of the Afrighid dynasty of Khwarezm (now a part of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan) (or Chorasmia). The word Biruni means [...] "from the outer-district" [...] in Persian, and so this became his nisba: [...] "al-Bīrūnī" [...] = [...] "the Birunian". Al-Biruni's relatives also took interest in the studies of science as well, so he grew up in an environment encouraging to his interests. He even had ties to royalty as there are links in his family to the families of prestigious elites. To conduct research, Al-Biruni used different methods to tackle the various fields he studied. Many consider Al-Biruni one of the greatest scientists in history, and especially of Islam because of his discoveries and methodology. He lived during the Islamic Golden Age, which promoted astronomy and encouraged all scholars to work on their research. Al-Biruni spent the first twenty-five years of his life in Khwarezm where he studied Islamic jurisprudence, theology, grammar, mathematics, astronomy, medics, philosophy and also dabbled in the field of physics and most other sciences as well. The Iranian Khwarezmian language, which was the language of Biruni, survived for several centuries after Islam until the Turkification of the region, and so must some at least of the culture and lore of ancient Khwarezm, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the commanding figure of Biruni, a repository of so much knowledge, appearing in a cultural vacuum. He was sympathetic to the Afrighids, who were overthrown by the rival dynasty of Ma'munids in 995. He left his homeland for Bukhara, then under the Samanid ruler Mansur II the son of Nuh. There he corresponded with Avicenna and there are extant exchanges of views between these two scholars.|$|E
