5|$|Modern {{proponents of}} social trinitarianism often {{claim to have}} been {{influenced}} by the Cappadocians' dynamic picture of the Trinity. However, it would be fundamentally incorrect to identify Gregory as a social Trinitarian, as his theology emphasises the unity of God's will, and <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> believes that the identities of the Trinity are the three persons, not the relations between them.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} of Victory of Faith, Hitler had stood {{side by side with}} the leader of the Sturmabteilung (SA) Ernst Röhm, a man with whom <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> had a close working relationship. Rohm was ruthlessly murdered on Hitler's orders a short time later during the purge of the SA {{referred}} to as the Night of the Long Knives. It has gone on record that, immediately following the killings, Hitler subsequently ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed, although Riefenstahl disputes that this ever happened.|$|E
5|$|Political and {{religious}} differences between old Missourians and newly-arriving Mormon settlers provoked {{tensions between the}} two groups, much as they had years earlier in Jackson County. By this time, Smith's experiences with mob violence led him to believe that his faith's survival required greater militancy against anti-Mormons. Around June 1838, recent convert Sampson Avard formed a covert organization called the Danites to intimidate Mormon dissenters and oppose anti-Mormon militia units. Though {{it is unclear how}} much Smith knew of the Danites' activities, <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> approved of those of which he did know. After Rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had no place in the Mormon community, the Danites forcibly expelled them from the county.|$|E
5000|$|Sight & Sound's Jonathan Romney {{described}} the director Ashim Ahluwalia as [...] "a very impressive talent, {{and given the}} oppressive conventions of the Indian film industry, <b>he’s</b> <b>clearly</b> an independent spirit and then some." ...|$|R

5|$|SpongeBob {{is often}} seen hanging around with his best friend Patrick, who lives on the same street as him. SpongeBob's {{unlimited}} optimistic cheer often leads him to perceive the outcome of numerous endeavors and the personalities of those around him as happier than they actually are; for instance, he believes that Squidward enjoys his company {{in spite of the}} fact that <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> loathes him. SpongeBob's greatest goal in life is to receive his driver's license from Mrs. Puff's boat driving school, but he panics and crashes whenever he is in a boat. He lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail Gary.|$|E
5|$|Following Thompson's attack {{upon the}} {{veracity}} of the codex, a number of scholars published their opinions that the document is genuine {{over the course of}} the 1980s and early 1990s, including John B. Carlson, Yuri Knorozov, Thomas A. Lee, Jr., Jesús Ignacio Mora Echeverría, George E. Stuart, and Karl Taube. In 2000, German epigrapher Nikolai Grube expressed his belief that the document is genuine, based upon the precision of the Venus almanac. However, in a later publication from 2012, <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> calls the codex a forgery. In 2002, French archaeologist Claude-François Baudez commented – like Thompson before – that the codex serves no divinatory purpose and was useless as an aid to a Maya priest; he believes that the document is the product of a forger using pre-Columbian materials but relatively ignorant of his subject. The codex is notable in its use of prominent illustrations of uniform size and the almost complete absence of hieroglyphic text; the deities lack names and the cardinal directions are unmarked. In a paper published in 2003, the authors (including Mayanist Stephen D. Houston) argue that the iconography and lack of hieroglyphic text are the result of a strong central Mexican stylistic influence.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to assess how Cranmer's theological views had evolved since his Cambridge days. There is evidence that he continued to support humanism; he renewed Erasmus' pension {{that had previously been}} granted by Archbishop Warham. In June 1533, he was confronted with the difficult task of not only disciplining a reformer, but also seeing him burnt at the stake. John Frith was condemned to death for his views on the eucharist: he denied the real presence. Cranmer personally tried to persuade him to change his views without success. Although he rejected Frith's radicalism, by 1534 <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> signalled that he had broken with Rome and that he had set a new theological course. He supported the cause of reform by gradually replacing the old guard in his ecclesiastical province with men who followed the new thinking such as Hugh Latimer. He intervened in religious disputes, supporting reformers to the disappointment of religious conservatives who desired to maintain the link with Rome.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps he did Amanda injustice. Perhaps {{there was}} a {{stronger}} thread of reality in her desire to recover him than <b>he</b> supposed. <b>Clearly</b> <b>he</b> believed that under the circumstances Amanda {{would have tried to}} recover anybody.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Ken Dryden awarded the album 4 stars noting that [...] "Harold Mabern was nearing his 57th {{birthday}} {{around the time}} of the two 1993 studio sessions that provided the music for this Japanese release; <b>he's</b> <b>clearly</b> in a mood to celebrate... Highly recommended for hard bop fans".|$|R

Then, begins to date April’s sister, Natalie but he doesn't commit to it, because <b>he's</b> <b>clearly</b> {{still in love with}} April.|$|R
25|$|A {{suggestion}} is that Mozart {{died as a result}} of his hypochondriasis and his predilection for taking patent medicines containing antimony. In his final days, this was compounded by further prescriptions of antimony to relieve the fever <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> suffered.|$|E
25|$|Descartes is not {{the first}} to use the {{mechanical}} analogies but because <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium, Descartes' theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics.|$|E
25|$|Despite the liberties Chariton {{took with}} {{historical}} fact, <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> aimed to place his {{story in a}} period well before his own lifetime. Tomas Hägg has argued that this choice of setting makes the work an important forerunner of the modern historical novel.|$|E
2500|$|Tracey Emin said: [...] "There is no {{comparison}} {{between him and}} me; he developed {{a whole new way}} of making art and <b>he's</b> <b>clearly</b> in a league of his own.

25|$|In 1810 Lieutenant Thomas Everard (acting) assumed {{command and}} was still in command on 12 May when Minorca {{captured}} the French polacca Friedland. Although Commander Ralph Randolph Wormley was appointed to command on 16 February, <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> did not assume command until later.|$|E
25|$|Ali Khamenei, himself, has {{remained}} {{silent on the}} issue of whether Iran should have an Islamic Republic or an Islamic Administration. However, <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> rejected the supervision of Assembly of Experts on the institutions that are governed directly under his responsibility (e.g. Military forces, Judiciary system and IRIB).|$|E
25|$|Sutcliffe, by some reports, used prostitutes {{as a young}} man, and it {{has been}} speculated that he had a bad {{experience}} during which he was conned out of money. Other analyses of his actions have not found evidence that he actually sought their services although <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> expressed unusual behaviour before the killings.|$|E

25|$|Hitler was {{a leader}} {{oriented}} towards practical politics, whereas, for Rosenberg, religion and philosophy were key and culturally {{he was the most}} influential within the party. Several accounts of the time before the Nazi ascension to power, indeed, speak of Hitler as being a mouthpiece for Rosenberg's views, and <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> exerted a great deal of intellectual influence.|$|E
25|$|Coffey also {{dismissed}} {{the notion that}} he ever received information about Kelli Ryan or her case in advance or that he ever met with A's Eric Leven. This runs contrary to Leven working alongside Coffey in several episodes and also is contrary to interviews given by Coffey where <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> states that he meets with producers to learn and strategize about how to proceed with walkthroughs.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{research}} has established that Arnold's success was {{not due to}} the form of detent escapement, but to his original methods of adjusting the balance spring for positional errors by manipulating the overcoil terminal curve. For obvious reasons, Arnold tried to keep these methods secret, certainly it is recorded that <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> expressed his concerns about possible plagiarism to Earnshaw, warning him {{in no uncertain terms}} not to use his Helical balance spring.|$|E

25|$|On 3 December 1839 he {{ascended the}} Danish throne as Christian VIII. The Liberal party had high hopes of “the giver of constitutions,” but he {{disappointed}} his admirers by steadily rejecting every Liberal project. Administrative reform {{was the only}} reform he would promise. In his attitude to the growing national unrest in the twin duchies of Schleswig and Holstein he often seemed hesitated and half-hearted, which damaged his position there. It was not until 1846 that <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> supported the idea of Schleswig being a Danish area.|$|E
25|$|Factional {{conflict}} dominated Iranian economic politics {{under the}} Ayatollah Khomeini from 1979 to 1989. The two principal factions were a statist-reformist group that favored state {{control of the}} economy and a conservative group that favored the private sector. Both factions claimed Khomeini's support, but by 1987, <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> had sided with the statist-reformists because he believed state capitalism to be the best way of heading off any threat to Islam. Khomeini's death on 3 June 1989 left the factions without their source of legitimation.|$|E
25|$|Guy de Chauliac (1300-1368) was a French {{physician}} and surgeon {{who wrote the}} Chirurgia magna, a widely read publication throughout medieval Europe that {{became one of the}} standard textbooks for medical knowledge for the next three centuries. During the Black Death <b>he</b> <b>clearly</b> distinguished Bubonic Plague and Pneumonic Plague as separate diseases, that they were contagious from person to person, and offered advice such as quarantine to avoid their spread in the population. He also served as the personal physician for three successive popes of the Avignon Papacy.|$|E
