40|$|The road of {{scientific}} research from the pilot scale plant to the industrial applications is often long and winding. The introduction of an ultrasound device able to replace the malaxers into the virgin olive oil extraction plants is a matter deeply discussed. However, a full-scale industrial plant able {{to work in an}} effectively continuous mode is still lack in the market of olive oil extraction industrial plants. In order to overcome one of the main weaknesses of olive oil extraction plants, the discontinuity of the process due to the presence of the malaxer, a batch machine placed between the crusher and the decanter, effectively continuous ultrasonic full-scale solutions for the extra virgin olive oil industry have been developed. Practical applications: High power ultrasound for the treatment of olive paste represents a system to replace the malaxing phase, the weakest link of the chain in the VOO extraction process. The malaxer is a batch machine, which works between two continuous devices, the <b>fruit</b> <b>crusher</b> and the decanter. It is also a bad heat exchanger due to a not favorable ratio between the big volume of olive paste that should be warmed and the small surface for the heat exchange. New devices need to be developed in order to optimize the extraction plant, reducing the time of process, the resource consumption without compromise the oil quality, in order to guarantee a right profit for the olive millers. Shock waves and micro jets are produced when cavitation bubbles are collapsed. Cell layers of the fruit pericarp are destroyed by the cavitation effects...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Brazilian pepper Schinus terebinthifolius is {{a highly}} {{invasive}} plant species {{that can be found}} in many different ecosystems, including the edges of estuaries in south and central Florida. Brazilian pepper fruits contain chemicals that are toxic to native salt marsh plants. Previous researchers found that high densities of <b>crushed</b> Brazilian pepper <b>fruits</b> negatively impacted growth and final biomass of the black mangrove Avicennia germinans and the red mangrove Rhizophora mangle. Here, we investigated the impact of S. terebinthifolius on the viability of mobile estuarine invertebrates commonly found in the Indian River Lagoon, as well as brine shrimp, a test organism commonly used in aquatic ecotoxicology bioassays. Our null hypothesis was that S. terebinthifolius would have no effect on the survival of all tested invertebrates. Our alternative hypothesis was that S. terebinthifolius would have a significant negative impact on the survival of the test invertebrates. Specifically, percent survival would decrease as the density of <b>fruits</b> increased, and <b>crushed</b> <b>fruits</b> would result in a lower percent survival than intact fruits. Bioassays containing 0 <b>fruits</b> (control), 5 <b>crushed</b> <b>fruits,</b> 5 intact <b>fruits,</b> 10 <b>crushed</b> <b>fruits,</b> or 10 intact fruits were tested on a variety of mobile invertebrates. We found that contact with any fruits of S. terebinthifolius significantly reduced survival in some trials (Sphaeroma quadridentata, Artemia salina Trial 1), significantly reduced survival of some trials only at the highest density of <b>crushed</b> <b>fruits</b> (Ilyanassa obsoleta, Artemia salina Trial 3), and had no effect on some trials (Petrolisthes armatus, Artemia salin...|$|R

40|$|Oil palm (Elais guinensis) is {{the most}} {{important}} tree crop in the rural economy of the humid rainforest of eastern Nigeria. The oil is consumed as household food, used domestically for industrial purposes, and was an important foreign exchange earning export. However, the processing of palm fruits to extract the oil is labour intensive. Although, in colonial times, some machines were introduced and were widely adopted, these excluded machines for <b>crushing</b> the <b>fruits.</b> This was the case until recently when locally fabricated crushers became available. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the implications of these machines for labour use and income among rural households in Imo State, Nigeria. Data from selected palm fruit processing mills indicate enthusiastic patronage of oil mills that have introduced these machines. The machines have eliminated labour for <b>fruit</b> <b>crushing,</b> an activity which required about 10 adults working for about 15 minutes. Presently, the machine crushes 60 kg of parboiled palm fruits in 6 minutes. Also on the average 60 kg of range fruits yielded about 20 litres of palm oil against 14 litres previously, an increase of about 50 %. This arose from the shorter processing time, and higher average temperature of <b>crushed</b> <b>fruits,</b> which aide...|$|R

50|$|Cranberries are {{a kind of}} tart red berry {{produced}} by various plant species, but it is the large-fruited, or “American cranberry” (Vaccinium macrocarpon), that is farmed for commercial production. Currently, the main cranberry farming Canadian provinces are British Columbia, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. However, the lower temperatures present in the Eastern provinces require the use of irrigation and flooding to prevent frost damage and moisture loss. Wet harvesting is the common harvesting method used for cranberries that are to become cranberry juice. A paddled machine called a water reel harvester is used to separate the ripe cranberries from the vines, then collected through a large suction pipe and transported by truck to a processing plant. At the processing plant, the cranberries go through a sequence of <b>fruit</b> <b>crushing,</b> mash maceration, mash heating, juice pressing, and pasteurization to produce a cranberry concentrate that is separated from pulp. To prepare a cranberry juice/cocktail product, cranberry juice concentrate is reconstituted with varying amounts of water, specified by the solicitation, contract, or purchase order.|$|R

40|$|Quality and {{composition}} of virgin olive oil (VOO) are strictly dependent on complex processes that take place during the olive <b>fruit</b> <b>crushing</b> and malaxation of the olive paste. In this work, modulation of O 2 levels within malaxation chambers (R 1 : unmodified atmosphere; R 2 : oxygen: 12. 73 – 4. 64 kPa {{from the beginning to}} the end of malaxation; R 3 : 10. 46 – 2. 27 kPa; R 4 : 9. 87 – 0. 69 kPa) in two continuous “two-phase” and “three-phase” oil extraction plants was performed. Combined effects on the biosynthesis of nutritionally bioactive molecules and aroma volatiles and on the resulting sensory properties of the produced oils were investigated. Results showed that the type of oil extraction plant markedly affected the level of the phenolic compounds in the oil (and the related sensory attributes of bitter, pungency, astringency and bitter and pungency persistence). Reduction of O 2 concentration in the malaxing chamber, while having a minor impact on the presence of phenolic compounds, significantly affected the formation of all the examined volatiles. Particularly, lowered levels of oxygen hindered the formation of lipoxygenase derived volatiles weakening odours and flavours of artichoke, fresh fruity, and fresh cut grass...|$|R

The objective of this study was to evaluate the best working conditions to be utilised to improve a wine making technology (cryomaceration) to produce wines characterised by high qualitative level and an elevated degree of safety. To put in evidence the possible differences on must and wines produced, grapes coming from the same vineyard was macerated at low temperatures utilising both an heath exchanger than the direct addition of CO 2,solid, and the obtained results was compared with that obtained by traditional wine making. The final wines obtained by different operative modalities utilised during prefermentation cold maceration were significantly different according to their phenolic composition, volatile acidity and total -amino nitrogen content. On the basis of the experimental results, the cryomaceration of musts can be considered a prefermentation treatment which allows to obtain high quality white wines, making them more equilibrated, rich of phenolic substances and characterised by a significant flavour so to make them strongly related to their production area (terroir) and then easily identifiable by consumers. Moreover these products could be characterised by an elevated safety grade due to the strong reduction of an additive like SO 2 which is less than ever tolerate by consumers...|$|R
