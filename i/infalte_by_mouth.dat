25|$|Common {{side effects}} when taken <b>by</b> <b>mouth</b> include nausea and itchiness. When {{applied to the}} skin common side effects include redness and burning. In pregnancy, use on the skin or in the vagina is {{believed}} to be safe. There is no evidence of harm when used <b>by</b> <b>mouth</b> during pregnancy but this has been less well studied. When used <b>by</b> <b>mouth,</b> greater care should be taken in those with liver problems. It is in the azole class of medications and works by disrupting the cell membrane.|$|R

5000|$|In {{some regions}} where iodized salt is not available, iodized poppyseed oil is the {{standard}} for preventing iodine deficiency and its complications including goiter. It may be given <b>by</b> <b>mouth</b> or <b>by</b> injection, injection being markedly more effective. [...] The origin of this use is attributed to Paulo Campos. Usually it is given to adults and children by intramuscular injection, one injection delivering enough iodine to last 2 or 3 years. Poppyseed oil is used because it is already manufactured and it very rarely causes an allergic reaction. Also, injections are more expensive {{and more difficult to}} administer than oral medications, thus there is interest in giving iodized oil <b>by</b> <b>mouth.</b> Use <b>by</b> <b>mouth</b> requires only food grade, not medical grade, quality control. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial on giving infants iodized poppyseed oil together with an oral polio vaccine had good results. [...] A randomized, double-blind, fully controlled trial in which lipiodol was given <b>by</b> <b>mouth</b> to children had disappointing results. [...] A recent clinical trial in which iodized oil was given <b>by</b> <b>mouth</b> found that the amount of iodine taken up (see bioavailability) varied with the amount of oleic acid in the oil. [...] Poppyseed oil has relatively little oleic acid. Peanut oil and rapeseed oil have far more oleic acid and are less expensive, and may be superior to poppyseed oil for giving iodine <b>by</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
