Posted {{by permission of}} the publisherThe chapter is focused on the problem of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> (conducted via the Internet or mobilephones) in the context of young people as potential victims and perpetrators of such aggression. The text addresses two main issues: the potential novelty of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> and its potential distinctive features and the diversity of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> acts (with a proposal of typology). The first aspect is analyzed through the new model – ABACUS {{that could be used to}} compare electronic and traditional aggression. The chapter presents also a typology of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> based on the victim’s identity and his/her relationship with a young person who is a perpetrator. The presented theories and discussions are illustrated with new data from two Polish projects on students and teachers experiences with <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression...</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} examining prevalence of online victimization among Polish mildly intellectually disabled adolescents (N = 100). The data was obtained via the Lodz <b>Electronic</b> <b>Aggression</b> Prevalence Questionnaire (LEPAQ), adjusted to intellectually disabled respondents’ needs. Sixty-fi ve {{percent of the}} respondents have fallen victim to a form of aggression performed over the Internet or a mobile phone whereas fi fteen percent of the intellectually disabled pupils experienced cyberbullying – the most dangerous form of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression.</b> The data shows that the involvement of the pupils with mild intellectual disability in <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> is intensive and internally diversifi ed. For the intellectually disabled, <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> occurs more often within a peer group, which results from the fact that they attend special schools and have limited social contacts...|$|E

In the article, the name of author Edward Deci was missing his middle name initial and should have read as Edward L. Deci. In addition, an incorrect version of figure 1 was published. ] Recent studies have examined whether <b>electronic</b> games foster <b>aggression.</b> At present, {{the extent to which}} games contribute to aggression and the mechanisms through which such links may exist are hotly debated points. In current research we tested a motivational hypothesis derived from self-determination theory—that gaming would be associated with indicators of human aggression to the degree that the interactive elements of games serve to impede players’ fundamental psychological need for competence. Seven studies, using multiple methods to manipulate player competence and a range of approaches for evaluating aggression, indicated that competence-impeding play led to higher levels of aggressive feelings, easier access to aggressive thoughts, and a greater likelihood of enacting aggressive behavior. Results indicated that player perceived competence was positively related to gaming motivation, a factor that was, in turn, negatively associated with player aggression. Overall, this pattern of effects was found to be independent of {{the presence or absence of}} violent game contents. We discuss the results in respect to research focused on psychological need frustration and satisfaction and as they regard gaming-related aggression literature...|$|R
40|$|Cyberbullying {{is often}} defi ned as {{aggression}} conducted through mobile phones and the Internet. This phenomenon is predominantly {{understood as a}} kind of peer aggression, when both the perpetrator(s) and the victim belong to the same group (class or online community). However, the Internet extends and facilitates harassment not only of peers. The paper focuses on different kinds of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> identifi ed through qualitative research (interview, e-mail interviews and focus groups with students and teachers). The results have shown that except cyberbullying one can indicate fi ve further types of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression.</b> They are: aggression against celebrities (e. g. actors, singers, etc.), aggression against the vulnerable (e. g. alcoholics, etc.), aggression against school staff, aggression against groups/ideas (when the victim is not a particular, identifi able person) and free-fl oating (random) aggression (often when the victim is totally anonymous to the perpetrator). This typology has been positively verifi ed in a survey on a representative sample of Polish adolescents (N = 2143). The paper presents the typology with the examples from the qualitative stage of research, also discussing potential socialization risks for each kind of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression.</b> It shows also (on the basis of quantitative research) the prevalence of perpetration and victimization of different kinds of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> as well as their co-occurrence. It demonstrates the factors that infl uence such involvement. It must be stated that although peer aggression cyberbullying seems to be predominant, other kinds of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> have also been frequently conducted by the respondents. For example, a signifi cant percentage of perpetrators attacked through new media the following groups of victims: random Internet users (30. 3 %), groups of people (19. 7 %), celebrities (13. 9 %), and vulnerable victims (13. 3 %). The conclusions underline the need to extend prevention educational tools to different kinds of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression,</b> not restricting them to cyberbullying understood as an extension of traditional bullying...|$|E

40|$|Peer victimization is a {{frequent}} occurrence for many adolescents; however, some of {{the psychometric properties of}} self-report scales assessing these experiences remain unclear. Furthermore, with an increase in access to technology, <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> should also be considered. The study examined the psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Peer Victimization Scale (MPVS, Mynard & Joseph, 2000), and developed versions to include the assessment of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> according to whether the adolescent was the target or perpetrator of peer victimization. Three hundred and 71 (191 girls and 180 boys Mage = 13 years 4 months, SDage= 1 year 2 months) adolescents in the UK completed the MPVS including 5 newly developed items assessing <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression,</b> a version of the MPVS designed to assess victimization perpetration, and a measure of self-esteem. Confirmatory factor analyses yielded a five-factor structure comprising: Physical, social manipulation, verbal, attacks on property, and electronic for both scales. Convergent validity was established through negative associations between the victimization scales and self-esteem. Sex differences also emerged. One revised scale and one new scale are subsequently proposed: The Multidimensional Peer Victimization Scale - Revised (MPVS-R) and the Multidimensional Peer Bullying Scale (MPVS-RB) ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> is a {{relatively}} new communication phenomenon, the mental health impacts of which among youth are an emerging and increasingly critical health problem. The problem is important as many researchers, policy makers, educators, parents and young people are finding it difficult to identify and prevent this form of violence. Moreover, the means and media of this movement continue to evolve at a rapid rate. The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine the phenomena of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> in youth and the corresponding impact to their psychological health. The current exploratory analysis examines the similarities and differences between traditional bullying and <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> and the significance of the resulting mental health outcomes for youth shown in the bully, victim and bystander roles. A line of inquiry was developed by the researcher to determine whether there may be a potential coliseum effect, amplifying the psychological harm to those involved. Theoretical sampling was used to examine three cases chosen for their social notoriety and ongoing proliferation. In addition to the factual and documented data relative to the vii cases, the original posted comments and interactions of third-party bystanders on the Internet were collected and analyzed in order to examine their contributing role in and potential impact on <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression.</b> Upon analyzing the themes found within these cases, a critical factor emerged relative {{to the role of the}} electronic bystander. The ability for a dissociated online persona to be anonymous and invisible in an environment – the Internet – that is relentless and the stage to infinite audiences has the potential to amplify the aggression's negative effect on the target by prolonging the victimization indefinitely. At the same time, this virtual coliseum seems to evoke aggressive behaviors among some youth who otherwise might not engage in this form of violence. The researcher determined that potential negative mental health impacts may be increased as a result of a coliseum effect, where peripheral spectators to acts of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> contribute to and nourish its existence. As unmonitored access to the Internet and other electronic media increases, <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> will likely follow a similar trajectory. It is therefore critical to conduct further research on this phenomenon in order to understand how and why it occurs and how various short and long term repercussions on the mental health of the youth involved evolve. Only then can preventive measures be developed, implemented and systematically evaluated. Health EducationMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> is {{a rapidly}} growing focus of research, but it lacks a unifying {{theoretical}} framework {{that is necessary to}} advance the field. The lack of a theoretical framework has led to inconsistencies in measurement of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression,</b> making it difficult to draw conclusions across studies. In general, researchers have assumed that <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> constitutes a new form of aggression, a counterpart to physical, verbal, and relational aggression, due to unique features surrounding the perpetration of <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression.</b> Furthermore, researchers have treated <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> as a categorical variable {{based on the assumption that}} “cyberbullies” constitute a distinct group of adolescents. However, these assumptions have not been empirically tested. It is possible that media represents an additional dimension on which aggression can be classified. The purpose of this study was to test competing models of aggression. It was hypothesized that form of aggression (i. e., physical, verbal, and relational) would be more salient in explaining relations among aggressive behaviors than media (in-person or electronic). It was also hypothesized that adolescents who perpetrated aggression would not be distinguished by what media they used to perpetrate aggression. Finally, it was hypothesized that a dimensional model would provide a better explanation of aggression than a categorical one. Participants were 1052 sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students from three public schools in a medium-sized city in the southeastern United States. All grades were approximately equally represented (352 sixth grade students, 350 seventh grade students, 340 eighth grade students). The racial composition of the sample was 76 % Black or African American, 15 % multiracial, 6 % European American, and 2 % American Indian or Alaska Native. Fifteen percent of participants reported that their ethnicity was Hispanic or Latino. Data were collected in the fall, winter, spring, and summer beginning in the winter of 2010. Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, one data point was randomly selected for each participant. Among other measures, participants completed the Problem Behavior Frequency Scale - Revised, a self-report measure that assessed the extent to which they engaged in physical, verbal, relational, and <b>electronic</b> <b>aggression.</b> Interestingly, a confirmatory factor analysis that took both media and form into account provided the best model to explain adolescent aggression. A latent profile analysis revealed two groups of adolescents: a moderately aggressive class and a low aggressive class. As hypothesized, neither group was distinguishable by the media they used to perpetrate aggression. Also as hypothesized, a comparison of the confirmatory factor analysis model and the two-class solution of the latent profile analysis indicated that a dimensional model provided the best fit. This study supports a theoretical framework of aggression in which aggression is classified both by form and media...|$|E

CDC defines {{bullying}} as any unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or group of youths who are not siblings or current dating partners that involves an observed or perceived power imbalance and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated. Bullying may inflict harm or distress on the targeted youth including physical, psychological, social, or educational harm. Bullying can include aggression that is physical (hitting, tripping), verbal (name calling, teasing), or relational/ social (spreading rumors, leaving out of group).

40|$|Bullying {{is a form}} {{of youth}} violence. Although {{definitions}} of bullying vary, most agree that bullying includes: 1 • Attack or intimidation with the intention to cause fear, distress, or harm that is either physical (hitting, punching), verbal (name calling, teasing), or psychological/relational (rumors, social exclusion); • A real or perceived imbalance of power between the bully and the victim; and • Repeated attacks or intimidation between the same children over time. Bullying can occur in person or through technology (<b>electronic</b> <b>aggression,</b> or cyberbullying). <b>Electronic</b> <b>aggression</b> is bullying that occurs through e-mail, a chat room, instant messaging, a website, text messaging, or videos or pictures posted on websites or sent through cell phones. 2 A young person can be a bully, a victim, or both (bullyvictim). Why is bullying a public health problem? Bullying is widespread in the United States. • In a 2009 nationwide survey, about 20 % of high school students reported being bullied on school property in the 12 months preceding the survey. 3 • During the 2007 - 2008 school year, 25 % of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students on a daily or weekly basis. A higher percentage of middle schools reported daily or weekly occurrences of bullying compared to primary and high schools. 4 • In 2007, about 4 % of 12 - to 18 -year-old students reported having been cyberbullied during the school year. 4 How does bullying affect health? Bullying can result in physical injury, social and emotional distress, and even death. Victimized youth are at increased risk for mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, psychosomatic complaints such as headaches, and poor school adjustment. Youth who bully others are at increased risk for substance use, academic problems, and violence later in adolescence and adulthood. Compared to youth who only bully, or who are only victims, bully-victims suffer the most serious consequences and are at greater risk for both mental health and behavior problems. 5 Who is at risk for bullying? A number of factors can increase the risk of a youth engaging in or experiencing bullying. 5 However, the presence of these factors does not always mean that a young person will become a bully or a victim. Some of the factors associated with a higher likelihood of engaging in bullying behavior include...|$|E
