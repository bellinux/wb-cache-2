50|$|BLVRB encodes {{a protein}} {{that is a}} 206-residue monomeric enzyme. The {{structure}} of BVR-B has a single-domain architecture consisting of a central parallel beta-sheet with alpha-helices on either side. This characteristic dinucleotide binding fold comprises, in this case, a seven-stranded parallel beta-sheet further extended by an antiparallel strand. In addition to the seven long strands of the main pleated sheet, a short parallel beta-sheet (strands 6a and 6c) is formed within the loop <b>joining</b> <b>strand</b> 6 and alpha-helix F. The central beta-sheet and {{the two groups of}} helices are held together mainly through hydrophobic interactions. One group of helices is made up of alpha-helices C, D, and E. The second group is composed of alpha-helices A and F and includes a short 310-helix between strands beta2 and beta3, in contrast to typical dinucleotide binding proteins in which a regular alpha-helix flanks these beta-strands. The most flexible loop in the structure corresponds to loop 120, between strand 5 and alpha-helix E, which contains residues with the highest main chain B-factors, {{with the exception of the}} N-terminal region.|$|E
40|$|We present {{evidence}} that the integrases (INs) of HIV types 1 and 2 are inhibited in vitro by the reverse transcriptases (RTs) of HIV- 1, HIV- 2 and murine leukaemia virus. Both 3 '-end processing and 3 '-end <b>joining</b> (<b>strand</b> transfer) activities of IN were affected by the RTs. Full inhibitions were accomplished with most RT and IN combinations tested at around equimolar RT/IN ratios. The disintegration activity of IN was also inhibited by RTs. Neither DNA synthesis nor the ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain of RT were involved in IN inhibition, since specific DNA polymerase inhibitors {{did not affect the}} level of IN inhibition, and the p 51 isoform of HIV- 1 RT (which lacks the RNase H domain) is as effective in inhibiting IN as the heterodimeric p 66 /p 51 isoform. On the other hand, the catalytic activities of HIV RTs were not affected by the INs, showing that RTs can inhibit IN activities, whereas INs do not inhibit RTs. We postulate that sequences and/or three-dimensional protein structures common to RTs interact with INs and inhibit their activities. We show evidence for this hypothesis and discuss the possible sites of IN involved in this interaction...|$|E

40|$|Two conserved {{catalytic}} arginines, Arg- 173 and Arg- 292, of the tyrosine site-specific recombinase Cre {{are essential}} for the transesterification steps of <b>strand</b> cleavage and <b>joining</b> in native DNA substrates containing scissile phosphate groups. The active site tyrosine (Tyr- 324) provides the nucleophile for the cleavage reaction, and forms a covalent 3 ′-phosphotyrosyl intermediate. The 5 ′-hydroxyl group formed during cleavage provides the nucleophile for the joining reaction between DNA partners, yielding strand exchange. Previous work showed that substitution of the scissile phosphate (P) by methylphosphonate (MeP) permits strand cleavage by a Cre variant lacking Arg- 292. We now demonstrate that MeP activation and cleavage are not blocked by substitution of Arg- 173 or even simultaneous substitutions of Arg- 173 and Arg- 292 by alanine. Furthermore, Cre(R 173 A) and Cre(R 292 A) are competent in <b>strand</b> <b>joining,</b> Cre(R 173 A) being less efficient. No joining activity is detected with Cre(R 173 A, R 292 A). Consistent with their ability to cleave and <b>join</b> <b>strands,</b> Cre(R 173 A) and Cre(R 292 A) can promote recombination between two MeP-full-site DNA partners. These findings {{shed light on the}} overall contribution of active site electrostatics, and tease apart distinctive contributions of the individual arginines, to the chemical steps of recombination.

40|$|DNA polymerases {{are defined}} as such because they use deoxynucleotides instead of {{ribonucleotides}} with high specificity. We show here that polymerase mu (pol μ), implicated in the nonhomologous end-joining pathway for repair of DNA double-strand breaks, incorporates both ribonucleotides and deoxynucleotides in a template-directed manner. pol μ has an approximately 1, 000 -fold-reduced ability to discriminate against ribonucleotides {{compared to that of}} the related pol β, although pol μ's substrate specificity {{is similar to that of}} pol β in most other respects. Moreover, pol μ more frequently incorporates ribonucleotides when presented with nucleotide concentrations that approximate cellular pools. We therefore addressed the impact of ribonucleotide incorporation on the activities of factors required for double-strand break repair by nonhomologous end joining. We determined that the ligase required for this pathway readily <b>joined</b> <b>strand</b> breaks with terminal ribonucleotides. Most significantly, pol μ frequently introduced ribonucleotides into the repair junctions of an in vitro nonhomologous end-joining reaction, an activity that would be expected to have important consequences in the context of cellular double-strand break repair...|$|R

With the exception of 27 C”H-C”H NOES, all the NOES were assigned from a three-dimensional ‘H-lH NOE “N-lH heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) spectrum. The torsion angle restraints were obtained from accurate 3 JHNG coupling constants measured from a HMQC-J spectrum, while the hydrogen bonds were derived from a qualitative analysis of the NOE, coupling constant and amide exchange data.

40|$|Lambda's Int protein {{acts as a}} {{specific}} topoisomerase at attachment sites, the DNA segments that are required for site-specific recombination. Int cleaves each strand of an attachment site at a unique place and creates <b>strand</b> exchanges by <b>joining</b> broken ends from two different parents. To study the action of Int topoisomerase in more detail, heteroduplex attachment sites were made by annealing strands that are complementary {{except for a few}} base pairs that lie in the region between the points of top and bottom strand exchange in the attachment site core. These heteroduplexes appear to interact normally with Int and its accessory proteins IHF and Xis. Although the heteroduplex sites are specifically cleaved by Int topoisomerase, rejoining of the broken DNA is hindered by the lack of Watson [...] Crick complementarity adjacent to the break. Because of this, heteroduplexes accumulate broken intermediates which are then processed in novel ways. We have used this feature to provide new information about functional differences between attachment sites, to investigate the way Xis protein controls directionality of site-specific recombination, and to demonstrate that Int protein can <b>join</b> <b>strands</b> indiscriminately and can therefore generate recombinants with either of two genetic polarities...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe highly conserved aspartyl-, asparaginyl-, and lysyl-tRNA synthetases compose one {{subclass}} of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, called IIb.

Three-dimensional models of bacterial aspartyl- and lysyl-tRNA synthetases complexed to tRNA {{indicate that a}} rigid scaffold of amino acid residues along the five beta-strands of the OB-fold accommodates the base U {{at the center of}} the anticodon. The binding of the adjacent anticodon bases occurs through interactions with a flexible loop <b>joining</b> <b>strands</b> 4 and 5 (L 45). As a result, a switching of the specificity of lysyl-tRNA synthetase from tRNALys (anticodon UUU) toward tRNAAsp (GUC) could be attempted by transplanting the small loop L 45 of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase inside lysyl-tRNA synthetase. Upon this transplantation, lysyl-tRNA synthetase loses its capacity to aminoacylate tRNALys. In exchange, the chimeric enzyme acquires the capacity to charge tRNAAsp with lysine. Upon giving the tRNAAsp substrate the discriminator base of tRNALys, the specificity shift is improved. The change of specificity was also established in vivo. Indeed, the transplanted lysyl-tRNA synthetase succeeds in suppressing a missense Lys [...] > Asp mutation inserted into the beta-lactamase gene. These results functionally establish that sequence variation in a small peptide region of subclass IIb aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases contributes to specification of nucleic acid recognition.

40|$|Protein kinase Cε (PKCε) is {{a member}} of the novel PKCs which are {{activated}} by acidic phospholipids, diacylglycerol and phorbol esters, but lack the calcium dependence of classical PKC isotypes. The crystal structures of the C 2 domain of PKCε, crystallized both in the absence and in the presence of the two acidic phospholipids, 1, 2 -dicaproyl-sn-phosphatidyl-L-serine (DCPS) and 1, 2 -dicaproyl-sn-phosphatidic acid (DCPA), have now been determined at 2. 1, 1. 7 and 2. 8 Å resolution, respectively. The central feature of the PKCε-C 2 domain structure is an eight-stranded, antiparallel, β-sandwich with a type II topology similar to that of the C 2 domains from phospholipase C and from novel PKCδ. Despite the similar topology, important differences are found between the structures of C 2 domains from PKCs δ and ε, suggesting they be considered as different PKC subclasses. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments and structural changes in the PKCε-C 2 domain from crystals with DCPS or DCPA indicate, though phospholipids were not visible in these structures, that loops <b>joining</b> <b>strands</b> β 1 -β 2 and β 5 -β 6 participate in the binding to anionic membranes. The different behavior in membrane-binding and activation between PKCε and classical PKCs appears to originate in localized structural changes, which include a major reorganization of the region corresponding to the calcium binding pocket in classical PKCs.
