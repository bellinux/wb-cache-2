The coil diameter provides {{a compromise between}} mechanical stability and allowing expansion of the wire to minimize strain and consequential drift.

Since, explosive boiling occurs during enormous power excursion in the liquid cooled reactor, the safety evaluation of a nuclear reactor is of vital importance. This paper reviews the transient boiling heat transfer which {{is the study of}} transition mechanism from natural convection or nucleate boiling to film boiling and critical point of heat flux using the various wetting fluid as working medium (Distilled water, ethanol, fluorinert liquid, etc.) caused by exponentially increasing heat input at various periods. The survey is also extended to study the heating <b>element</b> (<b>wire,</b> rod, film) usually made of aluminum or platinum under a subcooled or saturated condition of working fluid at atmospheric or higher system pressure. During the quasi-steady or rapid transient, an aspect of dynamic boiling like the onset of boiling, delay period, temperature overshoot, homogenous nucleation, heterogeneous nucleation, transient CHF, bubble growth, vapor coalescence and vapor collapse has been analyzed. Moreover, a visualization study of differently oriented test piece at a different heating rate and different phase of boiling has been qualitatively discussed...|$|E

40|$|The Fe- 16 at. (8. 5 wt) % Al alloy, {{known as}} FAPY, has been {{identified}} as a superior material for heating element applications. However, while the 15 -lb heats melted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) could be processed into wire, the large heat melted at Hoskins Manufacturing Company (Hoskins) could not be processed under commercial processing conditions. The primary objective of the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) was to demonstrate that wire of the FAPY alloy could be produced under commercial conditions from air-induction-melted (AIM) heats. The specific aspects of this CRADA included: (1) Melting 15 -lb heats by AIM or vacuum-induction melting (VIM) at ORNL. (2) Development of detailed processing steps including warm drawing and annealing temperature and time during cold-drawing steps. (3) Melting of 1400 -lb heats at Hoskins by the Exo-Melt{trademark} process and their chemical analysis and microstructural characterization. (4) Development of tensile properties of sections of ingots from the large heats in the ascast, hot-worked, and hot- and cold-worked conditions.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of the giant magneto-impedance (GMI) effect in 1994 had a strong impact {{on the development of}} micro magnetic sensors. In certain soft magnetic materials, such as composites of amorphous thin wires, the magneto-impedance change (MI ratio) is in the range of 50 - 100 % in the MHz frequency band for external magnetic fields of few Oe. Special thin-film structures have been proposed to provide the MI effect in miniature elements. In the present work, the concept of the magneto-impedance matrix has been elaborated, which enables the explanation of variety of MI field characteristics in wires and films from the common point of view. The fabrication technologies of the narrow thin film MI samples with different structures also were developed, including layered films and films integrated with a helical planar microcoil. The experimental technique employed in the work allowed us to measure all components of the total magneto-impedance matrix that came as the first verification of the matrix concept of the magneto-impedance. Different methods of getting the asymmetrical and antisymmetrical magneto-impedance behaviours were proposed demonstrating a great success of the impedance matrix concept. In the case of a simple transverse magnetic anisotropy, the diagonal components of the magneto-impedance matrix are symmetric and the off-diagonal components are antisymmetrical with respect to the de longitudinal magnetic field. The asymmetry in MI behaviour can be related to either a certain asymmetric arrangement of the dc magnetic configuration or a contribution to the measured voltage due to the ac cross-magnetisation process, represented by the off-diagonal component. The first case is realised in the wire and film having the helical or crossed anisotropies respectively, which are subjected to an ac current superposed with a de bias current. In the other approach, the asymmetric voltage response can be obtained by applying the ac current in series through the MI <b>element</b> (<b>wire</b> or film) and the small coil surrounded it. No helical anisotropy is required in this case. These kinds of asymmetrical MI are especially important for developing auto-biased linear MI sensors. The thin film with the integrated planar microcoil allowed us to measure the off-diagonal impedance in the sandwiched film. Results obtained for MI in thin films open up the perspective directions for the integrated MI sensors. The applications of the MI effect are not limited only by magnetic sensor technology. In this work, a new type of tuneable composite materials was proposed, the effective microwave permittivity (dielectric constant) of which depends on the de external magnetic field applied to the composite as a whole. The composite consists of the short pieces of ferromagnetic wires embedded into a dielectric matrix. The composite sample can be fabricated in the form of thin slab with thickness less than 1 millimetre. The short wire inclusions play the role of "the elementary scatterers", when the electromagnetic wave irradiates the composite and induces an electrical dipole moment in each inclusion. These induced dipole moments form the dipole response of the composite, which can be characterised by some effective permittivity. The field dependence of the effective permittivity arises from a high field sensitivity of the ac surface impedance of a ferromagnetic wire. In the vicinity of the antenna resonance (related with the short wire inclusions) any variations in the magneto-impedance of wires result in large changes of the effective permittivity. Therefore, this composite demonstrates both the tuneable and resonance properties (selective absorption). Thus, we have demonstrated a possibility of using the MI effect to design field-controlled composites and band-gap structures. A number of applications can be proposed, including selective microwave coatings with the field-dependent reflection/transmission coefficients and selective tuneable waveguides where the composite material may be used as an additional field-dependent coating. In addition, in the final chapter of future work we will take a quick look at tuneable composites with other microstructures and methods of the excitation...|$|E

In prior works, we seamlessly pattern areas of up to 1. 2 x 1. 2 m 2 with periodic features, i. e. a diffraction grating with a period in the micron range. For this process we use an argon ion laser emitting at 363. 8 nm. Thus, feasible periods {{are in the range}} of 100 μm to 200 nm. Edge-defined techniques or also called (self-aligned) double patterning processes can be used to double the spatial frequency of such structures.

We emulated cottonwood for its unusually ordered, periodic flutter, properties conducive to piezo excitation. Integrated over 0 °- 90 ° (azimuthal) of incident airflow, cottonwood mimics outperformed the vertical flapping stalk, but they produced << daW per conceptualized tree.
