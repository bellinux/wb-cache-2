5|$|Lindwall {{was born}} at Mascot, Sydney, New South Wales, the fourth of five children. He had one younger sister, two older sisters {{one of which was}} Eileen Lindwall who married Frank Weston and an older brother. The {{grandson}} of Swedish and Irish immigrants, Lindwall had a difficult childhood with his mother Catherine dying of pneumonia when he was seven.

5|$|After winning all the breaststroke {{events at}} the country championships, O'Brien was taken by his father to the Ryde pool in Sydney in 1960, to be coached by Forbes Carlile and his assistant, retired world record-breaking breaststroker Terry Gathercole. Carlile was {{regarded}} as the leading swimming coach in Australia at the time. At age 13, O'Brien was already a large teenager, weighing in at 82.6kg. He only trained with Gathercole during holidays, when his <b>father</b> <b>could</b> take him to Sydney; Jim Wilkins, a Catholic priest in Bathurst, supervised him according to Gathercole's program {{while he was in}} the countryside. Within a year, O'Brien rose from being a country carnival champion to a national-level athlete, despite the death of his father in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Biden's {{father had}} been very well-off earlier in his life, but {{suffered}} several business reversals {{by the time his}} son was born. For several years, the family had to live with Biden's maternal grandparents, the Finnegans. When the Scranton area went into economic decline during the 1950s, Biden's <b>father</b> <b>could</b> not find enough work. In 1953, the Biden family moved to an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, where they lived for a few years before moving to a house in Wilmington, Delaware. Joe Biden Sr. was then more successful as a used car salesman, and the family's circumstances were middle class.|$|E

5|$|Dirks {{was born}} in Bangkok, Thailand, in 1978. His father, Michael Dirks, was a {{mathematics}} teacher at the International School Bangkok recruited from the United States, his mother Suree, a Thai Chinese woman who worked in a bank at the time. After about a year, the family, including older brother William, moved back to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada so that his <b>father</b> <b>could</b> pursue doctoral studies in mathematics education at the University of British Columbia. Four years later the family settled in Michael's hometown of Spokane, Washington, where {{he took a job}} teaching math at North Central High School and Spokane Falls Community College.|$|E
5|$|Greene {{was born}} in Apponaug, Rhode Island, one of nine {{children}} of Caleb and Sarah Robinson (Greene) Greene. His family had roots in the founding of Rhode Island and in the American Revolutionary War, including General Nathanael Greene, George's second cousin. Caleb was a financially shrewd ship owner and merchant, but the Embargo Act of 1807, which prohibited U.S. vessels from carrying goods to other countries, and the War of 1812 left his family in financial difficulties. Young George attended Wrentham Academy and then a Latin grammar school in Providence and hoped to attend Brown University there, but his impoverished <b>father</b> <b>could</b> not afford it, so he moved to New York City and found work in a dry goods store on Pearl Street.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{had begun}} his {{education}} at Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit boarding school near Clane, County Kildare, in 1888 {{but had to}} leave in 1892 when his <b>father</b> <b>could</b> no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian Brothers O'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered {{a place in the}} Jesuits' Dublin school, Belvedere College, in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the Sodality of Our Lady by his peers at Belvedere. The philosophy of Thomas Aquinas continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.|$|E

His parents, Bomi (1908–2003) and Jer Bulsara (1922–2016), were Parsis from the Gujarat region of the then province of Bombay Presidency in British India. The family surname is derived from the town of Bulsar (now known as Valsad) in southern Gujarat. As Parsis, Mercury and his family practised the Zoroastrian religion. The Bulsara family had moved to Zanzibar so that his <b>father</b> <b>could</b> continue his job as a cashier at the British Colonial Office. He had a younger sister, Kashmira.|$|E

On 29 May 1915 he was wounded at Gallipoli and after recovering in England held a number of staff appointments with the 3rd Division on the Western Front in 1917–18. Following Jackson's birth the family returned to Australia in 1920 so that his <b>father</b> <b>could</b> resume his military career. He subsequently attended a number of schools, completing his secondary education at Scotch College, Melbourne in 1936, where {{he was a member of}} the athletics and rugby teams.|$|E
5|$|Mariano Moreno {{was the son}} of poor parents, Manuel Moreno y Argumosa and Ana Maria Valle, he had {{fourteen}} siblings. He {{studied at}} Colegio Grande de San Carlos, but without living in it, as his family could not afford the price. He graduated with an honor diploma. He met influential people within the literary field, who helped him to continue his studies at the University of Chuquisaca, even when his <b>father</b> <b>could</b> not afford the cost. This was the only big university in South America at the time. He studied the books of Montesquieu, Voltaire, Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and other European philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment. He studied English and French languages as well, to understand authors from Britain and France. This allowed him to work as a translator, and he spent several years working with Rousseau's The Social Contract. Moreno was convinced that society could be changed by the power of intelligence and reason.|$|E

5|$|Nevinson, {{alongside}} Edward Elgar and H.G. Wells represented British {{culture at}} the celebrations of {{the first anniversary of}} the Republic of Czechoslovakia in Prague in 1919. Nevinson first visited New York in May 1919 and spent a month there while his World War One prints were being shown, to great acclaim, at the Frederick Keppel & Co gallery. A second exhibition at the same venue in October 1920 was poorly received. This led to Nevinson becoming disillusioned with New York, to the extent he changed the name of his painting New York-an abstraction to The Soul of the Soulless City. Nevinson claimed to have been the first artist to depict New York in a modernist style but in fact several British avant-garde artists had painted in the city before World War One. In May 1919, while Nevinson was in America, Kathleen Nevinson gave birth to a baby son, but the child died shortly later and before his <b>father</b> <b>could</b> return to Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} of enduring overlordship from nearby Leinster, {{as compared to}} the more distant and anaemic overlordship of Munster, appears to have compelled the Dubliners to oppose the Leinstermen. The ensuing battle itself is recorded by both the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster and the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen, which reveal that it was Domnall himself who marshalled the forces of Munster to victory. Considering Munster's weakened state, his triumph in Dublin was remarkable achievement. Unfortunately for Donnchad, however, he lost his life in the encounter; and according to the thirteenth-century ecclesiast Giraldus Cambrensis (died 1220×1223), the Dubliners added insult to injury by burying his corpse with that of a dog as a show of contempt to the Leinstermen. There is uncertainty as to when Domnall originally gained the kingship of Dublin. His <b>father</b> <b>could</b> have installed him as such upon assuming the Irish high-kingship, or perhaps following the aforesaid ousting of Gofraid Crobán in 1094although it is not impossible that Domnall mac Taidc was installed as king at this point instead. Another possibility is that Domnall had been appointed king not long before his victory over the Leinstermenperhaps upon his father's failing health in 1114or else not long after his successful defence of Dublin. Whatever the case, the evidence of Domnall's kingship indicates that Muirchertach Ua Briain was the third consecutive claimant to the high-kingship to appoint an intended successor to the kingship of Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Wet {{weather in}} the {{following}} two years affected playing conditions, making the cricket pitches slow-paced and difficult to bat on. With little experience of such conditions, MacLaren had a succession of failures. His technique, based at the time on playing forward at the ball, was unsuited to wet pitches {{and it was only}} late in 1889 that he made the required technical adjustments and learned to play off the back foot (i.e. stepping backwards to play a shot). During 1890, his final year at Harrow, he captained the team and had his most successful season, scoring over 500 runs at an average of 42.54. In the match against Eton at Lord's, MacLaren once more succeeded when others struggled, and he scored 76 on a difficult pitch. In his four years at Harrow, MacLaren was twice awarded the prize for the school's best batsman, and received awards for his fielding. MacLaren also played football successfully: he captained his House team and played in the school first eleven in 1888 and 1889 before a knee injury forced him to miss the 1890 season. Unlike many of his fellow amateur cricketers in this period, MacLaren did not attend Oxford or Cambridge Universities, where he would have played a high level of cricket; his <b>father</b> <b>could</b> not afford to send him or his brothers there. On leaving Harrow, MacLaren found employment with the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank.|$|E
