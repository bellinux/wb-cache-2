25|$|However, {{universal}} constructions {{are more}} general than adjoint functors: a universal construction <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> optimization problem; it gives rise to an adjoint pair {{if and only if}} this problem has a solution for every object of D (equivalently, every object of C).|$|E
25|$|The church's plan is {{a mixture}} of Eastern Rite and Roman Catholic arrangement. The nave <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Italian basilica, while the large triple-apsed choir is similar to one of the early three-apsed churches, of which so many {{examples}} still exist in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. It is like two quite different churches put together endwise.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two basic}} types. One <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{oversize}} shoe or low boot made of thick rubber with a heavy sole and instep, designed for heavy-duty use. The other one is of much thinner, more flexible material, more like a rubber slipper, designed solely for protection against the wet rather than for extensive walking.|$|E
25|$|In compact stars quark matter would occupy cubic {{kilometers}} and {{exist for}} millions of years, so the thermodynamic limit is appropriate. However, the neutrinos escape, violating lepton number, so the phase space for quark matter in compact stars only has two dimensions, temperature (T) and quark number chemical potential μ. A strangelet {{is not in the}} thermodynamic limit of large volume, so it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> exotic nucleus: it may carry electric charge.|$|E
25|$|A corset dress (also {{known as}} hobble corset because it {{produces}} similar restrictive effects to a hobble skirt) {{is a long}} corset. It <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ordinary corset, but it is long {{enough to cover the}} legs, partially or totally. It thus looks like a dress, hence the name. A person wearing a corset dress can have great difficulty in walking {{up and down the stairs}} (especially if wearing high-heeled footwear) and may be unable to sit down if the boning is too stiff.|$|E

25|$|An {{apostrophe}} {{is used in}} {{time and}} money references, among others, in constructions such as one hour’s respite, two weeks’ holiday, a dollar’s worth, five pounds’ worth, one mile’s drive from here. This <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ordinary possessive use. For example, one hour’s respite means a respite of one hour (exactly as the cat’s whiskers means the whiskers of the cat). Exceptions are accounted for in the same way: three months pregnant (in modern usage, one says neither pregnant of three months, nor one month(’)s pregnant).|$|E
25|$|We treat R1 as an {{inference}} rule, {{even though}} it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> axiom in having no premises, {{because it is a}} domain-independent rule along with R2 and R3 common to all equational axiomatizations, whether of groups, rings, or any other variety. The only entity specific to Boolean algebras is axiom schema A1. In this way when talking about different equational theories we can push the rules to one side as being independent of the particular theories, and confine attention to the axioms as {{the only part of the}} axiom system characterizing the particular equational theory at hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{partition}} coefficient is defined at a specified temperature and, if applicable, pH of the aqueous phase. Partition coefficients {{are very important}} in pharmacology because they {{determine the extent to}} which a substance can pass from the blood (an aqueous solution) through a cell wall which <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> organic solvent. They are usually measured using water and octanol as the two solvents. Many pharmaceutical compounds are weak acids or weak bases. Such a compound may exist with a different extent of protonation depending on pH and the acid dissociation constant. Because the organic phase has a low dielectric constant the species with no electrical charge will be the most likely one to pass from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Even at pH7–7.2, the range of biological pH values, the aqueous phase may support an equilibrium between more than one protonated form. logp is determined from the analytical concentration of the substance in the aqueous phase, that is, the sum of the concentration of the different species in equilibrium.|$|E

25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E

Publishing sonnets about his love have become a kind of currency. This is a use of a common proverb of the time: [...] "He praises who wishes to sell."
