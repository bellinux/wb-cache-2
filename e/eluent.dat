25|$|The <b>eluent</b> is the solvent {{that carries}} the analyte.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of protein purification, the <b>eluent</b> is usually pooled in {{different}} test tubes. All test tubes containing no measurable trace of the protein to purify are discarded. The remaining solution is thus made of the protein to purify and any other similarly-sized proteins.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{mobile phase}} surface tension (organizational {{strength}} in <b>eluent</b> structure), other mobile phase modifiers can affect analyte retention. For example, {{the addition of}} inorganic salts causes a moderate linear increase in the surface tension of aqueous solutions (ca. 1.5J/cm² per Mol for NaCl, 2.5J/cm² per Mol for (NH4)2SO4), and because the entropy of the analyte-solvent interface is controlled by surface tension, the addition of salts tend to increase the retention time. This technique is used for mild separation and recovery of proteins and protection of their biological activity in protein analysis (hydrophobic interaction chromatography, HIC).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Micro {{two-dimensional}} separations were per-formed on polar bonded stationary {{phases of}} the type cy-anopropyl-silica using non-aqueous <b>eluents</b> (polar modifier dissolved in n-heptane) as the first direction <b>eluents</b> and aqueous <b>eluents</b> (organic modifier—MeOH dissolved in water) as the second direction <b>eluents.</b> The chromato-graphic process was performed in micro scale using 5 9 5 cm plates, small volumes of <b>eluents</b> and 10 lL of plant extracts to obtain satisfying separation. Plates developed in horizontal chambers were dried and observed in UV light (254 nm and 366 m) photographed by digital camera and derivatized by DPPH to detect antioxidants (free radical scavengers) or derivatized by Naturstoff reagent to detect phenolic compounds (characteristic luminescence of some phenolic compounds). The above experiments give the possibility to construct fingerprints for investigated Polygonum hydropiper, Betula verrucosa and Pulmonaria officinalis extracts. It {{can be used in}} quality control of the plant material and its antioxidative activity. Novelty of the paper is the micro-scale of the separation by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography mode. For the first time two-dimensional separation of plant extracts on 5 9 5 cm plates in two directions is performed...|$|R

30|$|The <b>eluents</b> for HPLC-ESI-Q-ToF {{analyses}} were water and acetonitrile, both LC–MS grade (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) with 1 % formic acid (98 % purity, J. T. Baker).|$|R
25|$|The chosen {{composition}} of the mobile phase (also called <b>eluent)</b> depends on the intensity of interactions between various sample components ("analytes") and stationary phase (e.g. hydrophobic interactions in reversed-phase HPLC). Depending on their affinity for the stationary and mobile phases analytes partition between the two during the separation process {{taking place in the}} column. This partitioning process is similar to that which occurs during a liquid–liquid extraction but is continuous, not step-wise. In this example, using a water/acetonitrile gradient, more hydrophobic components will elute (come off the column) late, once the mobile phase gets more concentrated in acetonitrile (i.e. in a mobile phase of higher eluting strength).|$|E
2500|$|Chromatography {{can be used}} to {{separate}} protein in solution or denaturing conditions by using porous gels. This technique is known as [...] size exclusion chromatography. The principle is that smaller molecules have to traverse a larger volume in a porous matrix. Consequentially, proteins of a certain range in size will require a variable volume of <b>eluent</b> (solvent) before being collected {{at the other end of}} the column of gel.|$|E
2500|$|Gradient elution {{decreases}} {{the retention of}} the later-eluting components so that they elute faster, giving narrower (and taller) peaks for most components. This also improves the peak shape for tailed peaks, as the increasing concentration of the organic <b>eluent</b> pushes the tailing part of a peak forward. This also increases the peak height (the peak looks [...] "sharper"), which is important in trace analysis. The gradient program may include sudden [...] "step" [...] increases {{in the percentage of}} the organic component, or different slopes at different times – all according to the desire for optimum separation in minimum time.|$|E
30|$|The <b>eluents</b> for the HPLC–DAD {{analyses}} were: {{water and}} acetonitrile (ACN) both HPLC grade (Sigma Aldrich, USA), while the <b>eluents</b> for HPLC-ESI-Q-ToF analyses were water and acetonitrile, both LC–MS grade (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). All <b>eluents</b> were added with 0.1 % v/v formic acid (FA; 98 % purity, J.T. Baker, USA). The chromatographic separation {{was performed on}} an analytical reversed-phase column Poroshell 120 EC-C 18 (3.0 [*]×[*] 75  mm, particle size 2.7  μm) with a Zorbax SB-C 18 pre-column (4.6 [*]×[*] 12.5  mm, particle size 5  μm), both Agilent Technologies. The flow rate was 0.4  ml/min and the program was 15 % B for 2.6  min, then to 50 % B in 13.0  min, to 70 % B in 5.2  min, to 100 % B in 0.5  min and then held for 6.7  min. Re-equilibration took 11  min. During the separation, the column was kept at 30  °C.|$|R
30|$|Purification was {{performed}} by semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (VWR LaPrep HPLC, VWR, Radnor, PA, USA) using an Ultrasphere ODS column (Beckman, Brea, CA, USA, 5  μm, 250 [*]×[*] 10  mm) with <b>eluents</b> A: acetic acid (17  mM)/ascorbic acid (1  mM), and B: ethanol (99.5 %). After purification, the <b>eluents</b> were removed using rotary evaporation and the product was reformulated in 10  mL pharmaceutical-grade solution containing ethanol 99.5 %/phosphate buffer/water (0.9 / 2.3 / 6.8) and sterile filtered (Dynagard, 0.2  μm, 2.5  cm 2 Hollow Fiber Syringe Filter, Microgon Inc., Laguna Hills, CA, USA). A sample was analyzed by analytical HPLC (VWR LaChrom Elite) using a Spherisorb column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA, 5  μm, 4.6 [*]×[*] 250  mm) and <b>eluents</b> A: acetic acid (17  mM), and B: acetonitrile. Both HPLC systems were equipped with UV detectors set at 254  nm and radio detectors (Bioscan Flow-Count PMT, Bioscan, Washington, DC, USA).|$|R
40|$|Here we {{describe}} the preparation and characterization of hybrid materials composed by shortened single-walled nanotubes and sidewall derivatized multi-walled nanotubes deposited on the external surface of HPLC mesoporous spherical silica particles. The resulting materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and used in high performance liquid chromatography experiments under {{a broad range of}} experimental conditions (organic and water based <b>eluents,</b> variable temperature). Compared to a pure graphitic porous carbon packing, our materials show less pronounced hydrophobicity and are suitable for the analysis of polar compounds with water based <b>eluents...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) has a {{non-polar}} {{stationary phase}} and an aqueous, moderately polar mobile phase. One common stationary phase is a silica which has been surface-modified with RMe2SiCl, where R is a straight chain alkyl group such as C18H37 or C8H17. With such stationary phases, retention time is longer for molecules which are less polar, while polar molecules elute more readily (early in the analysis). An investigator can increase retention times by adding more water to the mobile phase; thereby making the affinity of the hydrophobic analyte for the hydrophobic stationary phase stronger relative to the now more hydrophilic mobile phase. Similarly, an investigator can decrease retention time by adding more organic solvent to the <b>eluent.</b> RP-HPLC is so commonly used that it is often incorrectly referred to as [...] "HPLC" [...] without further specification. The pharmaceutical industry regularly employs RP-HPLC to qualify drugs before their release.|$|E
2500|$|RP-HPLC {{operates}} {{on the principle}} of hydrophobic interactions, which originates from the high symmetry in the dipolar water structure and plays the most important role in all processes in life science. RP-HPLC allows the measurement of these interactive forces. The binding of the analyte to the stationary phase is proportional to the contact surface area around the non-polar segment of the analyte molecule upon association with the ligand on the stationary phase. This solvophobic effect is dominated by the force of water for [...] "cavity-reduction" [...] around the analyte and the C18-chain versus the complex of both. The energy released in this process is proportional to the surface tension of the <b>eluent</b> (water: 7.3J/cm², methanol: 2.2J/cm²) and to the hydrophobic surface of the analyte and the ligand respectively. The retention can be decreased by adding a less polar solvent (methanol, acetonitrile) into the mobile phase to reduce the surface tension of water. Gradient elution uses this effect by automatically reducing the polarity and the surface tension of the aqueous mobile phase {{during the course of the}} analysis.|$|E
2500|$|DESI can be {{coupled to}} {{ultra-fast}} liquid chromatography using an LC <b>eluent</b> splitting strategy. It {{is a strategy}} through a tiny orifice on an LC capillary tube. There is negligible dead volume and back pressure that allows for almost real time mass spectrometry detection with a fast elution and purification. This coupling {{can be used to}} ionize a wide range of molecules, from small organics to high mass proteins. This is different from ESI (electrospray ionization) in that {{it can be used to}} directly analyze salt-containing sample solutions without requiring [...] “make-up” solvents/ acids to be doped into the sample. This set up allows for a high flow rate without splitting. The high resolution that is accomplished by reverse-phase HPLC can be combined with this procedure to produce high throughput screening of natural products as well. The incorporation of the electrochemistry component helps with ionization efficiency via the electrochemical conversion. This method is proved better than ESI in the fact that you don't have to separate the small potential that is applied to the cell from the potential on the spray in DESI. DESI also shows a better tolerance to inorganic salt electrolytes and you can use traditional solvents used in electrolysis.|$|E
30|$|The <b>eluents</b> for the HPLC-DAD {{analyses}} were: bi-distilled water (Carlo Erba, Italy) and acetonitrile, HPLC grade (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), {{both with}} 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid [TFA, 99 % purity, from Fluka (Milan, Italy)].|$|R
30|$|The HPAEC-PAD {{analysis}} was performed on a DIONEX ISC 3000 system (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) including pump, detector and autosampler. A CarboPac PA 200 column with guard column was used at 30 °C and flow rate of 0.5  ml/min. The injection volume was 10  μl. Three <b>eluents</b> were prepared in plastic bottles that were carefully purged using helium. The <b>eluents</b> consisted of water (A), 400  mM sodium acetate containing 200  mM NaOH (B) and 200  mM NaOH (C). The oligosaccharides were eluted using the gradient in 30  min: 50 % to 0 % C and 0 % to 50 % B. The initial condition was equilibrated in 5  min between the injections.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} program {{was used to}} further develop the existing W-Ta generator and to evaluate alternative adsorbents, preferably inorganic materials, as supports for the generator. During the first half year, combinations of non-complexing <b>eluents</b> {{and a variety of}} adsorbents, both inorganic and organic, were evaluated. Some of these adsorbents were synthetic, such as chelate resins that could be specific for tungsten. In {{the second half of the}} year, the stress was mainly on the use of complexing <b>eluents</b> because of the high affinity of hydrous oxides for tantalum, on the synthesis of chelate resins and on the use novel techniques (electrolytic) to solve the tantalum-adsorption problem...|$|R
2500|$|Partition {{chromatography}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} kinds of chromatography that chemists developed. The partition coefficient principle has been applied in paper chromatography, thin layer chromatography, gas phase and liquid–liquid separation applications. The 1952 Nobel Prize in chemistry was earned by Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge for their development of the technique, which was used for their separation of amino acids. Partition chromatography uses a retained solvent, on the surface or within the grains or fibers of an [...] "inert" [...] solid supporting matrix as with paper chromatography; or takes advantage of some coulombic and/or hydrogen donor interaction with the stationary phase. Analyte molecules partition between a liquid stationary phase and the <b>eluent.</b> Just as in Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC; a sub-technique within HPLC), this method separates analytes based on differences in their polarity. HILIC most often uses a bonded polar stationary phase and a mobile phase made primarily of acetonitrile with water as the strong component. Partition HPLC has been used historically on unbonded silica or alumina supports. Each works effectively for separating analytes by relative polar differences. HILIC bonded phases have the advantage of separating acidic, basic and neutral solutes in a single chromatographic run.|$|E
50|$|The {{mobile phase}} or <b>eluent</b> {{is either a}} pure solvent or a mixture of {{different}} solvents. It is chosen so that the retention factor value of the compound of interest is roughly around 0.2 - 0.3 {{in order to minimize}} the time and the amount of <b>eluent</b> to run the chromatography. The <b>eluent</b> has also been chosen so that the different compounds can be separated effectively. The <b>eluent</b> is optimized in small scale pretests, often using thin layer chromatography (TLC) with the same stationary phase.|$|E
5000|$|For the wet method, a slurry is {{prepared}} of the <b>eluent</b> with the stationary phase powder and then carefully {{poured into the}} column. Care {{must be taken to}} avoid air bubbles. A solution of the organic material is pipetted on top of the stationary phase. This layer is usually topped with a small layer of sand or with cotton or glass wool to protect the shape of the organic layer from the velocity of newly added <b>eluent.</b> <b>Eluent</b> is slowly passed through the column to advance the organic material. Often a spherical <b>eluent</b> reservoir or an eluent-filled and stoppered separating funnel is put on top of the column.|$|E
30|$|The WS {{portions}} collected {{were analyzed}} and characterized using high-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC), {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). The HPAEC system (Dionex ICS- 1000 system) equipped with the CarboPac PA- 1 column (4  mm ×  250  mm) and electrochemical detector for pulsed amperometric detection was employed and operated at 35  °C and flow rate of 1.0  mL/min under the helium atmosphere for monosaccharides and cello-oligosaccharides in the WS portions. The mobile phase was a gradient-programmed mixture of deionized water, 0.2  M NaOH and 2.0  M CH 3 COONa, as <b>eluents.</b> All <b>eluents</b> contained in 3 separate reservoirs were degassed by an aspirator and subsequently purged with helium to prevent the absorption of CO 2.|$|R
40|$|The {{differential}} chromatogram {{method was}} useful to reduce large changes in background response in single column ion chromatography using stepwise elution. Cations (Na^+, K^+, Mg^ and Ca^) were separated on cation exchange column by stepwise elution using both 0. 01 mM and 3. 0 mM copper sulfate <b>eluents</b> and detected at 230 nm by indirect photometry. Anions (lactate, acetate, propionate, formate, citrate, Cl^-, NO_ 2 ^-, Br^-, NO_ 3 ^-, SO_ 4 ^, S_ 2 O_ 3 ^ and I^-) were separated on an anion exchange column using both 0. 3 mM and 1. 5 mM disodium phthalate <b>eluents</b> and detected at 270 nm.

40|$|High-performance liquid {{chromatography}} (HPLC) combined with {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (ICPMS) has been studied {{as a means for}} the detection of carbon to provide a universal method for detecting organic compounds in chromatographic <b>eluents.</b> Carbon is particularly difficult to ionise and the amount of carbon present in normal chromatographic systems leads to high backgrounds, making detection a challenge. Novel separation approaches were therefore employed, using either entirely aqueous <b>eluents</b> (at temperatures of 60 and 160 °C, dependent on the column used) to eliminate the organic modifier completely, or isotopically enriched solvents. For the aqueous <b>eluents,</b> detection limits for sulphanilamide were found to be 2. 26 μg, corresponding to 1. 13 μmol (0. 47 μmol of carbon), injected on a conventional 4. 6 mm i. d. column. The use of a narrow bore column with highly isotopically enriched 12 C-methanol (99. 95 atom%) as organic modifier for the mobile phase enabled the detection of 86 μmol for 13 C-triple-labelled caffeine and 79 μmol for 13 C-double-labelled phenacetin. The sensitive detection of 12 C-compounds with 13 C-enriched methanol as organic modifier proved impractical due to a lower level of isotopic enrichment (99 atom%) of this solvent, with the residual 12 C-methanol resulting in significant interference. </p...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>eluent</b> or eluant is the [...] "carrier" [...] {{portion of}} the mobile phase. It moves the analytes through the chromatograph. In liquid chromatography, the <b>eluent</b> is the liquid solvent; in gas chromatography, it is the carrier gas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>eluent</b> {{exits the}} GC column (A) {{and enters the}} FID detector’s oven (B). The oven is needed {{to make sure that}} as soon as the <b>eluent</b> exits the column, it does not come out of the gaseous phase and deposit on the {{interface}} between the column and FID. This deposition would result in loss of <b>eluent</b> and errors in detection. As the <b>eluent</b> travels up the FID, it is first mixed with the hydrogen fuel (C) and then with the oxidant (D). The eluent/fuel/oxidant mixture continues to travel up to the nozzle head where a positive bias voltage exists (E). This positive bias helps to repel the reduced carbon ions created by the flame (F) pyrolyzing the <b>eluent.</b> The ions are repelled up toward the collector plates (G) which are connected to a very sensitive ammeter, which detects the ions hitting the plates, then feeds that signal (H) to an amplifier, integrator, and display system. The products of the flame are finally vented out of the detector through the exhaust port (J).|$|E

30|$|All chromatographic separations {{were carried}} out on a Phenomenex Kinetex C 18 column (250 [*]×[*] 4.6  mm, 5  μm) using a mobile phase {{consisting}} of methanol:water (60 : 40 %, v/v) in an isocratic mode at a flow rate of 1  mL/min. All <b>eluents</b> were detected at 276  nm.|$|R
30|$|The {{contribution}} of artifacts on structural diversity of alkaloids from Rauvolfia species is not ignorable as acidic or basic conditions {{are often used}} during isolation process, in spite that many artifacts from this genus are generally presented in literatures as naturally occurring compounds [9]. Considering {{that the presence of}} aldehyde group at C- 16 /C- 20 is common for sarpagine/perakine type alkaloids [8, 10, 11], it’s plausible to deduce that, like triacetonamine [12], a common artifact of plant extractions, the 2, 2 -dimethyl- 4 -oxopiperidine moiety might also be an artifact produced by reaction of aldehyde group with acetone/ammonia since the latter were used as <b>eluents</b> during the isolation procedures. These artifacts represent a unique type of sarpagine/perakine series bearing an unusual piperidine unit brought about by using common <b>eluents.</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the Snyder {{equation}} is not quite satisfactory for fitting retention data in normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on chemically bonded phases. This equation is a special case of the mathematical—statistical three-mode factor analysis model.

This study represents the first application of three mode factor analysis with missing data, and also the first application of three-mode factor analysis in the field of the natural sciences. The accuracy of the fit of the observations and of the prediction of the missing data, for various numbers of extracted factors, is discussed...|$|R
50|$|When {{performing}} this method, {{the bands}} of the eluting molecules may be broadened. This can occur by turbulence {{caused by the}} flow of the mobile phase molecules passing through the molecules of the stationary phase. In addition, molecular thermal diffusion and friction between the molecules of the glass walls and the molecules of the <b>eluent</b> contribute to the broadening of the bands. Besides broadening, the bands also overlap with each other. As a result, the <b>eluent</b> usually gets considerably diluted. A few precautions can be taken to prevent the likelihood of the bands broadening. For instance, one can apply the sample in a narrow, highly concentrated band {{on the top of the}} column. The more concentrated the <b>eluent</b> is, the more efficient the procedure would be. However, it is not always possible to concentrate the <b>eluent,</b> which can be considered as one more disadvantage.|$|E

50|$|The protein binding {{principles}} in EBA {{are the same}} as in classical column chromatography and the common ion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction and affinity chromatography ligands can be used. After the adsorption step is complete, the fluidized bed is washed to flush out any remaining particulates. Elution of the adsorbed proteins was commonly performed with the <b>eluent</b> flow in the reverse direction; that is, as a conventional packed bed, in order to recover the adsorbed solutes in a smaller volume of <b>eluent.</b> However, a new generation of EBA columns has been developed, which maintain the bed in the expanded state during this phase, producing high-purity, high yields of e.g. MAbs antibodies in even smaller volumes of <b>eluent.</b> Process duration at manufacturing scale has also been cut considerably (under 7 hours in some cases).|$|E
