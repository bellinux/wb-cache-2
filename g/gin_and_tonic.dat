As the quinine powder was so bitter people began mixing the powder with soda and sugar, and a basic tonic water was created. The first commercial tonic water was produced in 1858. The mixed drink <b>gin</b> <b>and</b> <b>tonic</b> also originated in British colonial India, when the British population would mix their medicinal quinine tonic with gin.|$|E

500|$|After {{living in}} a series of rented flats, in 1951 the couple moved to a house in St. John's Wood, where they sublet rooms to lodgers such as the actors Julian Mitchell and Tony Richardson. Fuelled by plenty of <b>gin</b> <b>and</b> <b>tonic</b> to cover her shyness, Manning could be a witty {{participant}} in London's literary scene; as in childhood she was given to making boastful inventions, such as claiming a family relationship to Marie Belloc Lowndes and that she had received a marriage proposal from Anthony Burgess the morning after his wife's death. Her insecurities also showed in other ways: she was very anxious about finances, and always alert for ways to make and save money. After the war both she and Reggie were unfaithful. At parties, Reggie would regularly ask other women if they were interested in extramarital encounters, while Manning claimed to have had affairs with both William Gerhardie and Henry Green, and engaged in an unrequited pursuit of her lodger, Tony Richardson. Jerry Slattery, her doctor, became her long-term lover; her affair came as a shock to Reggie, who felt he must have disappointed his wife. However, after a difficult start, Reggie adjusted and soon became a close friend of Jerry. Manning's adultery in some ways made it easier for Reggie to justify his own frequent affairs, including his longstanding relationship with Diana Robson, who was to become his second wife. Manning never paid undue attention to his infidelities, usually responding, [...] "you know what Reggie's like". The two never contemplated divorce, believing that marriage was a lifelong commitment.|$|E

50|$|The Haul {{is often}} {{associated}} with steampunk, a sub-cultural movement that draws its inspiration from a fusion of Victorian-era science fiction and contemporary technology. True to the alternative histories that are a staple of the steampunk genre, the Neverwas Haul has its origin story in a history that never was, a history in which the Hibernian Empire (not the British Empire) dominated the sociopolitical landscape of the nineteenth century—Hibernia being an obscure name for Ireland. In this mythology, the Neverwas Haul is the greatest of all the Hauls - gypsy vardo-like vehicles driven by Track Banshees - itinerant women who use their preternatural mechanical skills to keep their families on the move. The Haul is the primary mode of transport for the Traveling Academy of Unnatural Science, who seek to acculturate the heathens of the Black Rock Desert (where the Burning Man festival is held) by sharing such cultural staples as fine whiskey, <b>Gin</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tonics,</b> <b>and</b> high tea.|$|R

In 1975, after drinking <b>gin</b> <b>and</b> <b>tonics</b> {{at a party}} and then taking Diazepam, Quinlan collapsed, suffered respiratory failure and irreversible brain damage, and, after being taken to the hospital, lapsed into a persistent vegetative state. After she had been kept alive on a ventilator for several months without improvement, her parents requested that the hospital discontinue such active care and allow her to die. The hospital refused, and the subsequent legal battles made newspaper headlines and set significant precedents.
