The <b>flow</b> <b>domains</b> treated {{in this study are}} analogous in an idealized sense to those encountered in pebble bed based high temperature nuclear reactors. The quantification of turbulent flow effects serves two purposes.

Secondly, the quantification of turbulent flow effects adds to our fundamental understanding of the physics of incompressible flows in complex geometries. The study was conducted using an open-source spectral element computational fluid dynamics code, Nek 5000, which was used to perform a series of direct numerical simulations in several <b>flow</b> <b>domains</b> representing both theoretical geometries and idealized sections of a practical reactor core at low to moderate Reynolds numbers.

The heat transfer characteristics and flow structure in turbulent flow throught a rectangular channel containing built-in wing type vortex generator, have been investigated experimentally in the range of Reynolds number between 3, 000 and 30, 000. The geometrical conguration of interest is reminiscent of single element of a plate-n cross-flow heat exchanger.

A thorough computational {{study has been}} performed to understand the concentration and thermohydraulic maldistribution of nanofluids in parallel microchannel systems using an Eulerian Lagrangian twin phase model. The study reveals that nanofluids cannot be treated as homogeneous single phase fluids in such complex <b>flow</b> <b>domains</b> and effective property models fail drastically to predict the performance parameters. To comprehend {{the distribution of the}} particulate phase, a novel concentration maldistribution factor has been proposed.

Particle maldistribution has been conclusively shown to be due to various migration and diffusive phenomena like Stokesian drag, Brownian motion, thermophoretic drift, etc. The implications of particle distribution on the cooling performance have been illustrated and smart fluid effects (reduced magnitude of maximum temperature) have been observed and a mathematical model to predict the enhanced cooling performance in such flow geometries has been proposed.
