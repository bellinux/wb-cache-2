40|$|There {{have been}} so many <b>demonstrations</b> {{happened}} in Indonesia during post Reformation era. These student <b>demonstrations</b> and student movement have special fascination for mass media to publish and make them as interesting news for the society. Kompas newspaper is the one of the mass media which always reports some student <b>demonstrations.</b> However, Kompas sometime hyper illustrates the violence which happened in student <b>demonstrations.</b> The use of words like clash, chaos, disturbance, and causing traffic jam always appears on Kompas’ student <b>demonstrations</b> news. This research purposed to reveal how the audiences’ interpretation toward student <b>demonstrations</b> news on Kompas newspaper. This research uses qualitative methods with reception analysis approach. In analysis of reception, audiences considered as not only consumer of media content, but also as meaning producer. Audiences will read student <b>demonstrations</b> news, and then interpret it based on their knowledge. This research also uses Struart Hall encoding-decoding model to explain encoding and decoding process of student <b>demonstrations</b> news. The result of this research shows how audience are active in interpretating the student <b>demonstrations</b> news. Audiences’ interpretation consist of three interpretation positions; dominant reading, negotiated reading, and oppositional reading. Audiences who include in dominant reading position, interpret student <b>demonstrations</b> are close with violence. Audiences interpreted student <b>demonstrations</b> as preferred reading which appeared on Kompas. While audiences in negotiated reading position, interpreted student <b>demonstrations</b> by their own assumptions. These audiences evaluated that student <b>demonstrations</b> didn’t create chaos, but still assumed that student <b>demonstrations</b> have positive impact. Audiences, who included in oppositional reading, interpreted student <b>demonstrations</b> news oppositely with the preferred reading which written by Kompas. This research is openly to be study from some different perspectives and methods. Another similar research with different approach expected to increase and complete the present research.

40|$|Inverse {{reinforcement}} learning (IRL) allows autonomous agents {{to learn to}} solve complex tasks from successful <b>demonstrations.</b> However, in many settings, e. g., when a human learns the task by trial and error, failed <b>demonstrations</b> are also readily available. In addition, in some tasks, purposely generating failed <b>demonstrations</b> may be easier than generating successful ones. Since existing IRL methods cannot make use of failed <b>demonstrations,</b> {{in this paper we}} propose inverse {{reinforcement learning}} from failure (IRLF) which exploits both successful and failed <b>demonstrations.</b> Starting from the state-of-the-art maximum causal entropy IRL method, we propose a new constrained optimisation formulation that accommodates both types of <b>demonstrations</b> while remaining convex. We then derive update rules for learning reward functions and policies. Experiments on both simulated and real-robot data demonstrate that IRLF converges faster and generalises better than maximum causal entropy IRL, especially when few successful <b>demonstrations</b> are available...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{dissertation}} initially {{displays the}} key issues of Reverse Logistics and product <b>demonstrations.</b> A company {{in order to achieve}} an efficient product <b>demonstrations</b> management it is important to integrate and synthesize its strategies and policies with a responsive Closed-Loop Supply Chain. In the balance of this dissertation the author will try to achieve an insight into an optimal product <b>demonstrations</b> management. Based upon empirical evidence, it discusses the integration and alignment of the <b>demonstrations</b> operations with the reverse supply chain activities for expensive and time-sensitive products, for the Hewlett Packard case. Methodology/approach At first with the aid of an Analytical model, valuable information will be revealed for the major tradeoffs as well as the optimal policies, but for a simplified problem environment. A Linear Programming model for discovering insights in key sensitivities, process dynamics etc. is then proposed, showing the optimal policies for product <b>demonstrations.</b> Findings The results obtained reveal that a key factor for a successful product <b>demonstrations</b> management is an effective and responsive Closed-Loop Supply Chain. It is therefore to be supposed that an efficient and strategically integrated products <b>demonstrations</b> management would improve the results of this firm and increase its competitive advantage. This integration supports the idea that controlling product <b>demonstrations</b> effectively is not an easy task. But it seems that it is essential for companies with substantial product returns from <b>demonstrations.</b> Originality This dissertation may present some originality in identifying optimal solutions in <b>demonstrations</b> planning.

5|$|Like Compton, many U.S. {{officials}} and scientists {{argued that a}} <b>demonstration</b> would sacrifice the shock value of the atomic attack, and the Japanese could deny the atomic bomb was lethal, making the mission less likely to produce surrender.

They also worried that the bomb might be a dud since the Trinity test was of a stationary device, not an air-dropped bomb. In addition, only two bombs would be available {{at the start of}} August, although more were in production, and they cost billions of dollars, so using one for a <b>demonstration</b> would be expensive.|$|E
