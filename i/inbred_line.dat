When the <b>inbred</b> <b>lines</b> reached to 6 -leaf stage, Water Use Efficiency (WUE), Leaf Relative Water Content (LRWC), Excised Leaf Water Lost (ELWL) and stomata characteristics were measured for all <b>inbred</b> <b>lines</b> under the three treatments. Height and dry matter were also recorded for the all 7 <b>inbred</b> <b>lines.</b> Although <b>inbred</b> <b>lines</b> behaved differently when they were subjected to water-stress, nonetheless, the results indicated that water-stress significantly influence all characters except ELWL. This indicates that ELWL is not a sui criterion for screening water-stress tolerant genotypes.

Among the water-related characters studied, LRWC seemed to be the best character for screening drought tolerant genotypes due to its quick response to water-stress at the two stress treatments.

The high heritability estimates obtained from husked and dehusked fresh ear yields in this study indicate that the <b>inbred</b> <b>lines</b> have become homozygous at almost all the loci after eight generations of selfing. Husked fresh ear yield was phenotypically and genetically correlated with dehusked fresh ear yield, number of ears per hectare, husked and dehusked ear weights, dehusked ear length, husked and dehusked ear diameter, number of kernels per row and number of kernel rows per ear, indicating direct positive contribution of these traits to husked fresh ear yield. Visualizing the relationship among the <b>inbred</b> <b>lines</b> using singular value decomposition biplot analysis revealed that the <b>inbred</b> <b>lines</b> could be assigned into three distinct groups.

For organisms in which the male is heterogametic, such as humans, almost all X-linked genes are hemizygous in males with normal chromosomes because they have only one X chromosome and few of the same genes are on the Y chromosome. Transgenic mice generated through exogenous DNA microinjection of an embryo's pronucleus are also considered to be hemizygous because the introduced allele is expected to be incorporated into only one copy of any locus.

Here, excellent salt-tolerant maize <b>inbred</b> <b>line</b> TL 1317 and extremely salt-sensitive maize <b>inbred</b> <b>line</b> SL 1303 were screened to understand the maize response to salt stress and its tolerance mechanisms. Relative water content, membrane stability index, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, maximum photochemical efficiency, photochemical efficiency, shoot and root fresh/dry weight, and proline and water soluble sugar content analyses were used to identify that the physiological effects of osmotic stress of salt stress were obvious and manifested at about 3 days after salt stress in maize. Moreover, the ion concentration of two maize inbred lines revealed that the salt-tolerant maize <b>inbred</b> <b>line</b> could maintain low Na+ concentration by accumulating Na+ in old leaves and gradually shedding them to exclude excessive Na+.
