5000|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must walk a metaphorical tightrope, with two {{possible}} ways to lose the game; every 21 days, the Prime Minister reviews the opinion polls and will fire the Director General, <b>hereinafter</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> DG, if his approval rating is under 50%. If the player is too severe, firing will be implemented by giving the DG [...] "flying lessons". If he still has the lead, the DG will be given more money and employees to work with. With luck, the DG can temporarily keep his job by spying on and ignoring or discrediting suspects without using more severe and obvious methods such as [...] "removal", [...] "interrogation" [...] or [...] "heavy assault"; however, if the player is clumsy or blatant, the Prime Minister will quickly threaten and then order a flying lesson to be given to the DG.

40|$|AbstractTuberculosis is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} infection worldwide. The emergence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) isolates emphasizes {{that it is necessary}} to monitor drug resistance of the organism against anti-tubercular drugs. We analyzed 327 M. tuberculosis isolates from patients who were cared for at three different health care centers, <b>hereinafter</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> study areas (SAs), in North India. Of the 327 total M. tuberculosis isolates, 255 were from a tertiary health care center (Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh [SA- 1]), 48 were from a District tuberculosis center (Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan [SA- 2]), and 24 were from a different District tuberculosis center (Buxar, Bihar [SA- 3]). Drug susceptibility testing against first-line antibiotics (viz. isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and ethambutol) was conducted for all the isolates using 1 % proportional method. We found that the rates of acquired resistance were consistently higher than the rates of initial drug resistance. In new, untreated cases, a higher degree of MDR-TB was observed at SA- 1 (13. 3 %) and SA- 3 (25. 0 %), whereas it was observed in only 7. 1 % of the isolates at SA- 2. In previously treated patients, MDR cases were found in 35. 7 % of the isolates from SA- 1, 66. 6 % of the isolates from SA- 2, and 43. 8 % of the isolates from SA- 3. Resistance to a single drug was found at a much lower rate, ranging from 0. 0 to 6. 3 % in new cases as well as previously treated cases. In conclusion, the primary resistance of M. tuberculosis is low, but acquired drug resistance is slightly higher in North India...|$|E

40|$|Vegetation {{moisture}} and {{dry matter content}} are important indicators in predicting the behavior of fire and it is widely used in fire spread models. In this study, leaf fuel moisture content such as Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC), Leaf Relative Water Content (RWC), Dead Fuel Moisture Content (DFMC), and Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC) (<b>hereinafter</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> moisture content indices (MCI)) were calculated {{in the field for}} different forest species at 32 sites in a temperate humid forest (Zaringol forest) located in northeastern Iran. These data and several relevant vegetation-biophysical indices and atmospheric variables calculated using Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data with moderate spatial resolution (30 m) were used to estimate MCI of the Zaringol forest using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) methods. The prediction of MCI using ANN showed that ETM+ predicted MCI slightly better (Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 6 %– 12 %)) than MLR (MAPE between 8 % and 17 %). Once satisfactory results in estimating MCI were obtained by using ANN from ETM+ data, these data were then upscaled to estimate MCI using MODIS data for daily monitoring of leaf water and leaf dry matter content at 500 m spatial resolution. For MODIS derived LFMC, LDMC, RWC, and DLMC, the ANN produced a MAPE between 11 % and 29 % for the indices compared to MLR which produced an MAPE of 14 %– 33 %. In conclusion, we suggest that upscaling is necessary for solving the scale discrepancy problems between the indicators and low spatial resolution MODIS data. The scaling up of MCI could be used for pre-fire alert system and thereby can detect fire prone areas in near real time for fire-fighting operations...|$|E
