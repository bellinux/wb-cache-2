6000|$|In a Parliament of May 18, 1584, such <b>declinature</b> {{of royal}} {{jurisdiction}} was, by [...] "The Black Acts," [...] made treason: Episcopacy was established; the heirs of Gowrie were disinherited; Angus, Mar, and other rebels were forfeited. But such forfeitures never held long in Scotland.|$|E
5000|$|On 13 December 1638 he was deposed and excommunicated by the Glasgow assembly, whose authority, {{in common}} with the other bishops, he had refused to recognise. In {{addition}} to the ecclesiastical offence of signing the <b>declinature,</b> he was accused of drunkenness and incontinence, and of [...] "using of masse crucifixes in his chamber". On 23 August 1639 he and the other Scottish prelates drew up a protest against their exclusion from parliament.|$|E
50|$|Instead, on 16 February 1737, he {{left the}} Church, and two days later joined the Associate Presbytery of the Secession. It was he who read the Secession's <b>Declinature</b> on 17 May 1739 to the Assembly of the Church of Scotland. As an {{objector}} to the Burgess Oath, he became the Moderator of the Associate Presbytery's Synod, picking the Anti-Burgher side when it later split in the Breach of 1747. In 1740, he, alongside the other secessionist ministers, were all formally deposed from office by the Assembly.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1638, {{on the eve}} of {{the meeting}} of the General Assembly at Glasgow, he was at Hamilton, with Walter Whiteford, Bishop of Brechin. He was one of the six prelates who signed the <b>declinature</b> {{addressed}} to the general assembly, and on this and other grounds was deposed and excommunicated (13 December) by the assembly, the same assembly which abolished Episcopacy in the Kingdom of Scotland. Maxwell was charged with bowing to the altar, wearing cope and rochet, using [...] "the English liturgy" [...] for the past two years in his house and cathedral, ordaining deacons, giving absolution, fasting on Friday, and travelling and card-playing on Sunday. His accusers described him as [...] "a perfect pattern of a proud prelate".|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} family of p-enrichment schemes. These schemes may be {{separated}} into two basic classes: the first, called fixed tolerance schemes, rely on setting global scalar tolerances on the local regularity of the solution, and the second, called dioristic schemes, rely on time-evolving bounds on the local variation in the solution. Each class of p-enrichment scheme is further divided into two basic types. The first type (the Type I schemes) enrich along lines of maximal variation, striving to enhance stable solutions in "areas of highest interest. " The second type (the Type II schemes) enrich along lines of maximal regularity {{in order to maximize}} the stability of the enrichment process. Each of these schemes are tested over a pair of model problems arising in coastal hydrology. The first is a contaminant transport model, which addresses a <b>declinature</b> problem for a contaminant plume with respect to a bay inlet setting. The second is a multicomponent chemically reactive flow model of estuary eutrophication arising in the Gulf of Mexico. Comment: 29 pages, 7 figures, 3 table...|$|E
