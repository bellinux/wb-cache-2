5|$|In 1940 Alvarez {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory (MIT), where he {{contributed to a}} number of World War II radar projects, from early {{improvements}} to Identification friend or foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge. The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has {{played a major role in}} aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was <b>Ground</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach</b> (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses, and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 The Great Artiste.|$|E
500|$|The {{radar system}} for which Alvarez {{is best known}} and which has {{played a major role}} in aviation, most {{particularly}} in the post war Berlin airlift, was <b>Ground</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach</b> (GCA). Using Alvarez's dipole antenna to achieve a very high angular resolution, GCA allows ground-based radar operators watching special precision displays to guide a landing airplane to the runway by transmitting verbal commands to the pilot. The system was simple, direct, and worked well, even with previously untrained pilots. It was so successful that the military continued to use it for many years after the war, and it was still in use in some countries in the 1980s. Alvarez was awarded the National Aeronautic Association's Collier Trophy in 1945 [...] "for his conspicuous and outstanding initiative in the concept and development of the Ground Control Approach system for safe landing of aircraft under all weather and traffic conditions".|$|E

He used to refer to them, laughingly, as 'My Boys'.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after V-J Day, September 1945, Magruder {{became the}} {{commanding}} officer of Marine Aircraft Group 53 (a fully integrated Night Fighter Command) at Marine Corps Air Station Eagle Mountain Lake, Texas. The group consisted of seven tactical squadrons, one service and support squadron, one headquarters squadron, one <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> radar squadron and one <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> radar unit. This totalled nearly 2400 officers and men with 146 aircraft. At the time this was the largest aircraft group in Marine Aviation. In February 1946, MAG-53 moved operations back to MCAS Cherry Point. In August 1946 Magruder assumed command of Marine Aircraft Group 31.|$|R
50|$|A radically {{different}} type of antenna for X-band systems was invented by Luis W. Alvarez and used in three new systems: an airborne mapping radar called Eagle, a blind-landing <b>Ground</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Approach</b> (GCA) system, and a ground-based Microwave Early-Warning (MEW) system. The latter two were highly successful and carried over into post-war applications. Eagle eventually was converted to a very effective mapping radar called H2X or Mickey and used by the U. S. Air Corps and Navy {{as well as the}} British RAF.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the heavy}} rain and {{visibility}} reduced to 500 ft, XA897 was on a <b>ground</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>approach</b> (GCA) and was informed by Heathrow's air traffic controller that they were above the glide slope (GS) and needed to lose altitude. However, the crew reduced their height too much, with their air speed close to the minimum drag point for a gear down configuration. As a result, the Vulcan was 1030 yd short of the runway and the initial contact with the ground removed the aircraft's undercarriage.|$|E
5000|$|Ellis Cone (...) is one {{of several}} small cones or cone {{remnants}} along the southwest side of Toney Mountain in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1959-66, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Homer L. Ellis, ACC, U.S. Navy, radar air traffic controller at McMurdo Station, winter party 1968, and chief in charge of the <b>ground</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>approach</b> unit at the Byrd Station skiway landing strip, summer season, 1969-70.|$|E
5000|$|This group soon {{was joined}} by 3rd Battalion 9th Marines {{who served as the}} {{security}} element. Marine Air Traffic Control Unit 62 (MATCU 62) handled the airport traffic control operations including the airport tower and GCA radar (<b>Ground</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach).</b> The force occupying [...] "The Rose Garden" [...] was designated Task Force Delta. The base was made up of marines, sailors (medical and construction staff), air force (mostly cargo handing), a six-man United States Army contingent from the 11th Signal Brigade (United States) (providing specialized communications security to the command from June to December 1972), and Thai military elements.

No. 49-0161) {{turned to}} a heading 005 degrees magnetic (dm) and began a normal climb through the overcast. The pilot then reported that the C-119 may have scraped the tail skid on takeoff; additionally all the left seat (pilot side) gyroscopic instruments (Gyros) were not operational. A few seconds later, the pilot requested immediate GCA vector to Ashiya AB, stating that co-pilot would have to fly the GCA approach from the right seat. The GCA was continuously tracking them and reported its location as 12miles north of Ashiya AB, instructing co-pilot to turn right to a heading of 210 degrees. Then 49-161 disappeared from radar. All on board were lost ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAir traffic {{management}} (ATM) is an endless source of challenging optimization problems. Before discussing applications of metaheuristics to these problems, let us describe an ATM {{system in a}} few words, so that readers who {{are not familiar with}} such systems can understand the problems being addressed in this chapter. Between the moment passengers board an aircraft and the moment they arrive at their destination, a flight goes through several phases: push back at the gate, taxiing between the gate and the runway threshold, takeoff and initial climb following a Standard instrument departure (SID) procedure, cruise, final descent following standard terminal arrival route (STAR), landing on the runway, and taxiing to the gate. During each phase, the flight is handled by several air traffic <b>control</b> organizations: airport <b>ground</b> <b>control,</b> <b>approach</b> and terminal <b>control,</b> en-route control. These control organizations provide services that ensure safe and efficient conduct of flights, from departure to arrival...|$|R

In low cloud and following a <b>ground</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>approach</b> the flight crew lowered the landing gear and turned into their final approach under visual control. One mile short of the runway eyewitnesses saw the aircraft turn into a shallow right descending turn with a steep bank angle. The Viscount's right wing hit {{the ground and the}} rest of the plane broke up bursting into flames and crashing into a house 85 yards beyond the impact point further on. All 20 passengers and crew on the aircraft died in the crash and two occupants of the house also died.|$|E

50|$|The {{court of}} inquiry convened to review the crash {{determined}} that XA897s approach was affected by poor visibility due to heavy rain (three Russian TU-104 aircraft carrying the Bolshoi Ballet had already been diverted away from Heathrow to RAF Manston that morning) and that the aircraft was not equipped to use the instrument landing system (ILS) installed at Heathrow. The approach was undertaken using a <b>ground</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>approach</b> (GCA) (the first time Howard had done this). Howard attempted to abort the landing at Runway 01 Left, believing he was at 150 ft he applied power but his aircraft collided with the ground which removed his undercarriage and severely damaged the Vulcans control surfaces. The aircrafts port wing was almost vertical and with no prospect of recovery he and Broadhurst ejected.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{simulation}} of <b>ground</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>approaches</b> and describes an investigation into possible defects zn the system which might lead to accidents. Two such accidents are described and {{in both of these}} the aircraft built up long period expanding oscillations about the glide path. This motion is then investigated by simulation techniques and its causes determined. The trouble is found to be inherent in the technique of using the throttle to control height and the elevator to control speed. This is demonstrated by systematic use of the throttle in response to height errors according to various logical schemes. It ia found that, in certain circumstances, entirely logical use of the throttle results in an oscillation of increasing amplitude no matter bon successfully the pilot controls speed with the elevators. It 1 s concluded that accidents have sometimes resulted from use of the throttle to control height. Finally, a simple device is described, which led to a different flying technique giving much improved control of an aircraft making a blind approach. It consisted of an auxiliary spring;loaded throttle control. Flight tests of this device are strongly recommended. Replaces A. R. C. 24 545 - 2...|$|R
50|$|In 1951, the Navy reopened the {{airfield}} as NALF Brown Field, a naval auxiliary landing field, {{due to increased}} military activity stemming from the Korean War and the Cold War. In 1954, Brown Field was again commissioned and redesignated as a Naval Auxiliary Air Station, with facilities to support regular operations of Fleet aircraft, assigned missile programs, and field carrier landing practice. In 1955, NAAS Brown Field was home to one utility squadron (VU), two air antisubmarine warfare squadrons (VS), a fleet aircraft service squadron (FASRON), and a Regulus air missile unit. The following year, the base was home to two utility squadrons, VU-3 and VU-7, the headquarters for Commander, Utility Wing Pacific (COMUTWINGPAC), a FASRON 4 detachment, and a <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> unit. Aircraft that operated at NAAS Brown Field included the F6F Hellcat, F9F Cougar, SNB, R4D Skytrain, JD-1 Invader, P2V Neptune, and FJ Fury. On November 2, 1954, the Convair XFY-1 Pogo made a transitional flight from vertical takeoff to horizontal flight, then back to a vertical landing at NAAS Brown Field. In 1957, NAAS Brown Field was selected as a site {{for one of the}} Vanguard Earth Satellite Tracking Stations.|$|R

50|$|The Provost was {{developed}} to provide training better suited to the increasingly complicated operational aircraft that were then being brought into service. To suit the training mission, the two seats in the cockpit were side-by-side so that the instructor could be alongside the student for close observation and to demonstrate flight procedures; a third seat had been specified for an observer but this was later omitted following little use. The three-piece canopy was designed for good crash-worthiness and to facilitate instrument flying training in daylight, via extendible amber screens and blue-tinted goggles to prevent the pupil seeing outside the cockpit, while the instructor (wearing no goggles) {{could see through the}} amber panels. The Provost was also equipped with modern VHF radio aids for landing through cloud (<b>Ground</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach)</b> and to train the pilot to fly in cloud and navigate at night. The complexity of the cockpit was deliberate; contrary to earlier trainer aircraft which were simplified so students would find them easy to fly, the Provost was designed so that beginners were exposed to an advanced environment more akin to the varied tasks of aircraft operations.|$|E
5000|$|AN/MPN-14 Mobile Ground Approach System can be {{configured}} as {{a complete}} Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) or <b>Ground</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach</b> (GCA) facility. The radar unit is used by air traffic controllers to identify, sequence, and separate participating aircraft, provide final approach guidance through air defense corridors and zones, and coordinate ID and intent with local air defense units at assigned airports and air bases. These services can be provided in all types of weather. It is capable of identifying aircraft using secondary radar up to a 200-nautical-mile (370 km) radius and primary radar coverage to 60 nautical miles (110 km). The PAR provides both azimuth and elevation information from 15 nmi km to touchdown. Both the PAR and ASR {{can be used as}} final approach aids. The unit has three ASR display indicators and one PAR indicator located in the operations shelter, and one each ASR and PAR indicator located in the maintenance shelter. Complete operations are conducted from the operations trailer. The system is limited to a single runway but has the capability of providing opposite direction runway operations {{with the aid of a}} transportable turntable.|$|E
50|$|Training Squadron 86 {{is known}} by several names: TRARON EIGHT SIX, VT-86, or the Sabrehawks, a name derived from its history of flying the T-39D/G/N Sabreliner and the TA-4J Skyhawk II. The {{squadron}} was established on the 5th of June 1972, under the operational control of Commander, Training Air Wing EIGHT (TRAWING 8) at Naval Air Station Glynco, Georgia. The {{mission of the}} new squadron was to conduct advanced Naval Flight Officer (NFO) training for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, which had previously been overseen by Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC) Glynco. The training was in four areas: Radar Intercept Officer, Basic Jet Navigation, Airborne Electronic Warfare and Airborne Tactical Data Systems. Training was conducted in aircraft previously assigned to and supported by NATTC Glynco until February 1973, when the squadron accepted 24 T-39 Sabreliners, 20 A-4C Skyhawks, 2 EC-121K Warning Stars, 12 TS-2A Tracker aircraft, and approximately 350 enlisted maintenance and support personnel from NATTC and NAS Glynco. After receiving the aircraft and personnel, the squadron’s mission was expanded to include flight support for Air Intercept Control and <b>Ground</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach</b> training functions.|$|E
40|$|In the {{upcoming}} years, {{significant changes in}} the profile of satellite missions are expected as scientists and managers want to benefit from multi-satellite missions. Among others, distributed or virtual satellite platforms will create a completely new class of space missions, where not one single spacecraft or payload segment has to be operated but a formation or constellation of satellites. A “formation” designates multiple satellites in close proximity and is typically characterized by demanding guidance, navigation and control requirements. In comparison to perform these tasks by a <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> <b>approach,</b> on-board autonomy can guarantee superior performance with respect to control accuracies and cost efficiency. A dedicated research and development program on “Autonomous Spacecraft Navigation and Formation Flying” was initiated at DLR/GSOC in 1998. Numerous contributions in the area of space-borne GPS receiver technology, precision relative navigation and autonomous orbit control of satellite formations as a prerequisite for spacecraft autonomy have been made. Practical experience in the operations of a two-satellite formation has been gained by the GRACE mission. Next, GSOC is supporting Swedish Space Cooperation (SSC) in the implementation of the PRISMA formation flying demonstration mission, where a fully autonomous, robust and precise formation flying of spacecraft will be conducted by experiment. Finally, the German TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X radar satellites will be Europe’s first space mission equipped and operated routinely with an autonomous formation flying system...|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} was redesignated the 559th Fighter-Escort Squadron, {{and assigned}} to Strategic Air Command on 27 October 1950. On 1 November it was activated at Turner Air Force Base, Georgia {{assigned to the}} 12th Fighter-Escort Group. Early in December 1950 it transferred to Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas. The primary mission of the 559th was to organize and train a force capable of providing immediate fighter escort and air base protection {{in any part of}} the world. In January 1951 the squadron began flying training in the Republic F-84 Thunderjet. The program principally of routine transition training, night flying, instrument flights, and <b>ground</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>approaches.</b> Bombing and gunnery practice was accomplished at the Matagorda Island Bombing and Gunnery Range on Matagorda Island, just off the Texas coast. Late in April the squadron participated in a practice mission to Turner Air Force Base. Early in June the 559th participated in a long-range escort mission conducted by the 12th Fighter-Escort Wing. All told, 75 F-84s were involved. After staging at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, they were divided into two sections. One section escorted a large number of B-36 Peacemakers in a simulated bombing mission over New York City. The other section escorted another group of B-36s in a similar mission over Detroit. All the Thunderjets staged at Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan, before returning to Bergstrom.|$|R
