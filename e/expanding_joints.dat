The line being here upon a sharp curve, the expansion of the Rails forced the Viaduct sideways a few inches and disturbed the Line, so as to render it impassable. The Rails and the Viaduct were soon restored to their correct position, and any recurrence of the same thing, however improbable, guarded against upon this and other Viaducts under similar circumstances by the introduction of <b>expanding</b> <b>joints</b> on the rails.|$|E

40|$|The {{pressure-volume curve}} of the {{synovial}} cavity of the rabbit knee has been determined by the infusion of a non-absorbable oil into the joint space. Pressure (greater than 3 cm H 2 O) at a given volume decayed as a curvilinear function of time. In consequence, a plot of volume against pressure immediately after a volume increment (the immediate compliance curve) was steeper than a plot of volume against pressure after 5 - 20 min (the delayed compliance curve) above atmospheric pressure. Similarly, the compliance curve for a rapidly <b>expanded</b> <b>joint</b> was steeper than the compliance curve for the opposite, slowly <b>expanded</b> <b>joint.</b> Observations 2 and 3 indicated that the joint investment was visco-elastic. Pressure at a given volume during aspiration of the <b>expanded</b> <b>joint</b> was always less than pressure at the same volume during infusion. This hysteresis was substantial, the mean energy dissipation being about 37 %. Pressure at a given volume increased {{as a function of}} time during aspiration, but the pressure recovery was less pronounced than pressure decay during infusion. When the cycle of infusion and aspiration was repeated, the pressure-volume hysteresis loop was displaced progressively towards the volume axis. Observations 5 and 6 were attributed to plasticity of the joint investment. It is concluded that intra-articular pressure at a given volume depends on the rate of change of volume, the direction of change, and the previous history of the joint. The relevance of these properties to fluid dynamics in other interstitial compartments, in arthritic human joints, and to the neurophysiology of mechanoreceptors in the joint investment is discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{level of}} the contact {{pressure}} and the stresses induced during the hydraulically expanded tube–to-tubesheet process are the key factors for the integrity of a leak free <b>expanded</b> <b>joint.</b> The modelling {{of this type of}} joint requires an adequate representation of the material behavior in order to accurately evaluate important joint parameters such as the residual contact pressure and induced residual stresses. Maintaining a lower bound safe limit of the initial residual contact pressure over the lifetime of the <b>expanded</b> <b>joint</b> insures its durability. A design tool that addresses a proper material-geometry combination in conjunction with the required expansion pressure is developed. The proposed model is based on strain hardening material behavior of the tube and the tubesheet. The interaction of these two components is simulated during the whole process of the application of the expansion pressure. Particular emphasis is put on influence of reverse yielding and Bauschinger effect on the residual contact pressure. The results from the analytical model are confronted to those of the numerical FEA model. Two joints of different geometries and materials are considered to demonstrate the importance of considering the real material behavior in both models...|$|R

Experimental results demonstrate a good performance of this method to upgrade the joint shear strength, energy dissipation and ductility. It has been found that by increasing the joint size, the joint shear failure can be prevented. The joint expansion is shown to reduce the joint shear stress. This method is effective to change failure mode from brittle joint shear failure to flexural failure in beams...|$|R

40|$|This article {{develops}} the perspective that joint ventures are created as real options {{to expand in}} response to future technological and market developments. The exercise of the option is accompanied by an acquisition of the venture. It is hypothesized that {{the timing of the}} acquisition should be triggered by a product market signal indicating an increase in the venture's valuation. Based on a sample of 92 manufacturing joint ventures, this hypothesis is tested by estimating the effect of product market signals on the hazard of acquisition. The results indicate that unexpected growth in the product market increases the likelihood of acquisition; unexpected shortfalls in product shipments have no effect on the likelihood of dissolution. This asymmetry in the results strongly supports the interpretation of joint ventures as options to <b>expand.</b> <b>joint</b> ventures, termination by acquisition, real options, option to expand, learning...|$|R

Method: Semistructured interviews were conducted with staff from 18 service providers offering antenatal services, or programmes primarily focused on {{children under the age of}} 2 years and/or their families. The interview aimed to identify the precise nature of the services offered, problems encountered in providing those services, perceived gaps in services and potential strategies for improvement. Results: Services were diverse, provided by a range of different professionals, in varying locations (home, community, hospital) and with funding from various sources. The major findings were: (i) the fragmentation of services, lack of communication between them, and lack of continuity in services from one stage of family formation to another; (ii) the shortage of services working with the parents and infant together; and (iii) the difficulty of providing services for some at-risk populations.
