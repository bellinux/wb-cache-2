5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the <b>judicial</b> <b>procedure</b> during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E
5|$|Charles was {{the only}} son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father {{died when he was}} five years old, so Charles was educated by his {{governors}} until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon after, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial and economic situation, managing to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, <b>judicial</b> <b>procedure,</b> church government and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by his only son Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, {{the studies of}} law lasted three years and the {{curriculum}} included comparative and state (constitutional) law, international law, criminal law and <b>judicial</b> <b>procedure,</b> as well as general subjects. This is how the modern legal education in Serbia emerged in the year 1808. Before enrolling the legal department, it was compulsory to graduate at the philosophy department where the studies lasted two years, so the legal studies lasted {{a total of five}} years. Since 1853, the legal education became independent from the studies of philosophy and from 1863 the legal education in Serbia lasted four years.|$|E
25|$|The blood atonement {{doctrine}} was {{the impetus}} behind {{laws in the}} territory and state of Utah allowing capital punishment by firing squad or decapitation. Though people in Utah were executed by firing squad for capital crimes {{under the assumption that}} this would aid their salvation, there is no clear evidence that Young or other top theocratic Mormon leaders enforced blood atonement for apostasy or non-capital crimes like miscegenation. There is, however, some evidence that the doctrine was enforced a few times at the local church level without regard to secular <b>judicial</b> <b>procedure.</b> The rhetoric of blood atonement may have contributed to a culture of violence leading to the Mountain Meadows massacre.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Velikanova began {{contributing}} to the samizdat periodical A Chronicle of Current Events. The unofficial bi-monthly gathered reports {{from all over the}} USSR of violations by the Soviet authorities of civil rights and <b>judicial</b> <b>procedure,</b> and recorded the response to those violations. It became the principal uncensored Russian-language source of information about political repressions during Leonid Brezhnev's time as Party leader. Velikanova eventually became one of its main organizers and editors. As the years passed similar journals came into existence in other Soviet republics. Their information continued to flow to Moscow, however, for translation into Russian and publication in the Chronicle of Current Events.|$|E

25|$|The United Nations (UN) Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (1990) are {{replicated}} in Belgian law through The Criminal Code and the Police Functions Act. These principles dictate {{that use of}} force should be proportionate, appropriate, reported and delivered in a timely manner. However, the UN Human Rights Committee reported complaints of ill-treatment against both property and person by police escalated between 2005 and 2011, most commonly involving assault against persons no longer posing danger. Not only this, but Belgian judicial authorities failed to notify national police watchdog, Committee P, of resulting criminal convictions against police. This is a direct breach of Belgian <b>judicial</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{as well as a}} failure to comply with Article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{few things}} that both the Greco-Roman and the vernacular Irish sources agree on about the druids is that they played an {{important}} part in pagan Celtic society. In his description, Julius Caesar claimed that they were one of the two most important social groups in the region (alongside the equites, or nobles) and were responsible for organizing worship and sacrifices, divination, and <b>judicial</b> <b>procedure</b> in Gaulish, British and Irish society. He also claimed that they were exempt from military service and from the payment of taxes, and had the power to excommunicate people from religious festivals, making them social outcasts. Two other classical writers, Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, also wrote about the role of druids in Gallic society, claiming that the druids were held in such respect that if they intervened between two armies they could stop the battle.|$|E

2500|$|Julius Morgenstern {{argued that}} Exodus 34 is {{distinct}} from the Jahwist document, identifying it with king Asa's reforms in 899 BCE. Bright, however, believes that like the Decalogue this text has its origins {{in the time of}} the tribal alliance. The book of the covenant, he notes, bears a greater similarity to Mesopotamian law codes (e.g. the Code of Hammurabi which was inscribed on a stone stele). He argues that the function of this [...] "book" [...] is to move from the realm of treaty to the realm of law: [...] "The Book of the Covenant (Ex., chs. 21 to 23; cf. ch. 34), which is no official state law, but a description of normative Israelite <b>judicial</b> <b>procedure</b> {{in the days of the}} Judges, is the best example of this process." [...] According to Bright, then, this body of law too predates the monarchy.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{bankruptcy}} {{is governed}} by federal law. The United States Constitution (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4) authorizes Congress to enact [...] "uniform Laws {{on the subject of}} Bankruptcies throughout the United States." [...] Congress has exercised this authority several times since 1801, most recently by adopting the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended, codified in Title 11 of the United States Code and commonly referred to as the [...] "Bankruptcy Code" [...] ("Code"). The Code has been amended several times since, with the most significant recent changes enacted in 2005 through the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA). Some law relevant to bankruptcy is found {{in other parts of the}} United States Code. For example, bankruptcy crimes are found in Title 18 of the United States Code (Crimes). Tax implications of bankruptcy are found in Title 26 of the United States Code (Internal Revenue Code), and the creation and jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts are found in Title 28 of the United States Code (Judiciary and <b>Judicial</b> <b>procedure).</b>|$|E
