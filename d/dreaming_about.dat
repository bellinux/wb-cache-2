5|$|As the town, where Hamasaki {{is sitting}} on the bench, starts to rain, the {{atmosphere}} where Hamasaki is the doll starts to rain as well. Just after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki looking at the now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing the doll to fall on the ground and its strings become tangled. This happens to Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings attached to her. Hamasaki, sitting on the bench, starts to cry and sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who finishes day <b>dreaming</b> <b>about</b> the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E

When it is dark, he decides to sleep next to a beaver pond, lighting a small fire with the matches {{given to him by}} the girl. However, the fire gives him little to no protection against the extremely cold temperatures that night. He ends up <b>dreaming</b> <b>about</b> the sexual abuse he experienced at the hands of one of his teachers. Back on the tracks, Chanie continues to slowly make his way on his journey, weakened from exhaustion and exposure. He falls a number of times before finally succumbing to the cold.

In the morning an engineer comes across Chanie's frozen body by the tracks and notifies the authorities. The story ends with Chanie, warm and happy, dancing in the forest with all of the animals featured throughout the novel.|$|E

Jorge Amado, his close friend, was sent into exile {{for several years}} after he publicly criticized the country's rulers {{during the period of}} military dictatorship. In 1994, Caymmi said, [...] "I have concluded that to act as a citizen in Brazil today is to live a joke.

Peter and Olivia shut down the dream equipment before Nayak kills another victim, but the doctor dies in the process.

Katina was also accused by Russian journalism of erratic behavior, and left not long after.

500|$|Thompson filed {{a lawsuit}} {{on behalf of the}} parents of three {{children}} killed in the Heath High School shooting in 1997. Investigations showed that the perpetrator, 14-year-old Michael Carneal, had regularly played various computer games (including Doom, Quake, Castle Wolfenstein, Redneck Rampage, Nightmare Creatures, MechWarrior, and Resident Evil) and accessed some pornographic websites. Carneal had also owned a videotape of The Basketball Diaries, which includes a high school student <b>dreaming</b> <b>about</b> shooting his teacher and some classmates. The suit sought $33 million in damages, alleging that the producers of the games, the movie, and the operators of the Internet sites were negligent in distributing this material to a minor because it would desensitize him and make him more prone to violence. Additional claims included product liability for making [...] "defective" [...] products (the defects alleged were violent features and lack of warnings) and violation of RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, for distributing this material to minors. Said Thompson, [...] "We intend to hurt Hollywood. We intend to hurt the video game industry. We intend to hurt the sex porn sites." ...|$|E
500|$|A review from Idolator {{said that}} the futuristic theme to the video {{might have been better}} suited to the {{previous}} international single, [...] "Commander." [...] It also said, [...] "The pop diva continues her ascent to grown woman in this sun-soaked video, making good use of palm trees, a convertible, and the Los Angeles skyline," [...] commenting that she takes [...] "a breezy approach so casual it almost does look like a camera crew just happened to stumble upon a typical day out with the girls." [...] The reviewer concluded that [...] "it's hard to imagine better uses for a touch screen than getting {{as close as possible to}} the carefree fun on display here." [...] Steven Gottlieb of Video Static said, [...] " [...] a casual and sunny pop video gets a bit of a twist, or a flick, via an interface that's swiped from your iPhone...It's possibly not the kind of finger manipulation some Kelly Rowland fans have been <b>dreaming</b> <b>about,</b> but even they should admit it's a clever conceit." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that {{the only way they can}} make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down payment on a large amount of land he's been <b>dreaming</b> <b>about,</b> the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail.|$|E

500|$|The first verse of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] implores {{the object}} of the singer's desire to walk away, because her {{emotions}} are too overpowering and she feels love of unprecedented intensity. She fears that by allowing him to stay attached, she may [...] "lose control". Selena believes that her infatuation can lead to romantic love. She then sings [...] "I could fall in love (in love) with you" [...] before wondering how she would feel if she were to touch him for the first time. The fear of being rejected and unloved leads her to keep her feelings to herself, and she begins to believe that her love is [...] "not right". She continues, [...] "and I guess I should try/ to do what I should do/ but I could fall in love/ fall in love with you". During the midpoint break, Selena sings in Spanish that she is always <b>dreaming</b> <b>about</b> him, imagining that he loves her. She sings the chorus twice before the song comes to an end without her ever having come to terms with her loved one.|$|E
500|$|... finally {{reveals a}} side of Mariah we don't see that often — her true self. The Mariah we usually see and hear is a glossy one. Psychologists might say her affect is 'off' — meaning her {{gestures}} and facial expressions don't match her mood. There's a reason for that, as she explains on 'Side Effects', which is the emotional abuse she says she suffered during her marriage to music mogul Tommy Mottola. Mariah, who is usually quite guarded, has alluded to the subject in songs like 'Petals', but never has she gone into such detail as she does on 'Side Effects', in which she refers to the marriage as a 'private hell that we built'. Even though it's been 11 years since they split up, she sings in a lower register that she's still 'wakin' up scared some nights ... <b>dreaming</b> <b>about</b> the violent times'. Her emotional scars left her 'a little protective ... a little defensive ... a little depressed', which makes her 'fake a smile' as she 'deal with the side effects'. Even though it features Young Jeezy, {{it sounds like a}} rock power ballad.|$|E
500|$|A concept album, Man on the Moon: The End of Day is an autobiographical track {{series of}} moody dark {{material}} that is separated into five acts that all surround [...] "Day 'n' Nite" [...] with an arcane account. One reviewer summed up the story to be: [...] " [...] lonely guy sits in his room and dreams of success. He uses drugs to calm his fears and fend off night terrors. He eventually gets recognized as the star he always knew he was, and lives the superstar life… or maybe he's still <b>dreaming</b> <b>about</b> that stage of his life, and we're just witnessing what his dreams sound like." [...] According to Cudi, more lively songs had to be added so that listeners did not feel like they were listening to a [...] "slit-your-wrists album". It was observed by a reviewer that on Man on the Moon: The End of Day, Cudi neither raps nor sings, instead he goes [...] "puzzling through some third way: a sort of loose, hazily melodic talking." [...] Musical collaborators included Kanye West, Ratatat and MGMT, among others, and the record is narrated by Common. Lyrically, he raps about anxiety and his frequent nightmares.|$|E
