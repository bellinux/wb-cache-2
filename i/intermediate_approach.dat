30|$|Apart from purely {{microscopic}} and mesoscopic <b>approaches,</b> <b>intermediate</b> <b>approaches</b> {{have recently}} been proposed in the literature in order {{to account for the}} interaction between transverse cracking and delamination. For example, in works such as [26, 27], classical cohesive interfaces are used for both transverse cracks and delaminations; in this case, however, a priori information about the cracking pattern (e.g. the position of the splits) needs to be introduced in order to carry out the simulations. Another approach consists in introducing discrete cracks thanks to techniques such as the X-FEM [28]; once again, the interaction between transverse cracks and delamination occurs naturally, but the local stress/strain field is still poorly represented compared to a purely microscopic approach, and a minimum crack spacing (which is generally much larger than in reality) related to the element size chosen needs to be introduced. These <b>intermediate</b> <b>approaches</b> are helpful for one’s understanding of the degradation mechanisms. Unfortunately, because of the approximations introduced in the physics and the a priori information which they require, they cannot be considered to be predictive models.|$|R

40|$|The {{governments of}} Hungary, Poland and Russia have used buy-outs as an {{important}} privatization strategy which {{can be viewed as}} forming a continuum from straightforward sales where management and employees generally achieve significant ownership, as in Hungary, "via" <b>intermediate</b> <b>approaches</b> as in Poland where both payment and free distribution of shares are involved, to the Russian case where state-owned enterprises were effectively "given away" through a voucher privatization scheme.

40|$|Western {{research}} has characterized approaches to learning for specific learning tasks as discrete deep and surface approaches, distinguished by whether the {{intention is to}} understand or memorize. A more appropriate classification scheme for Hong Kong research is a continuum between deep and surface poles. In this article, the authors examine whether this characterization applies also to the West. University students in Australia (n = 1, 146) and Hong Kong (n = 1, 266) complete the revised Study Process Questionnaire. There are no effects by either discipline or study level in either country. Multiple-group analyses using structural equation modeling show configural invariance across the two samples, suggesting that the continuum characterization of approaches to learning {{is likely to be}} applicable for Western counterparts.

However, one danger in grazing is the {{potential}} for invasive species to be enhanced as well as the native biodiversity. A study by Loeser et al. showed that areas of high intensity grazing and grazer removal increased the biomass of nonnative introduced species. Both showed that an <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach</b> is the best method. The nonnatives did demonstrate that they were not as well adapted to the disturbances, such as drought. This indicated that implementing controlled grazing methods would decrease the abundance of nonnatives in those plots that had not been properly managed.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMost real {{networks}} often evolve through time: {{changes of}} topology can occur if some nodes and/or edges appear and/or disappear, {{and the types}} or weights of nodes and edges can also change even if the topology stays static. Mobile devices with wireless capabilities (mobile phones, laptops, etc.) are a typical example of evolving networks where nodes or users are spread in the environment and connections between users can only occur if they are near each other.

40|$|SummaryFour conserved {{amino acids}} of type IB topoisomerases (Arg 130, Lys 167, Arg 223, and His 265 in vaccinia topoisomerase) {{catalyze}} the attack by tyrosine on the scissile phosphodiester {{to form a}} DNA-(3 ′-phosphotyrosyl) -enzyme intermediate. The mechanism entails general acid catalysis (by Lys 167 and Arg 130) and transition-state stabilization (via contact of His 265 with the pro-Sp oxygen). Here we query the function of Arg 223, which accelerates transesterification {{by a factor of}} 105. The requirement for Arg 223 is alleviated by a neutral Sp methylphosphonate (MeP) linkage at the cleavage site. Arg 223 is not required for the 30, 000 -fold activation of the latent endonuclease activity of topoisomerase by the Sp MeP. The rate of autohydrolysis by the DNA-(3 ′-MeP) -topoisomerase <b>intermediate</b> <b>approaches</b> 10 % of the rate of religation to a 5 ′-OH DNA strand.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{researches}} which {{aim at the}} issue of SCTP performance over heterogeneous networks. Current SCTP solutions over the wireless issue can be categorized into two categories: (1) <b>intermediate</b> node supported <b>approach</b> and (2) end-to-end approach. The main idea of <b>intermediate</b> node supported <b>approach</b> relies on the intermediate nodes, such as base station or router, using several mechanisms to help sender to differentiate loss events. Collaborative SCTP [15] and ECN-D SCTP [16] belong to this category. However, end-to-end approach only uses the information of sender and receiver transmission data to judge the loss event.

40|$|International audienceThe {{paper by}} Hannah et al. (this volume) invokes foodweb {{theory and the}} ideas of {{complexity}} theory to guide the construction of models of intermediate complexity, which sacrifice explicit process detail {{to increase the number}} of interacting components of the system and simulate the web of feedback loops. This approach has its merits, if best practice modelling guidelines are followed and the method is used well. However, if this is not the case then the fundamental weakness of the <b>intermediate</b> model <b>approach</b> is that it may end up producing models that are over general and therefore not useful. To make the most of the <b>intermediate</b> complexity <b>approach</b> it is essential to keep the tenets of the middle-out approach in mind. Under the middle-out approach computational models are constructed and tested at the levels where we have the most detailed information, building on our existing knowledge and data and coupling a hierarchy of models rather than being swamped in a morass of detail or missing key feedbacks through over-generality...|$|R

40|$|Setting up {{experimental}} {{networks of}} a sufficient size {{is a crucial}} element {{for the development of}} communication services.

30|$|A {{difficulty}} in attaining such a sustainable society {{is that we}} do not have a methodology to properly assess economic development and pollution reduction in a unified manner because the former development has been usually associated with various types of pollutions. To partly deal with the difficulty, data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been used as a methodology for performance assessment on organizations, whose economic activities are characterized by desirable outputs and inputs. A problem was that conventional DEA documented a limited level of practicality in environmental assessment because it did not have a computational scheme to handle an existence of undesirable outputs. To overcome such a difficulty, many research efforts have developed new approaches and related models for DEA environmental assessment which measure the performance of various organizations that produce not only desirable outputs but also undesirable outputs. See recent literature studies such as Sueyoshi and Goto (2018), listing more than 800 previous works. See also Sueyoshi et al.
