50|$|Towards {{the late}} 19th century, {{therapeutic}} nihilism was gaining {{more and more}} popularity amongst the medical society. More and more leading physicians were criticizing the medical practice as “privileged monopoly” and claimed that every man should be his own physician through democratization of knowledge. Cultural critic Matthew Arnold described that “the stream of tendency of modern medical thought was toward a therapeutic nihilism.” The most preferred treatment method was active medication. For example when cocaine was first discovered, it was described in all of medical literature to have curative properties towards diseases such as <b>gastralgia,</b> childbirth, and nasal hemorrhage. Some, without question or doubt, were dosing newest medication and receiving newest therapeutics. Others preferred taking the same medication repeatedly, in other words, routine therapy. When performing routine therapy, the doctor’s role was simple and easy. For those who were taking heavy dosage of medication and receiving newest practice of medicine, the doctors were considered a “heroic” figure. If the therapeutics was successful the physician received credit, but for unsuccessful cases, patients were considered simply “unfortunate.” This naturally led to a growing concern that physicians only had theoretical knowledge but lacked sufficient experience in practice. Contemporary physicians such as Roberts Bartholow were stating that “the science of therapeutics should be made more certain” and that the “true knowledge of drug knowledge is not widely enough diffused.” In other words, the medical treatments of the 19th century have gained theoretical acceptance but were lacking in practicality. When faced with everyday exigencies, more and more physicians were left clueless. To make things worse, the ratio of medical practitioners to the US population in 1888 was one to 580, an unprecedented statistics. The medical society officially recognized their mischief when {{the president of the}} American Medical Association stated that there are “odious defects in the American medical education system.” Therapeutic nihilism slowly faded in the 19th century as systematic reform of the medical education system took place.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To assess {{safety of}} nimesulid in rheumatic pts with history of ulcer or {{multiple}} erosions (ME) of stomach and/or duodenal mucosa. Methods. 42 pts with rheumatic diseases aged 22 - 73 years were included. AH had gastric or duodenal ulcers or ME (n> 10) connected with NSAID treatment and confirmed by endoscopy {{no more than}} 6 months {{before the beginning of}} the study. Pts were included after healing of ulcers and erosions. The pts were randomized to receive Nimesulid 200 mg/day (group 1) or Diclofenac suppositoria 100 mg/day + ranitidine 150 mg/day (group 2). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed before and 12 weeks after the beginning of treatment. Results. Relapse of stomach ulcer was observed in I pts of group 1 (5, 6 %). Relapse of NSAID-induced ulcers and ME was noted in 6 pts of group 2 (33, 3 %) : in 4 cases stomach ulcers, in 1 case stomach ME, in 1 case duodenal ulcer (p= 0, 0424). Presence of <b>gastralgias</b> and dyspepsia was noted in 36, 8 % pts of group 1 and in 20 % pts of group 2 (p= 0, 0539). In 1 pts of group 2 <b>gastralgias</b> were the reason for premature endoscopy. Conclusion. Nimesil (Nimesulid) can be considered as a more safe drug than classical NSAIDs with smaller risk of serious gastroduodenal complications development in rheumatic pts with ulcer history. The results of the study allow to recommend Nimesulid as a drug of choice for treatment of pts with history of NSAID-induced gastropathy...|$|R

40|$|Yuanhu Zhitong {{prescription}} (YZP) is {{a typical}} and relatively simple traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), widely used in the clinical treatment of headache, <b>gastralgia,</b> and dysmenorrhea. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of action of YZP is not clear. In this study, based on the previous chemical and metabolite analysis, a complex approach including the prediction {{of the structure of}} metabolite, high-throughput in silico screening, and network reconstruction and analysis was developed to obtain a computational drug-target network for YZP. This was followed by a functional and pathway analysis by ClueGO to determine some of the pharmacologic activities. Further, two new pharmacologic actions, antidepressant and antianxiety, of YZP were validated by animal experiments using zebrafish and mice models. The forced swimming test and the tail suspension test demonstrated that YZP at the doses of 4 [*]mg/kg and 8 [*]mg/kg had better antidepressive activity when compared with the control group. The anxiolytic activity experiment showed that YZP at the doses of 100 [*]mg/L, 150 [*]mg/L, and 200 [*]mg/L had significant decrease in diving compared to controls.

40|$|Multiple {{endocrine}} neoplasm type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome predisposes to {{the development}} of endocrine and non-endocrine tumors with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Different mutations have been found throughout the gene with a variable phenotype expression. The proband, a Caucasian man, was admitted to our department in 2001, at the age of 51 because of a 1 -yr history of diarrhoea and hypertension. He reported a previous intestinal resection for bowel occlusion with a histological diagnosis of unspecified mesenchymal neoplasia. He had also undergone a left adrenalectomy for a large nonfunctioning adrenal adenoma. Subsequently, he had suffered from <b>gastralgia</b> and melena; a gastroduodenoscopy showed an erosive gastritis. His family history was negative for endocrine disorders. On physical examination, multiple abdominal cutaneous lipomas and facial angiofibromas were observed. Biochemical screening revealed a primary hyperparathyroidism and an increase in circulating levels of PRL, chromogranin-A, gastrin and glucagon. The whole body computed tomography (CT) scan, the 111 In-octreotide scan and the pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal any abnormality. The presence of small neuroendocrine tumors was suspected by a positron emission tomography uptake in the epigastric region. The endoscopic ultrasound revealed a pancreatic lesion sized 1. 1 cm that is under evaluation. Direct DNA sequencing analysis of the proband MEN 1 gene revealed the 579 delG frameshift mutation in the exon 3. The genetic screening of the family revealed the same mutation in 3 out of 5 offspring. The biochemical screening revealed some features of the MEN 1 syndrome in all three of them. In conclusion, a novel frameshift MEN 1 mutation was found in kindred with an apparently negative family history. Our experience confirms that MEN 1 syndrome is a complex and underestimated condition, unless specifically investigated by trained specialists...|$|E
40|$|The genus Pistacia L. {{consists}} of 11 species, {{most of which}} are known to produce oleoresin. There are three kinds of pistachio in Iran, including P. vera, P. atlantica, and P. khinjuk. Four subspecies or varieties have been identified for P. atlantica: cabulica, kurdica, mutica, and atlantica [1]. P. atlantica var. mutica is native to a number of temperate countries in Asia. In Iran, this plant grows in the central, western, and eastern regions. The oleoresin of P. atlantica var. mutica, known as “Turk terebinth gum, ” is used to make chewing gum in Iran. Mastic gum has been used in traditional medicine for various gastrointestinal disorders like <b>gastralgia,</b> dyspepsia, and peptic ulcer. Mastic gum has been reported to possess considerable in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity. The total mastic extract without polymer might be effective in reducing Helicobacter pylori colonization {{as well as in the}} treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

One of the major benefits of this drug is a low risk of serious adverse events(AE). However,Russiahas not conducted  its own large-scale trials of the safety of DR despite its popularity. Objective: to estimate the frequency of AE of DR (Diaflex®, Romfarm) in real clinical practice. Subject s and methods. The use of DR was retrospectively analyzed in 3479 patients (60. 4 % women and 39. 6 % men; mean age 57. 6 ± 12. 6 years) with OA and back pain. DR was used in a dose of 100 mg/day; treatment results were assessed following 30 days. The patients received combination  therapy: in addition to DR, 62. 6 % took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as myorelaxants, local glucocorticoid injections, other SYSADOA, etc. The efficiency of therapy (visual analogue scale (VAS) pain changes and treatment satisfaction), and the frequency and nature of AE were assessed.   Results. Combination therapy using DR was effective in the majority of patients: VAS pain intensity decreased from 71. 2 ± 17. 5 to 22. 6 ± 16. 3 mm; 76 % of the patients rated their treatment results as good or excellent. Major AE involved the gastrointestinal  tract; obvious <b>gastralgia,</b> nausea, and a sensation of heaviness were observed in only 1. 7, 1. 8, and 2. 4 % of the patients, respectively. There were frequent stools: 5. 91 ± 1. 9 defecation episodes per week at baseline; 7. 3 ± 2. 8 episodes per week after 30 days of DR administration (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Aiming at the {{investigation}} of the effect of the Pneumoperitoneum on the human body, I, the author of this report, have made, the following studies about 40 cases who have undergone the Pneumoperitoneum for more than 6 months: (these 40 patients were chosen among the tuberculosis ones who were received to the National Chiba Hospital since 1951). 1. Making graphic curve of breathing both before the operation and after the operation by Yokoyama 2 ̆ 7 s Pneumo-Graph and observing the variations of the movement of the thorax; 2. Scrutinizing the clinical conditions and the results of Roritgenographic studies of the gastroenteritinal test and liver function test comparing the condition before the operation with that after the operation. As for the graphic curve of breathing, those who had shown rather slight and narrow variations, were in good condidions in regard to the elevating function of the diaphragm and moreover the effect of the Pneumoperitoneum was remarkable. After the Pneumoperitoneum, the movement of the upper thorax increased and on the contrary, that of the lower thorax decreased compared with the condition before the pneumoperitoneum. This tendency was more remarkable in the cases of those who were in good conditions in regard to the elevating function of the diaphragm. As for the clinical conditions, there were mostly found such troubles of degestive system as <b>gastralgia,</b> anorexia and loss of weight. There were few which showed any changes about the breathing capacity, and so even those who have rather little breathing capacity can be adaptable to this therapy. Concerning to the gastroenteric changes by pneumoperitoneum the following were observed through the Rontgenographic studies: Dropping downward and forward of the stomach; elongating and,narrowing of the cardia; widening. and being recumbent of the fundus; reduction of the gastric-bubble. In addition to these, there were also observed the slight prolongation of the time for evacuating the contents of stomach and ascention of the acidified rate of the gastric juice through the X-ray test. Thus, most of those who complain troubles of degestive system are thought to have exactly some causes to do so, that is to say, it seems that there had already been something wrong in their degestive system and when there were added the stimulus of the Pneumoperitoneum, they became these troubles. As for the liver function test, I have made Co-R test, Cad-R test, B. S. P. test and Urobilinogen-test at a time, and as the results, found that there appeared 17...|$|E
