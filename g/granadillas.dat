Some food products in their diet include: sweet potato, plantain (and/or banana), yuca, corn (maize), rice, beans, chonta, heart of palm , chili, honey, meat and fish.

40|$|A yolk-shell-structured carbon@void@silicon (CVS) anode {{material}} {{in which a}} void space is created between the inside silicon nanoparticle and the outer carbon shell is considered as a promising candidate for Li-ion cells. Untill now, all the previous yolk-shell composites were fabricated through a templating method, wherein the SiO 2 layer acts as a sacrificial layer and creates a void by a selective etching method using toxic hydrofluoric acid. However, this method is complex and toxic. Here, a green and facile synthesis of granadilla-like outer carbon coating encapsulated silicon/carbon microspheres which are composed of interconnected carbon framework supported CVS nanobeads is reported. The silicon <b>granadillas</b> are prepared via a modified templating method in which calcium carbonate was selected as a sacrificial layer and acetylene as a carbon precursor. Therefore, the void space inside and among these CVS nanobeads can be formed by removing CaCO 3 with diluted hydrochloric acid. As prepared, silicon <b>granadillas</b> having 30 % silicon content deliver a reversible capacity of around 1100 mAh g− 1 at a current density of 250 mA g− 1 after 200 cycles.

40|$|One hundred twenty five accessions of Passiflora (<b>granadillas,</b> parchitas, curubas, badea {{and passion}} fruits) {{belonging}} to 26 {{species of the}} genus were characterized using 50 RAPD markers.

In the subgenus Tacsonia, similarity among accessions was high, indicating inter-species gene flow which is very important to traditional and molecular breeding studies of "curubas" (P. mollissima and P. sp. India). RFLPs analysis indicated high intra-specific polymorphism in P. ligularis and P. maliformis. DICE correlation from RAPD and RFLP data was r- 0. 745.

40|$|In Colombia, we {{have found}} 165 species that belong to the Passiflora genus and, of these, about 50 % have edible fruits. Among these, passion fruit, sweet granadilla and purple passion fruit are {{considered}} to be of economic importance. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of fruit ripeness and pulp fermentation time period (mucilage) on the seed germination of passion fruits (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa Deg.) and sweet <b>granadillas</b> (Passiflora ligularis Juss.) under laboratory conditions (alternating temperatures (30 / 20 ºC, 12 / 12 hour), 60 % relative humidity and in darkness for 60 days) and to establish growth parameters leaf area and plant dry mass. The seeds were extracted from fruits in three maturity stages (M 4, M 5 and M 6) and five fermentation periods (0 days (F 0); 1 day (F 1), 2 days (F 2), 4 days (F 4) and 8 days (F 8)) using a completely random design with a 3 x 5 factorial arrangement (maturity stage x fermentation time), with four replicates of 50 seeds each. It was found that the M 6 F 1 and M 5 F 1 treatments were more favorable in terms of germination for the passion fruit (94. 5 and 92. 0 %, respectively), while, for the sweet granadilla, the M 6 F 2 (39 %) and M 6 F 1 (35 %) treatments were more favorable. The growth parameters demonstrated that the highest dry mass value occurred in M 6 F 8 for the passion fruit (136. 76 mg) and in M 6 F 1 for the sweet granadilla (104. 73 mg); furthermore, these values increased as the maturity stage of the two species progressed. The leaf area of the passion fruit had maximum values in seedlings obtained from the treatment with maturity stage M 5 F 2 and a fermentation period of 1 day, M 5 F 2 (18. 3 cm 2), while the leaf area of the sweet granadilla increased in the same fashion as the dry mass, with M 6 F 8 having the highest value (16. 8 cm 2) ...|$|E
