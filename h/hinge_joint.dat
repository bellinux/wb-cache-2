5|$|The ribs were {{connected}} to the dorsal (trunk) vertebrae with two joints, acting together as a simple <b>hinge</b> <b>joint,</b> which has allowed researchers to reconstruct the inhaled and exhaled positions of the ribcage. The difference in volume between these two positions defines the air exchange volume (the amount of air moved with each breath), determined to be approximately 20L for a P.engelhardti individual estimated to have weighed690kg, or 29mL/kg bodyweight. This is a typical value for birds, but not for mammals, and indicates that Plateosaurus probably had an avian-style flow-through lung, although indicators for postcranial pneumaticity (air sacs of the lung invading the bones to reduce weight) {{can be found on}} the bones of only a few individuals, and were only recognized in 2010. Combined with evidence from bone histology this indicates that Plateosaurus was endothermic.|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{looked up}} to the top of the smokepipe, which seemed to be {{considerably}} higher than the crown of the arch that the steamer was approaching. How it could possibly pass was a mystery. The mystery was, however, soon solved; for, at the instant that the bows of the steamer entered under the arch, two men, taking hold of levers below, turned the whole smokepipe back, by means of a <b>hinge</b> <b>joint</b> that had been made in it, not far from the deck. The hinge was in the back side of the smokepipe, and of course in bending the pipe back there was an opening made in front; and through this opening the smoke, while the steamer was passing through the bridge, came out in dense volumes. As soon, however, as the arch was cleared, the pipe was brought back into its place again by the force of great weights placed at the ends of the levers as a counterpoise. Thus the opening below was closed, and the smoke came out of the top of the pipe as before.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Through {{experiment}} and theoretical analysis, this paper researched {{the influence of}} steel bar corrosion of hollow slab <b>hinge</b> <b>joints</b> on the structural mechanical behavior. The results showed that when load was little corrosion of <b>hinge</b> <b>joints</b> steel bar would do little to affect the joint between hollow slabs and <b>hinge</b> <b>joints</b> would work together with hollow slabs as a whole. When load was large, corrosion of <b>hinge</b> <b>joints</b> steel bar would decrease the joint between hollow slabs...|$|R

5000|$|According to one {{classification}} system, a {{pivot joint}} {{like the other}} synovial joint —the <b>hinge</b> <b>joint</b> has one degree of freedom. [...] Note that the degrees of freedom of a joint {{is not the same}} as the same as joint's range of motion.|$|E
50|$|Individual <b>hinged</b> {{expansion}} <b>joints</b> used in piping {{systems are}} restricted to pure angular rotation by its hinges.

50|$|Close to the elbow, the ulna has a bony process, the {{olecranon}} process, a hook-like {{structure that}} {{fits into the}} olecranon fossa of the humerus.

5000|$|A {{revolute}} joint (also called pin joint or <b>hinge</b> <b>joint)</b> is a one-degree-of-freedom kinematic pair used in mechanisms.

50|$|This linkage clearly {{consists}} of eight bars when the ground frame is counted as a bar. The Chebychev-Grübler-Kutzbach criterion shows that an eight-bar linkage must have 10 single degree-of-freedom joints, while the Peaucellier linkage {{appears to have}} only six <b>hinged</b> <b>joints.</b> This is resolved by noting that four of the <b>hinged</b> <b>joints</b> each connect three bars. This {{is considered to be}} a special case of two joints that are located in the same place. Thus, six plus four provides the 10 one degree-of-freedom joints.|$|R

50|$|A clam's shell {{consists}} of two (usually equal) valves, which are connected by a <b>hinge</b> <b>joint</b> and a ligament that can be external or internal.

40|$|The {{rotational}} {{stiffness of}} <b>hinge</b> <b>joints,</b> {{and the gap}} of the joints applied in large deployable trusses, have been experimentally shown {{to have a significant}} role in determining such structures' dynamic behavior; an analytical validation of these results is presented for the case where linear rotation springs are used to model the <b>hinge</b> <b>joints</b> employed in a simple beam in trusses. The results obtained indicate that the natural frequencies of these structures depend not only on joint stiffness but also on joint location. Such gap parameters as gap size, stiffness, position, and excitation-force levels, are discussed with a view to a deeper understanding of their effects on a space interferometry system's simulated dynamic responses...|$|R
