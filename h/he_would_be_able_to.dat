5|$|At the 2010 Winter Olympics, Celski won bronze in the 1500m and the 5000m relay. Five {{months before}} the Olympics, Celski {{suffered}} a gruesome injury when he fell during a race and his right skate blade gashed his left thigh and was uncertain if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> skate again.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{longed to}} return to his {{economic}} studies, as he had left these studies in 1844 and had been preoccupied with other projects over the last thirteen years. By returning to his study of economics, Marx felt <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> understand more thoroughly what was occurring in the world.|$|E
5|$|Roy faced {{challenges}} {{before entering}} college. His parents {{and his older}} brother had not attended college, and due to a learning disability Roy had difficulty with the SAT; his reading comprehension was slow, which increased the time he needed for tests. He had taken the test four times (with tutors) before finally meeting the NCAA requirements. Unsure whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> attend a four-year college, Roy worked on the Seattle docks, cleaning shipping containers for $11/hour.|$|E
50|$|In December 1981, Brown accidentally {{shot himself}} while {{handling}} a loaded revolver. The injury required {{surgery to remove}} bullet and wood fragments from his upper thigh. There {{was a question of}} whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> continue his career in football.|$|R
50|$|Primo Levi, {{in one of}} the autobiographic {{short stories}} in 'The Periodic Table', {{mentions}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> switch from a bike to a VéloSoleX if he managed to conclude a business deal with a cosmetics manufacturer (see the short story titled 'Nitrogen').|$|R
60|$|It {{was a way}} of {{assisting}} his relations {{likely to}} do real good, and on the other hand, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able,</b> under colour of the payment for the child, to further Miss Wellwood's schemes, and give her the interest of the thousand pounds, until his five and twentieth year might put his property in his own power.|$|R
5|$|The role of Sergeant Joaquin Acosta was to {{be played}} by Richard Gomez, but he chose instead to pursue a {{political}} career in Ormoc. Matti later cast Joey Marquez; although Marquez was seen primarily as a comedian, Matti believed <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> portray a simultaneously charismatic and obnoxious character. The cast also features Leo Martinez as General Pacheco, Lito Pimentel as Pol, William Martinez as Rex, Vivian Velez as Thelma, and Rayver Cruz as Bernabe.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold and John André {{finally met}} on September 21 at the Joshua Hett Smith House. On {{the morning of}} September 22, the outpost at Verplanck's Point under command of Col. James Livingston fired on HMS Vulture, the ship that was {{intended}} to carry André back to New York. This action did sufficient damage that she retreated downriver, forcing André to return to New York overland. Arnold wrote out passes for André so that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pass through the lines, and also gave him plans for West Point.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015 in {{his column}} in Weekly Famitsu, Sakurai alluded to the {{possibility}} of retirement, expressing doubt that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue making games if his career continued to be as stressful as it was. In December 2015, Sakurai once again stated that he was not sure if there will be another Smash Bros. game in the series. In January 2016, it was rumoured that a Super Smash Bros. game was being developed by Bandai Namco and that the game was planned as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch. However, the rumour was debunked upon the release of the Switch.|$|E
50|$|Marcus Jones {{was shown}} {{sweating}} profusely, prompting concerns that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to fight.|$|R
60|$|He {{declared}} {{it was like}} a ballad; that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do his best to help me; that I should have paper, pen, and ink, and write one line to Mr. Campbell and another to Mr. Rankeillor; and that if I had told the truth, ten to one <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> (with their help) to pull me through and set me in my rights.|$|R

5|$|In {{the second}} part, Lewis Hamilton quickly set a fast lap time, the quickest {{of the weekend}} up to that point, about half a second ahead of his {{teammate}} Rosberg. Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo set his fastest lap on the harder supersoft compound tyre, meaning that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> start the race on them, should it have stayed dry. On the back end, Williams struggled for pace and both Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa missed out on Q3 by qualifying 11th and 14th respectively. Also eliminated were Esteban Gutiérrez, Jenson Button, Romain Grosjean and Magnussen.|$|E
5|$|Marcus {{continued}} {{throughout his}} tenure to hold tightly to his father's assurance that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> maintain {{and act on}} his political convictions while running the business. He supported the United Nations in its early years, an unpopular position in Dallas for that time. In the early 1950s he began to explore the ramifications of ending the store's participation in the then-common practice of excluding black customers from shopping in the store, and while his legal advisors cautioned against that step, he offered support for any black entrepreneur looking to establish a quality store and, in 1954, began to hire black staff in some departments.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 2017 Yoshiki's {{management}} {{announced that}} the drummer would undergo urgent surgery on May 16, where an artificial disc would be inserted between his vertebrae. Due to his health conditions, {{it was reported that}} concerts would need to be either rescheduled or cancelled. On June 9, X Japan announced at a press conference that the concerts would not be postponed but instead performed in an acoustic set, with Yoshiki at the piano, as it is uncertain whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> play the drums in the future.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 February 1940, he was {{appointed}} Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Food. When Lord Woolton became Minister of Food in April 1940, Drummond produced {{a plan for the}} distribution of food based on [...] "sound nutritional principles". He recognised that rationing was the perfect opportunity to attack what he called [...] "dietetic ignorance" [...] and that, if successful, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> not just to maintain but to improve the nation's health.|$|R

5|$|Once the Thrud strip had run {{its course}} in White Dwarf, Critchlow worked on other comics {{including}} the Judge Dredd/Batman crossover story The Ultimate Riddle, first published in 1995. His work on this story was fully painted, and while considered impressive was also criticised as being forced, confused and muddy. Critchlow was developing a new style based on line-drawings with computer colouring, but having been pigeon-holed as a painter {{did not believe that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> interest anyone in this very different style.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra {{was warned}} by fellow {{members of the}} Junta, {{military}} leaders and even the Cabildo that if he left Buenos Aires, the government would be prone to fall into a political crisis. He left anyway, convinced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> reorganize the Army of the North. The warnings were justified; shortly after his departure, the Junta {{was turned into a}} legislative power, while the executive would be managed by the First Triumvirate. This arrangement lasted for a short time, then the Junta was abolished. The Regiment of Patricians made a mutiny against the triumvirate, but failed.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a {{short period}} doing {{contract}} surveying for the New Zealand Company in March 1849, Brunner remained unemployed and wrote numerous letters to his contacts. His former travelling companion, William Fox, and Dillon Bell, chief agent of the New Zealand Company, also sought to find him a job and through them, {{he was able to}} find work as a clerk with the Canterbury Association between September 1849 and February 1850. He returned to Nelson in May 1850 and secured full-time employment as a surveyor with the New Zealand Company, but with the proviso that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take on private work which did not interfere with his duties. To supplement his income Brunner began to take on architectural commissions.|$|E

5000|$|A dirty loan shark {{with ties}} to the yakuza. He lends out {{large sums of money}} to the desperate, but charges an absurd (and illegal) {{interest}} rate. He tracks down Kaiji after a client of his, Furuhata, disappeared without repaying a loan, which Kaiji cosigned in an act of weakness. Recognizing Kaiji could never repay the loan, Endō offers him the opportunity to board the gambling ship Espoir, where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> repay his debt and make some money as well.|$|R
5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. Because he {{could not afford to}} hire a film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi asked one of the company's technical experts if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he needed for a penny per copy.|$|E
5|$|Beckett {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part of the 2013 season with an 0–5 record and 5.19 ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain on May 15. While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness and tingling in his hand so he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the tingling sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.|$|E
5|$|Dunne {{had hoped}} that by moving to New York to write full-time, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> greatly expand his output, and he signed to do several projects, {{including}} a play featuring Mr. Dooley, and {{for a series of}} third-person stories featuring Molly Donahue, Bridgeport's resident suffragist. But Dunne found that he could not increase his production, and that some of the Dooley projects were ill-suited to the character: the play went unwritten and the Molly Donahue stories were abandoned after four pieces. Dooley appears as a character in some of them. Fanning found them unsatisfactory, with a misplaced Dooley, deprived of his bar and control of the dialogue. Dunne was not happy with them either: a note from the author appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal after the fourth piece was published there, alleging ill-health and dissatisfaction with the product.|$|E

What has happened once may happen again; and besides, his cowardice in signing the release of three enemies {{of the people in}} order to save his life would tell against him. No, I think <b>he</b> <b>would</b> keep silence. After we have got them safe away we can return and so far loosen his bonds that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able,</b> after a time, to free himself. Five minutes' start <b>would</b> <b>be</b> all that we should want." ...|$|R

5|$|For the 2009 remake, {{stuntman}} Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Mears's pleasant demeanor had the studio worried {{about his ability to}} portray such a menacing character on screen, but Mears assured them <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> perform the role. When Mears auditioned for the role he was asked why they should hire an actor over just another guy in a mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to Greek mask work, where the mask and the actor are two separate entities, and, based on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance.|$|E
5|$|Former Georgetown University {{basketball}} coach John Thompson had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. As {{he would tell}} the story {{many times in the}} following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on Jim Rome's radio show, he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001. Thompson was planning to be in Las Vegas for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel {{on the day of the}} show. After a Rome staffer personally assured Thompson that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed his travel plans. He felt the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|Histiaeus now {{gathered}} a large force of Ionians and Aeolians {{and went to}} besiege Thasos. However, he then received {{the news that the}} Persian fleet was setting out from Miletus to attack the rest of Ionia, so he quickly returned to Lesbos. In order to feed his army, he led foraging expeditions to the mainland near Atarneus and Myus. A large Persian force under Harpagus was in the area and eventually intercepted one foraging expedition near Malene. The ensuing battle was hard fought, but was ended by a successful Persian cavalry charge, routing the Greek line. Histiaeus himself surrendered to the Persians, thinking that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> talk himself into a pardon from Darius. However, he was taken to Artaphernes instead, who, fully aware of Histiaeus's past treachery, impaled him and then sent his embalmed head to Darius.|$|E

60|$|Her open mouth, {{showing the}} small, irregular, white teeth, appealed to him. It {{was open and}} ready. It was so vulnerable. Why should he not go in and enjoy what was there? The slim arm that went down so still and {{motionless}} to the lap, it <b>was</b> pretty. She <b>would</b> <b>be</b> small, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> almost to hold her in his two hands. She <b>would</b> <b>be</b> small, almost like a child, and pretty. Her childishness whetted him keenly. She <b>would</b> <b>he</b> helpless between his hands.|$|R
