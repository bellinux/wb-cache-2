40|$|<b>Parts</b> <b>feeding</b> to mixed-model {{assembly}} {{lines in the}} automotive industry is a large challenge, since diverse customer demands have increased the amount of parts handled within the production facilities; hence {{a large amount of}} parts can be categorized as low-volume parts. Existing theory states that the design of the <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> system impacts the performance of the production system, however, there is a gap in existing literature regarding research focusing on <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policies appropriate for low-volume parts. The aim of this study is therefore to develop guidelines for when different <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policies are suitable to apply for LVPs and highlight the effects of design options related to the <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> system. The aim has been broken down into three research questions which the study should answer: 1. How can low-volume parts be defined for <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> in the automotive industry? 2. Which <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policies are suitable to use for low-volume parts, and for what part characteristics does each policy fit best? 3. How should the <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> system related to each <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policy for low-volume parts be designed? A multiple case study of four companies within the automotive industry has been performed in order to fulfill the aim. The study has been qualitative and data has been collected through direct observations, semi-structured interviews and internal documents. It was identified that companies within the automotive industry can benefit from categorizing their parts based on consumption volume, where low-volume parts could be grouped into a separate segment. This allows for reduced complexity in the assignment of <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policies. This study has concluded that it is less beneficial to use continuous supply for low-volume parts compared with other <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policies. The assignment of <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> policies for low-volume parts can be performed based on part characteristics, where the part size and amount of part variants within the part family have been identified as most relevant to consider. Findings related to the design of the <b>parts</b> <b>feeding</b> system include that space limitations near the assembly line has a large influence on design choices. Furthermore, it is beneficial to consolidate parts when transporting them to the lineside presentation. In addition, the picking accuracy has been identified as more important for low-volume parts than picking efficiency, and picking information such as pick-by-voice can be helpful to enable increased accuracy of picking operations.

40|$|Abstract A design {{method to}} achieve {{multiple}} band-rejection characteristics in a wideband circular slot antenna is presented. First, a wideband circular slot antenna fed by a coplanar waveguide {{is designed to}} operate in the frequency range between 2. 3 and 11 GHz, which covers WLAN, WiBro, WiMAX, and UWB frequency bands. Next, resonant frequency variations of rejection bands are examined with respect to different slot locations and lengths when slots are inserted on the ground conductor and the circular patch of the antenna. When arc-shaped slots are placed close to the circular transition from a <b>feeding</b> <b>part,</b> multiple notch bands are obtained. In this case, a half of the guided wavelength of the first notch band corresponds to the slot length and other notch bands are integer-multiple of the first band. Single notch band can be obtained when the slot is located off the transition part. Based on this study, a wideband circular slot antenna with five band-rejection frequency bands at 2. 45, 3. 5, 4. 9, 7. 35, and 9. 8 GHz is designed and fabricated. The first arc-shaped slots are located in the ground conductor close to the circular transition from a <b>feeding</b> <b>part</b> to generate notch bands at 2. 45, 4. 9, 7. 35, and 9. 8 GHz, while the second slot for 3. 73 GHz is placed on top side in the circular patch.

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, {{in modern}} mobile and {{wireless}} communication systems, {{there is an}} increased demand for compact, wide bandwidth and low-cost antennas with dual band capability. In this paper, two shapes for a low cost reduced size PIFA with wide bandwidth are investigated. The antenna substrate is from a cheap foam material with rε = 1. 07. The antenna is fed by single coaxial feed. Size reduction is achieved by cutting U-shaped slot on the radiating surface of the PIFA structure. The antenna size becomes (0. 22 λ x 0. 18 λ). Wide bandwidth is reached by making the U-shaped slot with two unequal arms. Moreover, dual operating frequencies are achieved by cutting either L-shaped or U-shaped slits on the coupled <b>feeding</b> <b>part</b> of the radiating surface. The antenna resonates in Bluetooth ISM band at 2. 4 GHz {{as well as in}} WLAN band at 5. 2 GHz. The bandwidths are about 31 % and 7. 5 % for the lower and upper bands, respectively. The proposed antenna is simple in structure compared to regular stacked or coplanar parasitic patch antennas that, makes it suitable for most mobile communication applications.

The emulsion copolymerization of Styrene (Sty) -Butyl acrylate (BuA) {{was carried out in}} a semibatch reactor with sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) as surfactant and potassium persulphate (KPS) as initiator. The effects related to the distribution of the monomer, the surfactant, and the initiator on the copolymer composition and the overall behaviour of the reactor were thoroughly studied. It was found that BUA rich initial charge increased the polymerization rate, reduced the particle sizes, and minimized the composition drift. The experimental data showed that the free unadsorbed surfactant in the reactor increased with increasing the fraction of the BuA monomer initially charged in the reactor. This led to {{an increase in the number}} of polymer particles and in return increased the polymerization rate. In addition, cross-linked copolymer was obtained when the BuA content was high indicating the possibility of gel effect which as well led to the apparent increase in the polymerization rate. The water-solubilities of the monomers did not affect the reaction kinetics or the copolymer composition. This was demonstrated experimentally and by means of mathematical modeling. Reducing the surfactant and the initiator concentrations showed the general behaviour of lower polymerization rates and larger particle sizes. The copolymer composition was not affected by the changes in the surfactant and the initiator concentrations in the reactor. <b>Feeding</b> <b>part</b> of the initiator or the surfactant during the semi batch stage while maintaining constant concentrations showed major effects on the sizes and the numbers of the polymer particles, and the polymerization rate. This is believed to be related to the change in the agitation intensity as a result of varying the volume of the initial charge.

These robots have four degrees of freedom (three rotational and one translational). Typically these robots are used for assembly tasks that take place along a vertical axis.
