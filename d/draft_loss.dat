40|$|AbstractThe {{demand of}} poultry {{products}} and prices are increasing very rapidly. Therefore, modern poultry industry is using mechanical ventilation system in closed housing {{to support the}} increased growth rate of the birds. Ventilation system is used to produce the healthier and quality broiler by reducing indoor air pollutant concentration and temperature. Currently, the price of fossil fuel is increasing day by day; therefore, minimization of overall cost of poultry production needs reduction in energy consumption or introduction of cheaper and alternative energy sources. Although solar heating system is used in broiler industries during winter but limited research was done on natural wind-driven ventilation system. In the current study, natural draft chimney was modified with wire mesh screen and was designed for the enhanced ventilation. In laboratory, {{it was found that}} the modified chimney significantly minimized the <b>draft</b> <b>losses</b> and increased the ventilation rate up to 60 to 90 percent compared to the normal conventional chimney. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) showed that the chimney performance was significantly improved in the modified solar chimney than that in the normal one. It is suggested that modified solar chimney can be used to replace the mechanical ventilation system in poultry farming to reduce the production cost as well to meet the demand of animal protein for human beings...|$|R

This thereby, confirmed the effect of the lost performance of the overall boiler, and hence helps to develop means of eliminating the growth of either slagging or fouling or both (opacity). Practically, the boiler systems operate with a very substantial quantity of steam at an average pressure of 1. 6 × 105 Pa above atmospheric pressure, and a significant amount of total heat flow of 18. 53 kW is calculated. With the application of clay (0. 8 mm thick) assumed opacity effect, the average pressure reduces to 0. 67 × 105 Pa below atmospheric level, hence total rates of heat flow of 13. 73 kW. The fouling resistance is calculated as 0. 00257 m 2. oC/W enough to satisfy that of boiler water, as a result of which a loss in performance of 3. 76 % was found to be possible.

40|$|Lumpy {{skin disease}} (LSD), an {{infectious}} viral disease of cattle, causes considerable financial losses in livestock industry of affected countries. A questionnaire survey with {{the objectives of}} determining direct economic losses of LSD (mortality loss, milk loss, <b>draft</b> <b>loss)</b> and treatment costs (medication and labour cost) per affected herd, and assessing the cost effectiveness of vaccination {{as a means for}} LSD control was carried out in the central and north-western parts of Ethiopia. From a total of 4430 cattle (in 243 herds) surveyed, 941 animals (in 200 herds) were reported to be infected. The overall morbidity and mortality at animal level were 21. 2 % and 4. 5 %, and at herd level these were 82. 3 % and 24. 3 %. There was a significant difference in animal level morbidity and mortality between categories of animals. Over 94 % of the herd owners ranked LSD as a big or very big problem for cattle production. A large proportion (92. 2 %) of the herd owners indicated that LSD affects cattle marketing. A median loss of USD 375 (USD 325 in local Zebu and USD 1250 in Holstein-Friesian local Zebu cross cattle) was estimated per dead animal. Median losses per affected lactating cow were USD 141 (USD 63 in local Zebu cows and USD 216 in Holstein-Friesian local Zebu cross cows) and, USD 36 per affected ox. Diagnosis and medication cost per affected animal were estimated at USD 5. The median total economic loss of an LSD outbreak at herd level was USD 1176 (USD 489 in subsistence farm and USD 2735 in commercial farm). At herd level, the largest component of the economic loss was due to mortality (USD 1000) followed by milk loss (USD 120). LSD control costs were the least contributor to herd level losses. The total herd level economic losses in the commercial farm type were significantly higher than in the subsistence farm type. The financial analysis showed a positive net profit of USD 136 (USD 56 for subsistence farm herds and USD 283 for commercial herds) per herd due to LSD vaccine investment. It should be noted that only the noticeable direct costs and treatment costs associated with the disease were considered in the study. Generally, vaccination is economically effective and should be encouraged. </p...|$|E

40|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease is endemic in Ethiopia with occurrences of several {{outbreaks}} everyyear. Quantitative {{information about the}} impact of the disease on smallholder farming sys-tems in the country is, however, scarce. This study presents a quantitative assessment ofthe clinical and direct economic impacts of foot and mouth disease outbreaks on house-hold level in smallholder livestock farming systems. Impacts were assessed based on dataobtained from case outbreaks in cattle in crop–livestock mixed and pastoral smallholderfarming systems that occurred in 2012 and 2013. Data were collected by using question-naires administered to 512 smallholder farmers in six districts within two administratezones that represent the two smallholder farming systems. Foot and mouth disease morbid-ity rates of 85. 2 % and 94. 9 % at herd level; and 74. 3 % and 60. 8 % at animal level in the affectedherds were determined for crop–livestock mixed system and pastoral system, respectively. The overall and calf specific mortality rates were 2. 4 % and 9. 7 % for the crop–livestock mixedsystem, and 0. 7 % and 2. 6 % for the pastoral system, respectively. Herd level morbidity ratewas statistically significantly higher in the pastoral system than in the crop–livestock mixedsystem (P < 0. 001). The economic losses of foot and mouth disease outbreak due to milkloss, <b>draft</b> power <b>loss</b> and mortality were on average USD 76 per affected herd and USD 9. 8 per head of cattle in the affected herds in crop–livestock mixed system; and USD 174 peraffected herd and USD 5. 3 per head of cattle in the affected herds in the pastoral system. The herd level economic losses were statistically significantly higher for the pastoral sys-tem than for the crop–livestock mixed system (P < 0. 001). The major loss due to the diseaseoccurred as a result of milk <b>losses</b> and <b>draft</b> power <b>losses</b> whereas mortality losses wererelatively low.

After the draft, Ross {{was on the verge}} of quitting his job as a {{commentator}} for WWE, as he was angry at the fact he was leaving the Raw brand, where he had commentated for over ten years. Ross stated on his official blog that he was about to quit WWE, but he decided to continue to work for the company and make the best of working on SmackDown. After the Draft, the ECW brand was left without a world championship, after the ECW Champion Kane was drafted to Raw. As a result of pre-draft stipulations, champions took their championships to their new brand and made them property of that brand. SmackDown, however, lost their secondary championship, after United States Champion Matt Hardy was drafted to the ECW brand, in the process making the title ECW property, but gained another top-tier championship when WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown brand, in the process making the title SmackDown exclusive for the first time since 2005. The result of Triple H being <b>drafted</b> was the <b>loss</b> of the Raw brand's world championship. After the draft, the ECW Championship moved back to ECW when Mark Henry defeated Kane and The Big Show in a Triple Threat match at Night of Champions, leaving Raw without any top-tier championships.

40|$|Increasing {{interconnection}} {{of individual}} power systems into major grids has imposed more stringent {{quality assurance requirements}} on the modelling of hydroelectric generating plant. This has provided {{the impetus for the}} present study in which existing industry models used to predict the transient behaviour of the Francis-turbine plants are reviewed. Quasi-steady flow models for single- and multiple-turbine plants developed in MATLAB Simulink are validated against field test results collected at Hydro Tasmania's Mackintosh and Trevallyn power stations. Nonlinear representation of the Francis-turbine characteristics, detailed calculation of the hydraulic model parameters, and inclusion of the hydraulic coupling effects for multiple-machine station are found to significantly improve the accuracy of predictions for transient operation. However, there remains a noticeable phase lag between measured and simulated power outputs that increases in magnitude with guide vane oscillation frequency. The convective lag effect in flow establishment through the Francis-turbine draft tube is suspected as a major contributor to this discrepancy, which is likely to be more important for hydro power stations with low operating head and short waterway conduits. To further investigate these effects, the steady flow in a typical Francis-turbine draft tube without swirl is analysed computationally using the commercial finite volume code ANSYS CFX. Experimental studies of a scale model draft tube using air as the working medium are conducted to validate and optimise the numerical simulation. Surprisingly, numerical simulations with a standard k-ε turbulence model are found to better match experimental results than the steady-flow predictions of more advanced turbulence models. The streamwise pressure force on the draft tube is identified as a quantity not properly accounted for in current industry models of hydro power plant operation. Transient flow effects in the model draft tube following a sudden change in discharge are studied computationally using the grid resolution and turbulence model chosen for the steady-flow analysis. Results are compared with unsteady pressure and thermal anemometry measurements. The three-dimensional numerical analysis is shown to predict a longer response time than the one-dimensional hydraulic model currently used as the power industry standard. Convective lag effects and fluctuations in the <b>draft</b> tube pressure <b>loss</b> coefficient are shown to largely explain the remaining discrepancies in current quasi-steady predictions of transient hydro power plant operation...|$|R
