2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> are {{alternative}} routes to formulating the path integral, however their {{connection to the}} Hamiltonian formalism is less clear. One way is {{to start with the}} BF theory. This is a simpler theory than general relativity, [...] it has no local degrees of freedom and as such depends only on topological aspects of the fields. BF theory is what is known as a topological field theory. Surprisingly, it turns out that general relativity can be obtained from BF theory by imposing a constraint, BF theory involves a field [...] and if one chooses the field [...] to be the (anti-symmetric) product of two tetrads ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Bob McKeown on the edition of January 26, 2005, of The Fifth Estate, Coulter came under criticism for her statement, [...] "Canada used to be... one of our most... most loyal friends, and vice versa. I mean, Canada sent troops to Vietnam. Was Vietnam less containable {{and more of a}} threat than Saddam Hussein?" [...] McKeown contradicted her with, [...] "No, actually Canada did not send troops to Vietnam." [...] On the edition of February 18, 2005 of Washington Journal, Coulter justified her statement by referring to the thousands of Canadians who served in the American armed forces during the Vietnam era, either because they volunteered or because they were living in the United States during the war years and got drafted. She said, [...] "The Canadian Government didn't send troops... but... they came and fought with the Americans. So I was wrong. <b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> were 10,000 Americans who happened to be born in Canada." [...] (There were actually between 5,000 and 20,000 Canadians who fought in Vietnam itself, including approximately 80 who were killed.) John Cloud of Time, writing about the incident a few months later, said, [...] "Canada [...] noncombat troops to Indochina in the 1950s and again to Vietnam in 1972".|$|E

[...] "A few mulattoes, overseers and that class, rose with the negroes, but the great bulk of them, having got what they wanted, joined the whites or stood neutral; but {{now that they have}} thrown in their lot with the blacks the prospect seems almost desperate. However <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> <b>there</b> {{is no doubt that the}} island is ruined, and the whites who were lucky enough to escape with their lives will find that instead of being rich men they are penniless. It is a horrible business altogether. I shall be glad when we get to Cape François and can get news of what is really going on." ...|$|E
60|$|On the one hand, {{what follows}} from the untruth of the assumption? If {{apparent}} largeness of stars is not due to comparative nearness, and their successively smaller sizes to their greater and greater degrees of remoteness, what becomes of the inferences respecting the dimensions of our sidereal system and the distances of nebulæ? If, as has lately been shown, the almost invisible star 61 Cygni has a greater parallax than [Greek: a] Cygni, though, according to an estimate based on Sir W. Herschel's assumption, it should be about twelve times more distant--if, as <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> <b>there</b> exist telescopic stars which are nearer to us than Sirius; of what worth is {{the conclusion that the}} nebulæ are very remote, because their component luminous masses are made visible only by high telescopic powers? Clearly, if the most brilliant star in the heavens and a star that cannot be seen by the naked eye, prove to be equidistant, relative distances cannot be in the least inferred from relative visibilities. And if so, nebulæ may be comparatively near, though the starlets of which they are made up appear extremely minute.|$|E
