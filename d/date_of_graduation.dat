Before his death in 1892, General Cullum completed the first three volumes of a work that eventually comprised 10volumes, titled General Cullum’s Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy, and covering USMA classes from 1802 through 1850. From 1802 through the Class of 1977, graduates were listed by general order of Merit.

5000|$|A {{good deal}} of {{confusion}} exists about Jones' career and age.

50|$|Graduation {{is getting}} a diploma or {{academic}} degree or the ceremony that is sometimes associated with it, in which students become graduates.

When ceremonies are associated, they usually include a procession of the academic staff and candidates and a valediction.

Daughter of a physician, descendant to a noble prestigious family and considered the most handsome girl in the city, she was also fanatically Basque. They married at unspecified time, though prior to 1904; he tended to be quiet and unassuming, she was also introvert, but of a decisive and bold character. The couple settled at Calle Valázquez; they had 9 children, 6 boys and 3 girls.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this study {{examines}} whether employment by high school students improves or worsens economic attainment 6 to 9 years after the scheduled <b>date</b> <b>of</b> high school <b>graduation.</b> There {{is no indication that}} light to moderate job commitments ever have a detrimental impact and hours worked during the senior grade are positively correlated with future earnings, fringe benefits, and occupational status. These results are robust across a variety of specifications and suggest that employment increases net investments in human capital and facilitates the school- to-work transition, particularly towards the end of high school and for students not continuing on to college. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out of the {{undergraduate}} backgrounds and research achievements of 885 (94. 1 %) of all 940 medically qualified professors and readers in medical faculties in the United Kingdom. A total of 217 (24. 5 %) of the graduates in these senior academic positions had graduated from Oxford or Cambridge and 137 (15. 5 %) had an intercalated BSc. The corresponding figures for a control group matched for sex and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduation</b> were 118 (13. 3 %) for Oxford and Cambridge (academic to control odds ratio 2. 11 : 1) and 34 (3. 8 %) for the BSc (odds ratio 4. 58 : 1). Those with an intercalated BSc in the clinical specialties raised substantially more research grants from the Medical Research Council than their peers from Oxford and Cambridge or those without a BSc. The Oxford and Cambridge group raised more grants in the non-clinical specialties. Bibliometric analysis {{was carried out}} on the United Kingdom graduates within the broad specialty of medicine (n = 218) matched for <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduation.</b> Academics with a BSc had a better publication record over 10 years (median number of original publications 72) than the Oxford and Cambridge group (median 59) and a substantially better record than those from other schools without a BSc (median 46). Citation analysis was carried out on subsets of the above sample matched for <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduation</b> and frequency of publication. Those with an intercalated BSc were cited more often (8. 04 citations/paper) than the Oxford and Cambridge graduates (7. 63) and substantially more than their peers without a BSc (4. 16).

Furthermore, important variables are available to a high level of precision: income is described as a metric variable and information about employment characteristics is given on a monthly basis, from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>graduation.</b> Thus both the emergence and the development of the gender pay gap amongst university graduates can be tracked very precisely.|$|E

The analysis of the information, from a study of career paths, identified four types of mobility: intragenerational mobility, intergenerational mobility, internal mobility and external mobility. The results allow us to observe that most of the graduates with a major in communication sciences have had little mobility. However, occupational mobility is greater in graduates who have spent more time in the job market, particularly women. Meanwhile, generational mobility shows the importance of women for family support and highlights the differences between parents and children in level of academic training, even though their incomes are similar. </span...|$|E

Due to these restrictions, the effects we look at should to some extent be seen as combined effects, assessing scarring in a universal way. They do not, however, indicate the exact size of scarring for a certain elapsed period after the experience of early unemployment.|$|E
