Lat. {{there is}} a large island, at about 3 miles' distance from the mainland of the South-land; this island has high mountains, with a good deal of brushwood and many thornbushes, so that it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> over; here certain animals are found, since we saw many excrements, and besides two seals and a wild cat, resembling a civet-cat, but with browner hair. This island is dangerous to touch at, owing to the rocky reefs which are level with the water and below the surface, almost along the whole length of the shore; between it and the mainland there are also numerous rocks and reefs, and slightly more to southward {{there is a}}nother small island.|$|E

500|$|In 2000 Apple Records {{released}} a thirtieth anniversary {{edition of the}} album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: [...] "It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really.

[...] He commented on the production: [...] "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it...

It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to reading text off a monitor after experiencing a game like this". He concluded that [...] "LucasArts has done an impeccable job ... a must-see". In 1992 the magazine named the title as one of the year's four best adventure games. Andy Nuttal of Amiga Format wrote, [...] "The puzzles are very well thought-out, with some exquisite, subtle elements that give you a real kick when you solve them." [...] He noted that the game is [...] "littered with elements that are genuinely funny". His sole complaint was about the game's linearity compared to Monkey Island 2; but he finished by saying, [...] "It's a minor point, anyway, and it shouldn't put you off buying what {{is one of the best}} Amiga adventures ever." [...] In 2008, Retro Gamer Magazine praised it as [...] "a masterful piece of storytelling, and a spellbinding adventure".|$|E

Students deliberated over the effects of Harvard's comprehensive financial aid policies. Neal Gabler wrote in the New York Times that Harvard students were [...] "superachivers", even considering the effects of financial aid. They were [...] "likely to be wealthy, well-appointed young people groomed and professionalized at an early age precisely so they would impress admissions officers." [...] One Harvard graduate who had already joined Occupy Boston told the Boston Globe that attending Harvard did not ensure membership in the 1%, saying: [...] "I’m the first person in my family to go to college, and I worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Harvard, but I feel that the way the country is now, the American dream isn’t possible.’" [...] Some students in a dormitory near the encampment responded directly, chanting [...] "We are the one percent" [...] and yelling insults.|$|E

[...] While promoting the game in an issue of Star Wars Insider, writer Jack Lyon stated [...] "Short attention span Star Wars freaks will surely dig Masters of Teräs Käsi, LucasArts' first fighting game." [...] A backstory was developed in which Darth Vader uses a mysterious master of Teräs Käsi, Arden Lyn, to eliminate high-ranking members of the rebellion in hand-to-hand combat. Development of the game took approximately 19 months according to Lead Artist Craig Rundels. Softimage was used for character creation. It was the first LucasArts title developed for the PlayStation. [...] "No one had programmed a game on the PlayStation [...] We were learning the hardware, how to make art on it, how to program on it while we were developing Teräs Käsi." [...] A demo was released on disc in the third issue of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine.|$|E

2500|$|When Sebastian {{decided to}} record {{an album of}} Memphis soul {{classics}} it was suggested by Universal Music Publishing that Steve Cropper should be contacted {{to see if he}} would like to be involved.

He also called in Lester Snell, who is a mainstay Memphis organ/keyboard player who has worked with artists including Eddie Floyd, David Porter and Isaac Hayes. The Memphis Album was recorded live on analogue tape at Ardent Studios Memphis in August 2007. The recording engineer Curry Weber explained the reason for this on AllMemphisMusic, an online Memphis radio station, [...] "Going to tape is just such a richer and warmer tone when you hit it first of all. Not a lot of guys these days are talented enough to go to tape, cause it's so definitive and destructive.

2500|$|... "Telephone" [...] was {{originally}} written by Gaga for singer Britney Spears's sixth studio album, Circus (2008), but Spears's label rejected it. Later, Gaga recorded the song as a collaboration with Beyoncé for The Fame Monster. The song {{talks about the}} singer preferring the dance floor rather than answering her lover's call with the verses sung in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats. Gaga explained that the song deals with her fear of suffocation, [...] "fear [...] never being able to enjoy myself. 'Cause I love my work so much, I find it really <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{out and have a}} good time." [...] In [...] "So Happy I Could Die", Gaga presents an ode to sexual feeling and actions, stating, [...] "I love that lavender blonde, The way she moves the way she walks, I touch myself, can't get enough." [...] Essentially a love song, the object of affection in [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] becomes Gaga herself as she talks about drinking, dancing, observing, and touching herself. Gaga's voice sounds sedated in the song. The song also uses Auto-Tune in the singer's vocals. The last song on The Fame Monster is [...] "Teeth", which contains gospel music and S style music composition.|$|E
2500|$|The PlayStation Move {{has been}} {{generally}} well received. Game Informer gave it an 8 out of 10, saying, [...] "The PlayStation Eye and motion controller are a killer combination for accurate and highly responsive motion-based gameplay, and we applaud Sony {{for getting the}} hardware right the first time." [...] Kotaku praised its accuracy, design, use of augmented reality and said that [...] "The Playstation Move is a intuitive, natural feeling way to play games and it brings with it not only a sense of increased immersion to already graphically immersive games, but {{a new way to}} play with your reality and a refreshing form of colorful feedback." [...] IGN gave the Move an 8.5 out of 10, noting that the launch line-up of games for the controller was insufficient though it summarized by saying [...] "At the end of the day, the PlayStation Move {{has the potential to be}} the best motion control system on the current crop of consoles." [...] Joystiq praised the Move, saying [...] "The hardware's great, and I can see it being used in a multitude of really cool ways, but of course it's only as cool as the games that use it" [...] and that the launch line-up was not worth the purchase, though it believed that the Move would be worth the purchase in early 2011 due to a stronger line-up of games such as [...] and Killzone 3. CVG gave the Move an extremely positive review and awarded it 9 out of 10, saying that [...] "Sony's motion control gets beyond being a gimmick. We found ourselves constantly itching for 'one more go'." [...] The Guardian strongly criticized the Move's launch line-up, though it noted that the hardware was strong and that after playing with the Move it was [...] "very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to the relative inaccuracy of the Wii".|$|E
