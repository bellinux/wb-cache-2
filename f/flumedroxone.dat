50|$|<b>Flumedroxone</b> is a steroidal {{progestogen}} of the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone {{group that}} was never marketed. The C17α acetate ester of <b>flumedroxone,</b> <b>flumedroxone</b> acetate, has been marketed as an antimigraine drug.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flumedroxone</b> acetate (brand names Demigran, Leomigran; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} WG-537), {{also known as}} 6α-(trifluoromethyl)-17α-acetoxyprogesterone or as 6α-(trifluoromethyl)-17α-acetoxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a steroidal progestogen of the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone group that {{was introduced in the}} 1960s and that is or was marketed and used as an antimigraine agent in Europe. It is the C17α acetate ester of <b>flumedroxone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Flumedroxone</b> acetate {{is said to}} have weak or slight progestogenic {{activity}} without other hormonal activity (including estrogenic, antiestrogenic, androgenic, anabolic, or glucocorticoid). It has been assessed in over 1,000 patients for the treatment of migraine, with effectiveness ranging from excellent to less than that of the reference antimigraine drug methysergide. In keeping with its {{progestogenic activity}}, <b>flumedroxone</b> acetate produces menstrual irregularities, namely polymenorrhea, and breast tension as side effects in women. Other progestogens including medroxyprogesterone acetate, lynestrenol, allylestrenol, dydrogesterone, and normethandrone have also been found to be effective for migraine in a high percentage of women.|$|E
40|$|A {{double-blind}} cross-over {{trial of}} a micronized preparation of <b>flumedroxone,</b> an oral progestogen derivative, and a placebo was undertaken to determine whether this drug had prophylactic value in migraine. No benefit was found in males, or in females with no history of menstrual exacerbation of migraine. In women whose migraine was worse {{around the time of}} menstruation <b>flumedroxone</b> resulted in statistically fewer headaches of less severity...|$|E
