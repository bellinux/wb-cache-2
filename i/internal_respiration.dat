[...] Boston UniversityRespiration {{is the process}} of the exchange of gases between the body tissues and the environment. This is divided into external and <b>internal</b> <b>respiration.</b> External respiration involves the passage of air through the respiratory passages and into the alveoli of the lungs, together with its diffusion through the lung walls and into the blood. <b>Internal</b> <b>respiration</b> here includes the chemical and physical transport of the gases by the blood, the circulation of the blood, and the exchange of gases between the blood and the tissues. Respiration is affected by the low pressures encountered on high mountains and during flight. The regulation of respiration is controlled by the nervous system, regulated by impulses from the respiratory centers. The respiratory centers respond to changes in the tension of carbon dioxide and oxygen of the arterial blood. Blood tension affects respiration both by direct response of the center itself and by reflex impulses from the chemoreceptors of the carotid body and the aortic body. Respiration is also altered by the Hering-Breuer reflexes, impulses caused by pressure on the pressoreceptors in the carotid sinus and in the aortic arch, and by stretch receptors in the lungs. The gas tensions of the arterial blood are the chief regulators of respiration. An increase in the tension of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood is a stimulus to respiration. Appreciable lowering of the tension of oxygen in the arterial blood increases the excitability of the respiratory center. Blood gas tensions are altered by the level of the metabolism, the dead space in the respiratory system, the oxygen utilization, and changes in carbon dioxide and oxygen pressures in the air breathed. The <b>internal</b> <b>respiration</b> utilizes diffusion of gases to effect the transfer of gases into the blood and out, aided by an enzyme carbonic anhydrase. The gases are carried in the blood, largely in chemical combination. Carbon dioxide is carried as a bicarbonate in the blood plasma. Hemoglobin in the red cells carries the oxygen and much of the labile carbon dioxide. The quantity of gases carried depends upon the number of red cells and the amount of hemoglobin, the degree to which oxygen is utilized, and the rate of circulation. These factors are under nervous control, regulated in part by the factors altering the external respiration. Respiratory difficulties at high altitudes are due to the low barometric pressures encountered, which reduce the amount of oxygen available to the body. The constant water-vapor pressure in the lungs is also a factor limiting the amount of oxygen which can be supplied at high altitude. Respiration at high altitude is considered in two parts; first, respiration on high mountains, where altitude is maintained for days, weeks, or longer; and second, respiration during flight and conditions simulating flight, in which the altitude is maintained for a period of minutes or hours. Ascending high mountains causes the percentages of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the expired and in the alveolar air to change. The carbon dioxide percentage increases and the oxygen percentage decreases progressively with increase in altitude. These changes are more pronounced during muscular exertion. The tensions of carbon dioxide and of oxygen in both the alveolar air and the arterial blood are lowered, with increases in altitude, from 40 mm. and 102 mm., respectively, at sea level, to 21 mm. and 37 mm. at a 20, 000 -foot elevation. The respiration rate is not altered consistently, but the minute volume of respiration is increased with increase in altitude. During muscular work at high altitude the minute volume is higher than during the same amount of work at sea level. The minute volume increase is the result of an increase in the excitability of the respiratory centers due to lowered oxygen tension, sufficient to more than counteract the smaller stimulus incurred by a decreased carbon dioxide tension. <b>Internal</b> <b>respiration</b> is affected by high altitude. The red cell count and the hemoglobin content are increased, at first by temporary means; but later they are more permanently augmented. The hemoglobin content continues to increase for a number of weeks. Immediate increase in the rate of circulation aids in supplying the oxygen required until blood changes compensate for it. The oxygen requirement for rest is essentially the same as that at sea level, but a given amount of work requires more oxygen than is required by the same amount of work at sea level. Residents and natives at high altitude are acclimatized to altitude and perform muscular tasks with less respiratory effort than sea level residents at high altitude. The best explanation of adaptation appears to be an increase in the surface area of hemoglobin present in the blood of natives. Man, after becoming acclimatized, has climbed to 28, 000 feet on Mount Everest, but respiration is labored and the amount of exertion is limited. Oxygen has been used in some mountain climbing but with no appreciable benefit. This is probably due to inadequate oxygen supply and to technical difficulties. When air is breathed during flight and in simulated flight in low pressure chambers, the same trends noted on high mountains are found. The alveolar partial pressures are 30 mm. for carbon dioxide and 35 mm. for oxygen at an altitude of 20, 000 feet. The more permanent acclimatization factors are not found during flight because of the short duration, and even the immediate adjustments do not permit altitudes attainable on mountains to be reached without serious difficulties. The maximum altitude that can be attained when air is breathed is dependent on the rate of ascent, the length of time the altitude is maintained, and individual factors. The highest safe altitude for long exposures is probably about 15, 000 feet, and for short exposures 25, 000 feet is about the limit. By using oxygen, sufficient to maintain the partial pressure in the inspired air at 160 mm. up to 27, 000 feet, or by using pure oxygen above 32, 000 feet, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveolar air can be maintained at 36 to 40 mm. Under these conditions the volume of respiration is not increased above normal for sea level and <b>internal</b> <b>respiration</b> is probably normal. The altitude limit for flights using oxygen is probably below 50, 000 feet, the present record being 47, 358 feet. The highest recommended height is 40, 000 feet. The breathing of pure oxygen or oxygen-rich air may be accomplished by the use of masks. Masks should be employed at 10, 000 feet for long flights and at 15, 000 feet for all flights. For flights above 30, 000 feet it is desirable to breathe pure oxygen from the ground up. By using pressure enclosures, maintaining either the atmospheric pressure at sea level or the oxygen pressure at sea level, respiration is not restricted by altitudes. The highest altitude to which man has ascended was attained in a balloon with a pressurized gondola, in which the oxygen pressure was maintained above the sea level value of 160 mm. The altitude of 72, 395 feet was reached in this flight without respiratory difficulty. The data presented prove that respiratory difficulties at high altitude are caused by insufficient oxygen, and that by maintaining an adequate oxygen pressure in the inspired air, normal respiration is possible at high altitudes...|$|E

Jones, Brown and Hara (1987) observed decreased attraction to food, reduced feeding, hyperactivity as some of the behavioural responses of fish to acid conditions. The survival and mortality recorded in the species could be linked to the morphological and behavioural responses of the fish in the different acidic media. These behavioural strategies and morphological adaptations could be the adaptive mechanisms which made the species to survive in the acidified waters by reducing the stress of the acid on them as noted by Flik et al.

40|$|By {{combining}} {{an existing}} gas exchange model with {{the diffusion of}} respiratory gases over the barrier of the fruit skin, a new gas exchange model was developed. Parameters describing O- 2 and CO 2 permeance, <b>internal</b> <b>respiration</b> and fermentation for a batch of pears (Pyres communis L. cv. Conference) were estimated using this new gas exchange model. The model was calibrated using data on gas exchange, internal and external gas composition and the surface of individual pears. The surface area was calculated using a computer imaging method. The absence of internal O- 2 gradients in the aqueous phase of a pear, a prerequisite for using a three-compartment model set up based on Fick's first law, was confirmed using an O- 2 -electrode probe. Data analysis using the combined gas exchange model resulted in estimated parameters indicating an increased internal affinity for O- 2 and increased internal fermentative CO 2 production compared to data analysis using a traditional gas exchange model, based on external gas composition. The O- 2 and CO 2 permeances were also derived using Ne efflux data. The estimated permeances using the combined gas exchange model were lower than those found with the Ne method. The lower permeances can be explained assuming that the Ne method only assesses the skin permeance, while the permeances for O- 2 and CO 2 from the combined gas exchange model represent all the barriers between mitochondria, where respiration actually occurs, and the external atmosphere. The lower CO 2 permeance found using the new model might also {{be explained by the}} relatively high pH of the cytosol. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

For the midgut gland, the dorsal muscle, the gill, the heart, the scaphognathite muscle and the ventral nerve, the succinate dehydrogenase (SDHase) activity {{was measured by the}} method of methylene blue's reduction. In addition, the alkaline and the acid phosphatases (Alk. Pase and Acid Pase) were measured by the KIND-KING's colorimetry. Before measurement, the tissues were homogenized with buffer and dialyzed. For the ventral nerve, the cholinesterase (ChEase) and the glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOTase) activities were measured, too, by the m-nitrophenol and the REITMAN's methods respectively. For the hemolymph, both the phosphatases were examined. After sampling, the ganglions were fixed histologically and the PAS-positive granules in the cells were calculated quantitatively by the transcription method as previously. The SDHase and the Alk. Pase activities were high in the heart. The Acid Pase activity was high in the gill. In the hemolymph, each of the Pases was 3 - 21 and 8 - 20 KING-ARMSTRONG's unit respectively. The ChEase activity was 8 - 19 μM acetic acid/mg/hr in the ventral nerve. There were weak correlations of the SDHase and the Alk. Pase in the heart and the ventral nerve with the quantity of the PAS-substance in the cells. Therefore it seems that the cells have some role related with the metabolism of the heart or the ventral nerve. 1 ．クルマエビの食道上神経節の腹面後部に所在するPAS細胞に関して,中腸腺,腹部背筋,鰓,心臓,顎舟葉付属筋,腹髄神経索および血リンパ等におけるコハク酸デヒドロゲナーゼ,アルカリ性および酸性ホスファターゼ,コリンエステラーゼ或いはグルタミン酸 オキザロ酢酸トランスアミナーゼの諸活性度との生理的関連性を調べた。各酵素の活性は下記の方法に依り測定し,一方,当該細胞はその顆粒量を組織標本上から複写計量した相 対値を以て出現量の把握を行なった。 2 ．コハク酸デヒドロゲナーゼはメチレン青還元能の測定に依った。活性は心臓において最も高く 18 ~ 40 単位(10 ^ /g/min) を示した。 3 ．アルカリ性ホスファターゼはKIND-KING法に依り測定した。活性は心臓において最も高く 30 ~ 120 単位(mg phenol/g/ 15 min) を示した。なお血リンパでは 3 ~ 21 KING-ARMSTRONG単位であった。 4 ．酸性ホスファターゼはKIND-KING法に依り測定した。活性は鰓において最も高く 18 ~ 50 単位(mg phenol/g/hr) を示した。なお血リンパでは 8 ~ 20 KING-ARMSTRONG単位で あった。 5. コリンエステラーゼはm-二トロフェノール法に依り測定した。腹髄神経索の活性は 8 ~ 19 単位(μM acetic　acid/mg/hr) を示した。 6 ．心臓と腹髄神経索におけるコハク酸デヒドロゲナーゼとアルカリ性ホスファターゼの両活性は両臓器ともPAS顆粒量とr= 0. 52 以上の相関が認められた。特にコハク酸デヒドロゲナーゼは細胞内呼吸上,重要な位置を占めることから腹髄神経索において示された当該顆粒との量的相関は当該酵素とPAS細胞が何らかの機能的関係を有する可能性を示唆 するものと解される...|$|E
40|$|Tree {{mortality}} {{is the least}} understood process of a tree’s life-cycle. Two hypotheses on how mortality progresses in a tree are proposed in the literature: Manion’s gradual decline hypothesis and Bossel’s sudden death hypothesis. Bossel already formulated a mechanism in his model, BAUMTOD, {{as the cause of}} sudden death phenomena. His model, however, cannot be used to generate a causal understanding to Manion’s hypothesis. Therefore, a causal mechanism for the gradual decline pattern, advocated by Manion, is suggested. BAUMTOD is modified accordingly and the modified model is called BAUMTOD-M. The suggested mechanism concerns the <b>internal</b> imbalance of <b>respiration</b> demand and available photosynthate supply. Then, the eigenvalue elasticity analysis (EEA) is employed to pinpoint how a simulated tree responds to various stresses. It is applied to BAUMTOD and BAUMTOD-M to study the likely structural causes behind tree mortality according to Bossel’s and Manion’s hypotheses, respectively.

40|$|Noninvasive, {{continuous}} measurements in vivo {{are commonly}} used to make inferences about mechanisms controlling <b>internal</b> and external <b>respiration</b> during exercise. In particular, the dynamic response of muscle oxygenation (Sm(O(2))) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) {{is assumed to be}} correlated to that of venous oxygen saturation (Sv(O(2))) measured invasively. However, there are situations where the dynamics of Sm(O(2)) and Sv(O(2)) do not follow the same pattern. A quantitative analysis of venous and muscle oxygenation dynamics during exercise is necessary to explain the links between different patterns observed experimentally. For this purpose, a mathematical model of oxygen transport and utilization that accounts for the relative contribution of hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb) to the NIRS signal was developed. This model includes changes in microvascular composition within skeletal muscle during exercise and integrates experimental data in a consistent and mechanistic manner. Three subjects (age 25. 6 +/- 0. 6 yr) performed square-wave moderate exercise on a cycle ergometer under normoxic and hypoxic conditions while muscle oxygenation (C(oxy)) and deoxygenation (C(deoxy)) were measured by NIRS. Under normoxia, the oxygenated Hb/Mb concentration (C(oxy)) drops rapidly at the onset of exercise and then increases monotonically. Under hypoxia, C(oxy) decreases exponentially to a steady state within approximately 2 min. In contrast, model simulations of venous oxygen concentration show an exponential decrease under both conditions due to the imbalance between oxygen delivery and consumption at the onset of exercise. Also, model simulations that distinguish the dynamic responses of oxy-and deoxygenated Hb (HbO(2), HHb) and Mb (MbO(2), HMb) concentrations (C(oxy) = HbO(2) + MbO(2); C(deoxy) = HHb + HMb) show that Hb and Mb contributions to the NIRS signal are comparable. Analysis of NIRS signal components during exercise with a mechanistic model of oxygen transport and metabolism indicates that changes in oxygenated Hb and Mb are responsible for different patterns of Sm(O(2)) and Sv(O(2)) dynamics observed under normoxia and hypoxia...|$|R
40|$|Altered {{proprioceptive}} control {{induced by}} inspiratory muscles fatigue in persons {{with and without}} recurrent low back pain Introduction: Postural stability can be challenged by external and <b>internal</b> (e. g. <b>respiration)</b> perturbations. Normally {{the central nervous system}} can deal with these challenges by counteracting with small movements of multiple joints. [1] Recent evidence suggests that the postural compensation for the respiratory disturbance may be less effective in people with low back pain (LBP). [2] This can explain the increased postural sway and the use of a rigid proprioceptive postural control strategy in persons with LBP. [3] Insight into the mechanisms of this postural control impairment might assist the management of LBP. The role of the respiratory muscles in postural control remains unclear, but can be studied by inducing acute fatigue of the inspiratory muscles. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the influence of inspiratory muscles fatigue (IMF) on postural stability and proprioceptive postural control strategies in people with and without recurrent LBP. Methods: Postural control characteristics of 16 subjects with LBP and 12 healthy subjects were evaluated both before and after IMF. To evaluate postural stability, center of pressure (CoP) displacement was determined on a force plate. Muscle vibration was used to evaluate the role of proprioceptive signals in postural control. Ratios of CoP displacement measured during triceps surae muscles vibration to that measured during lumbar paraspinal muscles vibration determined the proprioceptive postural control strategies. All trials were performed on both a stable as unstable support surface and without vision. Acute IMF was induced by breathing against an inspiratory threshold load. Results: After IMF, healthy subjects showed a significantly larger sway compared to the unfatigued condition, while standing on the unstable support surface (p 0. 05). Conclusion: During postural perturbation, IMF has a disturbing effect on postural stability in healthy subjects. The use of a rigid proprioceptive postural control strategy, rather than ‘multi-segmental’ control, due to IMF, might explain this observed postural instability. This resembles the behavior of people with LBP during an unfatigued condition. These findings suggest that inspiratory muscle training associated with postural control coaching might assist in the management of recurrent LBP.

40|$|Atmospheric {{modification}} {{can extend}} the storage life of harvested {{fruits and vegetables}} beyond that which can be achieved with refrigerated air storage alone. Apples are particularly well suited to modified atmosphere (MA) storage and yet the recommended atmospheres for different cultivars of apples vary widely and responses of individual populations of apples to a given treatment can be variable. Part of this variation {{may be related to}} the variability in the internal atmosphere composition of individual fruit. This thesis explores the relationships between internal atmosphere composition of apples and factors such as skin resistance to gas diffusion (R), respiration, external oxygen concentration ([O 2]ext), temperature and artificial barriers, all of which can influence the outcome of a given MA treatment. Skin resistance to gas diffusion (R) values of freshly harvested apples of eight cultivars grown in New Zealand, were obtained using non-steady state and steady state methods at 20 ± 1 °C. R was cultivar dependent, with freshly harvested Braeburn apples having the highest mean R and Royal Gala the lowest. Skin resistance to ethane diffusion (RC 2 H 6) was linearly related to skin resistance to ethylene diffusion (RC 2 H 4) for individual apples within cultivars. Although there was a large degree of variation in between pairs of R values obtained on different apples within each cultivar, individual R values within these pairs were very similar to each other. The close relationship between the two independent estimates of R confirmed that this was real fruit to fruit variation rather than measurement error. In contrast, estimates of skin resistance to carbon dioxide diffusion (RCO 2) were consistently higher than values for RC 2 H 4. There was a curvilinear relationship between RCO 2 and RC 2 H 6 in a combined data set for all cultivars, indicating that CO 2 may diffuse through additional routes to those available for O 2, C 2 H 4 and ethane (C 2 H 6). Freshly harvested Cox's Orange Pippin apples were respiring nearly twice as fast as Splendour, Granny Smith or Braeburn apples and a third higher than Gala, Royal Gala and Golden Delicious apples. Respiration rate appeared to be independent of RC 2 H 6 both within individual cultivars and in a combined data set for all cultivars. On the other hand, there was a declining exponential relationship between [O 2]i and RC 2 H 6 for individual apples and an increasing relationship between [CO 2]i and RC 2 H 6. Thus, the magnitude of R affects internal atmosphere composition for a given external atmosphere. The respiratory and C 2 H 4 production responses of Cox's Orange Pippin and Granny Smith apples to reduced O 2 concentrations were characterised by studying the variation in the magnitude of O 2, CO 2 and C 2 H 4 concentration differences between the internal and external atmospheres (Δ[O 2], Δ[CO 2] and Δ[C 2 H 4]) of individual apples maintained in different O 2 atmospheres at 20 ± 1 °C. Δ[O 2] decreased at low O 2 levels, reflecting the decreased rate of O 2 uptake in low O 2 concentrations. Oxygen uptake relative to that in air (RelO 2) approximately followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a half-maximal rate of 2. 5 % O 2 for [O 2]i and 7. 5 % for [O 2]ext. A mathematical equation was developed to describe the two physiological processes (ie. anaerobic and aerobic respiration) involved in the relationship between relative rate of CO 2 production (RelCO 2) or internal CO 2 concentration ([CO 2]i) and [O 2]ext or [O 2]i. The equation had two components, each describing one of the two physiological processes. The relationship between relative rate of C 2 H 4 production (RelC 2 H 4) or internal C 2 H 4 concentration ([C 2 H 4]i) and [O 2]i was more closely described by an exponential rather than a Michaelis-Menten type hyperbolic curve. Nevertheless, the overall shape of the relationship conformed to the expectation that small changes in O 2 concentration would have much greater effect at low [O 2]i than they do at high [O 2]i. In contrast, the presence of the skin as a diffusion barrier (R) resulted in development of an apparent 'lag phase' in the relationship between RelC 2 H 4 or [C 2 H 4]i and [O 2]ext such that it was no longer described by an exponential type curve and became essentially sigmoidal. These differences are attributable to gradients in gas composition between internal and external atmospheres. Washing of Granny Smith apples in Tween 20 solutions inhibited development of greasiness. This effect was associated with increased R, depressed [O 2]i, lower respiration and increased [CO 2]i and [C 2 H 4]i in the washed fruit compared to controls. The depression of [O 2]i in Tween 20 treated fruit was greater than the elevation of CO 2, suggesting that the Tween 20 treatment may have affected CO 2 production and O 2 uptake to different extents or alternatively the Tween 20 deposit on the fruit surface was differentially permeable to these two gases. Washed fruit also remained greener and firmer than controls. Pre-treatment by wiping without using Tween 20 solution had none of these effects but did stimulate weight loss. None of the treatments induced internal browning which is often associated with the development of greasiness in Granny Smith apples. The relationship between temperature and R, <b>internal</b> atmosphere compostion, <b>respiration</b> and rate of C 2 H 4 production of eight cultivars of apples was ascertained after equilibrating fruit at temperatures ranging from 0 – 30 °C for 72 h. R appeared to be independent of temperature. [O 2]i decreased, while [CO 2]i increased, in response to increasing temperatures and varied with cultivar. Braeburn apples consistently had lower [O 2]i and higher [CO 2]i than the other cultivars while the converse applied for Splendour apples. Internal C 2 H 4 concentrations ([C 2 H 4]i) and rate of C 2 H 4 production increased with increasing temperatures to a maximum at 25 °C, above which internal concentrations and rates of production declined. The magnitude of decline was cultivar dependent. Compared to the other cultivars, Splendour apples had the least capacity to accumulate and produce C 2 H 4. There was a progressive increase in fruit respiration rate with increasing temperatures, which varied with cultivar. Over all the temperature regimes, Splendour had the lowest average respiration rate while Cox's Orange Pippin apples had the highest. The potential for variability in these gas exchange variables being associated with overall storage life and response to MAs is discussed. Small gas concentration differences were measured between the equator and calyx end, and between the equator and calyx end shoulder within individual fruit in Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, Granny Smith and Splendour apples at 20 ± 1 °C. In contrast, large O 2 and CO 2 concentration differences between the same positions were found in Gala, Royal Gala, Braeburn and Cox's Orange Pippin apples. The differences were much greater than those measured between the core cavity and the fruit surface. Similarly, tissues in the calyx region of Braeburn and Granny Smith apples consistently had lower O 2 but higher CO 2 and C 2 H 4 concentrations than any other position on the fruit surface, whilst tissues at the equator had higher O 2 and lower CO 2 and C 2 H 4 concentrations than other parts of the fruit. These data falsify the notion that the internal atmosphere of individual apples can be regarded as being homogeneous. The heterogeneous distribution of gases within individual fruit would presumably affect the tendency of individual tissues to develop low-O 2 or high CO 2 disorders, particularly for fruit stored in MAs at elevated temperatures. A conceptual model is presented which summaries the relationships between fruit [O 2]i and [O 2]ext, R, respiration, temperature and artificial barriers. The [O 2]i of apples are always lower than the [O 2]ext used during MA storage, to an extent which is determined by the respiratory O 2 uptake by the tissues coupled with R. With everything else being maintained equal, increased R or increased respiration rate therefore depresses [O 2]i which in turn modifies the extent of response of the crop to a given MA treatment. These variables are therefore all important in determining the fruit's response to atmospheric modification...|$|R
