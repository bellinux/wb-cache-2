5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and <b>disadvantages,</b> though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 {{because of the}} wear on the barrels. The <b>disadvantages</b> of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells {{have the advantage of}} being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.|$|E

40|$|Intergenerational <b>disadvantage</b> {{has been}} defined as “disadvantage induced by the attitudes, social {{circumstances}} or economic limitations of a person’s parents’ (Vinson, 2009,P. 1). This <b>disadvantage</b> could be in terms of poverty, labour force, or lack of access to opportunities that other children may have. One of the limitations of this concept is that it only takes into account direct family, so it is only how a person’s parents affect their <b>disadvantage.</b> However, we know that the local community also affects <b>disadvantage,</b> and that <b>disadvantage</b> tends to cluster. The obvious question that this paper tries to answer is do areas with high levels of <b>disadvantage</b> have high levels of <b>disadvantage</b> for all age groups in the area? Or are there areas where a high proportion of disadvantaged elderly people and a low proportion of <b>disadvantage</b> children live? And where are these areas (eg, rural/regional areas, capital cities, inner urban areas). Answering this question will give some idea of which areas have entrenched <b>disadvantage,</b> so <b>disadvantage</b> that covers a number of generations. It is these areas where broad policies to reduce <b>disadvantage</b> for everyone are important, rather than targeted policies to reduce <b>disadvantage</b> for children or the elderly. This paper finds that remote areas suffer the greatest proportion of people in areas where there are four generations disadvantaged, and urban areas have the most people in areas where no generations are in <b>disadvantage.</b> This does suggest that the Government should be concentrating on efforts to reduce multiple generation <b>disadvantage</b> in remote areas. generational <b>disadvantage...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper brings {{together}} research findings on poverty, social exclusion, childhood development, {{and health and}} wellbeing to create a picture of child <b>disadvantage</b> in New South Wales {{over the last five}} to ten years. Introduction Children born into <b>disadvantage</b> {{are more likely to have}} health problems and develop behavioural issues; they are also likely to experience housing and food insecurity, lower levels of educational attainment and less supportive parental relationships. Research also shows that experiences during child development affect lifelong health and wellbeing. This e-brief {{brings together}} recent findings on child <b>disadvantage</b> in NSW. It begins by defining <b>disadvantage</b> and the related concepts of poverty, deprivation and social exclusion. This is followed by research findings on poverty, social exclusion, childhood development, and health and wellbeing to create a picture of child <b>disadvantage</b> in NSW over the last five to ten years. Information on indigenous child <b>disadvantage</b> is included where available. Methodological notes are generally detailed in the endnotes.

40|$|A life-course {{account of}} the {{pathways}} to adult social exclusion for children born in 1958 is explored. We identify the pervasive childhood factors, associated {{with a wide range}} of adult <b>disadvantage,</b> and specific life-course domain antecedents. Childhood <b>disadvantage</b> has more powerful legacies for women than for men: pathways to social exclusion are gendered. Experiences of <b>disadvantage</b> between ages 16 and 23 relate as closely to outcomes at age 33 as at age 23. The excess legacy of childhood <b>disadvantage</b> for women is mediated through lone motherhood. There are strong continuities and interconnections across the life-course in the legacies of earlier <b>disadvantage.</b> Unemployment or divorce between ages 23 and 33 promote <b>disadvantage</b> at age 33 and the legacies of divorce are more powerful for women. The implications for our understanding of the processes of social exclusion and the need for policy responses tailored according to lifetime patterns of <b>disadvantage</b> are discussed. intergenerational transmission, <b>disadvantage,</b> gender...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} co-occurrence of {{multiple}} sources of psychosocial <b>disadvantage</b> {{in association with}} risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD). It was hypothesized that increased co-occurring psychosocial <b>disadvantage</b> {{would be associated with}} increased risk of CHD in a monotonic fashion. While both social and psychological <b>disadvantage</b> are associated with increased risk of CHD, indicators of psychosocial <b>disadvantage</b> are traditionally examined individually in relationship to CHD. However, multiple sources of psychosocial <b>disadvantage</b> tend to co-occur. Methods: Hypotheses were examined using data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and its follow-up studies (n 6913). Indicators of psychosocial <b>disadvantage</b> (education, income, employment, single parenting, marital status, depressive and anxious symptoms) and covariates were derived from baseline interviews and incident CHD from hospital records/death certificates collected over 22 years of follow-up. Hypotheses were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Results indicated that greater co-occurrence of psychosocial disad-vantage conferred increased CHD risk.

5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The <b>disadvantages</b> of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these <b>disadvantages.</b>|$|E

40|$|Adverse {{experiences}} in early life can exert powerful delayed effects on adult survival and health. Telomere attrition is a potentially important mechanism in such effects. One source of early-life adversity is the stress caused by competitive <b>disadvantage.</b> Although previous avian experiments suggest that competitive <b>disadvantage</b> may accelerate telomere attrition, {{they do not}} clearly isolate the effects of competitive <b>disadvantage</b> from other sources of variation. Here, we present data from an experiment in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) that used cross-fostering to expose siblings to divergent early experience. Birds were assigned either to competitive advantage (being larger than their brood competitors) or competitive <b>disadvantage</b> (being smaller than their brood competitors) between days 3 and 12 post-hatching. <b>Disadvantage</b> did not affect weight gain, but it increased telomere attrition, leading to shorter telomere length in disadvantaged birds by day 12. There were no effects of <b>disadvantage</b> on oxidative damage as measured by plasma lipid peroxidation. We thus found strong evidence that early-life competitive <b>disadvantage</b> can accelerate telomere loss. This could lead to faster age-related deterioration and poorer health in later life...|$|R
