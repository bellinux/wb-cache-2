40|$|Written {{corrective}} feedback (WCF) {{has been a}} long time practice in L 2 writing instruction. However, in many cases, the effects are not satisfactory. There have been controversies about it both theoretically and empirically. This paper reports a multi-case study exploring individual differences that impact learners’ responses to WCF. Four students’ compositions in an English course with writing components were examined. Then, the students were interviewed. The results of analyses reveal, though all the four students were motivated to study by a compulsory provincial English test, students of significantly lower proficiency were motivated to significantly more independent learning activities after class. As a result, they achieved significantly greater improvement. It is also revealed that WCF did not lead to simplified writing in terms of lexical diversity and structural complexity, for the students knew the grading criteria for the written task in the compulsory test. Moreover, this study shows that <b>Ferris</b> (<b>1999)</b> classification of treatable and untreatable errors should be used with reference to the students’ present zone of proximal development (ZPD).

I argue that these criticisms are both unfounded and highly selective, leaving large portions of my case unchal-lenged and, in some cases, even strengthening them. If the case for correc-tion has any appeal, it rests on a strong bias-that critics must prove beyond any doubt that correction is never a good idea, while supporters need only show that uncertainty remains.

30|$|Seagrass beds, which {{distribute}} {{widely in}} tropical and temperate coastal regions, {{are one of}} the most productive marine ecosystems (Duarte and Chiscano 1999). Thalli, roots, and rhizomes of seagrasses offer associated animals microhabitats and shelters (Osenga and Coull 1983; Orth et al. 1984; Castel et al. 1989; Atilla et al. 2005). In addition, various detritus and organic particles in seagrass beds enhance the density and heterogeneity of infauna (Hall and Bell 1993; Danovaro et al. 2002). Meiofauna, benthic organisms between 1  mm and 42  μm, is considered a trophic level between microfauna and macrofauna (animals larger than 1  mm). However, most studies dealing with seagrass beds merely focus on macrofauna, even though meiofauna can consume from 10 % to more than 50 % of the total primary production in a seagrass system (Danovaro et al. 2002). Moreover, most members of meiofauna are less influenced by hypoxia and predation than those of macrofauna and have distinct responses to environmental changes (Josefson and Widbom 1988; Castel et al. 1989; Giere 2009). Among meiofaunal communities, free-living nematodes usually constitute the most abundant taxa, albeit seagrass studies of meiofauna have primarily focused on epifauna, i.e., harpacticoid copepods. Nematode assemblages shift consistently with ambient sediments, and they are considered an ecological indicator (Bongers and <b>Ferris</b> <b>1999).</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{growing number}} of firms are expecting more of their profits {{to be derived from}} {{international}} sales (Topol and Sherman, 1994). But moving into foreign markets does not necessarily guarantee greater profitability. In fact it may guarantee more headaches for marketing managers (Singhapakdi,Rawwas, Marta and Ahmed, 1999). It is difficult for marketing managers to satisfy dissimilar local customers needs, which could result in a lower level of satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is one measure of evaluating the performance of the multinational corporation. Satisfied customers tend to be loyal patrons who also encourage other potential customers to do business with the firm, which leads to better performance (Fisher, Garrett, Arnold and <b>Ferris</b> <b>1999).</b> The extent to which the business firm is able to satisfy its customers is an indication of its general health and prospects for the future, because it has a direct impact on the primary source of future revenue streams for most companies (Fornell 1992). Customer satisfaction is also less sensitive to seasonal fluctuations, changes in costs or changes in accounting practices and reduces price elasticity (Kotler 1988). In the face of slow growth and highly growth and highly competitive markets, customer retention is critical. (Fornell 1992). One way t...|$|E
30|$|Written {{corrective}} feedback (WCF), {{one of the}} most debated issues, is heavily researched in second language (L 2) writing literature. On the one hand, Truscott (1996, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2010) has openly questioned the effectiveness of WCF in L 2 writing. He argues that WCF should have no place in L 2 writing classes. In response to Truscott, Ferris and other researchers (e.g., Bitchener 2008, 2012 a, 2012 b; Chandler 2003; <b>Ferris</b> 1995, 1997, <b>1999,</b> 2002, 2003, 2004, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2015) have provided evidence for the positive effect of WCF on improving L 2 writing.|$|R
40|$|HRM {{theories}} perceive {{organisational commitment}} {{as a useful}} instrument for an organisation to retain employees. However, from various perspectives, the usefulness of organisational commitment has been questioned. Several studies show that, {{in the case of}} the professionals, the perceived positive effects of organisational commitment on intention to stay may not occur (Abbot, 1988; Aranya and <b>Ferris,</b> 1984; Schomaker, <b>1999).</b> Other studies question whether organisational commitment is still relevant at all. Employment relationships are said to be changing due to the rise of post-Fordist organizations (Baruch, 1998; Kunda and Van Maanen, 1999; Thijssen, 2001) and the ‘free agent’ (De Korte en Bolweg, 1994; Hall, 1996). Finally, it is assumed that identity constructions, and the commitments that result from these constructions, are more layered and dynamic than is assumed in the commitment model. Authors such as Lash and Urry (1994) and Scase and Davis (2000) perceive advertising agencies to be an example of future organisations. The special interest in the ties that bind creative professionals – designers, art directors and copywriters – stems from the fact that, as the creators of the creative output, they are valuable resources for the agencies. The aim of this study is to gain insights into the dynamics and complexities of identity constructions by creative professionals in advertising agencies, and through this to obtain a better insight in the generalizability of the assumptions in the three-component model of commitment (Meyer and Allen, 1997; Meyer and Herscovitch, 2001; Meyer et al, 2002). The research adopts a relational perspective on identity construction (Giddens, 1991; Gergen, 1991, 1999; Hall, 1996). Two case studies were held in a design studio and an advertising agency. Based on narrative interviews, the book shows that indeed the creative professional represents the ‘free agent’. However, their characteristics might better be explained by long-standing professional ideals than by changes in contemporary society. Autonomy or ‘creative freedom’ is as an important characteristic of the identity of the creative professional. During their professional career, the creative professionals engage three main discourses which express variations in the identity of the creative professional. The creative professionals give their own meaning to these discourses. Three idealised types of creative professional identities are distinguished: the Creative Genius, the Self-employed and the Organisation Man. In each type a different meaning is given to autonomy, resulting in three career perspectives. The Creative Genius aspires to a career as an independent free artist, the Self-employed to a career as a self-employed applied artist and the Organisation Man to a career as an applied artist inside an organisation. From the provided narratives, a preference for a specific type can be observed but predictions cannot be made about future careers. Creative professionals use several types in their narratives, depending on the situation they are describing. However, the high percentage of self-employed creative professionals in the branch shows that self-employment is the most likely career. The limited possibilities that organisations offer for long-term employment, especially for female creative professionals, reinforce this effect. Analyses shows that in the identity construction of account professionals and support staff the ideal career paths are bound to an organisation. The book shows, by analysis of the survey, that the identity constructions of creative professionals can lead to various commitments, including organisational commitment. Only in case of the creative professionals, professional commitment is correlated to the intention to leave. This outcome questions the generalizability of the positive effects of commitment on the intention to stay. Furthermore, based on the narratives of the creative professionals, the book argues that these commitments are more dynamic and layered than is assumed in the commitment-model and measured in the survey. This further limits the predictive value of commitment for the intention to stay...|$|R
40|$|The {{skill of}} {{writing in a}} first (L 1) or second {{language}} (L 2) is a complex issue, as becoming a proficient writer entails mastering elements of content, style, and organization in addition to surface elements such as grammar, vocabulary, and the actual mechanics of writing. While surface errors are generally of secondary interest in L 1 writing, they have been a focus of L 2 writing research for some time. One important area of research in L 2 writing is that of error/grammar correction, specifically, whether learners actually benefit from the feedback that they receive from instructors and which type of feedback is most effective. Despite the fact that research on this topic has been ongoing for many years, it appears that opinions on this question appear to be as polarized as ever (e. g., the debate between <b>Ferris</b> <b>1999,</b> 2004 and Truscott 1996, 1999). In her recent article, Ferris (2004) articulates the issues that have contributed to this state of affairs. For example, the author reviews {{much of the literature}} on error correction in L 2 and asserts that existing empirical studies are largely incomparable due to differences in subject characteristics (i. e., English as a Second Language [ESL] vs. English as a Foreign Language [EFL] vs. foreign language [FL] students in American colleges), size of samples and treatment groups, duration of studies, types of writing considered, and types of feedback provided to students, among other parameters. Despite these inconsistencies, Ferris highlights several erro...|$|E
40|$|Errors are an {{integral}} part of language learners ’ output. Therefore, language teachers need to be equipped with principles to guide them in their error evaluation (Bartram and Walton 1994, <b>Ferris</b> <b>1999).</b> In addition to a general feedback policy that many teachers adopt, there are other, less obvious factors determining the teachers’ viewpoint on error. Various underlying motives surface, for example, in moderation meetings, where communal decisions are to be taken regarding the severity (and penalization) of the testees ’ linguistic inaccuracies. Diverse opinions voiced at such gatherings reveal significant differences in teachers ’ attitude to error. Why should teachers become ‘irritated ’ (James 1998) by certain errors more than by others? Moreover, why should one teacher consider a particular error as ‘mild’, while another teacher feels that it is ‘very bad’? These were the questions which initiated my interest in teachers ’ attitude to error. The research reported on here focused on two factors potentially affecting teachers ’ error judgment 1 : • the teacher’s native language: is she 2 a native speaker of English (TL), or Hebrew (in my context, the students ’ native language) ? • the teacher’s current professional setting: what proficiency level classes does she teach – lower or higher? Is she employed in an elementary school, high school, or tertiary institution? Initially I will describe the educational context under investigation, and discuss other researchers ’ findings in related research fields. The report of the study and its findings will be followed by suggestions for a teacher development programme.

40|$|Linguistic {{errors are}} {{pervasive}} in second language (L 2) students’ writing. Depending on their gravity, the errors may cause a minor degree of irritation {{to the reader}} or even lead to total communication breakdown. As such, errors {{have always been a}} major concern to both students and teachers, and error correction has also assumed a central position in language teaching. Students generally expect that their errors will be pointed out and dealt with by their teachers. For instance, in a study on students’ attitudes toward corrective feedback (CF) in college-level English writing classes, Leki (1991) surveyed 100 English as a Second Language (ESL) students, asking them such questions as how concerned they were with their written errors, what they thought were the most important features in their writing that the teacher should attend to, and what they looked at when receiving a graded paper from the teacher. The results of the survey indicated that the students believed that good writing should be error-free, and the majority wanted all their written errors to be corrected. For L 2 teachers, providing written CF on student writing has long been an essential practice. In fact, “grammar correction is something of an institution” (Truscott, 1996, p. 327) in L 2 writing courses. Despite the fact that correcting students’ written errors is a time-consuming ordeal, and the endeavor is “fraught with uncertainty about its long-term effectiveness” (<b>Ferris,</b> <b>1999,</b> p. 1), most L 2 teachers have continued to slave over students’ errors in one form or another. As confirmed by a recent study on practitioners’ perspectives, the majority of teachers believe that students need CF and that written CF is overall an effective pedagogical practice (Evans et al., 2010) ...|$|E
30|$|Debates on WCF {{are mainly}} fuelled by Truscott’s (1996) thought-provoking essay. In it, Truscott {{questions}} {{the efficacy of}} error correction as an instructional tool for L 2 writing. The key arguments of Truscott’s original essay (and its follow-ups) were as follows: (1) grammar correction practice goes against SLA theories; (2) existing evidence suggests that WCF has very little potential benefit for student writers; (3) the practical problems faced by teachers and students negate the usefulness of grammar correction; and (4) grammar correction is time consuming for both students and teachers (Truscott 1996, 1999, 2004, 2007). Truscott’s remarks have received strong rebuttals from many researchers. <b>Ferris</b> (<b>1999,</b> 2004) acknowledges that Truscott’s critiques highlight the complexities of WCF activities and the practical issues associated with them. However, he says that Truscott’s dismissal is unfounded since it simply neglects many empirical studies supporting the effectiveness of WCF. Based on comparative experimental studies, other researchers have demonstrated that WCF, if well designed and executed, is able to noticeably improve learners’ performance on certain grammatical structures (e.g., Bitchener 2008; Bitchener and Knoch 2010; Chandler 2003; Ellis et al. 2008; Hartshorn et al. 2010; Liu 2008; Nassaji 2011; Sheen 2007; Shintani et al. 2014; van Beuningen et al. 2012). A few recent examples of this research strand and their findings are as follows. Shintani et al. (2014) explored the effect of direct and metalinguistic feedback and found a stronger effect for the former than the latter. Bitchener (2008) reported that the students who received direct corrective feedback with written and oral meta-linguistic feedback, along with the group that received direct corrective feedback with no meta-linguistic feedback, outperformed the control group who did not receive any feedback whatsoever. Similarly, Abualsha’r and AbuSeileek (2014) found that the students who received corrective feedback delivered via computer about error types while writing essays performed significantly better {{than those who did}} not receive any corrective feedback whatsoever. Mawlawi Diab (2015) found that students receiving direct error correction and metalinguistic feedback outperformed students receiving only metalinguistic feedback. For example, the students who received direct error correction made fewer pronoun and lexical errors.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of teacher written feedback {{has been a}} subject of debate in second language writing for decades. The most basic debate in this area among ESL writing researchers is whether teacher written feedback in various forms has any positive effects on student writing revisions. Among other researchers, Ferris, Lee, Ene & Upton and Stevenson & Phakiti argued that while the {{effectiveness of}} error feedback in the traditional paper-and-pen form (<b>Ferris,</b> <b>1999,</b> 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and Lee, 2008 a, 2008 b), computer-facilitated form (Ene & Upton, 2014) or computer-generated form (Stevenson & Phakiti, 2013) was not conclusive, more research {{should be done to}} explore in what ways error feedback can be improved. Indeed, the heterogeneity of these studies characterized by different focus, research designs, institutional and instructional contexts, and participant backgrounds, alongside some methodological flaws and misinterpretation of findings identified in my critical review has possibly undermined the validity and reliability of the studies, giving rise to these mixed results for both paper-and-pen feedback and computer-based feedback. As such, the causality between different forms of feedback treatment and their outcomes of error reduction is questioned. With the primary interest in improving the effectiveness of teacher written feedback in error correction, ‘Mark My Words’ (‘MMWs’), the interactive-based electronic feedback system, was designed in such a way to accommodate individual learners’ language needs and to be more responsive to various error types. This study focused on examining on the effectiveness of ‘Mark My Words’ (‘MMWs’), as a kind of computer-facilitated feedback (i. e. electronic feedback), in improving students’ error reduction in their writing revisions, under a controlled condition. The mixed methods approach was adopted, namely the ‘error count’ method and ‘questionnaire’, in this study. The participants were 62 second-year engineering students enrolled in an English for Specific Purposes course in a Hong Kong University. Efforts were made to avoid the impact of extraneous variables on the validity and reliability of the research outcomes under such controlled condition. The positive results of this study can contribute some sort of concrete evidence to the growing body of literature of the ‘effectiveness of teacher written feedback’ and ‘second language writing’, thus clarifying some mixed results of the previous research. ...|$|E
