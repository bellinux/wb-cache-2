Garnets in kyanite-bearing samples are rich in grossular, whereas they are predominantly pyrope-almandines in the bimineralic (kyanite-free) samples. The kyanite eclogite from the P 3 pipe is more Mg-rich than those from KL 2 pipe. Equilibration temperatures indicate derivation from 4. 5 to 5. 3 GPa and 1060 to 1220 °C for the KL 2 samples and 3. 6 GPa, 918 °C for the P 3 sample. Garnet rare earth element patterns show two characteristic types, one with relatively low and flat <b>heavy</b> <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> patterns: Wajrakarur Group 1 and a second with lower light to <b>heavy</b> <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> ratios: Wajrakarur Group 2. Most samples in Wajrakarur Group 1 show pronounced positive Eu anomalies in garnet and positive Eu and Sr anomalies in the reconstructed whole rock trace element patterns; these are among the strongest anomalies in eclogite xenoliths worldwide. In contrast, Wajrakarur Group 2 samples show only subtle positive Eu anomalies. Oxygen isotopic ratios of garnets range between + 5. 3 ‰ and + 7. 8 ‰ δ¹⁸O. This range extends significantly beyond the range for unchanged mantle. Similar to many other eclogite suites worldwide, the Wajrakarur Group 1 and Group 2 eclogite suites shows evidence for an origin as crustal gabbroic material, likely once part of the oceanic crust, which was subducted and imbricated under the Eastern Dharwar craton. Their surface origin therefore lends support to geodynamic models that favor amalgamation of the Dharwar craton by subduction. 24 page(s...|$|E

These chemically inert 4 f electrons set up localized magnetic moments, which are coupled via an indirect exchange interaction involving the conduction electrons. This leads to the formation {{of a wide variety of}} magnetic structures, the periodicities of which are often incommensurate with the underlying crystal lattice(2). Such incommensurate ordering is associated with a 'webbed' topology(3, 4) of the momentum space surface separating the occupied and unoccupied electron states (the Fermi surface). The shape of this surface - and hence the magnetic structure - for the <b>heavy</b> <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> is known to depend on the ratio of the interplanar spacing c and the interatomic, intraplanar spacing a of the h. c. p. lattice(5).

In addition to verifying the importance of the c/a ratio, we find that the atomic unit cell volume plays a separate, distinct role in determining the magnetic properties: we show that the trend from ferromagnetism to incommensurate ordering as atomic number increases is connected to the concomitant decrease in unit cell volume. This volume decrease occurs because of the so-called lanthanide contraction(6), where the addition of electrons to the poorly shielding 4 f orbitals leads to an increase in effective nuclear charge and, correspondingly, a decrease in ionic radii. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMajor element {{and rare}} earth element (REE) {{investigations}} of 2010 Merapi eruption are newly reported. Several samples from Merapi summit were analyzed. SiO 2 and K 2 O contents range from 55. 2 to 60. 3 wt% and 1. 99 to 2. 99 wt%, respectively. The increase in silica and potassium contents newly obtained in this study indicates the diffe rence of magma composition compare to previous geochemical data. Chondrite normalized REE is characterized by enrichment of light {{rare earth element}} (LREE) and slightly depleted in <b>heavy</b> <b>Rare</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Element</b> (HREE). This characteristic of the pattern commonly occurs in subduction bearing volcanic rocks with no Eu anomaly. Chondrite normalized La/Yb ratio ranges from 6. 3 to 7. 6 showing high potassium content. Increasing volatile components indicates degassing and subsequent saturation of the volatiles which may trigger such eruption. Positive correlation between La/Yb and SiO 2 shows that garnet is rarely major fractionating phase, while negative correlation between Dy/Yb and SiO 2 indicates amphibole fractionation. Therefore, amphibole fractionation with high concentration of water may lead fluid saturation which may trigger strong explosive eruptions...|$|E
40|$|Eclogite {{xenolith}} varieties at Kaalvallei include accessory-free bimineralic xenoliths, diamond-bearing eclogite, corundum-bearing eclogite, garnet-websterite, alkremite and spinel-bearing eclogite. The xenoliths can be accurately {{classified into}} previously defined Group I and Group II varieties on both petrographic and geochemical prin-ciples. Kaalvallei Group I eclogites (including diamond-bearing eclogite) {{are considered to}} derive from a heterogeneous protolith. Eclogite genesis might have been by residue formation associated with the dehydration and partial melting of a protolith consisting of variably mixed, subducted ocean floor basalt and sediment. Kaalvallei Group II eclogite xenoliths {{are likely to have}} formed through crystallization of small-volume melts within conduits in old, enriched subcontinental lithosphere. Kaalvallei websterite xeno-liths might be petrogenetically related to Group II xenoliths. Isotopic data for Kaalvallei corundum-bearing eclogite and alkremite xenoliths do not provide constraints on petrogenesis. Spinel-bearing eclogite xenoliths are ultradepleted in virtually all trace elements, with very low light rare earth element contents, relatively high <b>heavy</b> <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> concentrations, extreme 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0915) and extreme 143 Nd/ 144 Nd (0517) isotopic compositions. These xeno-liths are considered to be the residues of a partial melting event...|$|E
40|$|Sitting {{atop the}} nearly {{stagnant}} Antarctic plate (ca. 6. 46 mm/yr), the Crozet archipelago midway between Madagascar and Antarctica constitutes {{a region of}} unusually shallow (1543 - 1756 m below sea level) and thickened oceanic crust (10 - 16. 5 km), high geoid height, and deep low-velocity zone, which may reflect the surface expression of a mantle plume. Here, we present new major and trace element data for Quaternary sub-aerial alkali basalts from East Island, the easterly and oldest island (ca. 9 Ma) of the Crozet archipelago. Crystallization at uppermost mantle depth and phenocryst accumulation have strongly affected their parental magma compositions. Their trace element patterns show a large negative K anomaly relative to Ta-La, moderate depletions in Rb and Ba with respect to Th-U, and <b>heavy</b> <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>element</b> (HREE) depletions relative to light REE. These characteristics allow limits to be placed upon the composition and mineralogy of their mantle source. The average trace element spectrum of East Island basalts can be matched by melting of about 2...|$|E

40|$|This {{preliminary}} study {{was carried out}} on the Shales of the Cenomanian-Turonian sedimentary sequence representing the Gongila Formation of the Gongola Basin as exposed in the Ashaka Cement quarry in Gombe, northeastern Nigeria. A total of ten shale samples were collected from the outcropping sections, out of which five representative samples were subjected to instrumental Neutron Activation Analytical (INAA) methods. The results of {{the analysis of the}} shale samples shows the average composition values; La (57),Ce (89. 4), Nd (34), Sm (6. 94), Eu (1. 52),Tb (0. 66),Lu (0. 42). This result however show slightly high LREE (light <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements)</b> enrichment and relatively low HREE (<b>heavy</b> <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements)</b> when compared to the Post-Achean Australian Standard (PAAS). The provenance of the Shales thus may be ascribed a granitic source rock with a high proportion of plagioclase feldspars...|$|R
40|$|Tholeiitic basalts from DSDP Holes 417 A and 417 D {{consist of}} two textural types: phyric and subophitic. Their major element and {{transition}} metal spectra are {{a consequence of}} the low-pressure fractionation of olivine prior to emplacement, and plagioclase accumulation during or after emplacement. Reverse, normal, and oscillatory zoning of the plagioclase phenocrysts within the same sample suggests magma mixing. Incompatible element abundances suggest a chemically and mineralogi-cally homogeneous source region depleted in the light <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> (LREE) relative to the <b>heavy</b> <b>rare</b> <b>earth</b> <b>elements</b> (HREE). Alteration of some samples has significantly affected the abundances of Siθ 2, MgO, K 2 O, H 2 O, and Fe 2 θ 3.
