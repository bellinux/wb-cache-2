25|$|One of {{the twin}} {{elements}} of natural justice is the rule against bias or nemo iudex in causa sua, which means {{that no one should}} be a judge <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> cause. The rule ensures that decision-makers will not be biased or prejudiced in a way that precludes a genuine and fair consideration of the arguments or evidence presented by the parties. Bias may be actual, imputed or apparent.|$|E
25|$|The ALUPEC is a {{phonetic writing}} {{system based on}} the Latin script and states only which letters {{should be used to}} {{represent}} each sound. The system does not establish rules for spelling (orthography). For that reason, Cape Verdean creole writing is not standardized; the same word or the same sentence may appear written in different ways. Cape Verdeans, then, write idiosyncratically — that is, each person writes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> dialect, sociolect, and idiolect.|$|E

25|$|During the Babylonian captivity (586–537BCE) the Men of the Great Assembly formalized and {{standardized}} {{the language of}} the Jewish prayers. Prior to that people prayed as they saw fit, with each individual praying <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> way, and there were no standard prayers that were recited. Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai, one of the leaders {{at the end of the}} Second Temple era, promulgated the idea of creating individual houses of worship in whatever locale Jews found themselves. This contributed to the continuity of the Jewish people by maintaining a unique identity and a portable way of worship despite the destruction of the Temple, according to many historians.|$|E
25|$|George Ramos of the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that many Cypress Park residents were {{angered by the}} negative portrayal of their community in the media; the perceived {{lack of attention to}} gang issues from the municipal government and their council member, Mike Hernandez; and the Los Angeles Times for posting large images of Stephanie Kuhen and her brother {{on the front page of}} the newspaper, stating that the media does not do this with ethnic minority children. Ramos said that the editor of the newspaper had asked for the images of the children to be posted before learning that they were white. Ramos also stated that many Cypress Park residents believed that if one is not from Cypress Park, one should be concerned with crime <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> neighborhood rather than in Cypress Park.|$|E
25|$|The High Court {{may also}} {{exercise}} powers of revision {{in respect of}} criminal proceedings and matters in subordinate courts. On calling for and examining the records of criminal proceedings or otherwise, the Court may direct a magistrate to make further inquiries into any complaints of offences that have been dismissed, or into the case of any accused {{person who has been}} discharged. The Court may also exercise powers that it exercises upon an appeal, such as reversing a conviction or altering a sentence, except that the Court is not authorized to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction. As in civil cases, when the Court is exercising its powers of revision it is up to it {{to decide whether or not}} to hear submissions from any party, and no party can claim a right to be heard. However, no order that prejudices an accused shall be made unless he or she has had an opportunity of being heard either personally or by advocate <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> defence. When a case has been revised by the High Court, it will certify its decision or order to the trial court, which may then make further orders that conform to the certified decision.|$|E

As social classes lack distinct boundaries the average American may have a status {{in the area where}} the lower middle and upper working class overlap. Overall the average American, age 25 or older, made roughly $32,000 per year, does not have a college degree, has been, is, or will be married as well as divorced at least once during his or her lifetime, lives <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> home in a suburban setting, and holds a white-collar office job.|$|E
500|$|The Merwedeplein apartment, {{where the}} Frank family lived from 1933 until 1942, {{remained}} privately owned until the 2000s. After becoming {{the focus of}} a television documentary, the building—in a serious state of disrepair—was purchased by a Dutch housing corporation. Aided by photographs taken by the Frank family and descriptions in letters written by Anne Frank, it was restored to its 1930s appearance. Teresien da Silva of the Anne Frank House and Frank's cousin, Bernhard [...] "Buddy" [...] Elias, contributed to the restoration project. It opened in 2005. Each year, a writer who is unable to write freely <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> country is selected for a year-long tenancy, during which they reside and write in the apartment. The first writer selected was the Algerian novelist and poet El-Mahdi Acherchour.|$|E
500|$|The {{median value}} of a housing unit in the US was $167,500 in 2005 with the median {{mortgage}} payment being clocked at $1,295. The average size of a household was 2.5 persons with almost all housing units, 97%, having 1 or fewer occupants per room. However, the term [...] "room" [...] does not exclusively refer to bedrooms, but includes the kitchen, dining room, family room, bath rooms and any other rooms a house might have. While 85% of American homes had 3 or fewer bedrooms the median number of total rooms per housing units was 5.3 in 2005. Considering these statistics one can conclude that the average American resides <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> home, pays roughly $1,000 per month in mortgage payments for a three or less bedroom house {{with no more than}} one occupant per room.|$|E

500|$|The Kampung Boy was {{successful}} {{due to its}} realistic presentation of Malaysia's cultural past. [...] Many Malaysians {{who grew up in}} the 1960s or earlier fondly remembered the laidback lives they had in the kampung upon reading the book. [...] Stevenson said that The Kampung Boys portrayal of the past would resonate with everyone's fondness for a happy experience <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> past. [...] Those unfamiliar with the ways of the kampung could relate to the [...] "universal themes of childhood, adolescence, and first-love". [...] According to Stevenson, the illustrations help to clarify any unfamiliar terms the reader might face and the narrative force of Lat's story depends more on the protagonist's experiences than on the details. [...] The book's appeal to both children and adults lies in Lat's success in recapturing the innocence of childhood.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{determined}} {{early on}} {{that the role of}} Sonny was crucial to the outcome of the picture, and they selected Dev Patel, who at the time was still revelling in the success of Slumdog Millionaire. Dench described Patel as a [...] "born comedian", and Madden considered him to be a [...] "comic natural—a sort of Jacques Tati figure, with amazing physical presence and fantastic instincts". Patel had personal experience of watching the elderly through his mother who had been a carer, and he was [...] "enticed by how vivid these characters are, by their sarcasm and their wisdom", confessing that he [...] "fell in love with the script because every character shines <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> different way and you believe in each of them." [...] Lilette Dubey was cast as Sonny's mother, and English-language debutante Tina Desai portrayed Sunaina, Sonny's call-centre-operator girlfriend.|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, at common law, natural {{justice is}} taken to be a {{procedural}} concept that embodies the twin pillars of audi alteram partem (hear the other party) and nemo iudex in causa sua (no one should be a judge <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> cause). In the United States, due process has both procedural and substantive components. Substantive due process involves the courts assessing the reasonableness of executive actions and legislation using rational basis review if a fundamental right is not implicated and strict scrutiny if it is. The question thus arises whether substantive fundamental rules of natural justice may be developed by local courts. However, a line of Malaysian cases has expressed {{the view that the}} concept of substantive due process is not applicable to Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). There is also academic commentary that rejects the notion of [...] "substantive natural justice", arguing that it is too vague and leads to problems in application. Another argument against substantive natural justice is the fear that it may become an avenue for judges to invalidate laws {{on the basis of their}} own subjective opinions, leading to unbounded judicial activism.|$|E

500|$|Mary Dyer's time in England {{lasted for}} over five years, and during her stay {{she had become}} deeply taken by the Quaker {{religion}} established by George Fox around 1647. [...] Formally known as the Society of Friends, the Quakers {{did not believe in}} baptism, formal prayer and the Lord's Supper, nor did they believe in an ordained ministry. [...] Each member was a minister <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> right, women were essentially treated as men in matters of spirituality, and they relied on an [...] "Inner Light of Christ" [...] as their source of spiritual inspiration. [...] In addition to denouncing the clergy, and refusing to support it with their tithes, they also claimed liberty of conscience as an inalienable right and demanded {{the separation of church and}} state. [...] Their worship consisted of silent meditation, though those moved by the Spirit would at times make public exhortations. [...] They minimized the customs of bowing or men removing their hats, they would not take an oath, and they would not fight in wars. [...] The Puritans in Massachusetts viewed Quakers as being among the most reprehensible of heretics, and they enacted several laws against them.|$|E
500|$|Further, {{under the}} U.S. federal tax laws, even if labor were {{considered}} [...] "property" [...] the gain or income from [...] "labor property" [...] would {{be defined as}} the excess of the amount realized (for example, the money received) by the taxpayer over the amount of the taxpayer's [...] "adjusted basis" [...] in the [...] "property" [...] (see [...] ). Since the taxpayer can have only a zero [...] "basis" [...] amount <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> labor [...] the personal living expenses incurred to generate labor being both non-capitalizable and, under , non-deductible [...] the [...] "gain" [...] would thus be equal to the amount of compensation received by the taxpayer. Compare Carter v. Commissioner, where the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated: [...] "The assertion that proceeds received for personal services cannot be given a 'zero-basis for the purpose of the assessment of taxation,' is frivolous. This is a variation of the 'wages are not income' theme, which has been rejected repeatedly by this court." [...] See also Reading v. Commissioner (taxpayer's argument [...] that gain from labor of self-employed individual cannot be determined until the [...] "cost of doing labor" [...] has been subtracted from the amount received [...] was rejected; validity of , disallowing deductions for personal living expenses, was upheld). See also Burnett v. Commissioner (taxpayer's argument [...] that wages represent an equal exchange of property and, therefore, are not taxable income [...] was rejected). See also In re Myrland (ruling that a taxpayer is not entitled to deduct the value of his labor from his income in calculating his taxes).|$|E
