25|$|Following the {{building}} of the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, London for the 2012 Summer Olympics West Ham United put forward proposals which would see the club leave their Boleyn <b>Ground</b> <b>location</b> and relocate to Stratford. On 22 March 2013, West Ham secured a 99-year lease deal, with the stadium planned to be used as their home ground from the 2016–2017 season. West Ham United supporters backed these proposals with 85% in favour of a move in a poll conducted by YouGov, in May 2013.|$|E

30|$|Distance-dependent individual-tree {{models have}} {{commonly}} {{been found to}} add little predictive power to that of distance-independent ones.

50|$|However, the <b>ground's</b> <b>location</b> some {{distance}} from the city centre made it unpopular with supporters, and in 1923 the club relocated to Holiday Park, taking with them the wooden stand.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a model theory for figure <b>ground</b> <b>locations</b> is proposed. Figure <b>ground</b> <b>locations</b> are n-tuples of predicates about {{relations}} between regional individuals {{and a set}} of regional individuals forming a regional partition of the plane. This language is based on the RCC-theory which is extended by a number of definitions and axioms constraining the models to the set of regular closed sets in a 2 -dimensional T 4 topological space. In this paper we give two models of figure ground locations: One model in point set topology referring to equivalence classes of regular closed sets. One graph theoretical model which is a set of directed and edgevalued versions of the non-directed non-labeled dual graph of the planar graph representing the regional partition. Both models are shown to be isormorphic with respect to a set of union and intersection operations. 1.

50|$|While RAF Scampton, {{where the}} real raid launched, was used for some scenes, the {{principal}} airfield used for <b>ground</b> <b>location</b> shooting was RAF Hemswell, {{a few miles north}} and still an operational RAF station at the time of filming. Guy Gibson had been based at Hemswell in his final posting and the airfield had been an operational Avro Lancaster base during the war. At the time filming took place it was then home to No. 109 Squadron and No. 139 Squadron RAF, which were both operating English Electric Canberras on electronic countermeasures and nuclear air sampling missions over hydrogen bomb test sites in the Pacific and Australia. However, part of the RAF's fleet of ageing Avro Lincolns had been mothballed at Hemswell prior to being broken up and several of these static aircraft appeared in background shots during filming, doubling for additional No 617 Squadron Lancasters. The station headquarters building still stands on what is now an industrial estate and is named Gibson House. The four wartime hangars also still stand, little changed in external appearance since the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{stadium is}} divided into five all-seater stands, the JCT600 Stand, the Kop, the Midland Road Stand, the North West Corner and the TL Dallas Stand. All five stands are covered except for {{a small part of}} the main stand, and all but the Midland Road Stand being two-tiered. Most of the stands are {{cantilever}} structures, and because of the <b>ground's</b> <b>location</b> on the hillside, the Midland Road Stand overhangs the road.|$|R
40|$|There has {{recently}} been a resurgence {{of interest in the}} use of beamed power to support space exploration activities.

Issues involved in providing photovoltaic receivers for such applications are discussed...|$|R

There exists a White Conduit Street in this area.|$|R
