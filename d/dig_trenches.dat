5|$|At around 1:30a.m. on Monday, 10 February 1930, {{approximately}} 50 troops {{belonging to}} the Second Battalion of the Fourth Regiment of Tonkinese Rifles (Régiment de Tirailleurs Tonkinois), stationed at Yên Bái, reinforced by around 60 civilian members of the VNQDĐ, attacked their 29 French officers and warrant officers. The plan was for the rebels to split into three groups. One group was to infiltrate the infantry barracks, kill French NCOs in their beds and raise support amongst the Vietnamese troops; a second, which was to include the external VNQDD members, was to fight {{its way into the}} post headquarters, while the third group would enter the officers' quarters. The longer term goal was to capture the barracks, secure the city, set up anti-aircraft guns in the hills and create a strong point around the railway station. They were to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> around it to defend it from incoming colonial forces.|$|E
5|$|Washington and {{the army}} were {{surrounded}} on Brooklyn Heights with the East River to their backs. As the day went on, the British began to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches,</b> slowly coming closer to the American defenses. By doing this, the British {{would not have to}} cross over open ground to assault the American defenses as they did in Boston the year before. Despite this perilous situation, Washington ordered 1,200 more men from Manhattan to Brooklyn on August 28. The men that came over were two Pennsylvania regiments and Colonel John Glover's regiment from Marblehead, Massachusetts. In command of the Pennsylvanian troops was Thomas Mifflin who, after arriving, volunteered to inspect the outer defenses and report back to Washington. In these outer defenses, small skirmishes were still taking place. On the afternoon of August 28, it began to rain and Washington had his cannons bombard the British well into the night.|$|E

25|$|Brendel {{was born}} in Wiesenberg, Czechoslovakia (now Loučná nad Desnou, Czech Republic) to a non-musical family. They moved to Zagreb, Yugoslavia (now Croatia), when Brendel was six where he began piano lessons with Sofija Deželić. He later moved to Graz, Austria, and studied piano with Ludovica von Kaan at the Graz Conservatory and {{composition}} with Artur Michel. Towards the end of World War II, the 14-year-old Brendel {{was sent back to}} Yugoslavia to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shortly before midnight, the Texians attacked. During {{the incessant}} firing that followed, Mexican troops shot out the Brazorias mooring lines. The ship ran aground on the bank. Texians soon ran low on {{ammunition}} for the cannon, {{but as the}} ship was fairly close to the fort, riflemen continued to fire. Mexican troops charged the schooner but were driven back. Austin's men discovered that their portable palisades were ineffective against Mexican marksmen; after the battle one shield alone had 130holes. To protect themselves, Austin's men took time to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> in the sand.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Ames {{has played}} a support role {{in a number of}} missions, most notably the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover missions, where the Ames Intelligent Robotics Laboratory played a key role. NASA Ames was a partner on the Mars Phoenix, a Mars Scout Program mission to send a high-latitude lander to Mars, {{deployed}} a robotic arm to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> up to 1.6 feet (one half meter) into the layers of water ice and analyzing the soil composition. Ames is also a partner on the Mars Science Laboratory, a next generation Mars rover to explore for signs of organics and complex molecules.|$|E

25|$|The 8th Hussars {{entered the}} {{trenches}} on the Western Front {{for the first}} time on 9 December 1914, not having arrived in time to take any part in the Retreat from Mons. The first action that the 8th encountered was in December 1914 at the Battle of Givenchy. The majority of their time was spent sending large parties forward to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> and this continued for the whole of the war. In May 1915, they took part in the Second battle of Ypres where the Germans first used chlorine gas. In September 1915 the 8th Hussars transferred to the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division.|$|E
25|$|The Lines {{played an}} active role in support of the Spanish {{campaign}} during the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779–83). The first hostile shot of the siege was fired by one of Fort St. Barbara's guns against a British ship in the Bay of Gibraltar on 11 July 1779. The Spanish subsequently began to strengthen the Lines and <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> leading out from them across the isthmus towards the Rock. A number of traverses were built within the two forts at either end to protect them from British cannon fire being directed against them from the batteries on the Rock.|$|E
25|$|Together {{with his}} friend Zeth Höglund, Ture Nerman {{represented}} the Swedish-Norwegian members of the Zimmerwald Conference. It united the remaining international socialist anti-war movement, whose more prominent leaders were Vladimir Lenin, Grigory Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky from Russia, Robert Grimm from Switzerland, and Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht from Germany. Those two could not participate, but sent their greetings and support. Luxemburg was in jail for anti-war propaganda, while Liebknecht had been mobilized by the German military to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> on the frontline. Returning to Sweden, Zeth Höglund was also sentenced to jail for his activities in the international anti-war movement, even though Sweden didn’t participate in the World War.|$|E

25|$|According to reports, Wahdat {{soldiers}} {{as well as}} male Hazara citizens were being arrested and executed mostly by Ittihad forces. Unarmed civilians as well were being killed, with men in particular being targeted. Other men were abducted and taken {{to the base of}} Sayyaf's Ittihad in Paghman and made to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> and bury the dead. Those who survived stated they saw on the bodies evidence of torture and mutilations. Human Rights Watch suggests that 70-80 people were killed in the streets fighting, while 700-750 people disappeared. It states that between 80-200 people were later released after ransoms were paid to Sayyaf's Ittihad commanders.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecutors}} {{presented a}} case that indicated Gacy was sane and fully in control of his actions. To support this contention, they produced several witnesses to testify to the premeditation of Gacy's actions and the efforts he went {{to in order to}} escape detection. Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Two witnesses who testified were PDM employees, who confessed Gacy had made them <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> in his crawl space. One of these employees, David Cram, testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him to dig a drainage trench.|$|E
25|$|Mohd Shah Ahmad related {{during the}} trial that over the four days, the {{security}} forces personnel were abused and tortured. They were made to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> {{along the sides of}} Bukit Jenalik to serve as a defence {{in the event of an}} attack on the camp. At night they were tied to a durian tree. It was that Mohd Shah Ahmad and Sanghadevan buried Trooper Matthews in one of these trenches. Trooper Matthews was apprehended by Jemari Jusoh and when Amin realised the identity of Trooper Matthews, Amin tortured Matthews by shooting his leg. Amin then ordered the Jemari Jusoh to shoot Trooper Matthews in cold blood.|$|E

25|$|The First World War {{introduced}} killing {{on such a}} {{mass scale}} that few nations were prepared to cope with it. Millions of bodies were never recovered, or were recovered long after any identification could be made. Hundreds of thousands of bodies were buried on the battlefield where they lay. It was often impossible to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> without unearthing remains, and artillery barrages often uncovered bodies and flung the disintegrating corpses into the air. Many bodies were buried in French municipal cemeteries, but these rapidly filled to capacity. Due to the costs and sheer number of remains involved, Australia, Canada, India, Newfoundland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom barred repatriation of remains.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, former Tel Kabri Expedition excavator, Assaf Yasur-Landau, and geophysicist, Yitzhach Makovsky, both then of Tel Aviv University, {{conducted}} an investigation {{to see if}} Kempinski and Niemeier had underestimated {{the size of the}} palace at Tel Kabri. They conducted electric resistivity and magnetometric soundings in an attempt to map out the architectural features under the soil without having to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches.</b> Their findings showed that the palace was indeed larger than previously thought. With these results, Yasur-Landau approached his former Megiddo Expedition colleague, Prof. Eric H. Cline of The George Washington University, the following year and asked whether he would like to co-direct new excavations at Tel Kabri. After devoting a year to getting the necessary funding and permits for excavation, the two were able to begin work on the site in the summer of 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} {{charges were}} related to the activities of Einsatzgruppe D in the Crimea. The ninth charge accused Manstein of twenty-three counts of authorising the execution of Jews and other Soviet citizens. The tenth charge accused him of failing to protect the lives of the civilians in the area. The eleventh charge claimed seventeen counts of soldiers in units commanded by Manstein handing over civilians to the Einsatzgruppe, while knowing that to do so would mean their deaths. The twelfth charge accused Manstein of seven counts of authorising his troops to kill Jewish civilians in the Crimea. The thirteenth charge accused Manstein of authorising the killing of civilians for offences which they did not commit. The fourteenth charge accused Manstein of six counts of issuing orders to execute civilians without trial; for merely being suspects; and for having committed offences that did not warrant the death penalty. The fifteenth charge was that Soviet citizens, in violation of the Hague Convention, had been compelled to build defensive positions and <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> in combat areas. This charge included twenty-five counts. The sixteenth charge accused him of fourteen counts of ordering the deportation of civilians as slave labourers. The final charge accused Manstein of thirteen counts of issuing scorched earth orders while in retreat, while ordering the deportation of the civilians in the affected areas.|$|E

500|$|The 10th Welsh {{moved up}} to cover {{the gap between the}} five battalions already engaged and the 13th RWF were {{deployed}} to clear the German position in front of their sister battalions; divisional engineers arrived to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> and lay wire. During the afternoon, the 10th SWB and 17th RWF were committed to the wood. At 16:00, another attack began and met with little resistance. The 10th SWB captured the eastern stretches of the wood and inflicted many casualties on the Germans. The 15th Welsh, along with the 15th and 17th RWF, fought north through the wood and made it to within [...] of the northern edge when they were thrown back by German fire. A further attack during the evening was called off and the troops were pulled back up to [...] and ordered to dig in for the night.|$|E
500|$|In the {{expectation}} of a siege, the castle garrison was increased to around 800 soldiers; the avenue of trees outside the castle gates were cut down, and neighbouring buildings destroyed to avoid them being used by Parliamentary forces. Large amounts of food were brought in to support the growing castle community, which also included {{a number of the}} wider Herbert family and other regional Royalist leaders who had sought shelter there. The first Parliamentary army arrived in early June, under the command of Colonel Morgan and Sir Trevor Williams. After several calls for the castle to surrender, a siege ensued, lasting through the summer months. In August, additional Parliamentary forces under General Fairfax arrived, and calls for the castle to surrender were renewed. Fairfax's men began to <b>dig</b> <b>trenches</b> towards the castle, and used these to move mortars forward, probably including the famous [...] "Roaring Meg", bringing the interior of the castle into artillery range. Facing a hopeless situation, the Marquess surrendered the castle on 19 August on relatively generous terms for the garrison. The Marquess himself was arrested and sent to Windsor Castle, where he died shortly afterwards. Informed shortly before his death that Parliament had granted his request to be buried in the family vault at Windsor, the Marquess remarked; [...] "Why then I shall have a better castle when I am dead, than they took from me when alive." ...|$|E
