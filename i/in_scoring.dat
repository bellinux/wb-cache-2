Early in the season, Wade became the second player in NBA history to tally at least 40 points, 10 assists and five blocked shots in a game since Alvan Adams did so in the 1976–77 season.

30|$|The {{inconclusive}} results {{appeared at}} both student and school level. At the student level, attitudes towards learning outcomes {{was the only}} common variable that predicted increased scores for all the country models. Mathematics self-efficacy predicted increased <b>scores</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia and Malaysia, but no {{significant increase in the}} Thai model. Instrumental motivation predicted increased <b>scores</b> <b>in</b> Malaysia, but was not significant in the Indonesian and Thai models. Meanwhile, mathematics behaviour predicted decreased <b>scores</b> <b>in</b> the Indonesian and Malaysian models only. On the other hand, attitudes towards learning activities predicted decreased <b>scores</b> <b>in</b> the Indonesian and Thai models only. Self-responsibility in failing mathematics is only significant in the Thai model with predicted decrease <b>in</b> <b>scores.</b> Mathematics self-concept predicted a decrease <b>in</b> <b>scores</b> for the Indonesian model only. At the school level, the Indonesian model has the highest number of significant predictors of mathematics performance. School average of sense of belonging, openness to problem-solving, and mathematics self-efficacy predicted increase <b>in</b> <b>scores,</b> whereas school average mathematics behaviour, mathematics self-concept, and intrinsic motivation predicted decrease <b>in</b> <b>scores.</b> Meanwhile, school average attitudes towards learning activities and openness to problem-solving were the only two school-level variables with a predicted increase <b>in</b> <b>scores</b> <b>in</b> the Thai model. However, school average mathematics interest, mathematics behaviour, and attitudes towards learning outcomes were the only three significant school-level variables with predicted decreases <b>in</b> <b>scores</b> for the Malaysian model. The findings also revealed that Malaysia has the highest school variance, followed by Indonesia and Thailand. This indicates that the effects of school traits on variation in students’ mathematics performance are much greater in Malaysia than Indonesia and Thailand.|$|R
