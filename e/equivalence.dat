5|$|Each of the valid Band1 {{permutations}} can {{be expanded}} (completed) into a specific number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations. By {{virtue of their}} similarity, each member of an <b>equivalence</b> class {{will have the same}} number of completions. Consequently, we only need to construct the solutions for one member of each <b>equivalence</b> class and then multiply the number of solutions {{by the size of the}} <b>equivalence</b> class. We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each <b>equivalence</b> class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into <b>equivalence</b> classes.|$|E
5|$|For {{each of the}} Band1 <b>equivalence</b> classes, all {{possible}} Band2,3 solutions need to be enumerated. An outer Band1 loop iterates over the 44 <b>equivalence</b> classes.

5|$|An {{enumeration}} technique {{based on}} band generation was developed that is significantly less computationally intensive.

40|$|In {{the paper}} "Relating Strong Behavioral <b>Equivalences</b> for Processes with Nondeterminism and Probabilities" {{to appear in}} TCS, we present a {{comparison}} of behavioral <b>equivalences</b> for nondeterministic and probabilistic processes. In particular, we consider strong trace, failure, testing, and bisimulation <b>equivalences.</b> For each of these groups of <b>equivalences,</b> we examine the discriminating power of three variants stemming from three approaches that differ for the way probabilities of events are compared when nondeterministic choices are resolved via deterministic schedulers. The established relationships are summarized in a so-called spectrum. However, the <b>equivalences</b> we consider in that paper are only a small subset of those considered in the original spectrum of <b>equivalences</b> for nondeterministic systems introduced by Rob van Glabbeek. In this companion paper we we enlarge the spectrum by considering variants of trace <b>equivalences</b> (completed-trace <b>equivalences),</b> additional decorated-trace <b>equivalences</b> (failure-trace, readiness, and ready-trace <b>equivalences),</b> and variants of bisimulation <b>equivalences</b> (kernels of simulation, completed-simulation, failure-simulation, and ready-simulation preorders). Moreover, we study how the spectrum changes when randomized schedulers are used instead of deterministic ones...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a {{hierarchy}} of games that allows us to make a systematic comparison of process <b>equivalences</b> by characterizing process <b>equivalences</b> as games. The well-known linear/branching time hierarchy of process <b>equivalences</b> can be embedded into the game hierarchy, which not only provides us with a refined analysis of process <b>equivalences,</b> but also offers a guidance to defining interesting new process <b>equivalences.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|In a 2005 study, Felgenhauer and Jarvis {{analyzed}} the permutations {{of the top}} band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 symmetries and <b>equivalence</b> classes for the partial grid solutions were identified, the completions of the lower two bands were constructed and counted for each <b>equivalence</b> class. Summing completions over the <b>equivalence</b> classes, weighted by class size, gives {{the total number of}} solutions as 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960, confirming the value obtained by QSCGZ. The value was subsequently confirmed numerous times independently. A second enumeration technique based on band generation was later developed that is significantly less computationally intensive.|$|E
5|$|The {{diversity}} of the ~, 56×66 Band1 permutations {{can be reduced to}} a set of 44 Band1 <b>equivalence</b> classes.

5|$|Because {{different}} embeddings {{may lead}} to different dual graphs, testing whether one graph is a dual of another (without already knowing their embeddings) is a nontrivial algorithmic problem. For biconnected graphs, it can be solved in polynomial time by using the SPQR trees of the graphs to construct a canonical form for the <b>equivalence</b> relation of having a shared mutual dual. For instance, the two red graphs in the illustration are equivalent according to this relation. However, for planar graphs that are not biconnected, this relation is not an <b>equivalence</b> relation {{and the problem of}} testing mutual duality is NP-complete.|$|E
40|$|A new homological {{dimension}} is introduced {{to measure the}} quality of resolutions of `singular' finite dimensional algebras (of infinite global dimension) by `regular' ones (of finite global dimension). Upper bounds are established in terms of extensions and of Hochschild cohomology, and finiteness in general is derived from homological conjectures. Then invariance under stable <b>equivalences</b> is shown to hold, with some exceptions when there are nodes in case of additive <b>equivalences,</b> and without exceptions in case of triangulated <b>equivalences.</b> Stable <b>equivalences</b> of Morita type and derived <b>equivalences,</b> both between self-injective algebras, are shown to preserve rigidity dimension as well.

40|$|Abstract. Behavioural <b>equivalences</b> on open {{systems are}} usually defined by {{comparing}} system behaviour in all environments. Due to this “universal ” quantification over the possible hosting environments, such <b>equivalences</b> are {{often difficult to}} check in a direct way. Here, working {{in the setting of}} process calculi, we introduce a hierarchy of behavioural <b>equivalences</b> for open systems, building on a previously defined symbolic approach. The hierarchy comprises both branching, bisimulation-based, and non-branching, trace-based, <b>equivalences.</b> Symbolic <b>equivalences</b> are amenable to effective analysis techniques (e. g., the symbolic transition system is finitely branching under mild assumptions), which result to be sound, but often not complete due to redundant information. Two kinds of redundancy, syntactic and semantic, are discussed and and one class of symbolic <b>equivalences</b> is identified that deals satisfactorily with syntactic redundant transitions, which are a primary source of incompleteness. ...|$|R
