5|$|Detective Harold Greer is {{initially}} {{in charge of}} the murder investigation, but Rusty has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer, whom he persuades to narrow the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out. Rusty soon discovers that Molto <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> own inquiries. Aspects of the crime suggest that the killer knew police evidence-gathering procedures and covered up clues accordingly. Semen found in the victim's body contains only dead sperm. The killer's blood is type A, the same as Rusty's. When Della Guardia wins the election, he and Molto accuse Rusty of the murder and push to get evidence against him. Rusty's fingerprints are found on a beer glass from Carolyn's apartment, and fibers from his carpet at home match those found on her body. Lipranzer is removed from the case, and Greer's inquiries uncover the affair.|$|E
5|$|From there, Crash {{crosses to}} the second of Cortex's islands. Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} {{and there is nothing}} more than a jungle, a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> way across the islands, Cortex dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple at the start of a creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally crossing to the Cortex Island. Crash then navigates the Cortex Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of Cortex Power, Pinstripe Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E

5|$|The {{race was}} won by Australian driver Will Power for Team Penske. Power <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> race return after an {{incident}} during a practice {{session at the}} 2009 Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma, which left him with two broken vertebrae in his back. Second place went to Ryan Hunter-Reay, who <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> first start for Andretti Autosport, and third place went to another returnee, A. J. Foyt Enterprises' Vitor Meira. Meira <b>was</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> first start since suffering similar injuries to Power, during the 2009 Indianapolis 500.|$|R

25|$|The events {{described}} {{take place}} in Harwich, as the Chevalier <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> escape from England some months after Culloden. While he does not give the Christian name of this midshipman Lockhart, James was in fact eighteen years old when this was written. What is more, his career at sea would help account for his presence some months later in Persia, since the trip overland from Scotland to Persia was exceedingly arduous in 1746.|$|E
25|$|Sir Eglamour {{has already}} {{recovered}} from the wound he received whilst slaying the dragon, returned home to Artois, been told the dreadful news about Christabel and after seizing control of Artois from the earl, has travelled to the Holy Land.

Her son Degarébel, in Israel, has just learned that a beautiful woman is available to wed. If he can prove his courage on the tournament field he can win her, so he {{is on his way to}} Egypt to take part in the fighting.|$|E
500|$|On 18 February 1975, de Lucía {{became the}} first-ever flamenco {{performer}} {{to perform at}} the Teatro Real of Madrid. He played a set with his brother Ramón, {{in front of a}} relatively young audience without the use of effects. Pohren said that de Lucía's performance [...] "was brilliant technically, and played a meaningful, moving, traditional brand of flamenco that did not betray what Paco had in store for the flamenco guitar in the future." [...] The recording was released as En vivo desde el Teatro Real. His 1976 album, Almoraima, was a wider success and featured Almoraima and Río Ancho. The album was named after a former convent of the same name located about [...] from Algeciras on the road to Jimena de la Frontera, which had recently been converted into a hotel complex. The album featured significant Arabic and jazz influences especially in the bulerías composition of the same name; the name Almoraima is of Arabic origin from the Moorish period. De Lucía performed on an episode of Parkinson on BBC in the UK, in which Michael Parkinson said [...] "a marvelous young musician who <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> very first appearance on British television. His unconventional and modern approach to playing flamenco has already made him a big star in Europe, particularly in his native Spain." ...|$|E

500|$|When Manhattan and Juspeczyk arrive back on Earth, {{they are}} confronted by mass {{destruction}} and death in New York City, with a gigantic Cthulhu-like creature, created by Veidt's laboratories, dead {{in the middle of}} the city. Manhattan notices his abilities are limited by tachyons emanating from the Antarctic, and the pair teleport there. They discover Veidt's involvement and confront him. Veidt shows everyone news broadcasts confirming that the emergence of a new threat has indeed prompted peaceful co-operation between the superpowers; this leads almost all present to agree that concealing Veidt's truth from the public is in the best interests of world peace. Rorschach meanwhile refuses to compromise and leaves, intent on revealing the truth. As he <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> way back, he is confronted by Manhattan. Rorschach declares that Manhattan will have to kill him to stop him from exposing Veidt, which Manhattan duly does. Manhattan then wanders through the base and finds Veidt, who asks him if he did the right thing in the end. Manhattan responds [...] "Nothing ever ends" [...] before leaving the Earth to create life elsewhere. Dreiberg and Juspeczyk go into hiding under new identities and continue their romance. Back in New York, the editor at New Frontiersman complains about having to pull a two-page column about Russia due to the new political climate. He asks his assistant to find some filler material from the [...] "crank file", a collection of rejected submissions to the paper, many of which have not been reviewed yet. The series ends with the young man reaching toward the pile of discarded submissions, near the top of which is Rorschach's journal.|$|E
2500|$|Five years later, during World War II, Robbie is {{a soldier}} {{fighting}} in the Battle of France. He had agreed to join the army {{so he could be}} released from prison. He <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> way on foot to Dunkirk after having been separated from his unit. In a flashback, in London six months earlier, he reunites with Cecilia (who has not spoken with her family since the incident), and they renew their love before he is shipped off to the French front.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{months have}} passed since a mutated strain of mad cow disease mutated into [...] "mad person disease" [...] that became [...] "mad zombie disease" [...] which overran the entire United States population, turning American people into vicious zombies. Survivors of the zombie {{epidemic}} have learned that it is best not to grow attached to other survivors, because they could die at any moment, so many have taken to using their city of origin as nicknames. Unaffected college student Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>his</b> way from his college dorm in Austin, Texas, to Columbus, Ohio, to see whether his parents are still alive. He encounters Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), another survivor, who is particularly violent in killing zombies. Though he doesn't appear to be sociable, Tallahassee reluctantly allows Columbus to travel with him. Tallahassee mentions he misses his puppy that was killed by zombies, {{as well as his}} affinity for Twinkies, which he actively tries to find.|$|E
