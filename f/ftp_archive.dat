50|$|As the Internet grew {{through the}} 1980s and early 1990s, many people {{realized}} the increasing {{need to be}} able to find and organize files and information. Projects such as Archie, Gopher, WAIS, and the <b>FTP</b> <b>Archive</b> list attempted to create ways to organize distributed data. In the early 1990s, Gopher, invented by Mark P. McCahill offered a viable alternative to the World Wide Web. However, in 1993 the World Wide Web saw many advances to indexing and ease of access through search engines, which often neglected Gopher and Gopherspace. As popularity increased through ease of use, investment incentives also grew until in the middle of 1994 the WWW's popularity gained the upper hand. Then it became clear that Gopher and the other projects were doomed fall short.|$|E

50|$|Around 1994 and 1995, WADs were {{primarily}} distributed online over bulletin board systems or sold in collections on compact discs in computer shops, sometimes bundled with editing guide books. FTP servers became the primary method in later years. A few WADs {{have been released}} commercially, including the Master Levels for Doom II, which was released in 1995 along with Maximum Doom, a CD containing 1,830 WADs that had been downloaded from the Internet. Several thousand WADs have been created in total: the idgames <b>FTP</b> <b>archive</b> contains over 18,000 files, and this represents {{only a fraction of}} the complete output of Doom fans. Third party programs were also written to handle the loading of various WADs, since the game is a DOS game and all commands had to be entered on the command line to run. A typical launcher would allow the player to select which files to load from a menu, making it much easier to start. In 1995, WizardWorks released the D!Zone pack featuring hundreds of levels for Doom and Doom II. D!Zone was reviewed in Dragon by Jay & Dee; Jay gave the pack 1 out of 5 stars, while Dee gave the pack 1½ stars.|$|E

40|$|The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is {{the single}} global {{repository}} for three-dimensional struc-tures of biological macromolecules and their complexes, and its more than 100 000 struc-tures contain more than 20000 distinct ligands or small molecules bound to proteins and nucleic acids. Information about these small molecules and their interactions with pro-teins and nucleic acids is crucial for our understanding of biochemical processes and vital for structure-based drug design. Small molecules present in a deposited structure may be attached to a polymer or may occur as a separate, non-covalently linked ligand. During curation of a newly deposited structure by wwPDB annotation staff, each mol-ecule is cross-referenced to the PDB Chemical Component Dictionary (CCD). If the mol-ecule is new to the PDB, a dictionary description is created for it. The information about all small molecule components found in the PDB is distributed via the <b>ftp</b> <b>archive</b> as an external reference file. Small molecule annotation in the PDB also includes information about ligand-binding sites and about covalent and other linkages between ligands and macromolecules.

30|$|DIUP reads all DICOM {{files from}} a CD on any {{workstation}} in the hospital. After loading the CD, the patient {{name and the}} available series are displayed. The physician can choose the relevant series and push these to a file transfer protocol (ftp) server after providing the in-house patient ID and checking whether the selected data are correct. This forces the physician to check whether the patient is registered at our hospital, and if not, to register the patient first. Replacement of the patient ID with the in-house patient ID is performed during the transfer to the central ftp server. At the radiology department, the data are retrieved from the <b>ftp</b> <b>archive</b> and stored at the appropriate DICOM node. During the storage process, the information regarding a patient having external data is recorded. The uploaded images will be updated with patient identifiers from our institution’s radiology information system (RIS) by overwriting the original patient ID and accession number with the correct patient ID and accession number in the DICOM header. Image-related materials such as radiology reports or informed consents are obtained from other institutions via email or fax. These image-related materials were not stored in the system but delivered separately to the physicians. Later, the stored data are subsequently removed from the ftp site if the transfer is successfully finished. Using DIUP, physicians can also track whether their CD has already been stored into the DICOM node, thus avoiding resending the same CD over and over.|$|E

40|$|Modeling of {{the topside}} {{ionosphere}} {{has for the}} most part relied on just a few years of data from topside sounder satellites. The widely used Bent et al. (1972) model, for example, is based on only 50, 000 Alouette 1 profiles. The International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) (Bilitza, 1990, 2001) uses an analytical description of the graphs and tables provided by Bent et al. (1972). The Alouette 1, 2 and ISIS 1, 2 topside sounder satellites of the sixties and seventies were ahead of their times in terms of the sheer volume of data obtained {{and in terms of the}} computer and software requirements for data analysis. As a result, only a small percentage of the collected topside ionograms was converted into electron density profiles. Recently, a NASA-funded data restoration project has undertaken and is continuing the process of digitizing the Alouette/ISIS ionograms from the analog 7 -track tapes. Our project involves the automated processing of these digital ionograms into electron density profiles. The project accomplished a set of important goals that will have a major impact on understanding and modeling of the topside ionosphere: (1) The TOPside Ionogram Scaling and True height inversion (TOPIST) software was developed for the automated scaling and inversion of topside ionograms. (2) The TOPIST software was applied to the over 300, 000 ISIS- 2 topside ionograms that had been digitized in the fkamework of a separate AISRP project (PI: R. F. Benson). (3) The new TOPIST-produced database of global electron density profiles for the topside ionosphere were made publicly available through NASA s National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) <b>ftp</b> <b>archive</b> at. (4) Earlier Alouette 1, 2 and ISIS 1, 2 data sets of electron density profiles from manual scaling of selected sets of ionograms were converted fiom a highly-compressed binary format into a user-friendly ASCII format and made publicly available through nssdcftp. gsfc. nasa. gov. The new database for the topside ionosphere established as a result of this project, has stimulated a multitude of new studies directed towards a better description and prediction of the topside ionosphere. Marinov et al. (2004) developed a new model for the upper ion transition height (Oxygen to Hydrogen and Helium) and Bilitza (2004) deduced a correction term for the I N topside electron density model. Kutiev et al. (2005) used this data to develop a new model for the topside ionosphere scale height (TISH) as a function of month, local time, latitude, longitude and solar flux F 10. 7. Comparisons by Belehaki et al. (2005) show that TISH is in general agreement with scale heights deduced from ground ionosondes but the model predicts post-midnight and afternoon maxima whereas the ionosonde data show a noon maximum. Webb and Benson (2005) reported on their effort to deduce changes in the plasma temperature and ion composition from changes in the topside electron density profile as recorded by topside sounders. Limitations and possible improvements of the IRI topside model were discussed by Coisson et al. (2005) including also the possible use of the NeQuick model, Our project progressed in close collaboration and coordination with the GSFC team involved in the ISIS digitization effort. The digitization project was highly successful producing a large amount of digital topside ionograms. Several no-cost extensions of the TOPIST project were necessary to keep up with the pace and volume of the digitization effort...|$|E
