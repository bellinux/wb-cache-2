5000|$|The {{railroad}} {{operates the}} [...] "trash train" [...] hauling refuse from Yarmouth to SEMASS, a waste-to-energy plant in Rochester, MA, as did its predecessor. However, Massachusetts Coastal operates the train {{under the new}} name, [...] "Energy Train" [...] using 20 former Canadian Pacific bath tub coal hopper cars rebuilt into [...] "Energy" [...] cars. These [...] "Energy Cars" [...] are numbered 1000-1019. These cars are painted in an attractive Pullman green scheme with a black band. The first 6 cars were fully painted with [...] "MASS COASTAL" [...] lettering, and [...] "ENERGY TRAIN" [...] written along the sides and gold stripes. the remaining 14 cars are in an abbreviated scheme with no lettering or stripes. This was done {{to speed up the}} delivery process. As of January 2015, the <b>Energy</b> <b>Train</b> operates Monday through Friday in the morning and afternoon. Mostly on Tuesdays, Mass Coastal sends a locomotive or two from either Rochester or Taunton to interchange with CSX in Middleboro. Operations in Fall River, New Bedford, and Taunton can be seen some days Monday through Friday.|$|E
50|$|Mass Coastal {{operates}} {{with five}} locomotives; numbered 2006 through 2010. The 2006 is an ex-ATSF GP7u (previously BNSF 1336), the 2007 {{is a similar}} ex-ATSF GP9u (previously BNSF 1664), the 2008 is an ex-Canadian National GP9RM and the 2009 is an ex IC GP28. All Mass Coastal locomotives rotate jobs throughout the year. Usually, 1 locomotive handles the <b>Energy</b> <b>Train,</b> 2 handle the Cape Cod Central tourist trains, and the 2 others handle the Fall River and New Bedford Lines. All MC units are to eventually be equipped with cab signals, enabling them to traverse the CSX interchange in Middleborough, MA. As of September 2015, 2008 and 2009 are so equipped. All of the locomotives are painted in an attractive Cranberry Red scheme with a black band and yellow stripes and lettering. The two exceptions to the paint scheme are engines 2006 and 2007. After a main generator failure in early 2009, the 2007 re-emerged with a new generator and yellow safety stripes on the front pilots. Soon after, this the unit was transferred to Taunton. It replaced 2006 which came to Hyannis and had the yellow stripes painted on both {{the front and rear}} plow. In 2009, a fourth engine was acquired numbered 2009; A GP28 built by EMD in 1964 for the Illinois Central Railroad. This engine was purchased from National Rail Equipment in Silvis, Illinois. In late 2010, the railroad purchased their fifth locomotive, a GP50 #2010. This engine is a former Chicago North Western unit.|$|E
30|$|Since 2000, East Japan Railway Company and Railway Technical Research Institute {{continued}} to make efforts to develop new <b>energy</b> <b>train</b> (NE Train), {{in order to reduce}} environmental load of railcar. The first-generation “NE Train” was first delivered from Tokyo Car Corporation in April 2003, configured as the world’s first hybrid diesel/battery railcar, which was named KiYa E 991 - 1 [12]. Then, the NE Train underwent modifications in 2006 in having the diesel generator replaced with a hydrogen fuel cell, becoming the world’s first fuel-cell/battery hybrid railway vehicle, classified KuMoYa E 995 - 1, which was used to power 95 -kW traction motors and fitted with lithium-ion batteries with an increased storage capacity (19  kWh) [13, 14]. Table 1 summarizes the configuration of the locomotives mentioned above.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{pressing}} global {{need for more}} trained scientists, engineers, policy makers, technicians and tradespeople with {{the knowledge and skills}} to develop, implement and maintain renewable and energy efficient systems and policies. This training requires the development of high quality, flexible renewable <b>energy</b> <b>training</b> courses that can be delivered by both face-to-face and self-paced distance education. The Internet’s unique features, including its ability to display not just static, but dynamic, information to anywhere in the world almost simultaneously means {{it can be used to}} significantly enhance the learning experience of students. In the light of this the Australian Cooperative Research Centre for Renewable Energy (ACRE) in conjunction with Murdoch University and the Brisbane Institute of Technical and Further Education (BIT) are developing a number of internationally focussed distance education and Internet based post secondary, and tertiary level renewable energy courses. The individual modules, or units, that make up these courses have been developed for maximum flexibility with the option of delivery face-to-face or through distance education. There are a number of challenges in delivering renewable <b>energy</b> <b>training</b> by conventional correspondence based distance education. These challenges can be reduced, and the quality of learning significantly enhanced by the use of the Internet. Some of the advantages of using the Internet to enhance post secondary renewable energy education will be discussed. A number of examples of how the Internet has been used to enhance ACRE's post secondary and tertiary level online modules and units will be shown. A number of Internet based resources useful for renewable <b>energy</b> <b>training</b> will also be given...|$|R
