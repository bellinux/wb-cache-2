[...] Jones had made the banner {{specifically}} for the occasion and displayed <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> helicopters to see. As it was pretty windy on the interstate at the time, Jones weighted the banner down with a container to stop it blowing away. Jones continued to make obscene gestures and returned to his truck several times to pet his dog. This was all broadcast on live television by news helicopters recording the event live. As it was a Thursday afternoon, it was witnessed by many children, whose after-school cartoons had been interrupted in order to broadcast the incident. As authorities prepared to negotiate with him, Jones suddenly returned to his truck and sat in the front seat. Intending to take his own life, Jones ignited a Molotov cocktail inside his truck. The vehicle suddenly burst into flames and was set ablaze. Jones got out of the vehicle however and ran across the freeway as he was engulfed in flames and smoke, with his hair, pants and socks all on fire. Jones tried to pat out the flames, managing to peel off his pants, socks and underwear. He continued to wander about, naked from the waist, looking dazed and disoriented. He then walked {{to the edge of the}} freeway gesturing angrily. It appeared as if he was about to jump off the freeway, however, he changed his mind and backed away from the edge, before returning to his ablaze truck. Moments later, at around 3:50p.m., he retrieved his shotgun from the back of the truck and then walked back across the freeway. He placed the shotgun beneath his chin, pulled the trigger and committed suicide. He then fell to the ground with the cameras still rolling and playing the event live to viewers watching at home. Jones died at the age of forty, roughly two weeks after his birthday.|$|E

50|$|By quote {{stuffing}}, trading systems delay price quotes {{while the}} stuffing is occurring, simply by placing and canceling orders {{at a rate}} that substantially surpasses the bandwidth of market data feed lines. The orders pile up in buffers, and the delay (increased latency) lasts until the buffer drains. Trading systems slow down a direct exchange feed whenever they want, and the phantom orders {{do not need to be}} in a particular stock; they can be in any of the securities that cohabit the particular price (market data) feed. For example, phantom orders at the rate of over about 10,000 messages/second, even for fractions of a second, delay the NYSE's CQS feeds.Exchanges profit by selling higher-capacity feeds to HFT traders, which disincents self-regulation that could prevent the quote stuffing. Quote stuffing happens frequently - when 6,000 replacement orders for one stock are crammed into a second, each order is valid for less time than <b>it</b> takes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of <b>the</b> order (traveling at close to the speed of light) to reach anyone not at the exchange; no normal person can execute a trade against the phantom order.|$|R

2500|$|Trotter {{started his}} search for Clifton in 1987. Almost 30 years later, in June 2016, {{he and his team}} logged the {{coordinates}} of an unknown wreck. He stated that they had been working on a project that involved two other wrecks. The team dived the unknown lost vessel in September 2016, and when the diver surfaced, he reported to Trotter that the unidentified vessel was [...] "a whaleback". Trotter instantly told his crew that they might well have discovered Clifton, as it was the only as-yet-undiscovered whaleback to have been lost on Lake Huron. The senior diver wanted additional confirmation of this discovery before making it public. [...] After deputizing several team members with action cameras, {{it was clear that the}} wreck was indeed a whaleback and was therefore Clifton. Trotter's divers further explored and video-documented the wreck, making nine dives in July–August 2017. Careful work was necessary, as the long-lost hull had been found approximately 100miles (160km) from where she had been last seen and was believed to have sunk. Trotter made the identification public in September 2017. The delay made <b>it</b> possible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> to be formally released on September 21, 2017, the 93rd anniversary of the vessel's last surface sighting. Trotter said that the discovery was [...] "a personal milestone" [...] in a quest that he was fortunate enough to complete within his lifetime.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of the {{internet}} on the return to original reporting. I analyze the reporting of 727, 038 <b>news</b> stories in <b>the</b> largest print and online newspapers in Argentina over a twelve-year period. I estimate the extent to which readers dislike the delay in <b>the</b> reporting of <b>news.</b> Before <b>the</b> internet, publishing every news story with a one-day delay resulted in a 65 % readership reduction. In the internet era, the reduction rate is 61 % for print editions and 64 % for online editions. Readers dislike delays in <b>the</b> reporting of <b>news,</b> and <b>the</b> extent of this aversion has not changed with the internet. Next, I compute the delay the newspaper incurs when it is not the …rst to report a news story. Prior to the internet, the delay was, on average, 1. 15 days. Post-internet, the delay can theoretically go below 1 day and in fact it falls to 0. 83 days for print editions and 0. 52 days for online editions. Faster updating has reduced the rate of readership loss inherent in not being the …rst newspaper to report news, up to a 42 %. Finally, I examine whether the internet has an e¤ect on <b>the</b> time <b>it</b> takes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> to be reported. I focus on the deaths of public …gures, a subset of <b>the</b> stories <b>for</b> which <b>the</b> time of the event is precisely de…ned. Post-internet, there is a 0. 07 day increase in the time taken to discover a death from the moment it occurred. However, there is also a 0. 19 day reduction in the time newspapers have to wait to publish a death after they …nd out about it...|$|R
40|$|When a {{disaster}} {{the magnitude of}} the Deepwater Horizon blowout and oil spill takes place, is <b>it</b> natural <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media stories, investigative reports, and public deliberation to focus almost exclusively on finding the person or group responsible for such a horrendous scene. Rhetorically speaking, the discourse surrounding the event can be characterized as a reductive form of praise and blame rhetoric (epideixis). However, these efforts, while well-intentioned, are troublesome because searches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> one technical cause and the sole personal culpability are thwarted by the sheer complexity of the ecological, technological, scientific, institutional, and communicative network required for such {{a disaster}} to take place. Thus, to demonstrate the insufficiency of extant models of disaster in a variety of fields, which tend to privilege human-centered approaches, Dead Man 2 ̆ 7 s Switch: Disaster Rhetorics in a Posthuman Age explores the ontology, technical documentation, and rhetorical theory of disasters through a posthuman lens. To find a more critical approach to understanding the nature of disasters in the twenty-first century, I ask the following questions: How do rhetoricians and technical communicators account more fully <b>for</b> <b>the</b> human and nonhuman forces at work in the precipitation of disaster? How do rhetoricians and technical communicators find an approach to ecological catastrophe that goes beyond the mere 2 ̆ 2 environmentalist rhetoric 2 ̆ 2 characterizing the public response? Through the application of several posthumanist theories, my project develops an approach to disaster that complicates traditional ways of approaching causality and blame. I use accident reports, news media stories, and popular literature as data for this project. By examining these texts, my project has broad implications for technical communication, rhetorical theory, and philosophy of rhetoric...|$|R

Japanese crab vessels would crowd around cod boats, where king crabs devoured the fish waste. Ed Shields, a king crab fisherman was aboard a schooner {{at this time}} and recalls the Japanese encroaching on the Bristol Bay fishing area. Ed Shields says that his father sent a telegram to Seattle, ordering one dozen high-powered rifles for each vessel and one case of ammunition each.

40|$|The live blog is a {{relatively}} new, web-native format that has special possibilities <b>for</b> creating journalism. <b>It</b> {{is an example of}} networked journalism that puts an emphasis on aggregated material from different sources such as social media and user-generated content. • Live blogs are usually heavily dependent on other mainstream media as well as social media to function. • News consumers appreciate the format of the live blog. They sometimes prefer it over other formats such as a conventional news articles and sometimes consume types of content they would not normally have chosen because it is presented in a live blog. • The use of live blogs has sparked conflict and debate, mainly because of the speed at which they are written and how this leads to publishing unconfirmed information which has occasionally put people at risk of harm. • Live blogs change the way journalists work: they have more (or less) to do, they use a different tone of voice and they might not always be able to verify the information that they share. Reporters take on a new role, that sometimes might resemble that of an editor, curator or moderator. • Verifying facts in real time {{is one of the biggest}} journalistic challenges when working with live blogs. Other challenges include the live blog taking up a lot of resources and keeping the narrative structure clear. • Live blogs can be used as a way of engaging with readers, making <b>it</b> easier <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> - paper to receive useful user generated content. • Live blogs might change how media companies act towards news consumers and increase the level of engagement with readers. • Live blogs open up the journalistic process to readers, so transferring some of the jour - nalistic responsibility towards them. Live blogs change the way the reader consumes <b>the</b> <b>news</b> – <b>the</b> reader has to act like an editor. • The live blog is an evolving format that we will see more of in the future...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>news</b> {{media and}} <b>the</b> {{political}} public relations industry are linked in numerous ways and {{any change in}} their relationship has many repercussions, not just <b>for</b> those in <b>the</b> political <b>news</b> industry, but for society and democracy in the UK as a whole. Neither political PRs nor journalists can function effectively without the other and each relies upon the other to enhance their importance. They are both powerful groups but without the other their power is impaired {{and their ability to}} succeed is significantly reduced. The extent of this relationship on public life and society in the UK means that an analysis of these relationships is essential to understand just who the political gatekeeper is in the early 21 st century. This thesis utilises interviews with professional practitioners in <b>the</b> political <b>news</b> industry to investigate the role of political journalists within <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media and <b>the</b> role of political PRs in the political public relations industry. It then establishes the extent and nature of the relationship between these two groups. The implications of this relationship are then analysed to determine whether <b>it</b> is possible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media to facilitate their role in democratic life in the UK. The thesis concludes that, as a result of all the changes in <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media and <b>the</b> dramatic growth in size and power of the political public relations industry, {{there is no longer a}} single political gatekeeper and that in fact political PRs and journalists conduct a collusive conflictual relationship. It presents a situation where not only are journalists hindered in carrying out <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media's democratic obligations but <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media is, as a whole, no longer able to effectively defend their obligations and journalists are failing in their role as a watchdog.

5000|$|B612 is {{attempting}} to raise approximately $450M to fund the development, launch and operational costs of the telescope, {{about the cost of}} a complex freeway interchange, or approximately $100M less than a single Air Force Next-Generation Bomber. The $450 million cost estimate is composed of $250 million to create Sentinel, plus another $200 million for 10 years of operations. In explaining the Foundation's current bypassing of possible governmental grants for such a mission, Dr. Lu stated their public fundraising appeal is being driven by [...] "the tragedy of the commons: When it’s everybody’s problem, it’s nobody’s problem", referring to a lack of ownership, priority and funding that governments have assigned to asteroid threats, also stating on a different occasion [...] "We’re the only ones taking it seriously." [...] According to another B612 board member, Rusty Schweickart, [...] "The good news is, you can prevent it — not just get ready <b>for</b> <b>it!</b> <b>The</b> bad <b>news</b> is, it's hard to get anybody to pay attention to it when there are potholes in the road." [...] After providing earlier Congressional testimony on the issue Schweickart was dismayed to hear from congressional staff members that, while U.S. lawmakers involved in the hearing understood the seriousness of the threat, they would likely not legislate funding for planetary defense as [...] "making the deflection of asteroids a priority might backfire in their reelection campaigns".|$|R
