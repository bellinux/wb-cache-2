5000|$|The Sand Prairie-Scrub Oak Nature Preserve is {{described}} on its webpage as [...] "a mixture of dry sand prairie, dry sand savanna and dry sand forest." [...] Areas of savanna and forest {{are characterized by}} black oak and blackjack oak, with some mockernut. It represents among the northernmost natural range trees of black hickory. Prairie grasses such as little bluestem, and sand plant life such as <b>eastern</b> <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus,</b> can be found.|$|E
50|$|A {{northern}} {{deciduous forest}} cloaks {{the slopes of}} the Delaware Water Gap. Hardwood species comprising the forest include various oaks, hickories, maples, ash, elm, cherry, walnut, birch, sycamore, and beech. Coniferous species include Eastern White Pine, Pitch Pine, Eastern Red Cedar, and Eastern Hemlock. Black bear, whitetailed deer, gray squirrels, red squirrels, raccoons, gray fox, fisher, and chipmunks are some of the forest species of the area. Shad migrate up the river through the gap in the spring. Other fish include bass, trout, carp, and walleye. timber rattlesnakes and copperheads also inhabit the rocky areas of the mountain. Salamanders are found in the moist areas of the forest. <b>Eastern</b> <b>Prickly</b> <b>Pear</b> <b>Cactus</b> also grows on the mountain near the red dot trail on the south eastern facing slope halfway up the mountain.|$|E
40|$|Opuntia humifusa (<b>eastern</b> <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus)</b> {{is listed}} as {{potentially}} threatened in Ohio, and we examined the characteristics of O. humifusa sites in Oak Openings Preserve in northwestern Ohio’s Oak Openings region {{in an attempt to}} provide data that may help protect this species. Opuntia humifusa occurrences were associated with loose sands of the xeric Udipsamment Ottokee and Oakville soil series on sites that had been cleared before the 1940 s during failed agricultural attempts. Shading by encroaching canopy trees is a threat to several O. humifusa populations in Oak Openings Preserve, and treatments that reduce canopy cover at these sites may help sustain this species and increase the proportion of flowering individuals. Because the patchy distribution of O. humifusa makes the species susceptible to local extinctions, the acquisition of sites by conservation organizations containing O. humifusa or providing suitable habitat is consistent with the perpetuation of this rare species in the Oak Openings region. Sandy sites previously disturbed by agricultural clearing, sand mining, or other soil disturbances should not be overlooked for their potential to provide O. humifusa habitat in this region...|$|E

40|$|Critical {{habitat is}} defined in the Species at Risk Act as any habitat in which a species at risk is capable of {{maintaining}} self-sustaining populations. Growth and survival of endangered O. humifusa, the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus,</b> was compared in field and glasshouse experiments. Conditions (light, soil organic matter, moisture, pH, and macronutrients) differed significantly among habitats at Point Pelee National Park (PPNP). The survival of transplanted seedlings in four habitats at PPNP (back beach, primary successional savanna, secondary successional savanna and deciduous forest) indicated that only two of these habitats (the savannas) would be suitable for O. humifusa over the longer term. Shading and macronutrient treatments in the greenhouse indicated growth was favoured by partial shade; nutrient enrichment enhanced growth, but in the field nutrient supplementation would accelerate secondary succession, {{to the detriment of}} O. humifusa.

The laboratory experimental study using diffusion method. The concentration of the <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus</b> fruit extract used was 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 %, whereas bacterial samples derived from the laboratory of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Hasanuddin. The observation of several concentrations showed a {{decrease in the number of}} colonies contained S. aureus, S. mutans, C. albicans significant with increasing concentrations of the <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus</b> fruit extract. From these observations, the largest inhibitory concentration present in a concentration of 100 %. The conclusion is the fruit of the <b>prickly</b> <b>pear</b> <b>cactus</b> extract can inhibit the growth of S. aureus, S. mutans, and C. albicans. The higher the concentration of the extract, the more reduced the growth of S. aureus colonies, S. mutans, and C. albicans and vice versa...|$|R
