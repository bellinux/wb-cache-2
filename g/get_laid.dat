It's almost like there's boyish innocence lurking underneath all that bile."

500|$|In March 1989, the Chili Peppers {{embarked}} on a two-month tour to break-in the new lineup. The [...] "Positive Mental Octopus tour" [...] saw the band play small venues throughout the United States, including several concerts on the East and West Coast. During this period, Frusciante began to assert more energy and his ego [...] "got a little swollen", according to Flea, [...] "He was running around being rude to girls and getting them pissed off. But that's to be expected, I mean, shit, you're 18 years old {{and you want to}} <b>get</b> <b>laid</b> really bad {{and all of a sudden}} you're in a band, the girls want to fuck.

[...] Another incident, following a performance at the George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, caused legal repercussions; a student accused Kiedis of engaging in sexual misconduct and indecent exposure. The vocalist was subsequently arrested and released on bail pending a trial that was to be set for a later date.|$|E

They formed one with Woods and Derrah a few weeks later, drawing inspiration from the [...] "burgeoning local punk and post-punk scenes". Iyall recruited Woods because she enjoyed playing {{with him in the}} Mommers and Poppers. [...] " [...] seemed only natural that we invite Peter Woods to join us [...] played clean and was a natural on rhythm guitar." [...] Romeo Void officially formed on Valentine's Day in 1979. According to Iyall, the name Romeo Void referred to [...] "a lack of romance" [...] and came to mind after they saw a local magazine with the headline [...] "Why single women can't <b>get</b> <b>laid</b> in San Francisco." [...] The band practiced in Iyall's flat in Mission District. It was decided that the group would embrace punk ideals despite the possibility that they become associated with the new wave movement. [...] "Even though I was going to the [...] so much, I also had criticisms: Everyone was leaning against the wall wearing black," [...] Iyall said. [...] "I guess we were considered new wave, but for me Romeo Void was a reaction against the regimentation of everyone having to be bleached blond and everything being about despair and no future, when I thought the do-it-yourself thing should encompass all the different kinds of emotions, and all the different colors. [...] I was proud of being American Indian, so I purposely never bleached my hair blond." ...|$|E

Shortly after the conversation, Steve is {{the first person to}} finish his meal, much to Stan's surprise. Stan later becomes insecure about the incident, and he is afraid that his stance as the alpha male of the household will be dethroned. The next morning, when Steve is watching a movie on television, Stan abruptly pushes him off the couch and claims it as his [...] "territory" [...] by peeing all over it. Steve becomes furious, and he tells Francine about the situation in the kitchen. Francine tells him that Stan is intimidated by him, and that he feels that he will be dethroned of his dominance by him. Puzzled, Steve talks to Stan about the issue and openly challenges him of his position as the dominant person in the household. Though Steve manages to outdo him in everything, Stan is inspired by a walrus documentary to do the one thing his son can not do: have sex. Turning to Roger for help, Steve is suggested to go to a party to <b>get</b> <b>laid.</b> Informed by Klaus of this, Stan rushes to the party to stop his son. However, upon arriving there, Stan learns that Steve's various attempts to have sex with a girl failed miserably as the boy is having a mental breakdown. Roger explains now there's no threat to Steve challenging Stan, and no threat of Steve's future son (whom shall never be born) challenging him. Stan later apologizes to him, and admits to having failed to raise him to be a man.|$|E

It featured a 1979 photo of a man sitting in the bar of a brothel with a very similar hairstyle and clothes to those worn by Chigurh in the film. Oscar-winning hairstylist Paul LeBlanc designed the hairdo. The Coens instructed LeBlanc to create a [...] "strange and unsettling" [...] hairstyle. LeBlanc based the style on the mop tops of the English warriors in the Crusades as well as the Mod haircuts of the 1960s. Bardem told LeBlanc each morning when he finished that the style helped him to get into character. Bardem humorously quipped that he was [...] "not going to <b>get</b> <b>laid</b> for three months" [...] because of his haircut.|$|E
2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't <b>get</b> <b>laid</b> in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me.

Jon Ginoli, openly gay frontman of the queercore band Pansy Division, called it [...] "an obviously anti-gay backlash song.

'Maybe I should pierce my butt or get a few tattoos / Maybe I should wear a dress and be a homo like you / Normal, hetero, straight guy / Yeah that's right, I'm a straight, normal, girl fuckin', coffee drinkin', titty suckin', cigarette smokin', seal killin', redneck-ass bastard from hell'. Hmm, I don't think the gay guys are to blame for that [...] Hearing the song, {{it was hard not to}} take it personally [...] At the same time I felt sad for the guy, who so obviously appeared threatened by gay people having more visibility and acceptance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bankhead {{returned}} to the United States in 1931, but Hollywood success eluded her in her first four films of the 1930s. She rented a home at 1712 Stanley Street, in Hollywood, and began hosting parties that were said to [...] "have no boundaries". Bankhead's first film was Tarnished Lady (1931), directed by George Cukor and the pair became fast friends. Bankhead behaved herself on the set and filming went smoothly, but she found film-making to be very boring {{and did not have}} the patience for it. She did not like Hollywood, either; when she met producer Irving Thalberg, she asked him, [...] "How do you <b>get</b> <b>laid</b> in this dreadful place?" [...] Thalberg retorted, [...] "I'm sure you'll have no problem. Ask anyone." [...] Although Bankhead was not very interested in making films, the opportunity to make $50,000 per film was too good to pass up. Her 1932 movie Devil and the Deep is notable for the presence of three major co-stars, with Bankhead receiving top billing over Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, and Cary Grant; it is the only film with Cooper and Grant as the film's leading men. She later said, [...] "Dahling, the main reason I accepted [...] was to fuck that divine Gary Cooper!" [...] Later in 1932, Bankhead starred opposite Robert Montgomery in Faithless.|$|E

Still, if the canoes go from Archangel to Petchora and back, we ought to be able to do it from Petchora, for the {{distance}} from there to Archangel is a good deal less than from the mouth of the Yenesei to the Petchora. There is one thing, if the weather gets very bad on the way, or we <b>get</b> <b>laid</b> up by bad weather for a long time on the way to Petchora, we can go up the river, I hear, to a place called Ust Zlyma, and from there go overland to Archangel. It is about two hundred or two hundred and fifty miles across, and we could walk that in ten days. I am quite sure that we should not be suspected of being anything but what we look; and at Archangel there is sure to be a British consul, and he would put us up to the best plan of getting out of the country. However, there will be plenty of time to see about that as we get on." ...|$|E

6000|$|There was {{one tree}} in the compound, and a monkey lived in it. At first I was {{strongly}} interested in the tree, for I was told {{that it was the}} renowned peepul--the tree in whose shadow you cannot tell a lie. This one failed to stand the test, and I went away from it disappointed. There was a softly creaking well close by, and a couple of oxen drew water from it by the hour, superintended by two natives dressed in the usual [...] "turban and pocket-handkerchief." [...] The tree and the well were the only scenery, and so the compound was a soothing and lonesome and satisfying place; and very restful after so many activities. There was nobody in our bungalow but ourselves; the other guests were in the next one, where the table d'hote was furnished. A body could not be more pleasantly situated. Each room had the customary bath attached--a room ten or twelve feet square, with a roomy stone-paved pit in it and abundance of water. One could not easily improve upon this arrangement, except by furnishing it with cold water and excluding the hot, in deference to the fervency of the climate; but that is forbidden. It would damage the bather's health. The stranger is warned against taking cold baths in India, but even the most intelligent strangers are fools, and they do not obey, and so they presently <b>get</b> <b>laid</b> up.
