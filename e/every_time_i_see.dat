And then, again, to be plain, I shirk {{the work of the}} {{critical}} part, shirk it as a man shirks a long jump. It is awful to have to express and differentiate BURNS in a column or two. O golly, I say, you know, it CAN'T be done at the money. All the more as I'm going write a book about it. RAMSAY, FERGUSSON, AND BURNS: AN ESSAY (or A CRITICAL ESSAY? but then I'm going to give lives of the three gentlemen, only the gist of the book is the criticism) BY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON, ADVOCATE. How's that for cut and dry? And I COULD write this book. Unless I deceive myself, I could even write it pretty adequately. I feel as if I was really in it, and knew the game thoroughly. You see what comes of trying to write an essay on BURNS in ten columns.|$|R

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'"

500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E
500|$|Like Robin, the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{video is}} drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is really about the violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there. That's why it works. And that's why it does my head in <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over the years, The Exorcists {{critical}} reputation {{has grown}} considerably. The film currently has an 87% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, based on 67 reviews the website collected. Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel {{placed it in}} the top five films released that year. BBC film critic Mark Kermode believes the film to be the best film ever made saying [...] "There's a theory that great films give back to you whatever it is you bring to them. It's absolutely true with The Exorcist—it reflects the anxieties of the audience. Some people think it's an outright horror-fest, but I don't. It was written by a devout Catholic who hoped it would make people think positively about the existence of God. William Peter Blatty, who wrote the book, thought that if there are demons then there are also angels and life after death. He couldn't see why people thought it was scary.

Sweeney stated that it was a by-product of the [...] "hijacking of the Holocaust" [...] by the Scientology exhibition which was where the outburst occurredas well as attempts to control his mind. Sweeney said of the incident: [...] "I apologised almost immediately, Tommy carried on {{as if nothing had happened}} but meanwhile Scientology had rushed off copies of me losing it to my boss, my boss's boss and my boss's boss's boss, the Director-General of the BBC." [...] Later, he added: [...] "I look like an exploding tomato and shout like a jet engine and <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it, it makes me cringe."

In a November 2011 interview, Patrick said {{of the future of}} the band: Those guys are amazing, it's basically this simple: Robert has a studio in his basement where he can totally do his old-fashioned kind of classic sound. They can write and record at any moment in time, they can get Ray Luzier in to play drums and I can take it {{for a week or two}} and write vocals or sing it. So it's as easy as them kind of recording everything, which is actually probably tough because they're constantly working with Scott on Stone Temple Pilot stuff. So the band is always there, you know what I mean, we're alive, we talk, Dean and I are constantly in communication. Ray Luzier, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> him he's like [...] "Man that Army of Anyone record is still, people still come up to me and talk about that Army of Anyone record".

2500|$|The {{impact of}} the bicycle on female {{emancipation}} should not be underestimated. The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to their larger participation {{in the lives of}} Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolise the New Woman of the late nineteenth century, especially in Britain and the United States. Feminists and suffragists recognised its transformative power. Susan B. Anthony said, [...] "Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> a woman ride by on a wheel...the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood." [...] In 1895 Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, wrote a book called How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle (described in Bicycling magazine as [...] "the greatest book ever written on learning to ride"), in which she praised the bicycle she learned to ride late in life, and which she named [...] "Gladys", for its [...] "gladdening effect" [...] on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action, proclaiming, [...] "I would not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum." [...] Elizabeth Robins Pennell started cycling in the 1870s in Philadelphia, and from the 1880s onwards brought out a series of travelogues about her cycling journeys around Europe, from A Canterbury Pilgrimage to Over the Alps on a Bicycle. In 1895 Annie Londonderry became the first woman to bicycle around the world.|$|E
