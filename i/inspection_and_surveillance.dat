40|$|The Commission 2 ̆ 7 s report {{covers a}} wide range of schemes such as licensing, audits, <b>inspections,</b> <b>and</b> various restrictions. The Commission was not asked to focus on {{specific}} industries, but to provide general guidance for application to any industry. The terms of reference were preventative. They were not directed at the investigation, prosecution or punishment of current or past criminal activity. The Commission was not asked to recommend changes to the law. Instead the Commission has identified four main strategies to prevent infiltration by organised crime: 1. Assessing the existing regime. Does this industry already have a regulatory regime, and if so, is it working and being enforced? 2. Restricting entry through a licensing scheme. An effective scheme will allow the right people into an industry, while keeping the wrong people out. Licensing is not always an appropriate response, and may be resource-intensive.   3. Regulating post-entry behaviour. This includes audits, <b>inspections,</b> <b>and</b> <b>surveillance</b> techniques, ‘know your customer’ schemes, and restrictions on cash-based transactions.   4. Addressing the use of professional facilitators: Assistance for organised crime can be provided wittingly or unwittingly by professionals such as lawyers, accountants and real estate agents. The Commission suggests customer due diligence measures, professional education and liability measures to address this risk. The report was tabled in Parliament on 25 May 2016...|$|R

40|$|A {{preliminary}} aging {{assessment of}} the fans used in nuclear air treatment and cooling systems was performed by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory {{as part of the}} U. S.

Details from guides and standards for the design, testing, and installation of fans; results of failure surveys; and information concerning stressors, related aging mechanisms, <b>and</b> <b>inspection,</b> <b>surveillance,</b> <b>and</b> monitoring methods (ISMM) were compiled. Failure surveys suggest that about half of the failures reported for fans are primarily associated with aging. Aging mechanisms associated with the various fan components and resulting from mechanical, thermal, and environmental stressors include wear, fatigue, corrosion, and erosion of metals and the deterioration of belts and lubricants. A bearing is the component most frequently linked to fan failure. The assessment also suggests that ISMM that will detect irregularities arising from improper lubrication, cooling, alignment, and balance of the various components should aid in counteracting many of the aging effects that could impair fan performance. An expanded program, to define and evaluate the adequacy of current ISMM and maintenance practices and to include a documented Phase I aging assessment, is recommended...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The use {{of small}} aerial {{vehicles}} (SAVs) such as quadrotors for <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>surveillance</b> applications both indoors and out is well established, but motion planning techniques are needed {{which can be}} calculated in real-time and which result in provably safe vehicle motion in tightly constrained 3 D environments. Applied to small quadrotor helicopters, our planning algorithm combines Probabilistic Road Maps (PRMs) with Nonlinear Programming (NLP) to yield dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories in nontrivial environments. Dynamics are incorporated as equality constraints in the NLP formulation, using a multiple shooting transcription. A key challenge is collision avoidance, accomplished via NLP inequality constraints. Simulation results for complex (thousands of polygons) indoor and cave environments are presented, showing complete plans computed more quickly than they can be flown. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We propose an {{algorithm}} {{for generating}} navigation summaries. Navigation summaries are a specialization of video summaries, where {{the focus is}} on video collected by a mobile robot, on a specified trajectory. We are interested in finding a few images that epitomize the visual experience of a robot as it traverse a terrain. This paper presents a novel approach to generating summaries in form of a set of images, where the decision to include the image in the summary set is made online. Our focus is on the case where the number of observations is infinite or unknown, but the size of the desired summary is known. Our strategy is to consider the images in the summary set as the prior hypothesis of the appearance of the world, and then use the idea of Bayesian Surprise to compute the novelty of an observed image. If the novelty is above a threshold, then we accept the image. We discuss different criterion for setting this threshold. Online nature of our approach allows for several interesting applications such as coral reef <b>inspection,</b> surveying, <b>and</b> <b>surveillance.</b> I...|$|R
