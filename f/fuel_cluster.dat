40|$|AbstractInternally and {{externally}} cooled annular {{fuel rod}} {{is an advantage}} over solid fuel rod in reactor core design {{in order to improve}} core power density and safety aspects like Minimum Critical Heat Flux Ratio (MCHFR) and lower centerline temperature. Various cluster geometries with annular fuel rod have been suggested for Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) depending upon the operating parameters. We had already presented the design of 33 rod annular <b>fuel</b> <b>cluster</b> for AHWR in previous paper. The 33 pin <b>fuel</b> <b>cluster</b> had a lower MCHFR and the reactor power could be increased by about 20 % only. The fuel bundle geometry presented in this paper is an improvised to obtain larger MCHFR and better physics performance. The AHWR uses a <b>fuel</b> <b>cluster</b> of 54 solid fuel rods and is designed for 920 MWth. We have designed an annual <b>fuel</b> <b>cluster</b> with 19 fuel rods which meets all the thermal design margin as well as gives 30 % more power than the solid fuel rod cluster without any considerable changes in design basis. Reactor core power calculations are carried out and then optimized burn up is obtained.

40|$|Liquid films falling {{under the}} {{influence}} of gravity are widely encountered in a variety of industrial two-phase flow applications (distillation columns, nuclear reactor cores, wetted walls and packed towers, heat pipes, vertical condensers etc.). The falling annular film represents a fundamental limiting case of the annular flow regime of two-phase gas-liquid flows. The maximum flow rates of gas and liquid phases which flow in opposite-directions (counter-current flow) are limited by a phenomenon known as a Counter-Current Flow Limitation (CCFL or flooding). In other words, flooding phenomenon is defined as the transition of part of liquid to a climbing film on increasing gas velocity. The calculation of pressure drop in nuclear fuel bundles across its different components is very complex and is not discussed vastly in the literature. In general, spacers of various configurations like wire wrapped, honey comb, grid type are used in the fuel rod bundles to provide support to the fuel pins as well as facilitates in effective cooling of the fuel pins, but the pressure drop across it is appreciable. This dissertation investigates the film thickness model in gas liquid two phase annular flow as well as pressure drop estimation in annular geometry such as fuel bundles and spacers. A mathematical model for the estimation of film thickness has been derived by the application of fundamental momentum equation and a numerical iterative technique with programming in MatLab has been adopted to estimate the film thickness in free falling film, a limiting case of gas liquid annular flow. An experimental test facility has been proposed to study and visualize the gas liquid interactions, flooding phenomenon and measurement of film thickness. Spacer loss coefficient and subsequently, pressure drop in D 5 <b>fuel</b> <b>cluster</b> have been estimated with the help of developed correlations based on flow area ratio. As this flow area ratio increases the spacer loss coefficient decrease & vice-versa for a given length of the spacer, but it increases with increase in the spacer length. Pressure drop across spacer is noticeable and amounts to an appreciable percentage of the total pressure drop in the <b>fuel</b> <b>cluster.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} for {{the cooperative}} research program for which this report {{has been written}} was to provide separate NCT facility user support for the students, faculty and scientists who would be doing the U. S. Department of Energy Office (DOE) of Science supported advanced radiotargeted research at the WSU 1 megawatt TRIGA reactor. The participants were the Idaho National laboratory (INL, P. I., Dave Nigg), the Veterinary Medical Research Center of Washington State University (WSU, Janean Fidel and Patrick Gavin), and the Washington State University Nuclear Radiation Center (WSU, P. I., Gerald Tripard). A significant number of DOE supported modifications {{were made to the}} WSU reactor in order to create an epithermal neutron beam {{while at the same time}} maintaining the other activities of the 1 MW reactor. These modifications were: (1) Removal of the old thermal column. (2) Construction and insertion of a new epithermal filter, collimator and shield. (3) Construction of a shielded room that could accommodate the very high radiation field created by an intense neutron beam. (4) Removal of the previous reactor core <b>fuel</b> <b>cluster</b> arrangement. (5) Design and loading of the new reactor core <b>fuel</b> <b>cluster</b> arrangement in order to optimize the neutron flux entering the epithermal neutron filter. (6) The integration of the shielded rooms interlocks and radiological controls into the SCRAM chain and operating electronics of the reactor. (7) Construction of a motorized mechanism for moving and remotely controlling the position of the entire reactor bridge. (8) The integration of the reactor bridge control electronics into the SCRAM chain and operating electronics of the reactor. (9) The design, construction and attachment to the support structure of the reactor of an irradiation box that could be inserted into position next to the face of the reactor. (Necessitated by the previously mentioned core rearrangement). All of the above modifications were successfully completed and tested. The resulting epithermal beam of 1 x 10 {sup 9 } n/sec-cm{sup 2 } was measured by Idaho National Laboratory with assistance from WSU's Neutron Activation Analysis Group. The beam is as good as our initial proposals for the project had predicted. In addition to all of the design, construction and insertion of the hardware, shielding, electronics and radiation monitoring systems there was considerable manpower and effort put into changes in the Technical Specifications of the reactor and implementing procedures for use of the new facility. This staff involvement is one of the reasons we requested special facility support from the DOE. Once the facility was competed and all of the recalibrations and measurements made to characterize the differences between this reactor core and the previous core we began to assist INL in making their beam measurements with foils and phantoms. Although we proposed support for only one additional staff position to support this new NCT facility the staff support provided by the WSU Nuclear Radiation Center was greater than had been anticipated by our initial proposal. INL was also assisted in the testing of a heavy water (deuterated water) bladder that can be inserted into the collimator in order to produce an intense, external thermal neutron beam. The external epithermal and/or thermal neutron beam capability remains available for use, if funding becomes available for future research projects...|$|E

A {{mathematical}} model was developed for studying shifting of the coolant stream as it moves along a rod in order to predict the temperatures of the parallel streams as they progress through the reactor. A fuelelement life code developed for computing the internal temperature structure, the amount of fission gas released, the internal pressure, the cladding strain when the internal pressure exceeds the coolant pressure, and the creep damage was used for comparing top-loading and inventedloading fuel programs for the EGCR. A statistical method was developed for estimating {{the probability that the}} hot spot on the EGCR fuel element will exceed a given temperature. A method of cooling the EGCR control rods was developed that will minimize diversion of coolant flow through leakage paths between graphite blocks. A preliminary design of a control rod cooled by this method was developed. Means for reducing the thermal stresses in the top head nozzles of the EGCR pressure vessel were studied. The stresses in the graphite sleeves of the EGCR fuel elements were calculated, and the maximum stress was found to be within the allowable limit. A study was made of the thermal stresses in the EGCR pressure-vessel support skirt, and a satisfactory design was developed. Procedures for removing ruthenium and cerium contamination from steel were outlined and incorporated in procedures for decontaminating the EGCR charge and service machines.

40|$|Lipotoxicity in {{skeletal}} muscle plays {{a critical role}} in the aetiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus by interference of lipid metabolites with insulin signalling and action. The dynamics of lipid oxidation and fine tuning with fatty acid uptake and intramyocellular triacylglycerol turnover may be very important to limit the accumulation of lipid intermediates. The use of metabolic inflexibility, defined as the impaired capacity to increase fat oxidation upon increased fatty acid availability and to switch between fat and glucose as the primary fuel source after a meal, does more justice to the complexity of changes in fuel oxidation during the day. Fatty acid availability, uptake and oxidation all play a role in metabolic flexibility and insulin resistance. During high fatty acid availability, fatty acid transporters may limit cellular and mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and thus limit fat oxidation. After a meal, when the demand for fatty acids as fuel is low, an increased fractional extraction of lipids from plasma may promote intramyocellular lipid accumulation and insulin resistance.

Plasma-assisted detonation of aluminum-water vapour mixtures is studied in normal condition. PAC gas dynamics and PAC electrodynamics are studied in this work also. It is obtained that there is high electric positive potential (up to 7000 V) on plasmoid’s surfac...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} solutions of the NURISP VVER lattice benchmark using APOLLO 2, TRIPOLI 4 and COBAYA 3 pin-by-pin. The {{main objective}} is to validate MOC based calculation schemes for pin-by-pin cross-section generation with APOLLO 2 against TRIPOLI 4 reference results. A specific {{objective is to}} test the APOLLO 2 generated cross-sections and interface discontinuity factors in COBAYA 3 pin-by-pin calculations with unstructured mesh. The VVER- 1000 core consists of large hexagonal assemblies with 2 mm inter-assembly water gaps which {{require the use of}} unstructured meshes in the pin-by-pin core simulators. The considered 2 D benchmark problems include 19 -pin <b>clusters,</b> <b>fuel</b> assemblies and 7 -assembly clusters. APOLLO 2 calculation schemes with the step characteristic method (MOC) and the higher-order Linear Surface MOC have been tested. The comparison of APOLLO 2 vs. TRIPOLI 4 results shows a very close agreement. The 3 D lattice solver in COBAYA 3 uses transport corrected multi-group diffusion approximation with interface discontinuity factors of GET or Black Box Homogenization type. The COBAYA 3 pin-by-pin results in 2, 4 and 8 energy groups are close to the reference solutions when using side-dependent interface discontinuity factors...|$|R
40|$|Space-based {{tracking}} {{missions are}} an emerging interest {{that could be}} accomplished using a cluster of microsatellites. This thesis addresses the design of microsatellite clusters to accurately track a target in a probabilistic suborbital occupancy corridor by pursuing the following: orbit determination using optimal measurement principles, cluster design heuristics and <b>fuel</b> optimal <b>cluster</b> maintenance. These are all evaluated on a high-fidelity simulation testbed. First, the orbital determination approach utilizes optimal measurement principles to design a constellation of clusters that minimizes the average model-based target tracking error. A two part approach, (1) constellation design and (2) cluster design, reduces the overall orbit determination complexity. The constellation design provides continuous, 24 hour coverage of the occupancy corridor and virtual formation centers about which the cluster design formulates the relative microsatellite orbits. Results suggest that satellite separations, rather {{than the number of}} the microsatellites in the cluster, are more important for providing target tracking accuracy. (cont.) Results also show that the J 2 -induced relative drift of the satellites in a cluster can be reduced by several orders of magnitude with very little degradation in the cluster's tracking capability. Second, this research formulates a cluster design heuristic that provides a robust cluster viewing geometry for a target in any direction. This robust design heuristic provides tracking capability for a cluster that is demonstrated to be comparable to one specifically tuned for a particular target orbit. Third, this thesis presents a receding horizon Model Predictive Control approach to cluster maintenance that exhibits reduced cluster-wide fuel expenditure by allowing relative satellite drift while maintaining mission driven cluster characteristics. The controller achieves this performance by being robust to unmodeled dynamics and noise. Finally, the performance of the integrated cluster-based orbit determination, tracking and control laws is demonstrated on a high-fidelity, multi-satellite simulation testbed. Results include tracking performance and trade-offs as a function of various control objectives. by John Daniel Griffith. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|This study {{takes on}} the issue of {{political}} and socio-economic conditions for the hydrogen economy as part of a future low carbon society in Europe. It is subdivided into two parts. A first part reviews the current EU policy framework in view of its impact on hydrogen and fuel cell development. In the second part an analysis of the regional dynamics and possible hydrogen and <b>fuel</b> cell <b>clusters</b> is carried out. The current EU policy framework does not hinder hydrogen development. Yet it does not constitute a strong push factor either. EU energy policies have the strongest impact on hydrogen and fuel cell development even though their potential is still underexploited. Regulatory policies have a weak but positive impact on hydrogen. EU spending policies show some inconsistencies. Regions with a high activity level in HFC also are generally innovative regions. Moreover, the article points out certain industrial clusters that favours some regions' conditions for taking part in the HFC development. However, existing hydrogen infrastructure seems to play a minor role for region's engagement. An overall well-functioning regional innovation system is important in the formative phase of an HFC innovation system, but that further research is needed before qualified policy implications can be drawn. Looking ahead the current policy framework at EU level does not set clear long term signals and lacks incentives that are strong enough to facilitate high investment in and deployment of sustainable energy technologies. The likely overall effect thus seems to be too weak to enable the EU hydrogen and fuel cell deployment strategy. According to our analysis an enhanced EU policy framework pushing for sustainability in general and the development of hydrogen and fuel cells in particular requires the following: 1) A strong EU energy policy with credible long term targets; 2) better coordination of EU policies: Europe needs a common understanding of key taxation concepts (green taxation, internalisation of externalities) and a common approach for the market introduction of new energy technologies; 3) an EU cluster policy as an attempt to better coordinate and support of European regions in their efforts to further develop HFC and to set up the respective infrastructure. ...|$|R
