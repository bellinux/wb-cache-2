FSS is the combination of either conducting patches or apertures in a thin conducting sheet arranged periodically in one or two dimensional array. FSS possess frequency selective behavior based on the element geometry. Patch type of FSS exhibits total reflection around resonant frequency whereas aperture type exhibits total transmission. This thesis presents the modelling, simulation, fabrication and test measurements of the FSS that is transparent to GSM and UMTS frequency band. FSS with a double square loop aperture as a unit cell is selected for the analysis. The modelling and simu-lation of the FSS are carried out in the Computer Simulation Technology (CST) micro-wave studio, 2012 version. FSS prototype is fabricated using the commercial available aluminum foil. Furthermore, the FSS prototype is tested in the laboratory as well as in real-time networks. The real-time or field measurement is conducted in the real networks for all three operators of Finland, namely DNA, Elisa and TeliaSonera. The laboratory result shows the resonant frequency shift downwards by a factor of 1. 22 comparing to the simulation results of freestanding FSS. The reason behind such frequency shift is well explained by the presence of a dielectric substrate in FSS prototype. On average, for all operators the field measurement result shows the transmission improvement of around 10 dB and 4. 5 dB in GSM and UMTS band respectively over the plain aluminum foil. Although the field measurement result does not show much improvement compared to the laboratory measurement result, it still prevails the possibility of using FSS for indoor coverage improvement...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe <b>repeater</b> <b>indoor</b> {{positioning}} system {{is based on}} the use of GNSS repeaters in order to provide GNSS availability indoors through the way of an amplification of the signals received on an outdoor (typically on the roof) antenna. The complete system, already described in previous conferences, uses four repeaters in order to provide a full 3 D 1 to 2 meter accuracy indoor positioning. The measurements, at the receiver end, are the pseudo-ranges at the instant of transition from one repeater to the next, the transmission being achieved through a sequential scheme (only one repeater transmitting at any given time). This approach implements a sort of "time differential" approach that provides such a good positioning accuracy. Unfortunately, {{it is not possible to}} improve this accuracy since the sequential scheme does not allow for carrier phase measurements. The pseudolite system allows such measurements but has the problems of synchronisation (not present in the case of repeaters since we are using the GNSS constellation time) and near-far. Repealites (a shortcut between repeater and pseudolite) is a recent concept under consideration. We still use an identical signal transmitted from all the so-called repealites but which is slightly delayed for each transmitter. The correlation function, at the receiver end, now shows N primary peaks in the case of N transmitting repealites. Interference problems and near-far effects have been addressed in previous papers and we are now interested in the positioning accuracy resulting from carrier phase measurements. The multipath problem, very acute indoors, is dealt with through the use of the SMICL (Short Multipath Insensitive Code Loop) design. Ambiguity resolution and resulting accuracies are presented through both the theoretical and experimental aspect...|$|R

The multipath problem is dealt with through the use of the SMICL (Short Multipath Insensitive Code Loop) design, already fully described in previous papers. In addition regulations tend to be provided for both repeaters and pseudolites and must be taken into account. The complete system, including both the infrastructure to be deployed and the various algorithms required at the receiver end (mainly the tracking loops), has been implemented in such a way it is possible to test and evaluate the indoor positioning in all desired environments. Thus, measurement campaigns were performed in Italy and in France in various indoor environments including large halls, classrooms, amphitheatre and car parks. Various receivers were also tested with different receiving bandwidth, ranging from 2 to 30 MHz, using either a standard Delay Locked Loop or the above mentioned SMICL approach. Results are provided concerning of course the accuracy of the achieved positioning, but also a full comparison of the performance of the receivers and associated data processing. All these results are also presented for the various tested environment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIndoor {{positioning}} with GNSS encounters several limitations. One is {{the power}} of the signal that is too weak indoors. The Assisted-GNSS (A-GNSS) and High sensitivity GNSS (HS-GNSS) are answers to the weak signal problem. They allow decreasing the detection level of the satellite signal down to - 150 or - 160 dBm which makes signals measurable in "light indoor" environments ("light indoor" corresponds to environments where the signal is not totally absent like the top floor of a building or nearby the windows). However the attenuation of walls and roof can easily overtake 30 dB in very common cases: A-GNSS and HS-GNSS are then inefficient. The GNSS <b>repeater</b> based <b>indoor</b> positioning system, already fully described in previous papers [1], proposes to solve the problem with a low cost infrastructure. This method is based on the use of so-called GNSS repeaters that have the role of collecting the GNSS signals in the best possible environment (namely outdoors {{on the roof of the}} building) or from a GNSS signal generator. A local network of antennas is deployed indoors and linked to the signal source (the signal generator or the roof antenna), in order to recreate a local constellation of repeaters whose positions have to be known to the receiver. The signal source is sequentially transmitted in such a way that each antenna broadcasts the signal during a limited period of time. Thus, a cycle of emission is obtained. A full cycle is obtained when all the antennas have broadcasted the signal once. When the first cycle is finished, another one starts, and so on. If we consider a receiver located indoors which is measuring the pseudo-ranges from all the satellites, we observe a jump in the measurements of the pseudo-ranges. Let us consider d 1 the distance between the antenna of the Receiver and the antenna of Repeater 1 and d 2 the distance between the antenna of the Receiver and the antenna of Repeater 2. Then, if the cables from the source to the antennas of the repeaters have the same length, this jump corresponds to the difference d 2 -d 1. At the end of a cycle (with a network of 4 repeaters) we have enough measurements to calculate a 3 D position. This is a very low cost infrastructure solution for indoor positioning since the electronics managing the sequence of emission is very simple. However, the Repeater technique does not solve the problem of the presence of strong short multipath that limits the accuracy of the pseudo-range measurements, and consequently the differences of pseudo-ranges. Multipath error is difficult to predict and changes in space and over time [2]. For this reason, there are no really accurate models for multipath indoors. Nevertheless, many techniques were developed to reduce the effect of multipath on code measurements. These techniques improve considerably the synchronization error, especially in the case of medium and long multipath. However, for short multipath, the error remains substantial. In addition, for indoor positioning where an accuracy of a few meters is required, these techniques are not sufficient. Considering the GPS L 1 civil signal, our definition of short multipath is the ones having a delay length inferior to 146. 5 m (half a chip of code). Thus we can consider that <b>indoor</b> applications using <b>repeaters</b> mainly involve only short multipath which is generated after reflections on nearby objects, as shown in [2]. The main goal is to find a way to remove short delay multipath effect on code measurements in order to improve the accuracy of pseudo-range difference measurements in the very specific context of the repeater based technique. A specific tracking loop discriminator (the so-called SMICL) which is able to mitigate the short multipath was developed to fulfill the goal. The theoretical description and validation of the new loop discriminator are available in [3] and [4] respectively...|$|R
