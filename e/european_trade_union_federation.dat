40|$|Transnational {{restructuring}} is {{the most}} important subject of transnational company agreements (Tcas) at the Eu level. Ewcs, <b>European</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Federations</b> (Etufs) and other union organisations have negotiated and signed a growing number of European restructuring agreements since 2000. This article presents an inventory of these agreements, concentrating on the substantive ones. They generally provide guarantees against plant closures and for employment protection, guarantees for the employees transferred within or outside the company (including similar employment conditions and rights), as well as measures to avoid forced redundancies. Some also include procedural rules about the consultation of the employee representatives and the monitoring of the agreement. They required a delegation of the capacity to negotiate from the national to the European level and at least three types of coordination: between the national level and the European level, between the Ewc and national <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> between the Ewc and one or several Etufs. This coordination has evolved over time. There has been a growing involvement of the Etufs, which have adopted internal mandating rules and are now recognized by a growing number of companies as signatory parties of Tcas...|$|R

40|$|European social {{dialogue}} refers, at the strict {{sense of the}} term, to bilateral negotiations between <b>European</b> <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> and employers’ <b>federations.</b> Social dialogue committees are organized at the cross-sectoral level {{as well as at}} the sectoral level. Currently, 40 professional sectors such as agriculture, chemical industry or telecommunications, have created a {{social dialogue}} committee. If social dialogue committees were at first mainly consultative bodies, in the 1990 ’s European social partners were encouraged to develop bilateral relations and to sign joint texts. In terms of outcomes, 70 joint texts were issued by the cross-sectoral organisations and more than 500 texts at the sectoral level (European Commission 2010). If social partners have the possibility to transform their text in Council decisions such as Directives, most part of the texts consist in process-oriented texts such as frameworks of actions, guidelines or joint opinions (Degryse & Pochet 2011, European Commission 2004). National transposition rely thus on voluntary processes that are largely dependent on the national social partners goodwill and capabilities (Pochet et al. 2009). Because of the non-binding character of the texts, questions about the legitimacy and the efficiency of the European social dialogue were raised (Keller 2008). For now, there is no systematic evaluation of the implementation and the European social partners themselves meet difficulties to receive information about it. Yet, to understand the implementation process better is crucial because it raises the possibility of a European coordination and eventually the construction of a social Europe. In this communication, from an empirical research comparing two sectors and ten countries, we will highlight the mechanisms and the conditions that could favor an effective transposition of the joint texts within the EU member States. Through Europeanisation and multi-level governance approaches, we show that by exploring the actors’ games and their actions and interactions on the national level and on the European level, we can seize the Europeanisation process at stake. Consequently, implementation seems to be linked to the mobilisation of the national social partners in the European social dialogue committees as well as the constraints and the opportunities of their national context...|$|R
