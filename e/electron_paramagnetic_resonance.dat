In the same manner, radical coupling reactions between I, II, and III may occur via radicals at C- 4 -O and C- 5 to form 5 -O- 4 or 5 - 5 linkages. Indeed, linkages between some of the monolignol tetramers present in the reaction products were identified as being constructed by 5 -O- 4 and 5 - 5 linkages. This result {{is consistent with previous}} reports about linkages among monolignol dimers and oligomers [35, 36]. In LC–MS chromatograms of all single-component reaction products, shown in Figs.  4 a, 5 a, and 6 a, major peaks for monolignol tetramers with 5 -O- 4 and 5 - 5 linkages were recorded. Some previous studies on computer simulations of electron densities and <b>electron</b> <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> suggested that II was hardly oxidized by peroxidase [37, 38].

Both equilibrium dialysis and Job plot experiments suggest that the functional groups in each monomeric residue are an effective site of binding for one metal ion. Reduction potentials, as obtained by cyclic voltammetric measurements, indicate that (i) coordination of the aforementioned polymeric ligands to Cu 2 + ions stabilizes the oxidized species, and (ii) iron complexes have an oxidation power definitely higher than that of the corresponding copper compounds. <b>Electron</b> <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> (100 or 6 K) and Mossbauer (r. t.) spectra suggest that the order of increasing distortion from idealized geometry is Me(n+) -chitosan almost-equal-to Me(n+) -(3) < Me(n+) -(2) less-than-or-equal-to Me(n+) -(1).

40|$|The {{influence}} of the intrinsic spin of electrons on the propagation of circularly polarized waves in a magnetized plasma is considered. New eigenmodes are identified, one of which propagates below the electron cyclotron frequency, one above the spin-precession frequency, and another close to the spin-precession frequency. The latter corresponds to the spin modes in ferromagnets under certain conditions. In the nonrelativistic motion of electrons, the spin effects become noticeable even when the external magnetic field B_ 0 is below the quantum critical magnetic field strength, i. e., B_ 0 < B_Q = 4. 4138 × 10 ^ 9 T and the electron density satisfies n_ 0 ≫ n_c≃ 10 ^ 32 m^- 3.

The resonance spectra of 0. 01 M solutions of these compounds in benzene exhibit a hyperfine structure arising from a spherically symmetrical contribution of the magnetic dipole interaction between the unpaired electron and the nuclear magnetic moments of the hydrogen atoms. The g‐factors for the compounds investigated in the first three classes were found to be 2. 0025 ± 0. 0004 and 2. 0031 ± 0. 0004 for the last compound. Such a close approach of the g‐factor to the free electron value plus the sharpness of the hyperfine structure lines indicates that the anisotropic contributions of the spin‐orbit interaction, which would normally lift the degeneracy of the triplet state, are averaged out by the tumbling of the molecules...|$|R

Using <b>electron</b> <b>paramagnetic</b> spin <b>resonance</b> (EPR), we show that this rotation aligns the two membrane-binding regions in the helical domain toward the lipid bilayer, allowing membrane interaction. A loop rearrangement in GTPase domain creates a new interface for oligomer formation.

5|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{technological}} important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films.

As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions.

40|$|Two {{steps are}} {{involved}} in the uptake of Cr(VI) : (1) the diffusion of the anion CrO 2 − 4 through a facilitated transport system, presumably the non-specific anion carrier and (2) the intracellular reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The intracellular reduction of Cr(VI), keeping the cytoplasmic concentration of Cr(VI) low, facilitates accumulation of chromate from extracellular medium into the cell. In the present paper, a direct demonstration of intracellular chromium reduction is provided by means of <b>electron</b> <b>paramagnetic</b> (spin) <b>resonance</b> (EPR) spectroscopy. Incubation of metabolically active rat thymocytes with chromate originates a signal which can be attributed to a paramagnetic species of chromium, Cr(V) or Cr(III). The EPR signal is originated by intracellular reduction of chromium since: (1) it is observed only when cells are incubated with chromate, (2) it is present even after extensive washings of the cells in a chromium-free medium; (3) it is abolished when cells are incubated with drugs able to reduce the glutathione pool, i. e., diethylmaleate or phorone; and (4) it is abolished when cells are incubated {{in the presence of a}} specific inhibitor of the anion carrier, 4 -acetamido- 4 ′-isothiocyanatostilbene- 2 - 2 ′-disulfonic acid...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{in vitro}} {{studies have shown that}} {{isolated}} mitochondria can generate oxygen radicals. However, whether a similar phenomenon can also occur in intact organs is unknown. In the present studwy,e tested the hypothesis that resumption of mitochondrial respiration upon reperfusion might be a mechanism of oxygen radical formation in postischemic hearts, and that treatment with inhibitorosf mitochondrial respiration might prevent this phenomenon. Three groups of Langendorff- perfused rabbit hearts were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia at 37 “C, followed by reflow. Throughout ischemia and early reperfusion the hearts received, respectively: (a) 6 mM KC 1 (controls), (b) 6 mM sodium amobarbital (Amytal“, which blocks mitochondrial respiration at Site I, at the level of NADH dehydrogenase), and (c) 6 mM potassium cyanide (to block mitochondrial respiration distallya, t the level of cytochrome c oxidase). The hearts were thperonc essed to directly evaluatoex ygen radical generationb y <b>electron</b> <b>paramagnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> pectroscopy, or to measure oxygen radical-induced membrane lipid peroxidation by malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) content of subcellular fractions. Severity of ischemia, as assessed by “P-nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of cardiac ATP, phosphocreatine, and pH, was similar in all groups. Oxygen-centered free radical concentration averaged 3. 84 f 0. 64 PM in reperfused control hearts, and it was significantly reduced by Amytal treatment (1. 98 2 0. 26; p < 0. 06), but not by KCN (2. 68 f 0. 96 PM; p = not significant (NS)), consistent with oxygen radicals being formed in them itochondrial respiratory chain at Site I. Membrane lipid peroxidation of reperfused hearts was also reduced by treatment with Amytal, but not with KCN. MDA content of the mitochondrial fraction averaged 0. 76 f 0. 06 nM/mg protein in controls, 0. 72 f 0. 06 in KCN-treated hearts, and 0. 64 groups). Similarly, MDA content of lysosomal membrane fraction was 0. 64 f 0. 09 nM/mg protein in controls, 0. 79 C 0. 16 in KCN-treated hearts, and 0. 43 2 0. 06 in Amytal-treated hearts (p 0. 06 versus both groups). Since the effects of Amytal are known to be reversible, in a second series of experiments we investigated whether transient mitochondrial inhibition during the initial 1 0 min of reperfusion wasa lso associated with beneficial effects on subsequent recovery of cardiac function after wash-out of the drug. At the end of the experiment, recoveroyf left ventriculaer nddiastolic and of developed pressure was significantly greater in those hearts that had been treated with Amytal during ischemia and earlyre flow, as compared to untreated hearts. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that in intact hearts electron flow through the respiratory chain may be an important source of oxygen radicals, which may form at the sites of interactions between Fe-S clusters and ubiquinone, and that resumption of mitochondrial respiration upon reoxygenation might contribute to reperfusion injury...|$|R

Ferromagnetism below T_C (5. 4 +/- 0. 3) K can be well described by critical scaling laws M(T) (1 -T/T_C) ^β with a critical exponent β = (0. 34 +/- 0. 2)), suggesting 3 D Heisenberg class magnetism instead of e. g. 2 D-type coupling between Mn-spins in van der Waals gap sites.

FhaC belongs to the ubiquitous Omp 85 superfamily of protein transporters. The X-ray structure of FhaC shows that the transmembrane β-barrel channel hypothesized {{to serve as the}} FHA-conducting pore is obstructed by two structural elements conserved among TpsB transporters, an N-terminal α helix and an extracellular loop.
