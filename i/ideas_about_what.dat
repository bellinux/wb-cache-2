500|$|Potter was an unsentimental naturalist {{who thought}} no {{creature}} either good or bad, {{and had no}} qualms describing earwigs in Mrs. Tittlemouse's passage or woodlice in her pantry. Her publisher Harold Warne however had different <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> was appropriate for a children's book. He had become accustomed to Potter's unusual choice of animal subjects through the years, but, ever sensitive to public reaction, thought she had gone a bit too far in Mrs. Tittlemouse with the earwig and the woodlice. [...] The earwig was, at his behest, transmogrified into a beetle and the woodlice into [...] "creepy-crawly people" [...] hiding in Mrs. Tittlemouse's plate rack. [...] "I can alter the text, when I get the proofs," [...] she wrote, [...] "and will erase the offensive word 'wood-lice'!" [...] Potter argued for the generic term [...] "slaters" [...] for the woodlice, but was overruled.

"Equus October" [...] {{was born}} out of a song that the band were {{considering}} discarding because they were never able to finish it until they entered the studio and changed their minds, wanting more material on the album. They decided to use a riff from it only as an interlude that ran 30 seconds long, but they came up with more <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> to do with it during the mixing process, eventually increasing the length of the song. Rubalcaba explained that the bass guitar line remained a constant fixture on jam sessions between himself and Eginton, and they decided to give it a chance by recording it at the album's sessions. Once Mitchell also began adding material to the song, Rubalcaba felt it started taking on a [...] "strong & majestic yet mournful" [...] sensation, almost as if it were about a ritualistic sacrifice. He later discovered the ritual of the October Horse and based the song's title on that of the ritual. [...] "It took on the feeling I had about the jam & how it just completely comes crashing down so abruptly at the end," [...] he explained. Expanding the song in the studio led the group to want to use it as an interlude that leads into the album's title track.|$|E

The inspiration for the episode came from the concept of [...] "thrillionaires", a term the Simpsons writers found in an issue of The Economist to describe millionaires who [...] "do really incredible stunts" [...] and [...] "go on amazing adventures". The episode's third act went through several incarnations, and the writers {{had a lot of}} <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> Burns should do once he has captured the Loch Ness monster. Eventually, the staff settled on the act's current iteration, which was conceived by Simpsons writer George Meyer. According to current showrunner Al Jean, the color of the Loch Ness monster would originally be green, but when the overseas animation was completed, the Loch Ness monster had a [...] "kind of pinkish" [...] color. Because it would be too expensive to re-color all the cels in which the monster appears, the staff decided to air the episode as it was, even though the monster was in the wrong color.

Morris blamed what he saw as a misguided effort to be [...] "left-field and trendy" [...] on Lil B's internet hype and coverage in the indie rock press. The Quietus praised the album as [...] "baffling, flawed but utterly engrossing", and said Lil B's flow is [...] "more measured but no less dexterous than his contemporaries, and the pace of his eloquent, brooding verses lend themselves well to the alien, frosted glass synth sounds and syrupy electronics that form the majority of the backing tracks here. Rain In England comes across like the work of some rap savant, a man whose inner filter has been disabled, creating something which may polarise but which is, at least, utterly distinctive."

They briefly meet a youth called Joel whose idea of Batman reflects characterizations and costumes portrayed within Schumacher's Batman and Robin. The teens treat Joel's ideas with utter disdain. In Watchmen, director Zack Snyder and comic book artist Dave Gibbons chose to parody the molded muscle and nipple Batsuit design from Batman & Robin for the Ozymandias costume.

Additionally, there were worries within Warner Bros. surrounding the negative critical reaction to Batman & Robin and how that may come to harm the success of the subsequent direct-to-video animated film , which was originally planned for release at around the same time as Batman & Robin but was subsequently delayed. However, SubZero received a far stronger positive response from critics than Batman & Robin, with Mr. Freeze's role within it being seen in a much more positive light, returning his popularity as a Batman villain to a level comparable to that reached by him within the two Emmy-winning episodes the character featured in of [...]|$|E

Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, the former assistant editor of Help!, said that Little Annie Fanny was not as sharp as Kurtzman's earlier work: [...] "technically brilliant but... slightly compromised." [...] Art agent and publisher Denis Kitchen, who handles Kurtzman and Eisner's estates, said that [...] "most Kurtzman devotees would not consider Little Annie Fanny genius work... some would argue the opposite: that it was genius diluted or degraded". Kitchen placed the onus on Kurtzman's employer Hefner, who [...] "was often a punctilious taskmaster with a heavy red pen who often had very different <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> was funny or satiric" [...] and insisted that each strip [...] "had to include Annie disrobing". Beauchamp agreed: [...] "Unfortunately, Hefner was notorious for his heavy editorial hand." [...] Duncan and Smith also agreed, and wrote that [...] "humor sometimes mixes awkwardly with the loaded topics of the era, and some have found Annie's lack of character development and the requisite sexual hijinks an impediment to taking her seriously."
