40|$|Capital {{rationing}} {{and reporting}} are often combined to allocate resources in firms. Trust in managers' honest reports and distrustful control create an interesting tension. How do managers {{respond to this}} ambivalence of trust and control? We develop an analytical model to predict, first, that managers reciprocate distrust; they misreport heavily so as to sabotage profitable investments. Second, reporting reduces in turn sabotage because managers are reluctant to lie. Third, honesty spills over, in addition, to inhibit managers' reciprocity. Evidence from a laboratory experiment supports our predictions. Our study ties capital rationing and reporting to the psychological factors of reciprocity and honesty and helps us understand their effects in budgeting. From a managerial viewpoint, the value of reporting, even in combination with capital rationing, may be as <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> as <b>how</b> sabotage further exacerbates the underinvestment which is known to arise from capital rationing...|$|R

40|$|Having been an {{observer}} {{of public policy}} towards Crown copyright {{for a number of}} years now it is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> just <b>how</b> far government has moved over the past decade in its stance on the issue. What began as a fairly entrenched viewpoint that Crown copyright was a necessary instrument of control over the process of official publication, seems now to have moved forward to a position that permits more radical thinking about the policy. Originally the enforcement of Crown copyright was seen as a means of maintaining control over the publication of the material, with a licensing policy for re-use and added-value exploitation by the private sector publishing industry. The private sector itself had long argued that the policy diminished prospects for the proper exploitation of official information. This it argued had had a detrimental effect, both for the industry itself and the degree to which the information might be used for the benefit of the national economy. Government began to listen to these arguments but HM Treasury consistently maintained the need for departments and agencies to recover costs and in some cases obtain profits from the distribution of official information. It was seen very much as a resource belonging to cost centres that should be exploited. Since the fall of the former Conservative Government it has become clear that those engaged in this debate are no longer as committed to these trenchant positions as they once were. Instead it would seem that a more open debate is underway within a broader reassessment of the nature, organization and functioning of the public services.

The King at last allowed himself, though rather unwillingly, to be won over by Red's persistency, and one day asked Ring to go and kill the oxen that were in the wood for him, and bring their horns and hides to him in the evening. Not knowing how dangerous the oxen were, Ring was quite ready, and went off at once, to the great delight of Red, who was now sure of his death.|$|E
40|$|During {{last year}} Sweden {{received}} many immigrants that was fleeing humanitarian disasters and war. Many that arrived was unaccompanied children that {{for different reasons}} came to Sweden without their families and kin. The Swedish municipalities {{has a responsibility to}} give this children roof over their head, give them a meaningful leisure and to integrate the children into the Swedish society. It is therefore <b>interesting</b> and important <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> well the Swedish municipalities is handling this aspect of their responsibility. The method of the study is qualitative conversational interview and the reason to this is that the method allows us to get {{a deeper understanding of the}} studied field. The goal of this study is to explore the cooperation among Swedish municipalities and sport clubs to strengthen the integration for unaccompanied immigrant children. The conclusion of this work is that the Swedish municipalities does not take a bigger responsibility than sports clubs regarding the work of integration for immigrant children through leisure activities. It should be said, regarding last year’s large immigrant stream that the municipalities has had a substantial amount of work and pressure to live up to their area of responsibility. Integration through sport clubs and other activities has therefore not been a priority. It is also a question of resources and cooperation, the clubs does not have resources to integrate the children nor the knowledge. The municipalities and the Länsidrottsförbund needs to have joint contribution to the sports clubs...|$|R
30|$|In the {{cultural}} preference, change in immigrants’ preferences for food, {{music and art}} under {{the effect of the}} host culture and the impact of immigrants on the arts, cuisine, music and fashion of the host society is included. In Spain and Italy, we still do not find fusion of Indian music and cuisine with the host ones, like we see in other countries of Indian diaspora (e.g. the UK Bhangra Pop music and Manchester’s Curry lane). Some of the Indians stick to their traditional Indian vegetarian diet mainly because of their religious beliefs, like Gagandeep, 21, male, a baptised Sikh from Hospitalet de Llobregat, says ‘I have my vegetarian diet. I don’t eat Spanish food because they put meat or eggs in all dishes’. But most of Indians have added the local dishes in their daily meals, like Gaurav, 24, male, a salesman in Madrid, Spain, says ‘I love Mediterranean food. My favourite food is Pizza and Pasta; occasionally I eat Indian food also, but now I find it very spicy’. An important change is occurring in some supermarkets in major cities of both countries: now, they provide a separate section for South Asian food, in order to satisfy the needs of the immigrant population. Moreover, Indian Bollywood music and dance is also becoming popular in some parts of Spain. In the future, it will be <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> when and <b>how</b> the Indian cuisine and music get fused with those of the host countries, and hybrid music and cuisine come out from this fusion.|$|R
500|$|Mike is {{hurt when}} new love {{interest}} Bronwyn Davies (Rachel Friend) {{chose to be}} with Henry Ramsay (Craig McLachlan). He incorrectly believes he and Jane {{have a chance of}} reconciling because when Jane and Des share a meal to discuss Mike, but Jane believed Des had invited her with romantic intentions in mind. Des does feel drawn to Jane and Jones told Darren Devlyn from the magazine that her character is [...] "really upset" [...] when Des wants to discuss Mike. Jane is nearly hit by a car and this makes Des realise that he is in love with Jane and asks her to marry him. Mike is left feeling worse that both women in his life have chosen other men. Jones told Devlyn that Des' friends still believe he is attached to the memory of his late wife Daphne Clarke (Elaine Smith). She explained that because of Daphne [...] "it's natural that the proposal comes as a big shock." [...] Both characters had been left emotionally damaged from previous relationships but Jones believed the duo had no hesitations once they made the commitment. The actress added [...] "it's great that Des is finally over his mourning." [...] She was also looking forward to her character taking the role of step-mother to Jamie. It was <b>interesting</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> Jane copes with the responsibility of looking after a child. Keane was happy with the storyline because he believed it was time for Des to move on. He was also excited to work more closely alongside Jones on the storyline.|$|R
