40|$|International audienceThe {{share of}} diesel fuel in European {{transport}} sector, which currently represents over 50 % of total 11 demand, is increasing, requiring massive imports of this product, {{while at the}} same time, gasoline fuels are 12 today in surplus. In terms of air pollutant emissions, gasoline and kerosene streams have shown potential 13 in achieving lower emissions in Compression Ignition (CI) engines, particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx) 14 and particulates. A new fuel formulation approach through the use of light fractions within diesel 15 technology could consequently address both questions of energy demand balance and reduction of diesel 16 engines pollution footprint. In this study, a fuel formulation for a Diesel engine is optimized to achieve 17 lower pollutants emissions and higher engine efficiency. The fuel matrix is based on seven refinery 18 streams representative of gasoline (Hydrotreated Straight-Run Gasoline HSRG, Hydrotreated Fluid 19 Catalytic Cracking HFCC and Reformate REF), kerosene (Hydrotreated Straight-Run Kerosene HSRK 20 and <b>Hydrocracked</b> Kerosene HCKK) and diesel cuts (Hydrotreated Straight-Run Diesel HSRD and 21 <b>Hydrocracked</b> Light Diesel HCKLD). A D-Optimal mixture design is applied to build, a 12 -run, 7 -factor fuelmatrix and the fuels are thoroughly optimized on two engine conditions at light and mid-load representativeof typical vehicle running conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was an {{understanding}} of the behavior of ring-opening catalysts concerning their activity and product selectivities in the hydroconversion of decalin when n-decane as a representative for aliphatic hydrocarbons is present. It was investigated how iridium and platinum on non-acidic silica behave as catalysts in the ring opening of decalin alone and in the hydroconversion of an equimolar mixture of decalin with n-decane. It was found that decalin is much less reactive than n-decane when the hydrocarbons are converted alone on 2. 6 Ir/silica or 2. 7 Pt/silica. In the competitive hydroconversion of the equimolar mixture, the reactivity of both feed hydrocarbons was reduced, especially the one of n-decane. It was concluded that the two-ring naphthene decalin is preferentially adsorbed and converted on the catalytically active sites. Primary products in the conversion of an equimolar decalin/n-decane mixture on 2. 6 Ir/silica were <b>hydrocracked</b> products with less than 10 carbon atoms and direct ring-opening products of decalin (dROPs). From a comparison with the results of the pure feed experiments it was possible to attribute the formation of <b>hydrocracked</b> products to the conversion of n-decane. Moreover, it was shown that the product selectivities of skeletal isomers (sk-Isos), ring-opening products (ROPs), open-chain decanes (OCDs) and <b>hydrocracked</b> products (C 9 -) in the mixed feed experiments can be calculated directly out of the product selectivities obtained in the conversion of the pure hydrocarbons. This was also found for the distribution of the dROPs and the composition of the <b>hydrocracked</b> products. Hence, it can be stated that the product selectivities of decalin and n-decane are not influenced by the presence of the respective other hydrocarbon on this non-acidic iridium catalyst. Platinum supported on non-acidic silica was found to be much less active than iridium as catalyst in the hydroconversion of decalin. Primary products of the conversion of the equimolar decalin and n-decane mixture were skeletal isomers of decalin, especially spiro[4. 5]decane, and <b>hydrocracked</b> products. These findings indicate an isomerization ability of platinum, which was also reflected in the high degree of branching of the <b>hydrocracked</b> products. It was found that much higher selectivities of OCDs were obtained in the mixed feed experiment than one would expect from the results of each pure feed hydrocarbon. This is best explained by an isomerization of n-decane on platinum and displacement of the iso-decanes by decalin before they can be <b>hydrocracked,</b> leading to high amounts of branched decanes in the product mixture. Additionally, a detailed look at the composition of the direct ring-opening products indicated a preferred hydrogenolysis of substituted carbon-carbon bonds in decalin which was not influenced by the presence of n decane. Catalysts containing 3 wt. % iridium or platinum supported on zeolite Y with different concentrations of Brønsted acid sites were prepared. An increased catalyst activity in the hydroconversion of equimolar decalin/n-decane mixtures was found with increasing concentration of Brønsted acid sites for iridium and platinum catalysts. When decalin and n-decane were converted solely on the iridium catalysts, n-decane was significantly more reactive than decalin. But, with increasing Brønsted acid site concentration of the catalyst, the reactivity difference gets smaller. It is striking, that the reactivity of decalin and n-decane was inverted when both hydrocarbons were converted competitively. An explanation for this finding was obtained by breakthrough measurements. Decalin was found to be preferentially adsorbed on the Ir/Na,H-Y catalysts. Hence, decalin gets preferred access to the catalytically active sites and is consequently hydroconverted preferentially. On the platinum counterparts to the Ir/Na,H-Y catalysts, a very high isomerization activity was found in the hydroconversion of decalin. In addition, the presence of n-decane did not cause a change in the product selectivities, but as on the Ir/Na,H-Y catalysts, the formation of OCDs was favored and the formation of C 9 - products was slightly suppressed in the competitive hydroconversion of decalin/n-decane. Besides zeolite Y, also zeolites Beta, EMC- 2, L, MOR and ZSM- 5 with different pore systems were loaded with ca. 3 wt. % iridium. On all these catalysts pure n-decane was found to be more reactive than pure decalin. However, the reactivity was inverted when an equimolar mixture of decalin and n-decane was used as feed on the Beta and EMC- 2 catalysts. Those were the catalysts with the highest selectivities of OCDs, among them was 3. 3 Ir/H 0. 58,Cs 0. 42 -Beta- 14, the catalyst on which the highest yields of OCDs were obtained within this work. Decalin was converted preferably on these HIPEROCs in the competitive hydroconversion of decalin and n-decane. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} <b>hydrocracked</b> products from the n-decane hydroconversion on the HIPEROC 3. 3 Ir/H 0. 58,Cs 0. 42 -Beta- 14 consist exclusively of n-alkanes indicating a purely hydrogenolytic carbon-carbon bond scission. At the same time, iso-decanes were formed which possess a distribution of methylnonanes and ethyloctanes which was reported for the isomerization of n-decane on bifunctional isomerization catalysts. It was concluded that both mechanisms proceed simultaneously in the hydroconversion of n-decane on HIPEROCs. This finding supports and gives independent evidence for a mechanism advanced recently for the hydroconversion of decalin on HIPEROCs. Molybdenum carbide was tested as a possible cheaper substitute for noble metals in the ring opening catalysts. Bulk molybdenum carbide turned out to be hardly active in the ring opening of decalin. The primary products were skeletal isomers of decalin, especially spiro[4. 5]decane. With bulk molybdenum carbide as catalyst, open-chain decanes were formed with low selectivities only, whereas <b>hydrocracked</b> products, especially methane, were predominantly made. Catalysts consisting of &# 946;-Mo 2 C supported on zeolite Y were also prepared. &# 946;-Mo 2 C supported on non-acidic zeolite Y turned out to have a very poor activity in the hydroconversion of decalin. The product selectivities were similar as those observed on bulk molybdenum carbide. Upon increasing the concentration of Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite, both the catalytic activity and the selectivities of ROPs and OCDs increased. However, these catalysts showed a considerable contribution of the paring reaction leading to the undesired products iso-butane and methylcyclopentane, as indicated by M-shaped carbon number distribution curves of the <b>hydrocracked</b> products. In an attempt to optimize the &# 946;-Mo 2 C/zeolite Y catalysts, the nSi/nAl ratio of the zeolite was varied between 2. 4 and 105 and the molybdenum loading between 5 and 20 wt. %. The best selectivities of OCDs were achieved with the catalyst 9. 8 Mo 2 C/H 0. 99,Na 0. 01 -Y- 7. More generally speaking, intermediate molybdenum loadings around 10 wt. % and an nSi/nAl ratio of zeolite Y around 7 appear to be favorable for these alternative ring-opening catalysts. In der vorliegenden Arbeit untersucht, wie sich Produktselektivitäten verhalten, wenn an Katalysatoren für die selektive Ringöffnung von Decalin äquimolare Mischungen von Decalin und n-Decan umgesetzt werden. Diese Mischungen dienen als Modell sowohl für naphthenische als auch aliphatische Komponenten in einem realen Einsatzöl, aber auch für gebildete offenkettige Decane und deren Edukt. Deshalb wurde in einem ersten Schritt eine äquimolare Mischung von Decalin und n-Decan an Iridium bzw. Platin geträgert auf nichtsaurem Silica umgesetzt, um die katalytischen Eigenschaften der Edelmetalle allein zu untersuchen. n-Decan stellte sich im Vergleich mit Decalin als deutlich reaktiver heraus, wenn es als Reinkomponente umgesetzt wurde. Im Gegensatz dazu waren die Reaktivitäten der beiden Kohlenwasserstoffe, insbesondere die von n-Decan, bei der konkurrierenden Umsetzung vermindert, so dass dort beide Einsatzkohlenwasserstoffe einen nahezu identischen Umsatzverlauf mit der Temperatur zeigten. Primäre Produkte bei der konkurrierenden Umsetzung von Decalin und n-Decan an 2. 6 Ir/Silica waren direkte Ringöffnungsprodukte (dROPs) und Crackprodukte (C 9 -). Durch den Vergleich der so erhaltenen Produkt¬selektivitäten mit den Selektivitäten aus der Umsetzung der reinen Kohlenwasserstoffe konnte die Bildung der Crackprodukte auf die Umsetzung von n-Decan zurückgeführt werden. Weiterhin ließen sich die Produktselektivitäten der Decalin-Gerüstisomere (sk-Isos), der Ringöffnungs¬produkte (ROPs), der offenkettigen Decane (OCDs) und der Crackprodukte in der Gemischumsetzung direkt aus den erzielten Produktselektivitäten bei der Umsetzung der Reinkomponenten berechnen. Dadurch ließ sich zeigen, dass die Produktselektivitäten an 2. 6 Ir/Silica durch die Anwesenheit des jeweils anderen Kohlenwasserstoffs nicht beeinflusst werden. Im Gegensatz zu Iridium erwies sich Platin als deutlich inaktiver in der Umsetzung von Decalin, was sich in stark erhöhten Reaktionstemperaturen zeigte, die für dessen Umsetzung notwendig waren. Die primären Produkte der Umsetzung einer äquimolaren Decalin/n-Decan-Mischung waren sk-Isos, wobei Spiro[4. 5]decan hervorstach, und Crackprodukte. Die Zusammen¬setzung der direkten Ringöffnungsprodukte von Decalin zeigte keine Veränderung bei gleichzeitiger Umsetzung von n-Decan. Es wurde jeweils bevorzugt die substituierte C-C Bindung von Decalin zu Butylcyclohexan geöffnet. Es wurden in der Folge zeolithische Katalysatoren bestehend aus 3 Massen % Iridium oder Platin geträgert auf Zeolith Y mit unterschiedlichen Konzentrationen an Brønsted Säurezentren hergestellt und in der hydrierenden Umsetzung von Decalin und n-Decan getestet. Dabei zeigte sich eine erhöhte Katalysatoraktivität mit zunehmender Konzentration an Brønsted-Säure¬zentren. Wie schon an den nichtsauren Katalysatoren war auch hier n-Decan deutlich reaktiver als Decalin im direkten Vergleich bei der Umsetzung der jeweiligen reinen Kohlenwasserstoffe. Allerdings wird der Reaktivitätsunterschied zwischen n-Decan und Decalin mit zunehmender Konzentration an Brønsted Säurezentren des Katalysators geringer. Wenn eine äquimolare Mischung aus Decalin und n-Decan umgesetzt wurde, zeigte sich eine invertierte Reaktivität der beiden Einsatzkohlenwasserstoffe – in diesen Fällen reagierte Decalin bevorzugt. Eine Erklärung für dieses Verhalten konnte mit Durchbruchsmessungen von Decalin/n-Decan-Gemischen an einer Reihe von Ir/Na,H-Y-Zeolithen als Adsorbenzien gefunden werden. Decalin wurde jeweils deutlich bevorzugt adsorbiert. Dadurch bildet sich eine höhere Konzentration an Decalin an den katalytisch aktiven Zentren heraus, was in der Folge zu einer bevorzugten Umsetzung von Decalin führt. Die Pt/Na,H-Y-Katalysatoren zeichneten sich allesamt durch eine sehr hohe Isomerisierungsaktivität aus. Die gemeinsame Umsetzung von Decalin und n-Decan führte zu keinen Änderungen der Selektivitäten der dROPs von Decalin, genau wie an den Ir/Na,H-Y-Katalysatoren. Es wurden ebenso in der Umsetzung der äquimolaren Decalin/n-Decan-Mischung höhere Selektivitäten an OCDs und niedrigere Selektivitäten zu Spaltprodukten gefunden als durch Berechnung der erhaltenen Selektivitäten bei der Umsetzung der reinen Einsatzkohlenwasserstoffe zu erwarten war. Als weitere Träger wurden neben Zeolith Y auch die Zeolithe Beta, EMC- 2, L, Mordenit und ZSM- 5 untersucht. Diese Zeolithe unterscheiden sich in ihrer Dimensionalität und den Abmessungen des Porensystems. Alle Zeolithe wurden mit ca. 3 Massen % an Iridium beladen. Die Aktivitäten der Beta- und EMC- 2 -Katalysatoren waren vergleichbar mit der von 3. 3 Ir/Na 0. 72,H 0. 28 -Y- 2. 4, was sich insbesondere auch auf die Reaktivität der einzelnen Kohlenwasserstoffe und deren invertierte Reaktivitäten in der Gemischumsetzung bezog. Eine detaillierte Untersuchung der Zusammensetzung der Produkte der n Decanumsetzung am HIPEROC 3. 3 Ir/H 0. 58,Cs 0. 42 -Beta- 14 ergab, dass (i) sämtliche Spaltprodukte ausschließlich aus n-Alkanen bestehen und (ii) die gleichzeitig gebildeten iso-Decane den sehr charakteristischen Gehalt an Methylnonanen und Ethyloctanen aufweisen, wie er in der Isomerisierung von n-Alkanen an bifunktionellen Katalysatoren gefunden wird. Diese Befunden wurden als starke Hinweise darauf gewertet, dass die hydrogenolytische C-C Bindungsspaltung am Iridium und die Isomerisierung an Brønsted-Säurezentren unabhängig voneinander ablaufen. Diese Tatsache stellt unabhängige Evidenz für den früher postulierten Mechanismus für die Umsetzung von Decalin an HIPEROCs dar. Molybdäncarbid wurde als mögliche preiswerte Alternative zu Edelmetallen in Ringöffnungskatalysatoren getestet. Der Vollkatalysator besaß jedoch nur eine geringe spezifische Oberfläche von 30 m 2 •g- 1 und war äußerst inaktiv in der Ringöffnung von Decalin. Erhaltene Primärprodukte waren Gerüstisomere, insbesondere Spiro[4. 5]decan. Offenkettige Decane wurden nur mit niedriger Selektivität aus Decalin gebildet. Hauptprodukte waren kurzkettige Spaltprodukte, insbesondere Methan. Mit dem Ziel höhere Aktivitäten zu erzielen, wurden Katalysatoren mit auf Zeolith Y geträgertem Molybdäncarbid präpariert. Auf nichtsaurem Zeolith Y erwies sich &# 946; Mo 2 C als sehr inaktiv und glich in seinen katalytischen Eigenschaften dem &# 946;-Mo 2 C-Vollkatalysator. Mit Erhöhung der Brønsted-Säurezentren¬konzentration des Trägers erhöhten sich sowohl die Katalysator¬aktivität als auch die Produktselektivitäten zu ROPs und OCDs. Gleichzeitig stiegen aber auch die Selektivitäten von unerwünschtem Isobutan und Methylcyclopentan durch die „Paring Reaktion“. Zur Optimierung der geträgerten Molybdäncarbidkatalysatoren wurden das nSi/nAl-Verhältnis zwischen 2. 4 und 105 und die Molybdänbeladung zwischen 5 und 20 Massen % variiert. Die höchsten Selektivitäten zu OCDs wurden an Katalysator 9. 8 Mo 2 C/H 0. 99,Na 0. 01 -Y- 7 erzielt. Im Allgemeinen zeigten sich Molybdänbeladungen von ca. 10 Massen % und ein nSi/nAl-Verhältnis von 7 bei Zeolith Y als vorteilhaft für die Ringöffnung von Decalin an diesen alternativen Katalysatoren...|$|R

Basestock fractionally vacuum distilled from used lubricants has superior properties to all natural oils, but cost effectiveness depends on many factors. Used lubricant may also be used as refinery feedstock to become part of crude oil. Again, there is considerable reluctance to this use as the additives, soot and wear metals will seriously poison/deactivate the critical catalysts in the process. Cost prohibits carrying out both filtration (soot, additives removal) and re-refining (distilling, isomerisation, <b>hydrocrack,</b> etc.) however the primary hindrance to recycling still remains the collection of fluids as refineries need continuous supply in amounts measured in cisterns, rail tanks.|$|R

Repeatability, linear intervals, and sample load ranges for quantitative application of this method are detailed for different products that cover {{a broad range of}} boiling points and chemical functionalities in the field of fossil fuels: a heavy oil and its derived <b>hydrocracked</b> products, raw and chemically-modified petroleum asphaltenes, a coal-tar pitch, several coal extracts, and coal hydroliquefaction products. Results from external standard calibration and a normalization method (both obtained by TLC-FID) are in agreement, and they are validated using TLC-ultraviolet scanning. The use of the latter demonstrates that TLC-FID can also be applied to products such as coal extracts and hydroliquefaction products, despite these products being more volatile than petroleum asphaltenes or heavy oils. For preparative purposes when external calibration is necessary, preparative TLC and SPE are less time-consuming alternatives to MPLC fractionation, providing similar results...|$|R

No significant differences between synthetic esters and silicone fluid were observed. Severely hydrotreated and <b>hydrocracked</b> oils indicate a higher gassing tendency. It is also shown that service-aged oil gassing tendency decreases with reclamation passes. The reclamation of service aged oil by three commercially available Fuller's Earth (FE) showed a declined gassing tendency when FE helped reducing the DDF and turbidity. In addition, the theoretical premises that, oil born decay products contribute to the oil gassing, is experimentally confirmed under laboratory conditions. Extended stability test (3 times longer than the standard specification) also provide convincing evidences that each brand of mineral insulating oil might contain a limited amount of unstable hydrocarbons and volatile compounds.

The improved friction and wear results for the blend are closely related to the boundary film formation on the worn surfaces due to the reactivity of the anion with the steel surfaces...|$|R

Aging was simulated by holding samples at 43 °C to accelerate oxidation (ASTM D 4625). Biodiesels were treated with antioxidants before and after aging, with continued aging after antioxidant treatment. Treating aged biodiesel was effective at restoring stability; however, antioxidant effectiveness was decreased relative to fresh biodiesel. Blends were prepared at B 5 (5 vol. %) and B 20 (20 vol. %) with biodiesel having either 3 - or 6 -hour Rancimat induction time and low or high polyunsaturated ester content with two diesels produced from <b>hydrocracked</b> or hydrotreated feedstocks. All B 5 s were stable for the entire storage time regardless of B 100 induction time. B 20 s were unstable if prepared from high polyunsaturated ester biodiesel with a 3 -hour induction time. Base diesel stability had considerable effect on blend stability. All but the lowest-stability B 20 s remained within specification, indicating that long-term storage of biodiesel blends is possible if the biodiesel has high oxidative stability and storage conditions are clean. Induction time decreases indicated loss of stability (consumption of antioxidant) prior to blend degradation; therefore, induction time monitoring is recommended for predicting quality changes during storage...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Previous {{applications}} of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to lubricants are not sufficiently detailed and comprehensive for R and D purposes {{and there are no}} LCAs of lube additives and fully formulated lubricants. The aim {{of this study is to}} integrate and expand previous LCAs of lubricants and to investigate on the contribution of lube additives to the environmental impacts of fully formulated lubricants. Approach: This study considers three base oils (mineral, poly-alpha olefins and <b>hydrocracked)</b> and a set of lubricating additives typically used in fully formulated engine oil. The LCA model is based on both industry and literature data. Results: The contribution of additives to the life cycle impacts of commercial lube oil was found to be remarkably high, particularly for land occupation and metal depletion (more than 50 %) and for climate change (30 %). Trends in the lubricants industry towards more sophisticated base oils correspond to remarkably higher environmental impacts per kg of product, but are likely to lead to reduce impacts per km. Conclusion: While the application of LCA to lubricants can be considered fully operational for general purposes outside the lubricants industry, this is not the case for R and D purposes within the industry. Additives should not be excluded from LCAs of modern lubricants, as their contribution in terms of environmental impact can be considerably high. As base oil is concerned, this study made the point on data availability and provided a contribution in order to integrate and expand previous LCAs of fully formulated lube oils...|$|R
40|$|Background, aim {{and scope}} While the {{application}} of LCA to lubricants can be considered fully operational for general purposes outside the lubricants industry, where Life Cycle Inventories (LCIs) of mineral and synthetic base oils can be used interchangeably and where additives can be excluded, {{this is not the}} case for research and development purposes within the industry. Previous LCAs of base oils are not sufficiently detailed and comprehensive for R&D purposes and there are no LCAs of lube additives and fully formulated lubricants. The aim of this paper is to integrate and expand previous LCAs of base oils and to investigate on the contribution of lube additives to the environmental impacts of a fully formulated lubricant. Materials and methods This study considers three base oils (mineral, poly-alpha olefins and <b>hydrocracked)</b> and a set of lubricating additives typically used in fully formulated engine oil. The LCA model is based on both industry and literature data. Results and discussion Trends in the lubricants industry towards more sophisticated base oils correspond to remarkably higher environmental impacts per kg of product, but lead to reduced impacts per km. The contribution of additives to the life cycle impacts of commercial lube oil was found to be remarkably high for some impact categories (nearly 35 % for global warming). Conclusions As base oil is concerned, this study made the point on data availability and provided a contribution in order to integrate and expand previous LCAs of mineral base oil and poly-alpha olefins (PAO). On the side of additives, the main conclusion is that in modern lubricants the contribution of additives in terms of environmental impact can be remarkably high and, therefore, they should not be exclude...|$|R
40|$|Chemical Engineering Department, College of Engineering King Saud UniversityHeavy Arabian vacuum residua were <b>hydrocracked</b> non-catalytically using {{tetralin}} as {{a hydrogen}} donor solvent. A bolted closure packless high temperature/high pressure autoclave with a magnedrive assembly was used batchwise for this purpose. The effects of temperature, pressure, and reactants ratio {{on the performance}} of the system were studied. The products were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Methods of analysis included: hydrocarbon group analysis using an HPLC, simulated distillation using a GC, sulfur determination and API gravity, asphaltene and carbon residue determination according to ASTM standards. Tetralin proved to be an effective donor for Arabian residua. HPLC and simulated distillation analysis showed that heavy compounds of the residuum were converted into lighter ones. When a ratio of tetralin to residuum less than 1 / 1 by weight was used coke formed in amounts proportional to tetralin. For ratios greater than 1 / 1 no coke formation was observed. A ratio of 2 / 1 was found to be a suitable ratio and was used in all runs. It was found that a minimum initial pressure of nitrogen gas (0. 5 MPa) was sufficient to keep the reactants in the liquid state. Otherwise, pressure had no effect on the conversion. As the temperature was increased the conversion to lighter products increased. The relative percentage change of both asphaltenes and carbon residue increase with temperature. Degree of desulfurization also increased with temperature. This preliminary study was limited to use a maximum temperature of 435 Qc. Increasing the temperature beyond this limit causes gas venting, and thus a loss of gaseous products. The system will be modified to work at higher temperatures by the method of rapid injection...|$|R
500|$|The {{shale oil}} derived from oil shale does not {{directly}} substitute for crude oil in all applications. It may contain higher concentrations of olefins, oxygen, and nitrogen than conventional crude oil. [...] Some shale oils may have higher sulfur or arsenic content. By comparison with West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark standard for crude oil in the futures-contract market, the Green River shale oil sulfur content ranges from near 0% to 4.9% (in average 0.76%), where West Texas Intermediate's sulfur content has a maximum of 0.42%. The sulfur content in shale oil from Jordan's oil shales may rise even up to 9.5%. [...] The arsenic content, for example, becomes an issue for Green River formation oil shale. The higher concentrations of these materials means that the oil must undergo considerable upgrading (hydrotreating) before serving as oil-refinery feedstock. [...] Above-ground retorting processes tended to yield a lower API gravity shale oil than the in situ processes. Shale oil serves best for producing middle-distillates such as kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel fuel. Worldwide demand for these middle distillates, particularly for diesel fuels, increased rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s. [...] However, appropriate refining processes equivalent to <b>hydrocracking</b> can transform shale oil into a lighter-range hydrocarbon (gasoline).|$|E

Promising experiences have been gained with a spray-injection incineration process, where a large combustion surface is created by atomizing the waste {{with the help of}} nozzles. Considering the design of a spray-injection combustion facility this thesis evaluates as well the material- and slurry specific- as the process- and apparatus-technical parameters. To perform corresponding experiments a laboratory facility was designed and constructed for testing of different nozzles in respect of their atomization characteristics. As carrier liquids were used water and a <b>hydrocrack</b> gasoil residue. The essential results of the experimental investigations are summarized. (orig.)

2500|$|Fischer–Tropsch iron {{catalysts}} need alkali {{promotion to}} attain high activity and stability (e.g. 0.5 wt% [...] ). Addition of Cu for reduction promotion, addition of , [...] for structural promotion {{and maybe some}} manganese can be applied for selectivity control (e.g. high olefinicity). The working catalyst is only obtained when—after reduction with hydrogen—in the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and elemental carbon are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron. With iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued. One direction has aimed at a low-molecular-weight olefinic hydrocarbon mixture to be produced in an entrained phase or fluid bed process (Sasol–Synthol process). Due to the relatively high reaction temperature (approx. 340nbsp&°C), the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions. The catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small (particle diameter 100nbsp&µm) and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation. Thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite (plus promoters) after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate. For maximising the overall gasoline yield, C3 and C4 alkenes have been oligomerized at Sasol. However, recovering the olefins for use as chemicals in, e.g., polymerization processes is advantageous today. The second direction of iron catalyst development has aimed at highest catalyst activity to be used at low reaction temperature {{where most of the}} hydrocarbon product is in the liquid phase under reaction conditions. Typically, such catalysts are obtained through precipitation from nitrate solutions. A high content of a carrier provides mechanical strength and wide pores for easy mass transfer of the reactants in the liquid product filling the pores. The main product fraction then is a paraffin wax, which is refined to marketable wax materials at Sasol; however, it also can be very selectively <b>hydrocracked</b> to a high quality diesel fuel. Thus, iron catalysts are very flexible.|$|R
25|$|These {{are used}} for {{high-temperature}} Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (nearly 340nbsp&°C) to produce low-molecular-weight unsaturated hydrocarbons on alkalized fused iron catalysts. The fluid-bed technology (as adapted from the catalytic cracking of heavy petroleum distillates) was introduced by Hydrocarbon Research in 1946–50 and named the ‘Hydrocol’ process. A large scale Fischer–Tropsch Hydrocol plant (350,000 tons per annum) operated during 1951–57 in Brownsville, Texas. Due to technical problems, and lacking economy due to increasing petroleum availability, this development was discontinued. Fluid-bed Fischer–Tropsch synthesis has recently been very successfully reinvestigated by Sasol. One reactor with a capacity of 500,000 tons per annum is now in operation and even larger ones are being built (nearly 850,000 tons per annum). The process is now used mainly for C2 and C7 alkene production. This new development {{can be regarded as}} an important progress in Fischer–Tropsch technology. A high-temperature process with a circulating iron catalyst (‘circulating fluid bed’, ‘riser reactor’, ‘entrained catalyst process’) was introduced by the Kellogg Company and a respective plant built at Sasol in 1956. It was improved by Sasol for successful operation. At Secunda, South Africa, Sasol operated 16 advanced reactors of this type with a capacity of approximately 330,000 tons per annum each. Now the circulating catalyst process is being replaced by the superior Sasol-advanced fluid-bed technology. Early experiments with cobalt catalyst particles suspended in oil have been performed by Fischer. The bubble column reactor with a powdered iron slurry catalyst and a CO-rich syngas was particularly developed to pilot plant scale by Kölbel at the Rheinpreuben Company in 1953. Recently (since 1990) low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch slurry processes are under investigation for the use of iron and cobalt catalysts, particularly for the production of a hydrocarbon wax, or to be <b>hydrocracked</b> and isomerised to produce diesel fuel, by Exxon and Sasol. Today slurry-phase (bubble column) low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch synthesis is regarded by many authors as the most efficient process for Fischer–Tropsch clean diesel production. This Fischer–Tropsch technology is also under development by the Statoil Company (Norway) for use on a vessel to convert associated gas at offshore oil fields into a hydrocarbon liquid.|$|R
