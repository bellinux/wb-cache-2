5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, <b>differential</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>calorimetry</b> (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of linear and star-shaped oligomers containing cationic and neutral organoiron groups in their structures {{was achieved by}} reaction of cationic arene complexes of cyclopentadienyliron containing terminal hydroxyl groups with 1, 1 ′-ferrocenedicarbonyl chloride or ferrocene carboxylic acid. The use of chloroarene complexes allowed {{for the formation of}} triiron complexes that were subsequently polymerized via nucleophilic aromatic substitution with various oxygen- and sulfur-based dinucleophiles. The corresponding polyethers and thioethers were isolated in good yields and these materials exhibited excellent solubilities in polar organic solvents. Cyclic voltammetric investigations revealed that the cationic iron centers pendent to the polymer backbones underwent reversible reduction steps, while the neutral iron centers within the polymer backbones underwent reversible oxidation steps. Photolysis of these polymers resulted in the removal of the cationic cyclopentadienyliron moieties pendent to the polymer backbones. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the cationic iron complexes were cleaved from the polymers at approximately 210 °C. <b>Differentials</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>calorimetry</b> (DSC) revealed that the glass transition temperatures of the cationic polymers occurred at higher temperatures than their neutral analogs...|$|R

Usually, such tests are done isothermally (at constant temperature) by changing {{the atmosphere of the}} sample. First, the sample is brought to the desired test temperature under an inert atmosphere, usually nitrogen. Then, oxygen is added to the system.

25|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>calorimetry,</b> or DSC, is a {{thermoanalytical}} {{technique in}} which {{the difference in the}} amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment.

The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of temperatures to be scanned.|$|E
25|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>calorimetry</b> (DSC) is an {{analytical}} technique {{used to examine}} thermodynamic properties of molecules. It can study the thermal behavior of materials as they undergo physical and chemical changes during heat treatment. The parameters that are measured {{are referred to as}} the glass transition value (Tg) and melting temperature (Tm). These values are measured over time and are comparable between an inert reference sample and the analyte. Changes in the (Tm) and (Tg) values evaluate phase changes (solid, liquid-gel, liquid, etc.) in which an endothermic or exothermic process occurs. This technique is useful for monitoring the phase changes in phospholipids by providing information such as the amount of heat released or absorbed and time for phase transitions to occur, etc. DSC monitoring can occur at slow rates which is a disadvantage in monitoring fast phase transitions within phospholipids.|$|E

The critical cooling rate of 30, 000 K/s is three times as large as that of the recently reported poly(ϵ-caprolactone) (PCL) 's. Namely, it turned out that PBN is a hard-to-vitrify polymer. The heating rate faster than 7000 K/s could prevent the cold crystallization from the proper glassy state. In the less severe cooling and heating rates than 30, 000 K/s and 7000 K/s, respectively, a variety of structure formations, such as the nucleation, the mesophase formation, the crystallization and their multiple melting behaviors, have been observed...|$|R

Nucleated samples showed an increased tendency for the ¿-phase formation and a decreased tendency for mesomorphic phase formation.

25|$|An {{analysis}} {{based on}} an extension of Zwanzig's model of protein folding indicates that global downhill folding proteins should reveal different apparent melting temperatures (Tms) when monitored by different techniques. This was experimentally confirmed in the protein BBL mentioned above. The unfolding followed by <b>differential</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>calorimetry</b> (DSC), circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence all revealed different apparent melting temperatures. A wavelength-dependent melting temperature was also observed in the CD experiments. The data analyzed with a structure-based statistical mechanical model resulted in a unimodal population distribution at all temperatures, indicating a structurally uncoupled continuous unfolding process. The crucial issue in such experiments is to use probes that monitor {{different aspects of the}} structure. For example, DSC gives information on the heat capacity changes (and hence enthalpy) associated with unfolding, fluorescence on the immediate environment of the fluorophore, FRET on the average dimensions of the molecule and CD on the secondary structure.|$|E

Although the exact mode of association is unknown, the present study demonstrates that such interactions occur in a specific manner and suggest selectivity of oat proteins for individual fatty acids.

40|$|Abstract. The {{continuous}} miniaturization {{of products}} needed e. g. in the automotive or the microelectronics sector requires process chains, which allow the manufacturing of microscopically small components in high quantities. The {{development of the}} required processes and technologies is {{the aim of the}} Collaborative Research Centre 747 “Micro Cold Forming ” of the German Research Foundation. As a necessary step in the manufacturing process chain heat treatment enables the adjustment of the semi-finished micro components to cold forming. Finally, the in-service characteristics of the aluminium components have to be adjusted by precipitation hardening that increases the strength values beyond those which can be achieved by strain hardening. To provide high strength aluminium alloys with an improved thermal stability new alloy concepts and advanced production processes have been developed within the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC). Besides the scandium containing foils made of alloy Al- 2 Sc, foils of a novel alloy Al- 4 Zr with approximately 4 mass- % Zirconium has been produced by means of physical vapour deposition (PVD). In contrast to conventional strip casting techniques the PVD process operates with low temperatures, which should suppress premature precipitation during the foil production and ensure the supersaturated solid solution that is a prerequisite for precipitation hardening. Samples of this material were subsequently artificially aged and characterized by ultra micro hardness measurements (UMH), transmission electron microscopical (TEM) analysis and <b>differential</b> power <b>scanning</b> <b>calorimetry</b> (DPSC) to evaluate the applied aging parameters...|$|R

30|$|The correct {{determination}} of the phase transition behaviour of phase change materials (PCMs) is paramount for assessing their application potential. In this work, the merits of a novel calorimetric technique, Peltier-element-based adiabatic <b>scanning</b> <b>calorimetry</b> (pASC), for PCM characterisation are investigated, especially {{in comparison with the}} commonly-used <b>differential</b> <b>scanning</b> calorimeter (DSC). A comparative study of two alkane-based PCMs, the commercial mixture RT 42 and the pure alkane tricosane (C 23) with these two techniques shows that pASC provides data at much higher resolution than DSC, due to its operation in thermodynamic equilibrium. Specifically the rate-dependence and deformation that is inherent to DSC experiments is absent in pASC. In addition, the enthalpy of the PCM is directly obtained. pASC results easily conform to the accuracy limits that are proposed in literature for the transition temperature and storage capacity of PCMs.|$|R
