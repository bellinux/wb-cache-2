40|$|Areas {{likely to}} receive carbon credits must meet internationally agreed {{protocols}}, two of these are: Kyoto and VCS. These protocols establish rules to evaluate a possible area that whether is eligible or not to receive carbon credits. Both protocols require a temporal satellite imagery analysis in order to assure that an <b>eligible</b> <b>area</b> was deforested prior to 1990 and still not covered by forest for Kyoto protocol, while VCS protocol establishes that an <b>eligible</b> <b>area</b> was not cleared within 10 past years and currently is not covered by forest. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a standard routine to map <b>eligible</b> <b>area</b> for carbon project based on Landsat 5 satellite imagery. Tasseled Cap transformation was applied to extract two components as a result of this transformation: brightness and wetness, also a NDVI image was created to perform this analysis. Thresholds for each of set of images were defined interactively to distinguish areas which are not covered by forest; only pixels that lie within these thresholds were selected as potential area for carbon project implementation. The result of this mapping indicates that 29, 902 ha and 26, 150 ha are eligible for carbon projects within the study area, according to the Kyoto protocols and VCS, respectively. The result showed a high grade of accuracy (Kappa index = 0. 88 and 0. 81 for Kyoto and VCS protocols respectively) for those <b>areas</b> identified as <b>eligible</b> for carbon project. Based on this analysis model, a tool was developed, called CarbonoGeo to map areas for carbon project implementation. Pages: 5917 - 592...|$|R

40|$|Working Paper SMART-LERECO N° 09 - 15 Agri-environmental schemes are {{the main}} policy {{instrument}} currently available in the European Union to promote environmentally friendly farming practices. Nevertheless, the adoption rate of these measures is still limited. This paper develops a profit maximizer theoretical framework to explain the farmer’s sign-up decision and the area to put under an agri-environmental measure characterised by {{a change in the}} crop pattern. The application concerns an agri-environmental measure awarding the introduction of alfalfa in cereal farms in Natura 2000 designated areas of Aragon (Spain). The econometric specification accounts for both the upper censoring of the enrolled area, constrained by the available <b>eligible</b> <b>area,</b> and the self-selection of contractors according to the extra-profit of their enrolment. To test the absence of fixed costs of enrolment, a simple tobit with a lower and an upper bound, that corresponds to the non fixed costs situation, is compared to the censored model with selection. Estimated specifications based on the enrolled area do not provided normally distributed residues and are not suitable to carry out the likelihood ratio test. Estimated specifications based on the share of enrolled <b>area</b> in the <b>eligible</b> <b>area</b> provide normally distributed residues. The likelihood ratio test rejects the absence of fixed costs. Technical factors as well as social capital variables are taken into consideration as determinants of technical and transaction costs. Estimation results show that there is an adoption barrier derived from the know-how affecting the fixed compliance costs of introducing the new crop. In addition, there is an adoption barrier derived from transaction costs which are reduced in the presence of social networks. These results suggest that a non linear payment mechanism or auctions might be suitable to ensure a better coverage of Natura 2000 <b>eligible</b> <b>areas</b> by the contracts, with a limited increase in related public expenditures...|$|R

The contract lasted until 30 April 2002, and the area was then incorporated in FFR's general contract. The second <b>area,</b> <b>concerning</b> routes in central Finnmark was won by Nordtrafikk Buss in 1999. The second round for this <b>area,</b> <b>concerning</b> around 850,000 vehicle kilometres per year and 24 buses, was won back by FFR in 2004, with contract period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009. In the third round in 2009, with contract period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2015, the company secured the contract again, beating Nordlandsbuss and Norgesbuss. In 2001, the third <b>area,</b> <b>concerning</b> bus routes in the municipalities of Måsøy and Nordkapp was also won by FFR. This contract was also later incorporated into FFR's general contract.
