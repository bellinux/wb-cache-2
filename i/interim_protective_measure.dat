40|$|Background and Objectives: Concern {{with the}} costs of blood safety is growing, which raises the {{question}} whether safety measures that reduce risk only marginally should be discontinued. Withdrawing such safety measures would allow reallocating resources to more efficient health care interventions, but it might raise moral objections. Materials and Methods: This study evaluates two ethical arguments why discontinuing blood safety measures would be more objectionable than not implementing them. The first argument is that whereas withdrawing <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> causes harm to patients, not starting <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> 'merely' omits to prevent harm. The second argument is that patients who benefit from <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> are historically entitled to the continuation of those <b>protective</b> <b>measures.</b> Results: Both arguments are unconvincing. There is only a weak causal connection between removing blood safety measures and harms that transfusion recipients suffer. Moreover, patients are not entitled to the continuation of <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> that prove very inefficient, unless applying these <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> rectifies past injustice towards them. Conclusion: Unless stronger ethical objections can be found, blood system operators and regulators should be more willing to withdraw inefficient safety measures...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper will}} assess {{terrorist}} threats to bridge infrastructure and the cost-effectiveness of <b>protective</b> and counter-terrorism <b>measures.</b> This analysis will consider threat likelihood, cost of security measures, risk reduction and expected losses {{to compare the}} costs and benefits of <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> to bridges to decide which <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> are cost-effective. In this paper, a break-even cost-benefit analysis determines the minimum probability of a successful attack, absent the <b>protective</b> <b>measures,</b> that is required for the benefit of the <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> to equal their cost. It was found that unless terrorist threat probabilities are high, then typical <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> are not cost-effective. Bridges and other critical infrastructure are subject to a range of natural and man-made hazards, and terrorism is most likely not as important a threat as natural hazards. Economic risks due to terrorism are then compared with risks from flood and seismic hazards.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} risk-informed {{decision support}} {{for assessing the}} costs and benefits of counter-terrorism (CT) <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> for infrastructure.

The illustrative examples show under what combination of risk reduction, threat probability, and fatality and damage costs the CT <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> would be cost-effective for United States building, bridge and aviation infrastructure. It was found that if indirect losses (such as business interruption, loss of GDP, etc.) are considered, then CT <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> are cost-effective even if the terrorist threat probability is not high.

Objective. To study the usage and side effects of personal <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> against mosquitoes among current users in Delhi. Materials and Methods. A community-based cross-sectional study among 350 adult individuals selected by systematic sampling method.

40|$|Sri Lankan farmers use {{large amounts}} of {{pesticides}} to control the pests affecting their vegetable crops. Improper use of pesticides by farmers has resulted in poisoning of occupational origin. This paper examines the use of <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> by pesticide applicators {{and its relationship to}} their illness symptoms. The data were collected by interviewing a stratified random sample of 150 farmers from predominantly vegetable growing areas of the Matale district during 1990 / 91 using structured questionnaires. These data were supplemented with secondary data and observation of all stages of pesticide application. Scales were constructed to measure the domains of material style of life, awareness and use of <b>protective</b> <b>measures,</b> and illness symptoms experienced by pesticide applicators. It was found that most of the farmers were aware of the <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> to be used when applying pesticides. There was, however, no significant positive relationship between awareness and use of <b>protective</b> <b>measures.</b> The main reason for not using <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> was discomfort. The most common symptoms reported by pesticide applicators were faintish feeling, headache and dizziness. A significant negative relationship was observed between use of <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> and symptoms exhibited within four hours of application. It is recommended that protective materials adapted to the climate and socio-economic conditions of farmers be developed, and that farmers be encouraged to use these protective materials through appropriate educational efforts and incentives.

40|$|Consequences of {{refusing to}} {{participate}} in the criminal investigation or <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> A quantitative study within a group of women assessed for risk of future intimate partner violence victimization Josefin Niit and Lisa Norrbin Abstract Intimate partner violence [IPV] is a global issue and IPV towards women have received increased attention during the last decades. The police perform a vital task in supporting victims of IPV and providing <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> to prevent further violence. Some victims refuse {{to participate in}} the criminal investigation or <b>protective</b> <b>measures,</b> which can have consequences for the judicial process or the risk of future victimization. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the consequences of refusing {{to participate in the}} criminal investigation or <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> within a group of women assessed for risk of future IPV victimization. A quantitative approach was applied to compare women who refused to participate against women who participated. The sample consisted of 207 cases which were assessed with SARA:SV in the police county of Södertörn. The results demonstrated that when women refused to participate in the criminal investigation the cases were 6. 2 times less likely prosecuted. Women who refused to participate in the <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> were repeatedly victimized to the same amount, even though they in comparison were a lower risk group. However, these women were 4 times more likely victims of assault when repeatedly victimized. Findings from the current study provide useful knowledge about consequences for women who refuse to participate in the criminal investigation or <b>protective</b> <b>measures</b> and enables practical solutions for agents of the judicial system to further help these women.
