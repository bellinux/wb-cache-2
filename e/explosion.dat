5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the <b>explosion,</b> had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had {{a conflict of interest}} in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in the <b>explosion.</b> After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated the <b>explosion</b> using an electrical or chemical detonator.|$|E
50|$|Ignited {{methane gas}} {{is a common}} source of <b>explosions</b> in coal mines, which in turn can {{initiate}} more extensive coal dust <b>explosions.</b> For this reason, rock dusts such as limestone dust are spread throughout coal mines to diminish the chances of coal dust <b>explosions</b> {{as well as to}} limit the extent of potential <b>explosions,</b> in a process known as rock dusting. Coal dust <b>explosions</b> can also begin independently of methane gas <b>explosions.</b> Frictional heat and sparks generated by mining equipment can ignite both methane gas and coal dust. For this reason, water is often used to cool rock-cutting sites.|$|R

50|$|<b>Explosions</b> {{can occur}} in nature. Most natural <b>explosions</b> arise from {{volcanic}} processes of various sorts. Explosive volcanic eruptions occur when magma rising from below has much-dissolved gas in it; the reduction of pressure as the magma rises causes the gas to bubble out of solution, resulting in a rapid increase in volume. <b>Explosions</b> also occur {{as a result of}} impact events and in phenomena such as hydrothermal <b>explosions</b> (also due to volcanic processes). <b>Explosions</b> can also occur outside of Earth in the universe in events such as supernova. <b>Explosions</b> frequently occur during bushfires in eucalyptus forests where the volatile oils in the tree tops suddenly combust.|$|R
5|$|Computer {{models have}} been very {{successful}} at calculating the behavior of TypeII supernovae when the shock has been formed.

5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the <b>explosion.</b> A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused an <b>explosion</b> in the gun breech. Sandia's technicians {{also found that the}} physical evidence did not support the U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to initiate the <b>explosion.</b>|$|E

The effects of the <b>explosions</b> were so severe that they caused the evacuation of over 20,000 people from the area. The <b>explosions</b> caused {{millions of dollars in}} damages to Pemex equipment. Additionally, it is estimated the <b>explosions</b> cost the Mexican economy $100 million a day as over 2,500 businesses were effected and 60% of Mexico's steel industry was shuttered.

40|$|Astrophysical <b>explosions</b> {{result from}} the release of magnetic, gravitational, or {{thermonuclear}} energy on dynamical timescales, typically the sound-crossing time for the system. These <b>explosions</b> include solar and stellar flares, eruptive phenomena in accretion disks, thermonuclear combustion on the surfaces of white dwarfs and neutron stars, violent magnetic reconnection in neutron stars, thermonuclear and gravitational collapse supernovae and cosmic gamma-ray bursts, each representing a different type and amount of energy release. This paper summarizes the properties of these <b>explosions</b> and describes new research on thermonuclear <b>explosions</b> and <b>explosions</b> in extended circumstellar media. Parallels are drawn between studies of terrestrial and astrophysical <b>explosions,</b> especially the physics of the transition from deflagration to detonation.

5|$|In {{an earlier}} {{disaster}} in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The inquest {{established that the}} colliery had high levels of airborne coal dust, which would have exacerbated the <b>explosion</b> and carried it further into the mine workings. The cause of the 1913 <b>explosion</b> is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any firedamp present. The miners in {{the east side of}} the workings were evacuated, but the men in the western section bore the brunt of the <b>explosion,</b> fire and afterdamp—a poisonous mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen left after an <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{people in}} Halifax at first {{believed}} the <b>explosion</b> {{to be the}} result of a German attack. The Halifax Herald continued to propagate this belief for some time, for example reporting that Germans had mocked victims of the <b>explosion.</b> While John Johansen, the Norwegian helmsman of Imo, was being treated for serious injuries sustained during the <b>explosion,</b> it was reported to the military police that he had been behaving suspiciously. Johansen was arrested on suspicions of being a German spy when a search turned up a letter on his person, supposedly written in German. It turned out that the letter was actually written in Norwegian. Immediately following the <b>explosion,</b> most of the German survivors in Halifax had been rounded up and imprisoned. Eventually the fear dissipated as the real cause of the <b>explosion</b> became known, although rumours of German involvement persisted.|$|E

During the investigation, numerous leaks to the media, later attributed to U.S. Navy officers and investigators, implied that Hartwig and another sailor, Kendall Truitt, had engaged in a homosexual relationship and that Hartwig had caused the <b>explosion</b> after their relationship had soured. In its report, however, the U.S. Navy concluded that the evidence did not show that Hartwig was homosexual but that he was suicidal and had caused the <b>explosion</b> with either an electronic or chemical detonator.|$|E

40|$|We are {{investigating}} the characteristics of extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic pulse (EMW) phenomena from underground nuclear and chemical <b>explosions</b> and from surface chemical <b>explosions</b> {{as they may be}} applied in an On-Site Inspection (OSI) context under a Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The principal application of these phenomena is for discrimination among underground chemical <b>explosions,</b> underground nuclear <b>explosions,</b> and earthquakes. Underground chemical and nuclear <b>explosions</b> both generate low-frequency EMP signals (about 1 Hz) that are observable within several kilometers of ground zero. During this fiscal year we have been gathering data from <b>explosions</b> of opportunity to see if ELF EMP signals are observable from large ripple-fired blasts and from smaller dedicated <b>explosions</b> such as those occurring at the NTS. In addition, we are continuing to review data from the Henderson Mine deployment that took place during FY 94 and data from previous underground nuclear tests including Hunter`s Trophy and past underground nuclear tests have been analyzed and we here make estimates of the properties of the EMP ftom underground nuclear ard chemical <b>explosions,</b> including detectability, dependence on yield, and dependence on distance from the source. Data from the Henderson Mine provide information about detection of EMP from typical moderate size underground chemical <b>explosions</b> in hard rock and problems related to detection of EMP in a mine environment located at high elevations. Data from the Carlin Mine site provide information about EMP from surface ripple-fired chemical <b>explosions</b> and detection in an open-pit mine environment.
