40|$|AbstractSecondary <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} parts for protection device to get the accurate fault generated current travelling waves. This paper studies current travelling wave transmission characteristics in secondary <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> based on Alternative Transient Program (ATP). Valuable transmission characteristics of <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> have been got from the simulation results: current travelling waves which pass the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> will be distorted and some interfering current travelling waves will be generated; duration of interfering current travelling waves depends on the length of the control cable; the original fault generated current travelling wave wave-front is delayed and smoothed by the control cable; magnitude of fault generated current travelling wave wave-front has been varied by the <b>control</b> <b>cable.</b> And these transmission characteristic of <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> provide useful references to the protection algorithms based on fault generated current travelling waves...|$|R
50|$|McGalliard was the {{inventor}} of the Solidstat, a single mount electrical control assembly, and issued a U.S. patent February 8, 1978. The Solidstat is widely used for: resistance <b>heater</b> <b>control,</b> lighting control, motor speed control, pipe heating, tank & kettle heating, laminating press <b>heater</b> <b>control,</b> and medical equipment involving heating, lighting, and temperature controls. A single mounting connection at the potentiometer bushing not only mechanically mounts all of the elements but additionally provides a heat sink connection for the circuit. At the same time, the use of a printed circuit board in the combination permits automated assembly and soldering which substantially reduced the cost of the circuit.|$|R

In order to increase the eigen consumption of photovoltaic energy, i. e. direct consumption of generated energy in the house, we propose to employ a dynamic programming approach to optimize heating schedules using forecasted consumption and weather data. Simulation results demonstrate the capability of our proposed system in reducing the overall energy cost while maintaining residents' comfort.

50|$|Investigation {{revealed}} that the Redstone's engine shutdown was caused by two of its electrical cables separating in the wrong order. These <b>cables</b> were a <b>control</b> <b>cable,</b> which provided various control signals, and a power cable, which provided electrical power and grounding. Both cables were plugged into the rocket at the bottom edge {{of one of its}} tail fins and would separate at liftoff. The <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> was supposed to separate first, followed by the power cable. However, for this launch, the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> was longer than expected—it was one designed for the military PGM-11 Redstone missile rather than the shorter cable designed for Mercury-Redstone. This <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> had been clamped to compensate for its greater length, but when the vehicle lifted off, the clamping did not work as planned and the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> separation was delayed, eventually occurring about 29 milliseconds after the power cable had separated.|$|R
40|$|During transmembrane {{signaling}} by Escherichia coli Tsr, {{changes in}} ligand occupancy in the periplasmic serine-binding domain promote asymmetric motions in a four-helix transmembrane bundle. Piston displace-ments of the signaling TM 2 helix in turn modulate the HAMP bundle on the cytoplasmic {{side of the}} membrane to control receptor output signals to the flagellar motors. A five-residue <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> joins TM 2 to the HAMP AS 1 helix and mediates conformational interactions between them. To explore <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> structural features important for signal transmission, we constructed and characterized all possible single amino acid replace-ments at the Tsr <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> residues. Only a few lesions abolished Tsr function, indicating that the chemical nature {{and size of the}} <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> side chains are not individually critical for signal control. Charged replacements at I 214 mimicked the signaling consequences of attractant or repellent stimuli, most likely through aberrant structural interactions of the mutant side chains with the membrane interfacial environment. Prolines at residues 214 to 217 also caused signaling defects, suggesting that the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> has helical character. However, proline did not disrupt function at G 213, the first <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> residue, which might serve as a structural transition between the TM 2 and AS 1 helix registers. Hydrophobic amino acids at S 217, the last <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> residue, produced attractant-mimic effects, most likely by contributing to packing interactions within the HAMP bundle. These results suggest a helix extension mechanism of Tsr transmembrane signalin...|$|R
