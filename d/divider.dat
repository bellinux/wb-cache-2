5|$|A mile (1.6km) {{north of}} NY417, NY16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Allegheny. On the other side, it becomes a four-lane road with a <b>divider</b> as it approaches NY17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate Highway standards. A trumpet interchange provides access to I-86 and NY17 in both directions in the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it finally does cross I-86/NY17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY446, the former route of NY408, comes in from the east and terminates.|$|E
5|$|Gill Creek and NY61 {{continue}} to run parallel {{for one more}} block before they separate ahead of Pine Avenue, once known as NY62A and now designated as US62 Business. The intersection between Pine and Hyde Park Boulevard marks the southwestern limits of Hyde Park, {{one of the largest}} parks {{in the vicinity of the}} city. For the next dozen blocks, NY61 acts as the <b>divider</b> between the residential neighborhoods of downtown Niagara Falls and the open spaces of Hyde Park, passing Sal Maglie Stadium as it heads north. At Linwood Avenue, the homes return to both sides of NY61 as it approaches Porter Road, which carries NY182. While Porter Road ends here, NY182 turns north, joining NY61 for two blocks to Ontario Avenue, where NY182 turns west toward the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge.|$|E

Several of these objects are not only unique in having such an early, definite dating, but also because they pre-date written records of their use; protractors would have reasonably been used to measure bearings and courses on maps, but sea charts are not known to have been used by English navigators {{during the first half of}} the 16th century, compasses were not depicted on English ships until the 1560s, and the first mention of a logreel is from 1574.|$|E

Beyond the airport, the <b>divider</b> ends, the travel lanes are reduced to four and, after a short curve and minimal descent, NY33 intersects Transit Road (NY78) and enters the town of Lancaster.

A short distance after, Route161 provides a connector to Richfield Terrace on the northbound side of the highway, the park's <b>divider</b> known as Cross Street. The highway continues northward, intersecting with Richland Court, which provides access to local residential homes. The next intersection is with Joan Place, which serves a similar function to Richland Court. Soon after, Route161 intersects with Saint Andrew's Boulevard, which also serves as the northern terminus of Richfield Terrace and connects the highway with CR609 (Mount Prospect Avenue). Just past Saint Andrew's Boulevard Route161 passes through a largely commercial section of Clifton with a heavy concentration of medical offices before terminating at an intersection with CR614 (Van Houten Avenue).

After passing under North Winton Road, NY590 resumes its northward trek and connects to NY404 by way of a modified cloverleaf interchange. The expressway continues onward, separating a large residential area from Irondequoit Bay Park West as it progresses toward a northbound-only exit with Norton Street. One half-mile to the north of Norton, NY590 meets NY104 via a large interchange.|$|E
5|$|Potter, however, did {{not feel}} he fitted into this {{increasingly}} experimental sound the band was developing and tended {{to wait until the}} others had worked out their parts during rehearsals, adding his bass lines on top at the last minute. After recording three tracks of their third album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), he decided to quit the band. His last gig was on 9 August at the 1970 Plumpton Festival. The remaining members auditioned Dave Anderson, roadie for Brinsley Schwarz and friend of the band, but after a week's rehearsal found that things weren't working out musically. Banton, meanwhile, had become influenced by Vincent Crane's work in Atomic Rooster, where Crane played the bass lines on a Hammond organ's bass pedals and suggested that he could do this as well. With just days to go before the next gig, they tried rehearsing as a four-piece, and it was successful. Banton later played bass guitar on certain songs, having already learned the instrument in the mid-1960s, and Hammill expanded his instrumental capabilities on stage to cover piano and keyboards as well as guitar. Jackson modified his saxophones to be completely electric, as opposed to simply being amplified through a microphone, and combined the sound with a wah-wah pedal and an octave <b>divider.</b>|$|E
5|$|On April 1, 2013, reports {{surfaced}} {{that there}} will be a third G.I. Joe film, and it will likely be in 3D. The studio announced that Chu will return to direct the third film. While at the 2013 San Diego Comic Con, Chu talked about bringing Scarlett back in the next film. The writers of the second film are also thinking about bringing back the Baroness in the sequel. Johnson is interested in returning as Roadblock for the sequel, and Park has talked about a possible return as Snake Eyes and also including his pet wolf Timber. Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura has stated he is open to doing a G.I. Joe/Transformers crossover, which Chu stated that he would be interested in directing. Bonaventura told Beijing News that he hoped that Johnson and Willis would return, the script is still in the writing stage, and that they are considering adding a third important role. On September 10, 2013, Chu was confirmed to direct the film, along with writer Evan Daugherty (Snow White and the Huntsman, Divergent, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) to pen the film's script. On December 5, 2013, Daugherty talked about writing the film's script and his feelings about Duke being killed, but Chu told MTV that Tatum may return as Duke in the sequel. On April 2, 2014, in an interview with Collider, Johnson believes that Chu may not return to direct, due to working on the live action Jem film, but they may find another director for the film. It was revealed that the third film will have a 2016 release date. On June 23, 2014, di Bonaventura told Collider in an interview that they're meeting with new directors and filming may start in early 2015. On July 1, 2014, Variety reported that Jonathan Lemkin will write the script for the film and will focus on Roadblock with Johnson returning. On February 5, 2015, Film <b>Divider</b> reported that the twins Tomax and Xamot and Matt Trakker from the TV series M.A.S.K. will be appearing. On April 2, 2015, the studio hired Aaron Berg to write the film, and D. J. Caruso to direct the film. On November 23, 2015, Deadline reported that Akiva Goldsman will lead a writers room for the next G.I. Joe film. In September 2016, Byung-Hun Lee told LRM Review that the studio doing the third film is waiting on the actors to return, including Johnson. On January 18, 2017, Caruso has stated to Collider that the script for the crossover movie is now being written. In May 2017, Dwayne Johnson stated that if the opportunity arises he would appear in any future G.I. Joe film, and that he hopes to be a part of the franchise expansion as well. It was announced in September 2017 that the third film is cancelled and a reboot of the franchise will happen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Analysis of a {{developmental}} mutant in Dictyostelium discoideum which {{is unable to}} initiate morphogenesis has shown that a protein kinase of the MAP kinase/ERK family affects relay of the cAMP chemotactic signal and cell differentiation. Strains in which the locus encoding ERK 2 is disrupted respond to a pulse of cAMP by synthesizing cGMP normally but show little synthesis of cAMP. Since mutant cells lacking ERK 2 contain normal levels of both the cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase (CRAC) and manganese-activatable adenylyl cyclase, it appears that this kinase is important for receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase.

Best compensation is achieved when both photoresistors are formed on the same semiconductor chip. The reference photoresistor is included in a <b>divider</b> of stabilized voltage or in a measuring bridge. The error amplifier compares the voltage at the middle point of the <b>divider</b> with the target value and adjusts the controlling current. In the linear controlling regime the RO becomes an analog multiplier: the current through the photoresistor is proportional to the product of the voltage across the photoresistor and the control voltage.|$|E
