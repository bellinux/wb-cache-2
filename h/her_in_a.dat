5|$|Despite {{her years}} of service, {{she had never}} {{received}} a regular salary and was for years denied compensation. Her unofficial status and the unequal payments offered to black soldiers caused great difficulty in documenting her service, and the U.S. government was slow in recognizing its debt to her. Tubman did not receive a pension for her service in the Civil War until 1899. Her constant humanitarian work for her family and former slaves, meanwhile, kept <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of constant poverty, and her difficulties in obtaining a government pension were especially taxing for her.|$|E

5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> studio kitchen.

The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested {{in the lives of the}} celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.|$|E
