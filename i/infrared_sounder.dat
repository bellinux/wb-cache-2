Many sensors used for climate measurements were designed to meet operational weather needs and are not optimized for climate sampling. [...] These sensors, along with older instruments designed for climate, lack the on-board ability to test for systematic errors on orbit. The CLARREO mission will meet these goals through careful consideration of the instrument design, calibration traceability at all stages of development and operation, with spectral, spatial and temporal sampling focused specifically on the creation of climate records.

50|$|The 1989 {{rebuilding}} {{of the theater}} was extensive. It involved razing the interior commercial space within the forward, Main Street-facing section of the building {{as well as the}} stage house, while carefully preserving and restoring the 1866-71 facade and the 1919 auditorium. At the same time, the interior auditorium portion of the structure was completely renovated. All of the commercial space at street level was reclaimed for a grand, new lobby. The result was an extensively-new Victoria Theatre (as it was now so re-named) designed expressly for the performing arts. The auditorium retained its original appearance with completely restored plaster work, drapery, marble work, gilding, and fresco detailing.

50|$|The {{study of}} {{supersaturation}} is also relevant to atmospheric studies. Since the 1940s, {{the presence of}} supersaturation in the atmosphere has been known. When water is supersaturated in the troposphere, the formation of ice lattices is frequently observed. In a state of saturation, the water particles will not form ice under tropospheric conditions. It {{is not enough for}} molecules of water to form an ice lattice at saturation pressures; they require a surface to condense on to or conglomerations of liquid water molecules of water to freeze. For these reasons, relative humidities over ice in the atmosphere can be found above 100%, meaning supersaturation as occurred. Supersaturation of water is actually very common in the upper troposphere, occurring between 20% and 40% of the time. This can be determined using satellite data from the Atmospheric <b>Infrared</b> <b>Sounder.</b> Evidence of supersaturation in the troposphere {{can be seen in the}} contrails of airplanes and rocket ships, which need to reach a humidity above that of ice saturation in order to form.|$|E

TIR instruments are conventionally considered to be inadequate for monitoring near-surface composition, because their sensitivity to the lowest part of the atmosphere is limited by the thermal contrast between the ground and the air above it.
