5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Pyramid anchors are pyramid-shaped anchors, {{also known}} as Dor-Mor anchors. They work in the {{upside-down}} position with the apex pointing <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> such that when they are deployed, the weight of wider base pushes the pyramid down digging into the floor. As the anchors are encountered with lateral pulls, the side edges or corners of the pyramids will dig deeper under the floor, making them more stable.|$|E

500|$|On 13 August 1997, amateur divers {{discovered}} Carol Park's body, clad {{only in a}} nightdress, 75 feet <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of Coniston Water. She was nicknamed [...] "the Lady in the Lake" [...] by detectives {{after the}} 1943 detective novel by Raymond Chandler, The Lady in the Lake. The body had been wrapped in a pinafore dress, a canvas rucksack and plastic bags, tied with several knots, and weighed down with lead piping. Her eyes had been covered by plasters. It was later reported that the body had landed on an underwater ledge, and had it been thrown into the water a few metres farther from the land, it would probably never have been found.|$|E
500|$|Sperm whales usually dive between , and {{sometimes}} , {{in search of}} food. Such dives can last more than an hour. They feed on several species, notably the giant squid, but also the colossal squid, octopuses, and fish like demersal rays, but their diet is mainly medium-sized squid. Some prey may be taken accidentally while eating other items. Most {{of what is known}} about deep sea squid has been learned from specimens in captured sperm whale stomachs, although more recent studies analysed feces. One study, carried out around the Galápagos, found that squid from the genera Histioteuthis (62%), Ancistrocheirus (16%), and Octopoteuthis (7%) weighing between [...] were the most commonly taken. Battles between sperm whales and giant squid or colossal squid have never been observed by humans; however, white scars are believed to be caused by the large squid. One study published in 2010 collected evidence that suggests that female sperm whales may collaborate when hunting Humboldt squid. Tagging studies have shown that sperm whales hunt upside <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of their deep dives. It is suggested that the whales can see the squid silhouetted above them against the dim surface light.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} Cody Caves began 600 {{million years ago}} when the {{limestone}} in which the caves later formed was laid <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of an ancient sea. Then, around 170 million years ago, the limestone beds were thrust upwards. This exposed the rock to the elements, water and carbonic acid, which eventually formed Cody Caves. Approximately [...] of the Cody Caves passageways are explorable. The caves have several types of calcite formations, such as stalagmites, stalactites, soda straws and flowstone. The boxwork is considered to be {{among the best in the}} world, protruding up to 20.3cm, whereas 2.5 to 5cm is average. These ancient formations have been growing at an average rate of one cubic centimetre per hundred years.|$|E

60|$|Being {{out in a}} boat on {{the river}} Lea, {{especially}} on Saturday afternoons, soon makes you smart at handling a craft, and spry at escaping being run down by roughs or swamped by barges; and it also affords plenty of opportunity for acquiring the most prompt and graceful method of lying <b>down</b> flat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of <b>the</b> boat {{so as to avoid}} being chucked out into the river by passing tow-lines.|$|R
