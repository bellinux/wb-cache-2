25|$|Chassis punches are {{available}} {{in a number of}} shapes, round being the most common. Other shapes include square, hexagonal, and special shapes for thing such as holes with key tabs and <b>D-sub</b> connectors Special shapes often use bolts that are square or keyed and a separate nut on the punch end to ensure alignment of the punch and die.|$|E
25|$|It {{will also}} come {{with up to}} 2GB of RAM, a {{standard}} netbook style 10.1-inch LCD screen, an option of either an 8 or 16GB SSD or a 160 or 250GB hard drive. Other features include 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi, 10/100Mbit Ethernet, a 1.3megapixel webcam, three USB 2.0 ports, a memory card reader, a <b>D-sub</b> connector {{and a pair of}} audio jacks.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the discontinuation of PSP, the Chinese electronics company Lenkeng released a PSP to HDMI converter called the LKV-8000. The device {{is compatible with the}} PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP GO, but the AV cable packaged with it requires an adapter to plug into the PSP GO's port. Instead of component RCA plugs, the PSP's YPbPr AV signal is carried through a <b>D-sub</b> 9 cable that screws into the converter box, which then converts the signal from analog to digital and upscales it to 720p through HDMI. Lenkeng also released a variant of the LKV-8000 with a button allowing the user to toggle between 720p and 1080p. To overcome the problems of PSP games being displayed in a small window surrounded by a black boarder, the LKV-8000 featured a Zoom button on the connector itself. This allowed players to fill screen natively, without any need to use the television's zoom function. A few other Chinese companies have also released clones of this upscaler under different names, like the Pyle PSPHD42. The LKV-8000 and its variants have become popular among players and reviewers as the only means of playing and recording PSP gameplay in full screen.|$|E
5000|$|Cannon also {{produced}} [...] "combo" [...] <b>D-subs</b> with larger contacts {{in place of}} some of the normal contacts, for use for high-current, high-voltage, or co-axial inserts. The DB-13W3 variant was commonly used for high-performance video connections; this variant provided 10 regular (#20) pins plus three coaxial contacts for the red, green, and blue video signals. Combo <b>D-subs</b> are currently manufactured in a broad range of configurations by other companies, including Amphenol, Conec, Teledyne Reynolds, Assmann Electronics, Norcomp, Positronic, Cinch, 3M, and Tyco. Some variants have current ratings up to 40 A or operating voltages as high as 13,500 V; others are waterproof and meet IP67 standards.|$|R
50|$|The widest {{application}} of <b>D-subs</b> is for RS-232 serial communications, though the standard {{did not make}} this connector mandatory. RS-232 devices originally used the DB25, but for many applications the less common signals were omitted, allowing a DE-9 to be used. The standard specifies a male connector for terminal equipment and a female connector for modems, but many variations exist. IBM PC-compatible computers tend to have male connectors at the device and female connectors at the modems. Early Apple Macintosh models used DE-9 connectors for RS-422 multi-drop serial interfaces (which can operate as RS-232). Later Macintosh models use 8-pin miniature DIN connectors instead.|$|R
2500|$|RGB is {{also the}} term {{referring}} to a type of component video signal used in the video electronics industry. [...] It consists of three signals—red, green, and blue—carried on three separate cables/pins. RGB signal formats are often based on modified versions of the RS-170 and RS-343 standards for monochrome video. This type of video signal is widely used in Europe {{since it is the}} best quality signal that can be carried on the standard SCART connector. This signal is known as RGBS (4 BNC/RCA terminated cables exist as well), but it is directly compatible [...] with RGBHV used for computer monitors (usually carried on 15-pin cables terminated with 15-pin <b>D-sub</b> or 5 BNC connectors), [...] which carries separate horizontal and vertical sync signals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{built-in}} display was a one-bit black-and-white, [...] CRT with a fixed {{resolution of}} 512×342 pixels, establishing the desktop publishing standard of 72 PPI. Expansion and networking were achieved using two non-standard RS-422 DE-9 serial ports named [...] "printer" [...] and [...] "modem"; {{they did not}} support hardware handshaking. An external floppy disk drive could be added using a proprietary connector (19-pin <b>D-sub).</b> The keyboard and mouse used simple proprietary protocols, allowing some third-party upgrades. The original keyboard had no arrow keys, numeric keypad or function keys. This was an intentional decision by Apple, as these keys were common on older platforms and {{it was thought that}} the addition of these keys would encourage software developers to simply port their existing applications to the Mac, rather than design new ones around the GUI paradigm. Later, Apple would make a numeric keypad available for the Macintosh 128K. The keyboard sold with the newer Macintosh Plus model would include the numeric keypad and arrow keys, but still no function keys. As with the Apple Lisa before it, the mouse had a single button. Standard headphones could also be connected to a monaural jack. Apple also offered their 300 and 1200bit/s modems originally released for the Apple II line. Initially, the only printer available was the Apple ImageWriter, a dot matrix printer which was designed to produce 144dpi WYSIWYG output from the Mac's 72dpi screen. Eventually, the LaserWriter and other printers were capable of being connected using AppleTalk, Apple's built-in networking system.|$|E
50|$|A smaller type of {{connector}} {{derived from}} the <b>D-sub</b> is called the microminiature D, or micro-D, which is a trademark of ITT Cannon. It is about half {{the length of a}} <b>D-sub.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Chroma was {{designed}} and released before the introduction of MIDI. The Chroma's main microprocessor was a 68B09 with a computer interface consisting of a 25-pin <b>D-sub</b> connector. An Apple IIe interface card (used to connect to the Chroma's <b>D-sub</b> connector) and sequencing software was released by ARP and Fender Rhodes. Multiple third parties came out with Chroma-to-MIDI converter boxes. They use the 25-pin <b>D-sub</b> connector to interface with the Chroma.|$|E
5000|$|Presence of a 25-pin <b>D-sub</b> {{connector}} {{does not}} necessarily indicate an RS-232-C compliant interface. For example, on the original IBM PC, a male <b>D-sub</b> was an RS-232-C DTE port (with a non-standard current loop interface on reserved pins), but the female <b>D-sub</b> connector on the same PC model {{was used for the}} parallel [...] "Centronics" [...] printer port. Some personal computers put non-standard voltages or signals on some pins of their serial ports.|$|E
50|$|The <b>D-sub</b> {{connector}} {{family is}} now out of general usage in the computer industry, due to size and cost. For portable devices such as PDAs, MP3 players, laptops, and smartphones, the <b>D-sub</b> connector is far too large to fit.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{a female}} {{high-density}} D-subminiature connector {{with a size}} 1 shell can be named DE15F or DE15S (see accompanying pictures). Both terms mean the same thing but could be construed to be completely different items. Similarly, a male standard-density <b>D-sub</b> with a size 1 shell can be named DE9M or DE9P; a female standard-density <b>D-sub</b> with a size 2 shell can be named DA15F or DA15S; a male high-density <b>D-sub</b> with a size 3 shell can be named DB44M or DB44P; and so forth.|$|E

50|$|For video {{applications}} the DE15HD connector {{has been}} replaced by DVI, HDMI and DisplayPort connectors. A notable exception to this replacement is on the few analog CRT monitors still in use: the analog version of the DVI connector is similar in price and more complex than the <b>D-sub,</b> so the shift away from D-subs was slow in this case. For the majority of consumer applications, <b>D-sub</b> serial and parallel connectors have been replaced by the physically much simpler and cheaper IEEE 1394 (FireWire), SATA, USB, Thunderbolt or modular connectors. These connectors tend to be less rugged and durable than <b>D-sub</b> connectors - for example, the SATA connector as part of a cable assembly is specified to withstand only 50 manual insertions - but the robustness of the <b>D-sub</b> is more than is needed in many consumer product applications.|$|E

50|$|Fender also {{released}} a keyboard-less {{version of the}} Chroma called the Chroma Expander. Like the Chroma, the main microprocessor in the Expander is a 68B09 with a computer interface consisting of a 25-pin <b>D-sub</b> connector. The Expander can be slaved to the Chroma via the 25-pin <b>D-sub</b> connector.Third party Chroma-to-MIDI converter boxes produced for the Chroma also work for the Expander.|$|E
50|$|The Radeon HD 3600 {{series was}} based on the codenamed RV635 GPU, packed 378 million {{transistors}} on 55 nm fabrication process, and had 128-bit memory bus width. The support for HDMI and <b>D-sub</b> ports is also achieved through separate dongles. Beside the DisplayPort implementations, there also exists other display output layouts as dual DVI port or DVI with <b>D-sub</b> display output layout.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{at least}} seven {{different}} methods used to attach wires to the contacts in <b>D-sub</b> connectors.|$|E
50|$|The 25-pin <b>D-sub</b> {{connector}} {{is still}} occasionally used in recording studios for multi-channel analog audio and AES digital audio.|$|E
5000|$|DE-15 {{has been}} {{conventionally}} referred to ambiguously as <b>D-sub</b> 15, incorrectly as DB-15 and often as HD-15 (High Density, to {{distinguish it from}} the DE-9 connector used on the older CGA and EGA cards, {{as well as some}} early VGA cards, which have the same E shell size but only two rows of pins). The video connector is an [...] "E" [...] size <b>D-sub</b> connector, with 15 pins in three rows, which is the high-density connector version (DE15HD).|$|E

50|$|Because {{of their}} {{relative}} complexity (the D-shaped metal shield, the screws and nuts), <b>D-sub</b> connectors are inherently {{more expensive than}} later connectors that superseded them.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} {{design of}} <b>D-sub</b> connectors is ill-suited for consumer plug-and-play applications. Thin metal pins, especially in higher-density connectors, are easily bent or broken, particularly if frequently plugged in by touch behind equipment. The need to tighten screws for a secure connection is cumbersome. There {{is a high}} risk of shorting the male pins with the mating connector's surrounding lip as well. Although ESD- and EMI-resistant <b>D-sub</b> connectors exist, the fundamental design was never intended to protect from electrostatic discharge or electromagnetic interference or facilitate very high frequency interconnections.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>D-sub</b> connectors are now {{defined by}} an international standard, IEC 60807-3 / DIN 41652. The United States military also maintains another specification for D-subminiature connectors, the MIL-DTL-24308 standard.|$|E
50|$|A {{general rule}} is that DCE devices provide the clock signal (internal clocking) and the DTE device synchronizes on the {{provided}} clock (external clocking). <b>D-sub</b> connectors follow another rule for pin assignment.|$|E
50|$|The D-subminiature or <b>D-sub</b> is {{a common}} type of {{electrical}} connector. They are named for their characteristic D-shaped metal shield. When they were introduced, D-subs were among the smallest connectors used on computer systems.|$|E
50|$|For this reason, D-sub-to-modular {{adapters}} {{are typically}} shipped with the <b>D-sub</b> contacts (pins or sockets) terminated but not {{inserted into the}} connector body, so that the D-sub-to-modular contact pairing can be performed by the equipment maker.|$|E
50|$|A further {{family of}} {{connectors}} of similar appearance to the <b>D-sub</b> family uses {{names such as}} HD-50 and HD-68, and has a D-shaped shell about half {{the width of a}} DB25. They are common in SCSI attachments.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{application}} {{scenario is}} to enable USB based computers to access {{and communicate with}} serial devices featuring <b>D-Sub</b> (usually DB9 or DB25) connectors or screw terminals, where security of the data transmission is not generally an issue.|$|E
50|$|<b>D-SUB</b> 37 {{connectors}} {{are commonly}} used in Hospital facilities as an interface between hospital beds and nurse call systems, allowing for the connection and signaling of Nurse Call, Bed Exit, and Cord out including TV entertainment and lighting controls.|$|E
50|$|The Chroma {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{microprocessor}} controlled analog synthesizers. It was designed before MIDI and featured a 25-pin <b>D-sub</b> connector computer interface used to slave the Expander to the Chroma. Also, an Apple IIe interface card and sequencing software was available.|$|E
