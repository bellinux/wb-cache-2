5|$|<b>Justice</b> <b>for</b> <b>All</b> is {{a visual}} novel {{adventure}} {{game in which}} the player takes the role of Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney who defends people accused of murder in four different episodes. At first, only one episode is available; as the player solves a case, a new episode is unlocked to play. The episodes are all divided into chapters, consisting of courtroom sections and investigation sections.|$|E
5|$|The band {{recorded}} …And <b>Justice</b> <b>for</b> <b>All</b> {{during early}} 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Musically, {{the album is}} progressive, with long and complex songs, fast tempos, and few verse-chorus structures. It is noted for its sterile production, which producer Flemming Rasmussen attributed to his absence during the mixing process. The lyrics feature themes of political and legal injustice seen through the prisms of censorship, war, and nuclear brinkmanship.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as he felt he had explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in <b>Justice</b> <b>for</b> <b>All,</b> he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi {{trying to come up with}} a way of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} game's {{development}} was finished, Mikami told Takumi {{that they should}} make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. Takumi had originally planned to let Edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes in the second game, but during the production the development team learned that the character had become popular. This led to Takumi feeling {{that he had to}} use the character more carefully and sparingly; he created the new prosecutor character Franziska von Karma, to save Edgeworth for the game's last case, and avoid a situation where he – a supposed prodigy – loses every case. As Takumi wanted the three first Ace Attorney games to be parts of a larger work, he avoided making a lot of changes between games: art from the first game for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series; and no new gameplay mechanics were added for Trials and Tribulations, as Takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche-lock mechanic for <b>Justice</b> <b>for</b> <b>All.</b>|$|E

After three pilots done between 1968 and 1970, a network change to CBS, and the last name of the character changed to Bunker, the new sitcom was renamed All in the Family. The show was based on the BBC's Till Death Us Do Part, with Bunker based on Alf Garnett, but somewhat less abrasive than the original. O'Connor's Queens background and New York accent is said to have influenced Lear to set the show in Queens.|$|E
