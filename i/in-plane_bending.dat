40|$|In this {{investigation}} two simple tests are conducted to characterise the shear, out-of-plane bending stiffness and <b>in-plane</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness of engineering fabrics and to investigate their wrinkling response during shear. A cantilever bending test [1] is first {{used to measure}} the out-of-plane bending stiffness while {{a modified version of the}} uniaxial bias extension (UBE) test is used to explore both the in-plane shear and the <b>in-plane</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness of the fabric (see Figure 1 a). An estimate of the shear resistance of the fabric is obtained using normalisation theory [2]. In [3] it was shown that, for a given tensile stiffness in the two fibre directions, the in-plane deformation kinematics of the specimen are determined by the ratio between the fabric’s in-plane shear stiffness and <b>in-plane</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness. Thus, by measuring the fabric kinematics together with the shear stiffness of the fabric, the <b>in-plane</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness of the fabric is inferred using an inverse modelling approach.

40|$|Periodic {{structures}} {{have always}} been part of our lives. With the development of human understanding it was realised that natural opals, butterfly wings and bird feathers which have been keenly observed for generations are actually naturally occurring photonic crystals (structures with periodic modulation of the refractive index). In this work, I have investigated the scientific use of refractive index contrast and nanometer scale periodicity for applications in optical interconnects and surface plasmon resonance like dielectric optical sensors. One dimensional photonic crystals can be engineered to sustain a surface wave called as Bloch surface wave (BSW). A BSW based label-free sensor is designed and implemented using only a pair of high (Si, 70 nm) and low (SiO 2, 676 nm) index materials in contrast to multiple pairs used previously. The demonstrated bulk sensitivity (900 nm/RIU) for a single pair sensor is comparable to the multi-pair sensors using the prism based Kretschmann-Raether configuration. The demonstrated sensor using only a single pair of dielectric layers is the dielectric counterpart of the surface plasmon resonance based sensors using gold on dielectric. A SU 8 waveguide is cladded by the above mentioned thicknesses of silicon and silica to demonstrate on-chip sensing using the end-fire coupling for the first time. The demonstrated on-chip sensing platform is simple to fabricate and is believed to lay the foundation of a cheap and sensitive integrated sensing system. Organically Modified Ceramic (ORMOCER) based single-mode waveguides and passive devices for both single and multi-level centimetre sized optical boards using nano-imprint lithography (NIL) are demonstrated with waveguide loss less than 0. 2 dB/cm. An ‘optical via’ for vertical coupling of light from one optical plane to another is designed and implemented using NIL. A novel 1 x 4 2 D optical port is designed and implemented {{for the first time to}} spatially distribute the input light over different optical planes. Polymer waveguides inherently have smaller refractive index contrast between core and cladding requiring a bending radius of atleast 8 mm for lossless communication. Sharp <b>in-plane</b> <b>bends</b> are demonstrated for the first time by integrating core-shell colloidal crystals with these polymer waveguides. The demonstrated efficiency for <b>in-plane</b> <b>bends</b> is poor which will improve with optimisation of the colloidal crystal fabrication.

Here, we present IR-UV double-resonance spectra of jet-cooled, uncapped peptides containing a tryptophan (Trp) UV chromophore in the 1000 - 2000 cm- 1 spectral range.

40|$|Deuteration of Bronsted acidic {{sites in}} zeolites gives {{observable}} infrared <b>in-plane</b> O-D <b>bending</b> modes. For zeolite Y and ZK- 5, a maximum near 870 cm- 1 with a shoulder near 890 cm- 1 is observed. These signals are related to, respectively, the high-frequency and the low-frequency stretching modes. Mordenite, zeolite beta and ZSM- 5 possess a single mode near 890 cm- 1. The zeolite structure type and composition influences {{the position of}} the modes strongly. A large anharmonicity parameter, x(deltadelta) OD (- 80 cm- 1), is found due to Fermi resonance with the zeolite lattice mode...|$|R
