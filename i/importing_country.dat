40|$|In this {{working paper}} we model {{the case of}} an {{international}} non-renewable resource monopolist as a dynamic game between a monopolist and <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> governments, and we investigate whether a tariff on resource imports can be advantageous for the consumers of the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> when the monopolist sets the price and the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> governments act in a non-cooperative way. We find that a tariff is advantageous for the consumers even when there is no commitment to the trade policy, although the part of the rent that can be reaped by the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> decreases substantially with the number of <b>importing</b> <b>countries.</b> The optimality of the tariff in our dynamic game is {{explained by the fact that}} through the tariff the governments of the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> can influence the dynamics of the accumulated extractions and hence the extraction costs and the evolution of the monopolist price.

25|$|The world's largest {{deposits}} of bitumen are in Canada, although Venezuela's {{deposits of}} extra-heavy crude oil are even bigger. Canada has vast energy resources {{of all types}} and its {{oil and natural gas}} resource base would be large enough to meet Canadian needs for generations if demand was sustained. Abundant hydroelectric resources account for the majority of Canada's electricity production and very little electricity is produced from oil. In a scenario with oil prices above US$100, Canada would have more than enough energy to meet its growing needs, with the excess oil production from its oil sands probably going to export. The major <b>importing</b> <b>country</b> would probably continue to be the United States, although before the developments in 2014, there was increasing demand for oil, particularly heavy oil, from Asian countries such as China and India.|$|E

The results show that the oil price shocks influenced the TOT in the oil exporting and <b>importing</b> <b>countries,</b> differently. So that, in oil exporting countries, positive (negative) oil price shocks have significantly positive (negative) effect on their TOT, while in oil <b>importing</b> <b>countries,</b> positive (negative) oil price shocks have significantly a negative (positive) effect on TOT. Furthermore, the findings reveal that in the oil exporting countries, the effect of negative oil price shocks on TOT is more than positive oil price shocks.

For commodities such as grains, while grain production rises in exporting countries, the effect is not sufficient to cover the fall in production in <b>importing</b> <b>countries.</b> In particular, the impact is serious on food security in <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> of agricultural products.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how criminalizing {{the act of}} bribing a foreign public official affects international trade flows using a watershed global anti-corruption initiative – the 1997 OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. This multilateral agreement criminalized foreign bribery (previously illegal only for U. S. firms) in countries that represent over 75 % of world exports. I exploit temporal variation {{in the implementation of}} the Convention along with variation in the level of corruption of <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> to quantify the effects of the Convention on bilateral exports. In contrast to previous work on U. S. efforts to criminalize foreign bribery, I use a large panel of exporters and importers to control for a broad range of confounding global and national trends and shocks. I find that, on average, the Convention caused a reduction in bilateral exports from signatory countries to high corruption <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> relative to low corruption <b>importing</b> <b>countries.</b> In particular, we observe a 5. 6 % relative decline in bilateral exports to <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> that lie one standard deviation lower on the Worldwide Governance Indicators index of corruption. This suggests that by creating large penalties for foreign bribery, the Convention indirectly increased transaction costs between <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> with high levels of corruption and exporting countries that criminalized foreign bribery. The Convention may have induced OECD firms to divert their exports to less corrupt countries; while at the same time, non-OECD firms that are not bound by the Convention may have increased their exports to corrupt countries. I also find evidence that the effects of the Convention differed across product categories...|$|R

The European Union (EU) has agreed to reduce their direct export subsidies if the United States reduces its export credits.

However, the impacts of such a reduction on the <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> and the United States are not clear. In light of this debate, we analyze the impact of a reduction in the repayment period to 180 days on <b>importing</b> <b>countries</b> and examine the subsequent effects on U.
