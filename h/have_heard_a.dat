5|$|A {{variation}} of this origin of Chamba {{is that it}} originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent. The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. Suddenly he was said to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> voice which informed him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his lack of trust in her morals. The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter’s honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King’s daughter is venerated as a goddess. Every year, since 935, the Minjar festival or fair has been held. It lasts for 21 days, coinciding with {{the first day of}} Baisakhi.|$|E
25|$|Guards {{initially}} {{laughed at}} the claims of ghosts by inmates but as time progressed some {{were reported to have}} experienced unusual activity themselves, including feeling cold spots, unseen fingers on the back of their neck, and crying in the night. The first Warden of Alcatraz, James A. Johnston, was reputed to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> woman sobbing while conducting tour of the prison. Occupants of the prison reported seeing prisoners from the early military prison in 19th century garb walking the corridors in A-Block which would disappear when approached by the guards, and one member of staff reputedly saw a gang of Native American prisoners marching around in a circle before vanishing. Phantom gunfire, cannon blasts and fire alarms going off on their own accord have all been reported. The Warden's House, now a burnt out shell since the Occupation of Alcatraz, is also reputed to be haunted; {{during the time of the}} penitentiary, several guards reported seeing the spectre of a man with mutton-chop sideburns during a party wearing a gray suit and brimmed cap, leaving the room icy cold and extinguishing the fire in the Ben Franklin stove. A phantom lighthouse has also been said to have emerged from the fog of San Francisco bay.|$|E

500|$|The 20th Party Congress {{opened on}} 14 February 1956. In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates {{to rise in}} honor of the {{communist}} leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with Klement Gottwald and the little-known Kyuichi Tokuda. In {{the early morning hours of}} 25 February, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the [...] "Secret Speech" [...] to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates. In four hours, he demolished Stalin's reputation. Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the [...] "congress listened to me in silence.

500|$|Falcons coach Dan Reeves {{was praised}} {{for his ability}} to lead the team after having heart surgery only weeks prior, as Reeves' {{comeback}} proved to be an emotional rallying point for the team. Austin Murphy of Sports Illustrated noted that Reeves' return [...] " [...] the already close-knit Falcons," [...] and Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle agreed: [...] "Dan has really inspired us all. [...] He walked in the meeting room four days after having had surgery, and you could <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> pin drop. We wanted to hear every last word he had to say." [...] Reeves described his time during the season as [...] "more rewarding than any other teams I've been involved in," [...] and to Falcons special teams coach Joe DeCamillis, Reeves' leadership that season was [...] "his best coaching job ever." [...] CBS called Reeves' return [...] "an amazing comeback that people will be talking about for years." ...|$|E
500|$|A fresh {{round of}} {{interest}} in L'Oiseau Blanc began in the 1980s, after freelance writer Gunnar Hansen of Northeast Harbor, Maine, researched and published {{an article in the}} June 1980 issue of Yankee Magazine, titled [...] "The Unfinished Flight of the White Bird". Hansen revealed how Anson Berry (d. 1936), a hermit living near Machias, Maine, claimed late in the afternoon of 9 May 1927 to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> sputtering aircraft fly over his isolated camp at Round Lake, Maine. Berry {{had not been able to}} see the aircraft because of fog and low clouds, but had heard what sounded like a crash or forced landing in the distance. Reportedly Berry tried to locate the crash site but was unsuccessful Hansen and others did a great deal of research during the 1980s, and located multiple other witnesses who reported memories of the aircraft in a line from Nova Scotia down to eastern Maine on that date.|$|E

2500|$|The benign {{intentions}} of the United States were also argued by John Bright and Richard Cobden, strong supporters of the United States and leaders of the Anti-Corn Law League in Britain. Both had expressed strong reservations about the legality of American actions, but argued strongly that the United States had no aggressive designs against Great Britain. [...] Bright publicly disputed that the confrontation had been intentionally engineered by Washington. In an early December speech to his constituents, he condemned the British military preparations [...] "before {{we have made a}} representation to the American Government, before we <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> word from it in reply, [...] should be all up in arms, every sword leaping from its scabbard and every man looking about for his pistols and blunderbusses?" [...] Cobden joined with Bright by speaking at public meetings and by writing letters to newspapers, organizers of meetings that he could not attend, and influential people in and out of Britain. As time passed and voices opposing war were heard more and more, the Cabinet also began considering alternatives to war, including arbitration.|$|E
