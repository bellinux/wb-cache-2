Crowds often assemble at popular viewing points and car parking may prove difficult. Related to the time of the <b>high</b> <b>tide</b> at Sharpness, the bore passes Newnham on Severn one hour before this, Framilode and Arlingham, twenty-five minutes before, Epney twenty minutes before, Minsterworth at the <b>high</b> <b>tide,</b> Stonebench, on the east bank, fifteen minutes after the <b>high</b> <b>tide</b> and Over Bridge thirty-five minutes afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{remained}} far from land, the waves triggered by Liza {{were able to}} reach California, where they combined with <b>high</b> <b>tide,</b> threatening beachfront homes that had weakened foundations after a previous tide. The hurricane was responsible for sweeping hundreds of Labor Day swimmers out into the ocean in Zuma Beach and Newport Beach, {{all of whom were}} saved by lifeguards. The waves also tore off a group of sundecks estimated at $5,000(1968USD) near Laguna Beach.|$|E
5|$|At Isle of Palms in South Carolina, {{workers and}} dozens of firefighters {{prepared}} sandbags in preparation for <b>high</b> <b>tide</b> after waves from the storm previously caused moderate beach erosion. As a precaution, officials there intentionally cut power and gas to multiple uninhabited buildings.

5|$|Caribbean {{monk seals}} {{were found in}} warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to haul out at sites (low sandy beaches above <b>high</b> <b>tide)</b> on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally would visit the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes (or their remnants) {{occasionally}} track {{through the}} area in late summer and early fall, but are often weak {{by the time they}} reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location. Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of <b>high</b> <b>tide,</b> storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|In late 1943, Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{in charge}} of {{improving}} the coastal defences along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion, expected to take place sometime in 1944. Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In the immediate area of Gold, between Le Hamel and La Rivière, seven defensive strongpoints designed to hold 50 men apiece were constructed. Two major concrete-reinforced coastal artillery emplacements (a battery of four 122mm guns at Mont Fleury and the Longues-sur-Mer battery, with four 150mm guns) were only partially completed by D-Day. Rommel ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} the beach to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at <b>high</b> <b>tide</b> so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the <b>high</b> <b>tide</b> mark. Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry.|$|E

5|$|A salvage {{attempt was}} ordered by Secretary of State William Paget only {{days after the}} sinking, and Charles Brandon, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of {{practical}} details. The operation followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship and fastened to two empty ships, or hulks. At low tide, the ropes were pulled taut with capstans. When the <b>high</b> <b>tide</b> came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|E
5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape {{during the rainy}} season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms of}} soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during <b>high</b> <b>tide.</b> Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
5|$|Because Missouri had {{run aground}} during an unusually <b>high</b> <b>tide,</b> Wallin {{required}} a date {{on which the}} tide would be roughly comparable to {{the conditions under which}} Missouri was grounded in order to free her. The date selected was 2 February. With time as a factor, Wallin took charge of the operation and put his five-point plan into motion. With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional buoyancy for the tug boats when the time came to move Missouri.|$|E
30|$|The main {{differences}} in diet between daytime and nighttime <b>high</b> <b>tides</b> {{are attributable to}} cyprids and juvenile bivalves, which comprise the bulk of A. nigrescens diet. Cyprids seem to be captured mostly during daytime <b>high</b> <b>tides.</b> Cruz ([1999]) found that settlement of Chthamalus spp. in the low intertidal zone during daytime <b>high</b> <b>tides</b> was significantly <b>higher</b> than during the night, with densities of up to 74 cyprids and metamorphs per 25  cm 2 quadrat. In another study, settlement of C. montagui was ten times higher during the day than during the night, which led the authors to hypothesize that cyprids use light as a cue to settle (Cruz et al. [2005]). Conversely, in our study juvenile bivalves were captured predominantly during nighttime <b>high</b> <b>tides.</b> However, due {{to the difficulty of}} identifying the bivalves, {{it is not possible to}} know about their natural history, although data from this study suggest that they settle mainly at night.|$|R

5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at <b>high</b> <b>tide,</b> and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more {{by the end of this}} century.|$|E
5|$|On the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} a storm surge peaking at 8feet (2.4m) on the Chesapeake Bay in Hoopers Island and 6.5feet (2m) on the Atlantic coast in Ocean City. The {{track of the}} hurricane to the west funneled into the bay and was so strong it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay. Tolchester Beach recorded a record-breaking <b>high</b> <b>tide</b> of 7.91feet (2.4m) above mean low water. Rainfall in the Maryland portion of the Delmarva Peninsula reached 3.2inches (81mm) in Steeles Neck. The large circulation of the hurricane produced strong winds across the area, including maximum sustained winds of 52mph (84km/h) and a gust of 66mph (106km/h) in Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Estuary {{has one of}} {{the highest}} tidal ranges in the world, up to , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range, and the {{underlying}} geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The tidal range means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at <b>high</b> <b>tide</b> and the landing stage at the end of the pier has several levels to allow boats to dock at all stages of the tide.|$|E
