5|$|Michelle {{is another}} New Yorker, in her forties, who {{believed}} {{she was the only}} Hasidic lesbian in the world and as a consequence allowed herself to be pressured into marriage. However, she got divorced and was subsequently ostracized by her <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>community</b> when they discovered she was homosexual.

5|$|Antankarana {{homes are}} {{typically}} raised on stilts above ground level. Young men seeking {{to start a}} family typically leave their father's house and build their own from wood and thatch gathered locally. After marrying a young woman will leave her family's home to move into her husband's house, where she manages the household and assists in planting and harvesting rice. The husband is responsible for earning money for basic necessities and farming the family's land. A young couple typically receives furniture and other essentials as wedding gifts from friends, <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>community</b> members. Divorce and remarriage are common in Antankarana society.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies of}} young adults who had used AAC since {{childhood}} report a generally good quality of life, though few lived independently, or were in paid employment. The young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and unaided AAC approaches. More positive quality of life outcomes often correlated with better quality of communication and interaction, as well as personal characteristics, <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>community</b> support, and excellent AAC services. Poorer outcomes were related to {{lack of access to}} appropriate AAC supports and resources, problems with technology and negative attitudes.|$|E
5|$|Lassie themes {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} boys and their dogs with the show helping to shape the viewer's understanding of mid-twentieth century American boyhood. Lassie {{was associated with the}} wholesome family values of its period but some parents' groups monitoring television content found cliffhanger plots showing children in danger too intense for very young viewers and objected to some of Timmy's actions which were believed to encourage children to disobey parents. However, Lassie was consistently depicted as caring, nurturing, and responsible with a commitment to <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>community,</b> often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs. She was the perfect 'mother' within the American ideology of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The cult of Thor {{was linked}} up with men's {{habitation}} and possessions, and with {{well-being of the}} <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>community.</b> This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past {{have been used as}} fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with Sif of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess, when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{outlines}} {{the rise of}} interest in the interconnecting contexts of children, <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> the consequences of those interconnections. <b>Families</b> <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> can offer both opportunities and constraints for children's participation in the world and their general development, and the impact of context varies with the child's age and other characteristics such as disability, ethnicity and gender. The interest in context has led to descriptions of 'the ecology of childhood', and explorations of 'the cultural nature' of children's development. It has led also to the recognition that - for the analysis of child development, family life or social policy - we need studies on the ways in which children, <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> are interconnected. The pathways that lead to negative and positive consequences for individual children, <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> also need close examination as do the best opportunities for intervention to enable a turning point in life trajectories...|$|R

40|$|Family {{violence}} {{has been an}} issue of serious concern to Aboriginal people, <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> in Victoria {{for a number of}} years. In 2003, the Victorian Indigenous Family Violence Task Force Report identified that it is widely recognised <b>and</b> acknowledged that <b>family</b> violence adversely affects the social, cultural, health, emotional, and economic well being of Aboriginal people, <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>communities.</b> Aboriginal definitions of the nature <b>and</b> forms of <b>family</b> violence are broader and more encompassing than those used in a mainstream context. The Task Force Report affirmed the need to build on the strengths of Aboriginal <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> encompass Aboriginal concepts to effectively address family violence within Aboriginal communities. This resulted in a community led partnership between the Aboriginal <b>communities</b> of Victoria <b>and</b> government to address family violence together. Strong Culture, Strong Peoples, Strong Families: Towards a safer future for Indigenous <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>communities</b> Ten Year Plan 2 (the Ten Year Plan), identified the commitment to develop an Indigenous specific prevention framework for family violence which links to the wider prevention framework developed by the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation...|$|R
