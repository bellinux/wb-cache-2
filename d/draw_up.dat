50|$|The {{collaborative}} {{process can be}} used to facilitate a broad range of other family issues, including disputes between parents and the <b>drawing</b> <b>up</b> of pre and post-marital contracts. As the traditional method of <b>drawing</b> <b>up</b> pre-marital contracts is oppositional, many couples prefer to begin their married life with documents <b>drawn</b> <b>up</b> consensually and mutually.|$|R

5|$|Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 {{before he}} could <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> his last will. Since his son Richard had predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, claimed the inheritance. The Dudleys {{maintained}} that Guildford's daughter Jane was the natural heir. They finally won the resulting court case {{with the assistance of}} Thomas Cromwell.|$|E
5|$|A {{siege of}} the castle was started, but through papal {{intervention}} King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. A commission was appointed to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> an arrangement that would be acceptable to both sides. The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels {{the right to buy}} back forfeited estates, at prices depending on their level of involvement in the rebellion. After initial resistance, the terms were eventually accepted. By the summer of 1267, the country was pacified, and this spirit of reconciliation would last until the 1290s. The Dictum of Kenilworth was later incorporated into the Statute of Marlborough.|$|E
25|$|The first {{town plan}} had been <b>drawn</b> <b>up</b> by Assistant Surveyor Dixon in 1828, but {{the site was}} moved, as it was subject to flooding. The new town plan was <b>drawn</b> <b>up</b> by Surveyor Hoddle and was gazetted in 1833.|$|R

For the appointment of Duffy the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) undertook a consultation of academics and literary organisations to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> {{a short list of}} recommendations which they presented to the Prime Minister. He, in conjunction with the Cabinet Office then submitted the name to the Queen for approval.|$|E
5|$|Following further {{disputes}} and delays, {{it was reported}} in March 2010 that Edinburgh Council was considering cancelling the contract with Bilfinger Berger. By June 2010, the project's cost had risen to £600 million. Council project managers were reported to be in crisis talks, considering options including: borrowing £55 million to fund the increased costs; phasing {{the introduction of the}} tram line, so that trams would initially run between the airport and Haymarket; and terminating the contract with Bilfinger Berger. The council asked TIE to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> costs for truncating the line at four places: Haymarket station, York Place, the foot of Leith Walk or Ocean Terminal.|$|E
5|$|Hitler envisioned {{widespread}} car ownership {{as part of}} the new Germany and {{he arranged}} for designer Ferdinand Porsche to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> plans for the KdF-wagen (Strength Through Joy car), intended to be an automobile that every German citizen could afford. A prototype was displayed at the International Motor Show in Berlin on 17 February 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the factory was converted to produce military vehicles. No production models were sold until after the war, when the vehicle was renamed the Volkswagen (people's car).|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Nakayama {{commissioned}} the famed architect Yoshikazu Uchida to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> {{a blueprint for}} the area. Uchida arranged ten buildings around Oyasama's Residence. A 50-meter boulevard {{would come out of}} the Residence on a north-south axis, along which six school buildings would be lined up. Classrooms and large auditoriums would be built {{at the end of this}} boulevard. The international school and library were to be eventually integrated into this plan. In January 1937, a middle school (now Tenri High School) was built according to Uchida's plan, but as Japan mobilized for the Pacific War the plan had to be temporarily shelved.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Disney {{produced}} Mary Poppins, {{based on}} the book series by P. L. Travers; he had been trying to acquire the rights to the story since the 1940s. It became the most successful Disney film of the 1960s, although Travers disliked the film intensely and regretted having sold the rights. The same year he also became involved in plans to expand the California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> blueprints for a new building.|$|E
5|$|Operational {{experience}} had found Blackburn's Firebrand strike fighter {{to be far}} from suited to carrier operations. In particular, the pilot sat near the wing's trailing edge, looking over a very long and wide nose which gave a particularly poor view for landing. The Firecrest had also been rendered obsolete {{by the arrival of}} gas turbine engines, and while Blackburn did <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> proposals for turboprop-powered derivatives of the Firecrest, (as the B-62 (Y.A.6) with the Armstrong Siddeley Python engine), these went unbuilt, with orders instead going to Westland for the Wyvern. The two flying prototypes remained in use until 1949, being sold back to Blackburn in 1950, and were later scrapped.|$|E

5|$|Sardinia and Libya {{were already}} conquered by Marcellinus and Heraclius, when Basiliscus cast anchor off the Promontorium Mercurii, now Cap Bon, {{opposite}} Sicily, about forty miles from Carthage. Geiseric requested Basiliscus {{to allow him}} five days to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> the conditions of a peace. During the negotiations, Geiseric gathered his ships and suddenly attacked the Roman fleet. The Vandals had filled many vessels with combustible materials. During the night, these fire ships were propelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting Roman fleet. The Roman commanders tried to rescue some ships from destruction, but these manoeuvres were blocked by the attack of other Vandal vessels.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament has 20 Standing Committees {{consisting}} of 25 to 71 MEPs each (reflecting the political make-up {{of the whole}} Parliament) including a chair, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to <b>draw</b> <b>up,</b> amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to {{be presented to the}} plenary. The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not always been the case. In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the Budgetary Control Committee's narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.|$|E
5|$|The role of UNTAG was {{to assist}} the Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG), Martti Ahtisaari, in {{overseeing}} {{free and fair elections}} in Namibia for a Constituent Assembly. The elections were to be carried out by the South African Administrator General, under UN supervision and control, and this Assembly would then <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> a constitution for an independent Namibia. UNTAG was tasked with assisting the SRSG in ensuring that all hostile acts ceased; South African troops were confined to base, and ultimately withdrawn; discriminatory laws were repealed, and political prisoners released; Namibian refugees were permitted to return (when they were known as returnees); intimidation was prevented, and law and order maintained.|$|E

5|$|A {{regeneration}} {{scheme was}} announced in 2004; supported by the Phoenix Trust, the maltings would be converted into residential, retail and business space. Public consultation took place in 2005 and 2006, with around 90% of participants supporting regeneration and three-quarters asking for a cinema and entertainment complex. Lincolnshire Enterprise granted £200,000 towards the regeneration scheme and the Gladedale Group came forward to develop the project. Over the next three years, they worked with the Prince's Regeneration Trust to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> plans for the site's regeneration which protected the historic exterior. In 2009, their proposals were submitted for planning permission. North Kesteven District Council approved the £50million development in 2011; Tesco was also granted permission to build a £20million supermarket {{as part of the}} redevelopment. The maltings would be converted into retail and office space, alongside 220 apartments.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use of the bomb. Groves formed a committee that met in April and May 1945 to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> a list of targets. One of the primary criteria was that the target cities must not have been damaged by conventional bombing. This would allow for an accurate assessment of the damage done by the atomic bomb. The targeting committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At {{the top of the list}} were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who had visited the city on his honeymoon and knew of its cultural and historical significance.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with this}} evidence, the General Board sent a formal request in October 1903 to C, asking it to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> {{plans for a}} {{battleship}} including these characteristics. No progress {{had been made by}} 26 January 1904, when the General Board asked C for a design including four 12-inch guns, eight 10-inch or larger guns, and no intermediate armament beyond 3-inch anti-destroyer guns. The move to only 10-inch weaponry was the result of doubt among naval authorities that heavier guns could physically be mounted on a ship's broadside. No action was taken on this request until September, when C began planning a ship with four 12-inch guns in dual turrets along with eight dual 10-inch or four single 12-inch guns.|$|E
