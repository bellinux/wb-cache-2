2500|$|In the {{formative}} {{years of the}} Gypsy Horse, the Roma bred not only for specific colour, profuse feather, and greater bone, but also for increased action and smaller size. To increase action at the trot, they first tried Hackney Pony breeding, but this blood reduced both feather and bone. The Roma therefore turned to the Section D Welsh Cob to add a more animated trot to the breed without loss of other desired traits. Another trend in breeding was a steady decrease in height, a trend still present among many Romani breeders. In the 1990s, the breed's average height still was in excess of , but horses of [...] were beginning {{to be viewed as}} more desirable, primarily for economic reasons. John Shaw, a carriage painter from Milnrow, Rochdale, Lancaster, was quoted in 1993 as saying, [...] "Very big, hairy coloureds are now in vogue.

60|$|Many {{and many}} a mile he trailed his mustang, for Nack-yal never forgot the Sagi, and always headed for {{it when he}} broke his hobbles. Shefford {{accompanied}} an Indian teamster in to Durango with a wagon and four wild mustangs. Upon the return, with a heavy load of supplies, accident put Shefford {{in charge of the}} outfit. In despair he had to face the hardest task that could have been given him--to take care of a crippled Indian, catch, water, <b>feed,</b> <b>harness,</b> and drive four wild mustangs that did not know him and tried to kill him at every turn, and to get that precious load of supplies home to Kayenta. That he accomplished it proved to hint the possibilities of a man, for both endurance and patience. From that time he never gave up in the front of any duty.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts by visitors to Chile, Gage {{would have had}} to rise early in the morning, prepare himself, and groom, <b>feed,</b> and <b>harness</b> the horses; he had to be at the departure point at a specified time, load the luggage, charge the fares and get the passengers settled; and then had to care for the passengers on the journey, unload their luggage at the destination, and look after the horses. The tasks formed a structure that required control of any impulsiveness he may have had.|$|R
40|$|At present, {{there is}} no clear {{consensus}} as to whether protein <b>feeding</b> <b>harnesses</b> any ergogenic benefit for endurance athletes. In this thesis demonstrate no effect of protein on endurance performance. Furthermore, data presented herein indicates that protein co-ingestion does not enhance recovery 24 hours after exercise. Consequently, there is currently no basis on which to recommend protein feeding for endurance performance and recovery. Nutrient strategies implemented after exercise can markedly alter the acute response of muscle protein synthesis and, potentially, long-term phenotypic adaptation. Protein nutrition has traditionally been considered in the context of resistance exercise. Endurance exercise followed by protein ingestion increases the synthesis of mixed muscle protein via increased mRNA translation. Herein, we demonstrate that protein feeding after endurance exercise elevates the synthetic rate of contractile proteins and specific mRNA signalling intermediates. Insulin resistance that precedes Type II diabetes is characterized by blunted sensitivity of the pancreas to glucose and impaired glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Lifestyle interventions including nutrient and exercise have the potential to improve glycemic control. The final experimental chapter in this thesis provides mechanistic evidence to support the benefits of resistance exercise for lowering post-prandial glucose concentrations. Interestingly, protein ingestion did not augment the glucose-lowering effects of prior resistance exercise. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

As well as training animal owners, Brooke staff train local healers, farriers, government vets (who often have had no training on treating equines) saddlers, <b>feed</b> sellers and <b>harness</b> and cart makers.|$|R
40|$|Two {{engineering}} model 30 -cm ion thrusters have been assembled, calibrated, and qualification tested. This paper discusses the thruster design, performance, and power system. Test results include documentation of thrust losses due to doubly charged mercury ions and beam divergence by both direct thrust measurements and beam probes. Diagnostic vibration tests {{have led to}} improved designs of the thruster backplate structure, <b>feed</b> system, and <b>harness.</b> Thruster durability is being demonstrated over a thrust range of 97 to 113 mN at a specific impulse of about 2900 seconds. As of August 15, 1974, the thruster has successfully operated for over 4000 hours...|$|R
50|$|In 1919, Glengallan was {{described}} as being approached via a winding drive over a quarter mile long, with magnificent pine trees lining {{either side of the}} drive, a neat picket fence of 270 yards surrounds the garden area, broken by a substantial gateway of stone pillars and iron gates. It was also described as having cobbled areas to {{the north side of the}} house and approaching the office/store doors, a fernery, small vineyard, homestead enclosure and adjacent small paddocks irrigated by pipes which were supplied by elevated tanks filled by a pump, stables with <b>feed</b> room and <b>harness</b> room, buggy shed for three vehicles, and a couple of six-room cottages for married men and their families. By this time, much of the infrastructure which originally supported Glengallan would have been disused or much modified.|$|R
30|$|On {{the basis}} of this study on intake and {{digestibility}} of nutrients, rumen fermentation attributes and nutritional profile of Malpura sheep, it may be suggested that complete rations using non conventional feed ingredients could be successfully made and tried in the diet of sheep {{to bridge the gap between}} demand and supply and to get maximum economic production. Feed costs were reduced by 26 % when PJP replaced up to 50 % of the concentrate diet of sheep, without affecting their growth (Sawal et al. 2004). The local price of PJP is observed to be 25 % of the price of concentrate mixture and thus at 40 % level of replacement the price would be reduced by 30 %. In a series of experiments, Talpada et al. (2002) also found suitability of incorporating PJP in the complete diet of crossbred calves. Thus, PJP that is available at ease with the farmers of semi-arid/arid tropics could very well substitute cereal grains and oil cakes in the concentrate mixture. This would encourage the incorporation of unutilized or underutilized <b>feeds</b> and thereby <b>harnessing</b> and optimizing maximum benefit from the available natural resources for sustainability.|$|R
