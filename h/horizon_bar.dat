40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study was}} conducted to determine the effectiveness of a simple head-up display in improving glide-slope tracking performance during steep visual approaches in a STOL aircraft. The head-up display featured an attitude-stabilized <b>horizon</b> <b>bar</b> and glide-slope reference bar parallel to and 7. 5 deg below the <b>horizon</b> <b>bar.</b> On some approaches a flight-path marker symbol showing the projected ground impact point was also displayed. Half of the approaches were flown in a conventional mode in which the pilot changed pitch attitude to correct for height errors. The remaining approaches were flown in a direct-lift mode in which the pilot modulated thrust to change the flight-path angle without pitching the aircraft...|$|E

Her sister ship, the Thomson Spirit, was {{originally}} the Holland America ship [...] In 2005, a replacement, the fourth Noordam, was ordered from Fincantieri shipyards in Italy. After its last sailing with Holland America Line, the ship was taken out of service, chartered to Thomson Cruises and rechristened as the Thomson Celebration. She was originally furnished with a $1million art collection, some of which, including a 17th-century Oriental screen {{at the entrance to the}} <b>Horizons</b> <b>bar</b> on Deck 9, can still be found on board.|$|R

40|$|A {{simulator}} {{study was}} conducted to determine the usefulness of adding flight path vector symbology to a head-up display designed to improve glide-slope tracking performance during steep 7. 5 deg visual approaches in STOL aircraft. All displays included a fixed attitude symbol, a pitch- and roll-stabilized <b>horizon</b> <b>bar,</b> and a glide-slope reference bar parallel to and 7. 5 deg below the <b>horizon</b> <b>bar.</b> The displays differed with respect to the flight-path marker (FPM) symbol: display 1 had no FPM symbol; display 2 had an air-referenced FPM, and display 3 had a ground-referenced FPM. No differences between displays 1 and 2 were found on any of the performance measures. Display 3 was found to decrease height error {{in the early part of}} the approach and to reduce descent rate variation over the entire approach. Two measures of workload did not indicate any differences between the displays...|$|E

40|$|A two part {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the display requirements for the final approach and landing phase of a remotely piloted vehicle (RPV) mission, and to assess {{the relative merits of}} several possible display configurations. The objective of {{the first part of the}} {{investigation was}} to obtain subjective assessments of several display configurations, and to select the most promising display concepts for subsequent evaluation in terms of performance measures. A basic display consisting of a perspective image of terrain and runway, a <b>horizon</b> <b>bar</b> and an aircraft symbol was used, and guidance symbology was added to the basic displaying selected state variables. Initial results suggested that as guidance symbology is added to the basic display, pilot acceptance tends to increase. A point of diminishing returns is eventually reached, however, when additional information produces too much clutter, and makes it difficult for the pilot to process the displayed information...|$|E
50|$|Following {{the second}} {{procedure}} turn, a continual descent begins from {{a height of}} approximately 3,200 ft, as they had a definite glide path indication. This could not, however, {{have come from the}} ILS glide path transmitter, as the flight path led over the glide path station with its many weak and steep secondary glide path beams. The flight director system could offer an explanation for the regular rates of descent. At approximately 3,200 ft over N a spurious glide path was crossed during the second procedure turn. Now if {{on the basis of this}} indication, which might have also coincided with a localizer indication, the flight director was set to the approach mode in order to follow both pointers on this, the subsequent approach might be explained, but only if the two pilots neglected to keep the normal, continuous, mutual check on the basic navigational instruments and the marker control. The artificial <b>horizon</b> pitch <b>bar</b> which is not integrated with the ILS glide path signals required an average rate of descent of approximately 500 ft/min to maintain a 2.5° glide path without wind correction. In this instrumentation, the ILS glide path indication takes the form of a small triangle in the artificial horizon.|$|R
50|$|The “double X” warning made me briefly notorious {{and from}} the Sunday morning that review came out and then {{on for a long}} time, my phone didn’t stop ringing. You have to {{remember}} this was 1973; still the hippie years, with disco and the club scene on the <b>horizon.</b> The gay <b>bars</b> around Sheridan Square and down on West Street were packed. If you were Andy Warhol or various other notables of the time, who better to have on your arm than a twenty-one-year old poet who dressed like Cher and had just been named by the venerable ‘New York Times’ as a literary outlaw? I got invitations to go everywhere with everybody--but the problem was that in reality, I was a pretty much uneducated, inexperienced Jewish kid from the Bronx with an admittedly nasty streak, but I was scared to death of all these people. I stopped answering the phone.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{develop a}} method for {{forecasting}} the NSW remand and sentenced prisoner populations. Method: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with other time series as input variables were employed to estimate and forecast changes in the remand and sentenced prisoner populations. Models were tested by estimating model parameters over the period January 1998 – December 2010 and then comparing model forecasts with actual prison population trends over the period January 2011 – March 2013. Comparison of actual with forecast remand and sentenced prisoner numbers revealed that both models provide fairly reliable predictions of prison population trends over a three year time <b>horizon.</b> Results: <b>Barring</b> any significant change to policing and penal policy, the prison population {{is expected to rise}} {{in the first half of}} 2013 and then to drop steadily over the next three years. Although modelling suggests an uptrend in the remand prisoner population, this should be more than offset by a decrease in the sentenced prisoner population over the next thirty-three months. Conclusion: Although the models developed here provide accurate forecasts in retrospective testing, they should not be used as the sole basis for projecting future prison numbers. Future projections of prisoner numbers should also be based on advice from correctional administrators, police prosecutors, legal policy analysts, and others on the likely effects of any proposed change to policing, bail or sentence policy. Construction of a simulation model may help in quantifying the effects of these changes. Authored by Wai-Yin Wan, Steve Moffatt, Zachary Xie, Simon Corben and Don Weatherburn...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{disorientation}} (SD) is {{a common}} factor in aviation accidents, especially in novice pilots. An experiment was carried out to determine which of four different attitude indicator concepts in combination with two different display backgrounds (abstract vs. synthetic landscape) proves {{to be the most}} beneficial for novice pilot performance. Inexperienced pilots had to recover from unusual attitudes by using the standard moving-horizon display, a moving-aircraft display, a frequency-separated display, and a “mixed” display, with the latter two representing hybrid concepts with movements of both aircraft symbol and <b>horizon</b> <b>bar.</b> Participants performed the task of recovering from unusual attitudes most efficiently with hybrid display concepts, suggesting that these display concepts prevent figure-ground reversals and associated pilot errors. Outcomes of the study suggest that the implementation of hybrid display concepts as a backup option when unwillingly entering Instrument Flight Conditions could be a solution for preventing SD in novice pilots...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Subsurface {{profiles}} {{were obtained}} during airborne and surface short-pulse radar surveys along a winter roadway over the k a n a River near Fairbanks, Alaska. The roadway crossed ice-covered channels and intervening frozen channel bars. The airborne profiles were intended for ice thickness profiling but also revealed sporadic reflections from a deeper <b>horizon</b> beneath the <b>bars.</b> Later profiling {{from the surface}} recorded these deeper reflecting horizons in detail, and they were found to correspond with the base of seasonal frost, measured in drill holes. The sediments immediately beneath e frozen material were saturated and represented {{the top of a}} seasonally variable groundwater table confined and controlled by frost penetration. The profiles made from the surface also revealed reflections {{from the bottom of the}} ice and the channel bottom. However, no significant reflections were observed beneath the channel bottom; reflections from sloping horizons above and below the base of the frost in the bar may indicate alluvial bedding patterns in these deposits. Eleven holes were drilled along the roadway to determine ice thickness, water depth, frost depth and the depth to the river ice-alluvium contact. Wide-angle reflection and refraction soundings were also made to determine electrical properties of materials and to verify our depth interpretations from echo times. These observations indicate that the airborne technique provides an effective method of locating unfrozen channels and measuring the depth of frost penetration beneath bars. The surface surveys revealed additional data on sedimentary structure...|$|R
