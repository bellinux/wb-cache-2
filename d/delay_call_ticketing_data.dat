40|$|Objective : We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that responses to physiologic deterioration in hospital ward patients delayed by more than 15 minutes are associated with increased mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: We used data from a 23 -hospital cluster randomized trial (January 2004 to December 2004) of implementation of rapid response teams (intervention) versus standard practice with conventional cardiac arrest team-based responses to emergencies (control). We examined emergency calls in all hospitals. In intervention hospitals, we also examined such calls in the period before, during the introduction, and after the full implementation of a rapid response system. We studied the statistical association between such <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> and mortality. Main Outcomes and Measure: Hospital outcomes (mortality, unplanned ICU admissions, and cardiac arrests). Results: There were 3, 135 emergency team calls in all hospitals. Overall, almost one third of such <b>calls</b> were <b>delayed.</b> In intervention hospitals, the proportion of <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> was similar before and after implementation of rapid response teams. Compared with control hospitals, in intervention hospitals, {{there was a significant}} decrease in the proportion of <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> during both the introduction (27. 3 % vs 34. 3 % weekly rate; incidence rate ratio, 0. 84; p = 0. 001) and the full implementation period (29. 0 % vs 34. 5 % weekly rate; incidence rate ratio, 0. 84; p = 0. 023). <b>Delayed</b> <b>calls</b> more likely occurred at night, in high dependence or coronary care units, in patients older than 75 years, in those with a decrease in Glasgow Coma Scale, or in those with hypotension as the reason for the call. Finally, in all hospitals, <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> were associated with an increased risk of unplanned ICU admissions (adjusted odds ratio = 1. 56; 95 % CI, 1. 23 - 2. 04; p ≤ 0. 001) and death (adjusted odds ratio = 1. 79; 95 % CI, 1. 43 - 2. 27; p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Among ward patients, emergency team activation in response to acute deterioration triggered more than 15 minutes after detection and documentation of instability is independently associated with an increased risk of ICU admission and death.

40|$|Arbitrage-free price bounds for {{convertible}} bonds are obtained assuming a stochastic volatility {{process for the}} common stock that lies within a band but makes few other assumptions about volatility dynamics. Equity-linked hazard rates, stochastic interest rates and different assumptions about default and recovery behavior are accommodated within this approach.

Empirical results focus on call notice period effects, showing that uncertain volatility can capture the call premia so often observed in issuer’s call policies.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of delay depends {{to a large}} extent on the following four basic operations: delay, wakeup, interrupt, and resume. Traditional implementations of delay in the WAM are slow because three out of the four basic operations need to save or restore the argument registers. In this paper, we present a novel method for implementing delay in a Prolog machine called ATOAM. The main idea is to store <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> as frames, called suspension frames, on the control stack rather than as records on the heap. Since <b>delayed</b> <b>calls,</b> after being woken, can be executed directly by using their suspension frames, the four basic operations become very simple. This method had been predicated to cost a large amount of control stack space. However, with tail-recursion elimination, the control stack space requirement can be reduced dramatically. This method has been implemented in the B-Prolog system. For several benchmark programs where delay is used, the experimental results show that B-Prolog is [...] ...|$|R
