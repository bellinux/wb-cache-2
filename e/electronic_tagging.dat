In March 2004 the Committee endorsed a bill aimed at tackling antisocial behaviour, which included plans for parenting orders and the <b>electronic</b> <b>tagging</b> of youths {{under the age}} of 16. First Minister Jack McConnell made her Deputy Minister for Communities in the Scottish Executive in October 2004. In that post she was responsible for the launch of a radio and television advertising campaign aimed at tackling domestic abuse that aired over Christmas 2005, and she expressed concerns over the level of discrimination faced by travellers and gypsies after the issue was highlighted in a 2005 Scottish Parliament report.|$|E

40|$|In the {{contrast}} between domestic and international management of gas bottle, necessity and practicality of developing a domestic management system based on <b>electronic</b> <b>tag</b> is proposed in this paper. <b>Electronic</b> <b>tag</b> combined with RFID is now an advanced technology in domains of production, retail, logistics, traffic, etc. The predominance of introducing <b>electronic</b> <b>tag</b> into our management system is obvious by comparing differences of <b>electronic</b> <b>tag</b> and bar code used on the domestic gas bottles. The structure, function and characteristics of our management system are analyzed in detail and then the actual effect of usage is discussed. Finally, the implementation scheme and exploitation composition of the system are summarized and the application foreground of <b>electronic</b> <b>tag</b> is described...|$|R
50|$|Recent {{technologies}} have helped solve this problem. Some <b>electronic</b> <b>tags</b> give off repeating signals that are {{picked up by}} radio devices or satellites while other <b>electronic</b> <b>tags</b> could include archival tags (or data loggers).

So a novel double-transmitter-coil antenna (DTC antenna) is presented in this paper. Compared to the traditional STC antenna, this new antenna has a more excellent performance in the tag test systems, especially when it is used for testing the quality factor of tags...|$|R
2500|$|Humboldt squid {{are large}} {{carnivorous}} marine invertebrates that move in schools {{of up to}} 1,200 individuals. They swim at speeds of up to 24 kilometres per hour (...) propelled by water ejected through a siphon and by two triangular fins. Their tentacles bear suckers lined with sharp teeth with which they grasp prey and drag it towards a large, sharp beak. During the day the Humboldt squid behave similar to mesopelagic fish, living at depths of [...] <b>Electronic</b> <b>tagging</b> has shown that they also undergo diel vertical migrations which bring them closer to the surface from dusk to dawn. They hunt near the surface at night, {{taking advantage of the}} dark to use their keen vision to feed on more plentiful prey. The squid feed primarily on small fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and copepod, and hunt for their prey in a cooperative fashion, the first observation of such behaviour in invertebrates. [...] The Humboldt squid is also known to quickly devour larger prey when cooperatively hunting in groups. Humboldt squid are known for their speed in feasting on hooked fish, sharks, and squid, even from their own species and shoal, and have been known to attack fishermen and divers.|$|E

50|$|A curfew {{requirement}} {{can require}} that an offender {{will be at}} a fixed address for between 2-12 hours during a 24-hour period {{for up to six}} months. The order can be enforced with <b>electronic</b> <b>tagging.</b> These orders can only be issued if there is monitoring system for curfew in their area. Monitoring can be done via spot-check, with private security firm sending employees to check on an offender at home or but more commonly by <b>electronic</b> <b>tagging.</b> The cost of tagging is estimated to be £675 per month per offender. This compares favourably with keeping an offender in prison which is estimated at £1,555 per offender per month. A 2007 report showed that 58 per cent of offenders broke the terms of their tagging order and more than a quarter committed further offences.|$|E
