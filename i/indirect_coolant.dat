40|$|As {{we enter}} the second century of superconductivity, helium still {{prevails}} as the cryogenic coolant of choice. What does the future of helium hold? What {{can be done to}} avoid the squandering of this precious resource? In our presentation, we will discuss the use of cryogenic hydrogen originated from renewable and low-CO 2 emission sources. We suggest that 20 K of liquid hydrogen can ultimately displace helium as an <b>indirect</b> <b>coolant</b> in a range of superconducting electromagnetic devices. As is already well documented, superconductors have much potential underpinning the future developments in transportation, energy supply/storage and also in medical applications. Although superconductors that can operate at liquid hydrogen temperatures, such as MgB 2 and YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7, are not yet truly commercially available, research indicates that these will be feasible in the near future...|$|E
