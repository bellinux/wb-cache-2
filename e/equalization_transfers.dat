50|$|Ireland's health {{insurance}} system was originally a state monopoly with premiums collected by Vhi Healthcare. The monopoly was later broken, and the British private {{health insurance}} company BUPA entered the Irish market and began competing with VHI, generally undercutting it by attracting mostly younger and healthier clients by offering them cheaper coverage. VHI complained bitterly because BUPA was effectively seen to be making an unacceptably-high amount of profits under the arranagements, saddling VHI {{with the cost of}} insuring the more high-risk end of the market. In 1999, {{private health insurance}} covered about 1.5 million people (42% of the population). To tackle the problem, on 1 July 2003, new risk equalization regulations came into force (SI No. 261 of 2003) with the aim to neutralize more equitably the differences in insurers costs from variations in the health status of their members. It introduced risk <b>equalization</b> <b>transfers</b> from insurers with low-risk profiles to insurers with high-risk profiles. Under the regulations, insurers covered by the scheme, both open insurers and the one restricted membership undertaking were required to submit biannual returns to The Health Insurance Authority, the independent statutory regulatory body for the industry, detailing the claims of their members. Under the system, if the market equalization percentage, the degree of difference between insurers' risk profiles, is less than 2%, the regulations specify that no risk equalization payments should be commenced. If it lies between 2% and 10%, the Authority must make a recommendation to the Minister for Health and Children {{as to whether or not}} payments should be commenced. If it is above 10%, the Minister is to sanction the commencement of payments unless, having consulted with the Authority, he determines that to do so would not be in the best overall interests of health insurance consumers.|$|E

Nevertheless, some improvements in revenue-sharing through the program might be contemplated. For example, a return to a national average capacity standard, from the five-province standard which has been in place since 1982, would increase insurance for idiosyncratic shocks by about one-third. ...|$|R

Furthermore, the normative implication is obtained from our final results that there exists an optimal degree of fiscal decentralization to reach the central government´s goal of growth maximization, but the magnitude of fiscal decentralization chosen by the central government is excessive to entail the highest regional welfare. <b>equalization</b> <b>transfers,</b> fiscal decentralization, economic growth, convergence...|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis contains three essays on <b>equalization</b> <b>transfers</b> in a fiscal federalism. In Chapter One, we study {{the impact of}} <b>equalization</b> <b>transfers</b> in a fiscal federalism on {{the policies of the}} regional governments. This chapter presents a dynamic general equilibrium model of a fiscal federalism in which two asymmetric regions provide their residents with non-productive public expenditures (a flow) and public capital (a stock). In our model, each regional government behaves strategically in choosing its policies to maximize the discounted welfare of its own residents, under the equalization transfer scheme. Our analysis indicates that the the tax {{on the use of the}} private capital input is equal to zero in the steady state. In addition, we observe that the only change induced by the equalization transfer scheme is an increase in the non-productive public expenditures in less-endowed region (Quebec) with an offsetting fall in the non-productive public expenditures in more-endowed region (Ontario). The results of the numerical exercise we carry out also suggest that an equalization scheme in a federal state lowers the welfare gap between a rich and a poor region. In Chapter Two, we investigate how the equalization transfer formula is determined and how the equalization transfer program affects a region’s policies. This chapter presents a political economy model of equalization payments in a fiscal federalism in which asymmetric regional governments, who care about the welfare of its own residents, lobby the (incumbent) federal government, who takes into consideration both the welfare of the federation and the political support it receives from the states when allocating <b>equalization</b> <b>transfers.</b> It is shown that if the federal government allows politics to distort its economic policy it actively implements an equalization transfer program that is different from the one it would implement if it behaved like a benevolent dictator. The equalization transfer scheme implemented by the federal government induces a fall in the investment of public capital in both regions, and if the political power of the poor region is sufficiently higher than that of the rich province, then the equalization transfer scheme induces a higher level of the non-productive public good in the poor region than in the rich region. A numerical example is provided to illustrate this result. Chapter Three presents a model of <b>equalization</b> <b>transfers</b> in a federation in which each regional government has private information on its own technology for public service delivery. The aim of the federal government is to design an equalization transfer scheme that is Bayesian incentive compatible and satisfies the interim participation constraint in order to achieve the goal of providing residents of a poor region with at least a certain level of utility without imposing an excessive burden on the giving region. We show that the <b>equalization</b> <b>transfers</b> allow the recipient region to raise its private consumption above the level it would have attained in the absence of <b>equalization</b> <b>transfers</b> because some of the transfer is allocated to raise private consumption. Furthermore, it is shown that the <b>equalization</b> <b>transfers</b> are also lower if the federal government can observe the type of the poor region...|$|E
40|$|The author {{reviews the}} {{conceptual}} basis for fiscal <b>equalization</b> <b>transfers,</b> analyzes the theoretical implications for optimal design of <b>equalization</b> <b>transfers,</b> and suggests quantitative approaches {{for assessing the}} fiscal needs of subnational governments and determining their entitlement to transfers. The author illustrates proposed methods using data for local and provincial Canadian governments. The proposed methods could be useful tools, he says, for undertaking systematic objective reviews of aggregate and sectoral public spending in developing countries. The author argues that in a decentralized federation, fiscal inefficiencies and inequities arise because of subnational governments'differing levels of ability to provide comparable public services at comparable tax rates. Fiscal <b>equalization</b> <b>transfers</b> that reduce or eliminate differentials in net fiscal benefits create a rare instance in economics when considerations of equity and efficiency coincide. These transfers must allow for differences in the spending needs and revenues-raising abilities of the various subnational governments. The author argues for a two-tiered approach to equalization. The first tier would be a federal responsibility to equalize the burden of federal taxes. The second tier would be an interprovincial equalization fund to be administered by the Council of Provincial Finance Ministers. It would entail a comprehensive equalization system {{that takes into account}} provincial spending needs. The standard of equalization would be negotiated.

In addition, the two equalization schemes differently affect the composition of public expenditures.

40|$|A common {{feature of}} multi-jurisdictional systems is {{equalization}} programs. The implementation of such programs, {{that is based}} on some measurement of sub-national fiscal capacity and effort, is particularly complex. Within a political economy model, this paper analyzes the impact of such systems on accountability, identifying a positive and a negative effect. The positive effect arises because with equalized fiscal resources, a consequence of equalization, citizens attach more importance to any remaining variation in public good supplies and so punish rent-taking more severely. This induces politicians to restrain themselves and so accountability improves. The negative effect arises because the complexity of such programs reduces the informational content of observed public good supplies. This introduces a perverse fiscal incentive that reduces accountability. Thus, the overall impact of equalization programs on accountability depends on the balance of these effects. <b>Equalization</b> <b>transfer</b> programs Rent-seeking Yardstick fiscal competition Fiscal federalism...|$|R

However, in most Latin American countries own revenue collections represent a minor share of sub-national revenues and equalization programs, if present, are generally not properly designed.
