500|$|In 1993, Lou Arkoff, {{the son of}} Samuel Z. Arkoff, {{approached}} Bakshi {{to write}} and direct a low-budget live-action feature for Showtime's Rebel <b>Highway</b> <b>series.</b> For the third time, Bakshi revisited his screenplay for If I Catch Her, I'll Kill Her, which he retitled Cool and the Crazy. The picture, which aired September 16, 1994, starred Jared Leto, Alicia Silverstone, Jennifer Blanc and Matthew Flint. Reviewer Todd Everett noted that it had the same [...] "hyperdrive visual sense" [...] of Bakshi's animated films. He said, [...] "Everything in 'Cool' [...] seems to exist in pastels and Bakshi shoots from more odd angles than any director since Sidney J. Furie in his heyday. And the closing sequences ably demonstrate how it's possible to present strong violence without any blood being shed onscreen. Bakshi pulls strong [...] from a cadre of youngish and largely unknown actors".|$|E

5000|$|In {{his review}} for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker wrote, [...] "It is the {{whimsical}} notion behind the Rebel <b>Highway</b> <b>series</b> {{to take a}} group of mostly grade-D exploitation films from the '50s and remake them, with good actors and directors, in the '90s".

40|$|A closed course {{nighttime}} legibility study measured {{legibility distance}} for 6 inch letters using <b>Highway</b> <b>Series</b> D and two experimental fonts, Clearview Condensed Road and a D-Modified font. The Clearview font has a thinner stroke width than Series D {{and was used}} for white-on-green signs. The D-Modified font has a thicker stroke width than Series D and was used for black letters on white, yellow, and orange backgrounds. Three types of retroreflective sheeting were tested: ASTM Types III, VIII, and IX. Forty-eight signs were used; all sign blanks were 12 inch x 30 inch with a border. Twenty-four participants, aged 55 - 75, drove a passenger sedan around a closed course at 30 mph while attempting to read ground-mounted signs on the right shoulder. Results showed no difference between drivers aged 55 - 64 and those aged 65 - 75. Overall legibility distances ranged from 143 ft to 206 ft, producing legibility indexes {{in the range of}} 24 - 34 ft of legibility per inch of letter height. Color was found to be a significant factor in legibility with yellow and white producing the longest legibility distances followed by green and then orange. Across all colors, retroreflective sheeting type was a significant factor with specific difference...|$|E
