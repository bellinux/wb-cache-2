50|$|The 2012 200s {{received}} a completely revamped frame, a new, lighter, cast aluminum swing arm, a new 7 mm longer PDS rear shock with adjustable rebound and compression settings, the latest WP forks {{with a wider}} adjustment range and new settings. The new wheels have CNC-machined hubs, Excel brand rims, zinc/nickel-coated spokes and aluminum spoke nipples. The new bodywork has a slimmer seat, a longer rear fender and a translucent fuel tank. There is a newly redesigned kick-starter. A redesigned air box and filter that can be replaced {{without the use of}} tools and a flow-optimised <b>intake</b> <b>flange</b> is between the airbox and the carburetor.|$|E
25|$|The center two intake bolts on each head were {{relocated}} to prevent accidental mix-ups of Gen-2 and Gen-3 intakes. The intakes can be interchanged by slotting the bolt holes, but the added deck {{height of the}} GEN-3 engine means that sealing and port match will be compromised. Gen-3 intakes can be machined to fit Gen-2 engines by surface grinding the <b>intake</b> <b>flanges</b> and slotting the center holes.|$|R
