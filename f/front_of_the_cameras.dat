5|$|Although a {{competitor}} on paper in 1988, Coates {{was supposed to}} only be a coach and was forbidden to compete. The Australian Skating Union had refused to select him as they wanted to allow younger athletes an opportunity to race. However, the AOF officially listed Coates as {{a competitor}} {{so that he could}} train with the others on the ice, and because the artificially inflated athlete count would entitle the Australian team to take more support staff. However, Coates was informed that the registration was only for show and that he was not to race. However, {{when it was time for}} his event, he put on a uniform, defied team orders and skated his best time ever. Henke publicly excoriated Coates in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras,</b> but stopped when he found out that Prime Minister Bob Hawke had sent Coates a congratulatory message. However, Coates' new Australian record was only good enough for 26th place and ended his sixth and final Olympic campaign. His speed skating teammates Michael Richmond and Danny Kah managed two top 15 finishes each, and Medhurst was the only other Australian to place in the top 20.|$|E
5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E
25|$|Glenn Anders, a noted Broadway actor, {{made his}} film debut in this picture.

As a result of the work on this film, Lockhart would sign a long-term contract with RKO.|$|E

25|$|It is aired for {{two months}} (February to April) on the TVA network. Hosted by Julie Snyder, the show is a {{competition}} {{to find the best}} young francophone singer, not only in Quebec, but also in French-speaking regions of Canada, having auditions in Ontario (Eastern Ontario) and New Brunswick (l'Acadie). Then fourteen people (seven of each gender) are chosen to compete in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|E
25|$|A cryptic {{message from}} Paramount has Norma certain that DeMille {{is eager to}} discuss her script. She drops in {{on the set of}} his current film and is greeted warmly by former colleagues and the famed {{director}} himself, but DeMille is noncommittal about Salome. Meanwhile, Max discovers the studio had called to ask about Norma's exotic car, not her screenplay. However, a delusional Norma leaves the lot convinced she'll soon be back in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> and begins to prepare for the role ("As If Never Said Goodbye").|$|E
500|$|It was {{expensive}} to build large sets, and Milius {{did not want}} to rely on optical effects and matte paintings (painted landscapes). The crew instead adopted miniature effect techniques (playing on perspective) to achieve the illusion of size and grandeur for several scenes. [...] Scale models of structures were constructed by Emilio Ruiz and positioned in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> so that they appeared as full-sized structures on film; using this technique, the Shadizar set was extended to appear more than double its size. Ruiz built eight major miniature models, including a [...] high palace and a representation of the entire city of Shadizar that spanned [...]|$|E

500|$|Another bill Milk {{concentrated}} on {{was designed to}} solve the number one problem {{according to a recent}} citywide poll: dog excrement. Within a month of being sworn in, he began to work on a city ordinance to require dog owners to scoop their pets' feces. Dubbed the [...] "pooper scooper law", its authorization by the Board of Supervisors was covered extensively by television and newspapers in San Francisco. Anne Kronenberg, Milk's campaign manager, called him [...] "a master at figuring out what would get him covered in the newspaper". He invited the press to Duboce Park to explain why it was necessary, and while cameras were rolling, stepped in the offending substance, seemingly by mistake. His staffers, however, knew he had been at the park for an hour before the press conference looking for the right place to walk in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> It earned him the most fan mail of his tenure in politics and went out on national news releases.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{airing of}} the show, while praising Hatch as [...] "forthright, trustworthy" [...] and [...] "humorous and kind-hearted," [...] he became {{publicly}} known for {{how he would}} always qualify his respect for Hatch with comments such as [...] "we've become real good friends, {{but not in a}} homosexual way." [...] Boesch would proclaim in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> [...] "I wouldn't allow Hatch in my home; wouldn't allow him to meet my family" [...] and, referring to when some Green Berets came to build an obstacle course, [...] "When them Green Berets were here, I made sure they knew Hatch was queer." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{found that}} one way to enhance his pitches was to extemporize his commercials, poking fun at the {{sponsors}} (while never showing disrespect for the products themselves), the sponsors' company executives, and advertising agency types who wrote the scripted commercials that he regularly ignored. (If he read them at all, he ridiculed them or even threw aside the scripts in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.)</b> To the surprise of the advertising agencies and sponsors, Godfrey's kidding of the commercials and products frequently enhanced the sales of those products. His popularity and ability to sell brought a windfall to CBS, accounting for {{a significant percentage of}} their corporate profits. [...] While his willingness to mock the scripted commercials provided to him by sponsors' ad agencies angered those agencies, the sponsored, concerned only with improving their sales, were happy to let Godfrey tear apart those scripts (even physically on occasion).|$|E

2500|$|Producer Thom Mount (who is {{part-owner}} of {{the real}} Durham Bulls) hired Pete Bock, a former semi-pro baseball player, as a consultant on the film. [...] Bock recruited {{more than a dozen}} minor-league players, ran a tryout camp to recruit an additional 40 to 50 players from lesser ranks, hired several minor-league umpires, and conducted two-a-day workouts and practice games with Tim Robbins pitching and Kevin Costner catching. Bock made sure the actors looked and acted like ballplayers and that the real players acted convincingly in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> He said, [...] "the director would say, 'This is the shot we want. What we need is the left fielder throwing a one-hopper to the plate. Then we need a good collision at the plate.' I would select the players I know could do the job, and then we would go out and get it done".|$|E
2500|$|Brown's {{remarks were}} {{recorded}} by a Sky News microphone {{he was still}} wearing, and widely broadcast. It was later said that Brown had misheard Duffy and thought she had asked, [...] "where are they fucking from?" [...] Soon after the incident, Brown talked to Jeremy Vine live on BBC Radio 2 where he publicly apologised to Mrs Duffy. American comedian Jon Stewart commented that the clip showed the moment when Brown's [...] "political career leaves his body". Subsequently, Brown visited her house for 43 minutes in order to apologise in person. Upon emerging, he {{described himself as a}} [...] "penitent sinner", while Duffy refused to speak to the press and would not shake hands with him in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> She said the incident had left her feeling more sad than angry and that she would not be voting for Labour or any other party. The incident was subsequently dubbed as [...] "Bigotgate".|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 Singapore {{commissioned}} {{its first}} reclaimed water plant, thus opening a [...] "Third Tap". This was done carefully, after a monitoring period {{of two years}} to ensure safe water quality. There was also an active marketing campaign that included {{the opening of a}} visitor center, the sale of NEWater in bottles and the Prime Minister drinking a bottle of NEWater in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> In 2005 Singapore opened its first seawater desalination plant, the [...] "Fourth Tap". In the meantime it also further expanded its reservoirs, the [...] "First Tap". Today's largest reservoir, the Marina Bay reservoir, was inaugurated in 2008. It is located in the estuary of a river that has been closed off by a barrage to keep the seawater out. Two similar barrages were completed in July 2011, forming the Punggol Reservoir and the Serangoon Reservoir. When the 1961 water agreement with Malaysia ended in August 2011, Singapore could thus afford to let it expire.|$|E

2500|$|The series gave early {{exposure}} to, {{and generated}} breakthrough Australian hits for, international artists including ABBA, Meat Loaf, Blondie, Boz Scaggs, Cyndi Lauper, Madonna and Michael Jackson; sometimes {{years before they}} became international stars. Meldrum made overseas trips and formed friendships with many artists, enabling Countdown to gain international exclusives. His on-screen performances were sometimes criticised for rambling and incomprehensible commentaries or interview questions. When providing an album review he would often hold the album awkwardly in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> with lights glaring off its surface {{making it difficult to}} see. In an early [...] "Humdrum" [...] segment, Meldrum told viewers to [...] "Go out and buy it" [...] when reviewing an album. Shrimpton was furious, since ABC policy prohibited direct endorsements, so [...] "do yourself a favour" [...] became Meldrum's standard recommendation. Other catchphrases that he added to the vernacular are [...] "So watch out for that one", [...] "So there you go!" [...] and [...] "A good mate of mine".|$|E
2500|$|Having {{spent his}} early years in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> on Leave it to Beaver as [...] "Gilbert Bates" [...] (56 episodes), Talbot {{abandoned}} acting for {{a career as a}} journalist. In an article in Salon.com he looked back {{with a sense of humor}} about his past role. [...] "In the interests of historical accuracy I should say that, yes, Gilbert was a troublemaker and an occasional liar, but my character was certainly no Eddie Haskell – that leering teenage hypocrite who spoke unctuously to parents ('Well, hello Mrs. Cleaver, and how is young Theodore today?') and venomously to the Beav ('Hey, squirt, take a powder before I squash you like a bug')."! [...] "I have spent my adult life trying to conceal my Leave it to Beaver past or correcting the historical record. Either way the series has become inescapable. When I was a kid, I loved acting; in fact, I badgered my father and mother until they allowed me to work. But how could I have known as an innocent 9-year-old that I was taking part in a television program that would live on for 40 years as an icon for baby boomers? In the early '80s, I turned down an offer to revive my role as Gilbert in a dreadful Beaver reunion series. [...] "I'm trying to establish myself as a documentary filmmaker and an investigative reporter," [...] I explained to the producers. [...] "I can't go back to being Gilbert!" ...|$|E
