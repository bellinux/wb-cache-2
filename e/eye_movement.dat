40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} hand preference and conjugate lateral <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> The sample comprised of 224 persons. The hand preference was assessed using a handedness inventory. Conjugate lateral <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were elicited in response to verbal and spatial questions among left-, mixed- and right-handers. The left- and mixed-handers exhibit significantly greater number of conjugate lateral <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> than the right-handers. On the verbal task, right-handers exhibit rightward conjugate lateral <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> and left- and mixed-handers exhibit leftward conjugate lateral <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> On the spatial questions, right-handers exhibit leftward conjugate lateral <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> and left- and mixed-handers also exhibit leftward conjugate lateral <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> While right-handers show normal lateralization pattern, the left- and mixed-handers show right brain dominance irrespective {{of the nature of}} questions...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the coupling between a speaker’s and a listener’s <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> Some participants talked extemporaneously about {{a television show}} whose cast members they were viewing on a screen in front of them. Later, other participants listened to these monologues while viewing the same screen. <b>Eye</b> <b>movements</b> were recorded for all speakers and listeners. According to cross-recurrence analysis, a lis-tener’s <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> most closely matched a speaker’s <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> at a delay of 2 sec. Indeed, the more closely a listener’s <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were coupled with a speaker’s, the better the listener did on a comprehension test. In a second experiment, low-level visual cues were used to manipulate the listeners’ <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> and these, in turn, influenced their latencies to comprehension questions.

Thus the immune response to infection may result in changes to the sleep cycle, including an increase in slow-wave sleep relative to REM sleep.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed tapetum lucidum, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick enough to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E
40|$|Rapid <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> {{that occur}} during {{paradoxical}} sleep are {{generated from the}} brainstem and are modulated by cerebral hemispheres. In an attempt to establish the participation of cerebral hemispheres on rapid <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> we carried out a quantitative study of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> density in patients bearing hemispheres vascular lesions. The polysomnographic recordings of 24 patients were compared to those of 24 healthy volunteers. Density of rapid <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> {{was defined as the}} porcentage of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> during the respective time of paradoxical sleep. Based on the present results, we concluded that: stroke patients with hemispheric lesions displayed increased density of rapid eye movements; there was no difference on the density of rapid <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> according to the hemispheric lesion; higher density of rapid <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> was observed in patients with anterior hemispheric lesion...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> evoked by cerebellar microstimulation were investigated in alert, encephale isole cats. Repetitive stimuli (20 - 500 Hz, 20 - 500 μA) {{were applied to}} the vermis, lobules V-VII with tungsten microelectrodes. Horizontal and vertical DC-EOGs were recorded with a rectigraph. In many cases, the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were also recorded two-dimensionally with an XY-recorder. We analyzed the dependence of the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> on the stimulus parameter, stimulus sites and initial eye positions. 1) Two types of <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> saccades and smooth <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were evoked. The sites for the lowest stimulus threshold (about 20 μA) were both in the Purkinje cell layer and the deep layer of the white matter. The types of the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were not dependent upon the stimulus sites. Directions of the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were contingent on the stimulus sites. Horizontal <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were evoked by the stimulation of the lobule VI. The <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> evoked by the stimulation of the lobule V and VII contained predominantly upward and downward components respectively. Straight upward and downward <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were induced by the stimulation of the midline vermis. 2) The velocity and amplitude of the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were not dependent on the stimulus parameters. The peak velocities of saccades increased {{in proportion to the}} amplitude of the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> The amplitude of the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> depended upon the initial positions of the eye in the orbit, and the evoked <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> tended to reach the same final goal in the orbit regardless of initial eye positions. 3) Such goal-directed <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were evoked in 80 % of all the stimulus sites. In 70 % of those sites the movements were goal-directed both horizontally and vertically. In the remaining 30 % the movements were goal-directed either horizontally or vertically. The eccentricities of the goal positions increased with stimulus intensity and frequency. The goal positions of the movements evoked by the simultaneous stimuli of the two different sites were obtained by vectorial addition of the two <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> evoked by the stimulation of each site. These results may indicate that the vermis, lobules V-VII {{play an important role in}} the control of eye position in the orbit...|$|R
40|$|With recent {{advances}} in eye tracking technology, {{it is now possible}} to track surgeons’ <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> while engaged in a surgical task or when surgical residents practice their surgical skills. Several studies have compared <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> of surgical experts and novices, developed techniques to assess surgical skill on the basis of <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> and examined the role of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> in surgical training. We here provide an overview of these studies with a focus on the methodological aspects. We conclude that the different studies of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> in surgery suggest that the recording of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> may be beneficial both for skill assessment and training purposes, although more research will be needed in this field...|$|R
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which implies a good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls <b>eye</b> <b>movement.</b> Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a {{luminous}} or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered collimating curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. <b>Eye</b> <b>movement</b> perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.|$|E

5000|$|In {{animals with}} {{forward-facing}} eyes, the eyes usually move together. [...] <b>Eye</b> <b>movements</b> are either conjunctive (in the same direction), version <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> usually described by their type: saccades or smooth pursuit (also nystagmus and vestibulo-ocular reflex). Or they are disjunctive (in opposite direction), vergence <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> The relation between version and vergence <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> in humans (and most animals) {{is described by}} Hering's law of equal innervation.|$|R
40|$|Early in the {{evolution}} of vertebrates <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> were strictly primitive reflexes that were predominantly controlled by vestibular and visual sensory stimuli. Later during phylogeny, along with the development of the fovea of the retina, vertebrates acquired the ability to make voluntary <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> (BOttner and BUttner-Eonever, 1988). In short, five types of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> can be distinguished. The first two are slow <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> that compensate for movements of the head and the visual surround; these are named the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the optokinetic reflex (OKR), respectively. Extended rotatory or visual stimulation results in a so-called vestibular or optokinetic nystagmus with a slow (compensatory) and a fast (reset) phase. The <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> that operate predominantly under voluntary control are saccades, smooth pursuit, and convergence. Saccadic <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> are fast conjugate <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> which reset the eye position; smooth pursuit movements are used to follow a small moving visual target; and convergence movements are slow disconjugate <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> enabling frontal-eyed animals to foveate near objects and establish stereoscopic vision...|$|R

Results revealed a negative correlation between the overall spatial dispersion of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> and the spatial imagery score. Consequently, those with a lower spatial imagery score employed a larger degree of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> to blank spaces than those with a higher spatial imagery score. No relationship was found between <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> and the other aspects. We propose that weaker spatial imagery ability increases the “need” to execute <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> during recall and discuss this finding in relation to the current literature on <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> to ‘nothing’...|$|R

The spatio-temporal organization of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> in the kitten has a prevailing vertical orientation and differs completely {{from that of the}} cat. In the kitten the amplitude of <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> is smaller than in the cat and only a few movements are followed by fixation. It results, by correlating amplitude-peak velocity, that rapid <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> in the awake kitten are saccades.

40|$|To see {{a moving}} object clearly, we must rotate our {{eyes with the}} same {{velocity}} {{as that of the}} moving object while keeping the object 2 ̆ 7 s image on the foveae.

However, a question how pursuit <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> affect velocity perception still remains unsolved. This paper reviews velocity perception based on pursuit <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> First, characteristics of pursuit movements were described. Second, perceptual phenomena including Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon, sigma-movement and the anisotropy of perceived velocity, which depend on pursuit <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> were discussed.

40|$|Tested whether <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> during {{retrieval}} of emotional memories {{are followed by}} less vividness and less emotionality of future recollections; whether this effect is stronger than {{the effects of a}} control activity; whether the alleged effects of tapping and <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> are stronger than a no-movement, control condition; and whether reductions in vividness and emotionality after <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> (and finger tapping) are specific to negative memories or also occur in the case of positive memories. 60 17 - 22 yr olds recalled positive or negative memories and scored the vividness and emotionality of the recollections. Next, memories were recalled while the S was performing rapid <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> finger tapping, or not performing a dual task. They were asked to recall the event again and to rate its vividness and emotionality. Compared to finger tapping and the no-dual-task condition, recollections after <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> made future recollections less vivid. After <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> but not after the other interventions, negative memories became less negative, and positive memories became less positive. The findings show that <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> not only reduce vividness and emotionality of memories during the eye moving, but also affect future recollections, during which no <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> are made...|$|R
40|$|The dot-probe {{paradigm}} {{is one of}} the most often used paradigms to investigate attentional biases towards emotional information. However, a large number of the dot-probe studies so far used a long stimulus onset asynchrony allowing for <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> to occur, which might increase the error variance. This study aimed at addressing this methodological issue by varying the instructions with regard to the gaze behavior and calculating the reaction time (RT) bias score (i. e., RTs for targets presented at the location of the emotional compared to the neutral stimulus) separately for trials with <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> and trials without <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> Results of Experiment 1 (using typical instructions, i. e., instructions that are lenient with regard to <b>eye</b> <b>movements)</b> showed an RT bias, but only in the trials without <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> The overall RT bias (calculated "blind" for <b>eye</b> <b>movements)</b> was non-significant. In Experiment 2, stricter instructions and small changes in the procedure led to a sharp decrease in the number of <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> such that both the RT bias in the trials without <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> as well as the RT bias across all trials was significant...|$|R

25|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>movement</b> {{in reading}} {{involves}} the visual processing of written text. This {{was described by}} the French ophthalmologist Louis Émile Javal in the late 19th century. He reported that eyes do not move continuously along a line of text, but make short, rapid movements (saccades) intermingled with short stops (fixations). Javal's observations were characterised by a reliance on naked-eye observation of <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> {{in the absence of}} technology. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, investigators used early tracking technologies to assist their observation, in a research climate that emphasised the measurement of human behaviour and skill for educational ends. Most basic knowledge about <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> was obtained during this period. Since the mid-20th century, there have been three major changes: the development of non-invasive eye-movement tracking equipment; the introduction of computer technology to enhance the power of this equipment to pick up, record and process the huge volume of data that <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> generates; and the emergence of cognitive psychology as a theoretical and methodological framework within which reading processes are examined. Sereno & Rayner (2003) believed that the best current approach to discover immediate signs of word recognition is through the recordings of eye movements and event-related potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} decades {{saw more}} elaborate attempts to interpret <b>eye</b> <b>movement,</b> including {{a claim that}} meaningful text requires fewer fixations to read than random strings of letters. In 1879, the French ophthalmologist Louis Émile Javal used a mirror {{on one side of}} a page to observe <b>eye</b> <b>movement</b> in silent reading, and found that it involves a succession of discontinuous individual movements for which he coined the term saccades. In 1898, Erdmann & Dodge used a hand-mirror to estimate average fixation duration and saccade length with surprising accuracy.|$|E
40|$|AbstractVisual {{suppression}} of low-spatial frequency information during <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> {{is believed to}} contribute to a stable perception of our visual environment. While visual perception has been studied extensively during saccades, vergence has been somewhat neglected. Here, we show that convergence <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> reduce contrast sensitivity to low spatial frequency information around the onset of the <b>eye</b> <b>movements,</b> but do not affect sensitivity to higher spatial frequencies. This suggests that visual suppression elicited by convergence <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> may have the same temporal and spatial characteristics as saccadic suppression...|$|R

Glissades are the slow drifting <b>eye</b> <b>movements</b> occasionally seen {{at the end of}} saccadic <b>eye</b> <b>movements.</b> Glissades are hypothecated to be produced by mismatches in the pulse and step components of the motoneuronal controller signals.
