25|$|The {{construction}} of the Virginia approaches to Arlington Memorial Bridge was a 16-year road construction project to connect Arlington Memorial Bridge with roads in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States.

25|$|Game Revolution {{argued that}} if the {{multiplayer}} was taken away, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> campaign {{was not enough to}} make Battlefront II worth the buy. IGN claimed that the game suffers from problems remaining from the original Battlefront, such as a lack of challenging AI characters in single player mode. Computer-controlled opponents and allies tend to run headlong into gunfire, wander off ledges, and walk into walls. IGN felt that these, along with redundant use of planets featured in previous Star Wars settings, were problems carried over from the original. X-Play hosts Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb gave the game a 4 out of 5, but criticized the online multiplayer.|$|E

25|$|Many grammarians adopted Alexander's {{innovation}} soon afterwards, including John of Garland (incidentally Alexander's harshest critic) {{who wrote}} grammatical treatises in verse, Simon di Vercelli ("Maestro Sion") who wrote Novum Doctrinale somewhere between 1244 and 1268 (it only being transcribed {{by one of}} his pupils when he died in 1290), and Everard de Béthune who wrote Graecismus in 1212. From that point onwards, it was rare for a grammatical work to not at least contain the principal rules as mnemonic verses. <b>Even</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> humanistic grammars of the 15th century included mnemonic verses excerpted from Doctrinale or other versified grammars. This method of Latin grammar instruction was used by teachers well into the 20th century, it still being used in English schools in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

500|$|In 1944, it was {{determined}} that the Grumman XTB2F, then under development for the Navy, would be too large to practically and safely operate from aircraft carriers. <b>Even</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> s, known as [...] "battle carriers" [...] (CVB) and the largest aircraft carriers built by any nation to that point, would have difficulty operating the massive aircraft, which {{was the size of a}} U.S. Army Air Force medium bomber. As a result, in late June 1944, Grumman submitted its G-66 design to the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer). After a review of the design by BuAer during the following month, a revised design was submitted, and on August 17 the existing contract for the XTB2F was modified to instead order two XTSF-1 aircraft, to be based on Grumman's F7F-2 Tigercat two-seat, twin-engined fighter-bomber, the first prototype intended to be a conversion of a F7F airframe.|$|E

Between the Oval's inaugural Test and January 1954, the overall batting average at the ground was 37.03, and it dropped to 28.07 between the installation of the new pitch and the year 2000. <b>Even</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> pitch was, however, according to a 1982 report, [...] "well known of its peculiar playing characteristics." [...] It crumbled during matches, giving more help to spin bowlers. Australian Test bowler Ashley Mallett believed that the new pitch was certainly more helpful to spin bowling, while England captain Nasser Hussain was negative about batting on the pitch during the 2004 England tour in his biography Playing With Fire. In 2012 the pitch was described by the media during the Australian tour as [...] "slightly damp, tacky appearance" [...] after rain, and then [...] "tinder-dry." ...|$|E

It ought to, at any rate, because that story is plainly wrought out and is apparent as it is possible to make it." [...] A review in The Nickelodeon offered little more than a summary of the film, but the reviewer found the subject to be enhanced by the attention to detail in the production. The reviewer was also pleased that the child was not brought in to serve as in deus ex machina role.

When Cline answered it, Goodman ordered him {{to go back to the}} game. Although Cline knew there was no way to reconnect the feed, he promised to do the best he could. By the time the game ended at 7:07, thousands of viewers were calling the network to complain about missing the end of the football game. Others called newspapers, television stations, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York City Police Department, both to seek the final score, and simply to vent. Humorist Art Buchwald wrote [...] "Men who wouldn't get out of their chairs in an earthquake rushed to the phone to scream obscenities [...]" [...] As people learned of the outcome, some became upset because Ridlehuber's touchdown meant the Raiders had won by more than the point spread of 7, and bets thought to be won were now lost. In Oakland, Gowdy and DeRogatis left the broadcast booth to tell Ellis that the final two minutes were the most exciting they had ever seen. Ellis replied, [...] "It's too bad America didn't see it."
