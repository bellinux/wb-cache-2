Today, most Christian exegetes reject much of Bultmann's theory, but accept certain of his intuitions. For instance, J.

25|$|The {{practice}} of Lectio Divina, {{a form of}} prayer that centers on scripture reading, was developed in its best-known form in the sixth century, through the work of Benedict of Nursia and Pope Gregory I, and described and promoted more widely in the 12th century by Guigo II. The 9th century saw the development of mystical theology through {{the introduction of the}} works of sixth-century theologian Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, such as On Mystical Theology. <b>His</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> via negativa was especially influential.|$|E
25|$|Freud had greatly {{admired his}} {{philosophy}} tutor, Brentano, {{who was known}} for his theories of perception and introspection, as well as Theodor Lipps {{who was one of the}} main contemporary theorists of the concepts of the unconscious and empathy. Brentano discussed the possible existence of the unconscious mind in his Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874). Although Brentano denied its existence, <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unconscious probably helped introduce Freud to the concept. Freud owned and made use of Charles Darwin's major evolutionary writings, and was also influenced by Eduard von Hartmann's Philosophy of the Unconscious (1869).|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, the {{connection}} between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by Julius Robert von Mayer and James Prescott Joule, who measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat {{is a form of}} energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of Sadi Carnot was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of thermodynamics in <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics—a restatement of the law of conservation of energy—which was stated around 1850 by William Thomson, later known as Lord Kelvin, and Rudolf Clausius. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of Lazare Carnot, Sadi Carnot, and Émile Clapeyron–as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work—to formulate the first law.|$|E

500|$|He {{spent his}} {{last three years}} in impoverished exile. He took the name [...] "Sebastian Melmoth", after Saint Sebastian, and the titular {{character}} of Melmoth the Wanderer (a Gothic novel by Charles Maturin, Wilde's great-uncle). Wilde wrote two long {{letters to the editor}} of the Daily Chronicle, describing the brutal conditions of English prisons and advocating penal reform. <b>His</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dismissal of Warder Martin for giving biscuits to an anaemic child prisoner repeated the themes of the corruption and degeneration of punishment that he had earlier outlined in The Soul of Man under Socialism.|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{is deeply}} self-centered and takes {{everything}} personally, a trait which {{is reflected in}} <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> news and current events. According to the comedian, [...] "There's nothing too large that doesn't involve him. Every news story is really about him ... Everything he cares about is a news story because he cares about it." [...] This is expressed in his frequent attacks on and feuds with well-known figures such as The Decemberists, Sean Penn, Conan O'Brien, Rain, Barry Manilow, Tony Bennett, and Don Rickles (the latter three of whom beat out Colbert for Best Individual in a Variety or Music Program at the Emmys). The comedian equates these feuds with Bill O'Reilly's culture wars.|$|E
500|$|In <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's {{relation}} to modernism, Thomas Schatz finds the film an unresolved [...] "examination {{of the process}} of human interaction and interpersonal communication" [...] and [...] "immediately establishes [...] self-referential stance" [...] that invites the spectator [...] "to read the narrative as something other than a sequential development toward some transcendent truth". For him, Alvy [...] "is the victim of a tendency toward overdetermination of meaning -- or in modernist terms 'the tyranny of the signified' -- and his involvement with Annie can be viewed as an attempt to establish a spontaneous, intellectually unencumbered relationship, an attempt which is doomed to failure." [...] Marcus Geduld cites the flashback to Alvy as a child (in a therapist's office with his mother) as an example of basic problems (poverty, discordant parents) being masked by a supposed existential crisis.|$|E
50|$|His Oratio ad Graecos (Address to the Greeks) condemns paganism as worthless, and {{praises the}} {{reasonableness}} and high antiquity of Christianity.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, {{philosophy}} has seen a remarkable revival <b>of</b> interest in <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> emotion and with it a reassessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pathê in <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Aristotle. Quite a number of scholars claim him as the first philosopher to defend a cognitive approach in emotion theory. I will argue that this claim is one-sided and that <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passions differ markedly from contemporary cognitive views of emotion...|$|R
500|$|Among Harrison's biographers, Dale Allison {{describes}} the song as an [...] "expression of alienation from the world" [...] and comments: [...] "The disparity between this confused melancholy and the confident religious advocacy on All Things Must Pass and Living in the Material World is remarkable." [...] Gary Tillery groups the song with the Extra Texture tracks [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies" [...] and [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] {{as examples of}} Harrison having reached [...] "rock bottom" [...] in 1975. Elliot Huntley views [...] "World of Stone" [...] as overlong, with the shouted backing vocals [...] "annoying" [...] and Harrison's guitar sound [...] "thin and weedy", and he bemoans that [...] "the melody doesn't really deviate from its beginnings". Like Leng, Ian Inglis gives over much of <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song to possible interpretations of its lyrics, but he otherwise writes: [...] "Harrison returns to {{his view of the}} world as a place of obstacles and trials in which there is little hope ... The variations in his vocal range fail to add variety or interest to what is, by now, a predictable and cheerless message, set to a leaden and monotonous score." ...|$|E
500|$|With Spector as his co-producer, Harrison taped {{the basic}} track for [...] "Let It Down" [...] in London {{early in the}} summer of 1970. Similar to the [...] "libidinous detour" [...] {{provided}} by [...] "I Dig Love", Leng views the inclusion of [...] "Let It Down" [...] on All Things Must Pass as [...] "a brief sensory interlude" [...] from the predominant spiritual concerns found on the album. In <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, Inglis notes that this period coincided with heightened suspicion on Boyd's part regarding her husband's womanising, while music journalist John Harris has written of there being an element of intrigue during the All Things Must Pass sessions, through Clapton's growing infatuation with Boyd. This development was an open secret to the musicians with whom Clapton formed Derek and the Dominos at this time – his fellow Delaney & Bonnie bandmates Bobby Whitlock, Jim Gordon and Carl Radle – and to an apparently indifferent Harrison. Clapton sought refuge in heroin from his [...] "torment", Harris writes, while pouring his feelings for Boyd into the songs that Derek and the Dominos would soon record for their album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (1970).|$|E
500|$|In the 6th century, John Philoponus (c. 490–c. 570 CE) criticized Aristotle's view of motion, {{noting the}} {{inconsistency}} between Aristotle's discussion of projectiles, where {{the medium of}} aether keeps projectiles going, and <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> void, {{where there is no}} such medium and hence a body's motion should be impossible. Philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by the action of some surrounding medium but by some property, or conatus implanted in the object when it was set in motion. This was not the modern concept of inertia, for there was still the need for an inherent power to keep a body in motion. This view was strongly opposed by Averroës and many scholastic philosophers who supported Aristotle. The Aristotelian view was also challenged in the Islamic world. For example, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) seems to have supported Philoponus' views, while he developed a concept similar to inertia. The concept of inertia was developed more clearly in the work of his contemporary Avicenna, who conceived a permanent force whose effect is dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance, making him [...] "the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion." [...] Avicenna's concept of mayl is almost the opposite of the Aristotelian conception of violent motion and is reminiscent of Newton's first law of motion. Avicenna also developed an idea similar to momentum, when he attempted to provide a quantitative relation between the weight and velocity of a moving body.|$|E

5000|$|While Machiavelli's {{influence}} {{as a military}} theorist is often given a backseat to his writings as a political philosopher, that he considered Dell'arte della guerra to be his most important work is clear from <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military science and soldiery in other works. For example, in The Prince he declares that [...] "a prince should have no other object, no any other thought, nor take anything as his art but that of war and its orders and discipline; for {{that is the only}} art which is of concern to one who commands." ...|$|R
500|$|The journal Man {{published}} a highly negative review by P. G. Rivière of the University of Oxford. Criticizing {{what he saw}} as the [...] "chatty 'Holier-than-Thou' tone" [...] of the book, Rivière asserted that at only 160 pages of text, Arens had failed to give sufficient attention to the subject and evidence, instead devoting much of the space to constructing and demolishing straw men arguments. Coming to the defence of those who believe the account of Staden regarding cannibalism among the Tupinambá by arguing that it could indeed reflect the German explorer's genuine experiences, Rivière notes that Arens has not tackled all of the claims which assert that this South American people committed anthropophagy. Furthermore, he expresses his opinion that Arens' work has made him reassess the evidence for Tupinambá cannibalism, the existence of which he is now even more thoroughly convinced. Proclaiming it to be both a [...] "bad" [...] and a [...] "dangerous" [...] book, he finally expresses his fear that it might prove to be [...] "the origin of a myth". Similarly, Shirley Lindenbaum of the New School for Social Research published her highly negative review of Arens' work in the journal Ethnohistory. Casting a critical eye on his claims, she notes that his use of source material was [...] "selective and strangely blinkered", which detracted from his ideas of [...] "collective prejudice" [...] which she considers valuable. Critiquing <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fore people of New Guinea as being littered with inaccuracies, she draws comparisons between cannibalism and sexual activity, noting the latter is also not directly observed by anthropologists but nonetheless undoubtedly goes on. She furthermore expresses surprise that the work was ever designed for a scholarly audience because of its poor levels of accuracy.|$|E
500|$|After {{the fact}} pattern, Cardozo began <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law with [...] "the {{conduct of the}} defendant's guard, if a wrong in its {{relation}} to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relative to her it was not negligence at all." [...] Cardozo quoted Pollock on Torts and cited several cases for the proposition that [...] "proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do." [...] Only {{if there is a}} duty to the injured plaintiff, the breach of which causes injury, can there be liability. He defended his decision, [...] "a different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of contradictions." [...] Cardozo posed hypothetical situations: if a railway guard stumbles over a bundle of newspapers, and there are explosives within, will there be liability to an injured passenger {{at the other end of}} the platform? Will the result be different if the object containing the explosives is a valise instead? If there was negligence that day, Cardozo argued, it was only negligence that resulted in the fall and destruction of the package, and there was no wrong done by the railroad to Palsgraf for personal injury, [...] "the diversity of incidents emphasizes the futility of the effort to build the plaintiff's right upon the basis of a wrong to some one else." [...] The chief judge instructed, [...] "The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed". Cardozo did not absolve the defendant who knowingly unleashes a destructive force, such as by shooting a gun, just because the bullet takes an unexpected path. This is not such a case, Cardozo held: even if the railway guard had thrown down the package intentionally, without knowing the contents he could not knowingly risk harm to Palsgraf, and would not be liable. Negligence cannot impose liability where an intentional act would not.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} book he ponders the origin {{and nature of the}} universe, {{considering}} theories by Xenophanes, Hesiod, Leucippus, Heraclitus, Thales, and Empedocles before arguing that the universe was created from the four elements and is governed by a divine spirit. Manilius holds the view that the universe is made up of two spheres: one solid (the Earth) and one hollow (the [...] "sphere of stars", often known as the firmament). The constellations are fixed in the firmament; the Earth is stationary and the firmament revolves around it, accounting for the movement of the stars at night. The planets, the moon, and the Sun revolve around the Earth in the space between its surface and the edge of the firmament. Because the Earth is {{in the center of the}} universe, it is equidistant on all sides from the firmament; thus, it remains in place at the center, as it is not compelled to [...] "fall" [...] in any specific direction. According to Manilius, the universe is ruled by a god (conspirat deus) and governed by reason (ratione gubernat); however, he is vague about the exact relationship between the deity, the universe, and reason. After Manilius finishes describing the universe, he discusses the constellations and stars and the celestial circles. In this section, Manilius places particular emphasis on the Milky Way, and he proposes six explanations for this unique celestial body: it is the place in the sky where either two hemispheres are coming apart or together, it is the former path that the Sun traveled, it is the route Phaethon took when he drove the sun chariot of Helios, it is milk that was spilled from Juno's breast, it is a concentration of small stars, or it is the abode of dead heroes. Manilius agrees with the latter point and finishes <b>his</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way by considering heroes who have earned a place in the heavens. The first book then concludes with an exploration of cometswhich Manilius sees as harbingers of disasters, such as plagues.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Gould’s Structure of Evolutionary Theory {{argues that}} Darwinism has {{undergone}} significant revision. Although Gould succeeds in showing that hierarchical approaches have expanded Darwinism, {{his critique of}} adaptationism is less successful. Gould claims that <b>the</b> ubiquity <b>of</b> developmental constraints and spandrels has forced biologists to soften their commitment to adaptationism. I argue that Gould overstates his conclusion; his principal claims are compatible with at least some versions of adaptationism. Despite this weakness, Gould’s <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> adaptationism – particularly <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exaptive pool and cross-level spandrels – should provoke new work in evolutionary theory and <b>the</b> philosophy <b>of</b> biology...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to <b>the</b> developing field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> critical theory <b>of</b> organisation. It presents a critical inquiry into <b>the</b> ideological nature <b>of</b> (neo) Human Relations management theory and its strategies for <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> subjectivity and organisational culture. The introductory chapters discuss the meta-theoretical grounds and contexts for <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis. Chapter 1 {{responds to the}} epistemological challenges put forward by post- Modernism highlighting the basic trajectory and underlying values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis. Chapter 2 discusses <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> critical organisation theory so far, with respect to <b>the</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> subjectivity and culture. This includes a <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Foucault, (neo) Marxist Theory, Labour Process Theory and critical social psychology {{as they have been}} taken up by organisational studies of subjectivity and culture. Chapter 3 clarifies <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> ideology and outlines the research strategy for <b>the</b> concrete study <b>of</b> (neo) Human Relations management as ideological. This involves a 'depth hermeneutic' research strategy, made up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3 components <b>of</b> (1) A Social Analysis, (2) A Discourse Analysis, and (3) An Interpretation <b>of</b> Meaning. As <b>the</b> 'Social Analysis' component of this 'depth hermeneutic', chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7 highlights <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Herbert Marcuse, exploring his critical social psychology; his notion of 'new forms <b>of</b> control'; <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between culture, language and power; and <b>his</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rationalisation process leading to <b>the</b> rationalisation <b>of</b> culture and power relations. This is followed by both the 'Discourse Analysis' and 'Interpretation of Meaning' components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'depth hermeneutic' method. Chapter 8 offers an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> management discourses around subjectivity and culture and identifies its leading authors.
