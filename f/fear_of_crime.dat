5|$|Since the 1980s, Southeast D.C. {{has been}} synonymous with crime and violence, and {{has one of}} the highest crime rates in the District of Columbia (albeit not the highest rates in all {{categories}} of crimes). Concern about crime at the Anacostia, Congress Heights, and Southern Avenue stations has existed for many years, although statistics only partially support these concerns. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> was one of the reasons why, in 1991, Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes that would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia Station.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, as <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> became Jeffersonians' No. 1 concern, Lee sensed his {{continued}} political fortunes would {{have less to}} do with reforming the Sheriff's Office than in making his suburban constituents feel safe from the big city ills.|$|E
50|$|Supporting {{this finding}} is a survey done with collegiate {{students}} that showed {{that there was a}} significant correlation between the attention paid to local crime and fear. This survey also showed a significant correlation between the <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> and violence and the number of times the respondents viewed television per week.|$|R
25|$|In January 2007, the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) {{draft report}} on South Africa was released. This noted that South Africa had the world's second-highest murder rate, with about 50 {{people a day}} being killed, and that {{although}} serious crime was reported as falling, security analysts said {{that the use of}} violence in robberies, and rape, were more common. Mbeki in response {{said in an interview that}} <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> were exaggerated.|$|R
50|$|According to criminologist Simon Cottee, {{sociologist}} Stanley Cohen analyzed <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> immigrant <b>crime</b> among Germans {{and other}} contemporary Europeans in the 1960s {{as a form}} of moral panic.|$|R
25|$|<b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> in old age, {{especially}} among the frail, sometimes weighs more heavily than concerns about finances or health and restricts what they do. The fear persists {{in spite of the}} fact that old people are victims of crime less often than younger people.|$|E
25|$|Crime rates {{remained}} largely unaffected in Castle Vale until {{towards the end}} of the HAT's existence. Crime rates began to fall in 2001, and between 2000 and 2004, the number of crimes committed in Castle Vale reduced by 36%, although the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> still remained high amongst residents. West Midlands Police has launched a series of initiatives aimed at tackling specific causes of crime on the estate. They are also assisted by five Neighbourhood Wardens, who have no powers for arrest or enforcement but act as intermediaries between the police and community.|$|E
25|$|The first {{reported}} incident of crime at the Anacostia station {{occurred during the}} station's construction. Three teenagers broke into the construction site on July 7, 1989; stole tools; and broke the glass on the cab of a crane before being arrested. Concern about crime at the station led Metro to station additional transit police officers at Anacostia station {{in the weeks after}} the station's opening, and D.C. police patrolled the station's parking garage. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> {{was one of the reasons}} why Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes in 1991 which would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia station.|$|E
5000|$|Youth {{participation}} in violence has become normalized. While reliable data regarding crime is sparse, there are widespread <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> facing Guatemalan youth. [...] "Maras gangs are generally associated with low-income urban areas, {{due to high}} levels of inequality and the lack of social, economic and cultural alternatives available in this context", making Guatemala City {{one of the most dangerous}} areas in Guatemala. Gangs dominate public space, often limiting areas where others can interact. An estimated 53-330 gangs reside in Guatemala City.|$|R
40|$|Gang {{crime and}} {{resulting}} public fear {{became a major}} policy focus during the 1990 s, yet few studies specifically focus on <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> gang <b>crime.</b> Guided by social disorganization theory, we test three theoretical models about the individual thought processes leading to <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> gang <b>crime.</b> Using structural equation models, we find {{that each of these}} three theoriesFdiversity, disorder, and community concernFis an important predictor <b>of</b> gang-related <b>fear.</b> In addition, we find that the indirect relationships between demographic characteristics, theoretical variables, and fear depend upon which model is tested. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> Gangs and <b>Crime</b> Policy Crime has been a major focus of political campaigns for years (Johnson 1997; Warr 1995, 2000), but during the 1990 s, policy-makers routinely cited gang violence and the fear it invoked in the public as a primary justification for harsher laws and punishment policies (e. g., Clinton 1997; Senate 1994). Throughout the 1990 s...|$|R
50|$|News of {{the attack}} was subject to {{internet}} censorship in the People's Republic of China. The Chinese Government ordered the major news portals to remove mentions of the incident, citing <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> copycat <b>crime.</b> For example, Baidu's Zhidao page on the incident was taken down.|$|R
25|$|The media enables {{concerned}} citizens {{to pick up}} images of criminal events— the perpetrators, the victims, motives, and sensational details of violent crimes; interpersonal communication and internet based social networks add to the dissemination of information. Fear may be generated if the individual identifies with the described victim, or feels that their own neighbourhood bears resemblance to the one described; then the image of risk may be taken up, personalised and translated into personal safety concerns. The media sometimes reports <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> through broader concerns about neighbourhood breakdown, the loss of moral authority, and the crumbling of civility and social capital.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{events that}} have {{happened}} to Croydon's skyline include the Millennium project to create the largest single urban lighting project ever. It was created for the buildings of Croydon to illuminate them for the third millennium. Not only did this project give new lighting to the buildings, but it provided an opportunity to project onto them images and words, mixing art and poetry with coloured light, and also displaying public information after dark. Apart from increasing night time activity in Croydon and thereby reducing the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime,</b> it helped to promote the sustainable use of older buildings by displaying them in a more positive way.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s the U.S. Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) found a {{reduction}} of 10% to 13% in Washington, D.C.'s violent crime rate during DST. However, the LEAA did not filter out other factors, and it examined only two cities and found crime reductions only in one and only in some crime categories; the DOT decided it was [...] "impossible to conclude with any confidence that comparable benefits would be found nationwide". Outdoor lighting has a marginal and sometimes even contradictory influence on crime and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) {{has used}} open gangway rolling stock {{for several years}} , while the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the New York City Subway's operator, was {{considering}} it for up to 750 railcars of the planned R211 order. Initially they had planned only 10 cars, enough for an experimental prototype train-set, amid <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> However, TTC claims that crime {{has not been a}} problem since the implementation of open gangway stock. In July 2016, the state and the MTA announced that along with some major station upgrades, they were increasing the number of open gangway cars to as many as 750, up from 10.|$|R
50|$|The {{shooting}} prompted {{an increase}} in security at movie theaters across the U.S. that were screening the same film, in <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> copycat <b>crimes.</b> The shooting also led to a spike in gun sales in Colorado {{as well as political}} debates about gun control in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Cora Alexa Døving, {{a senior}} {{scientist}} at the Norwegian Center for Studies of the Holocaust and Religious Minorities, argues that there are significant similarities between Islamophobic discourse and European pre-Nazi antisemitism. Among the concerns are imagined threats of minority growth and domination, threats to traditional institutions and customs, skepticism of integration, threats to secularism, <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>crimes,</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> misogyny, <b>fears</b> based on historical cultural inferiority, hostility to modern Western Enlightenment values, etc.|$|R
500|$|As {{some critics}} have noted, Psycho-Pass explores {{societal}} and psychological themes, such {{as the price of}} living without stress, and without <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. But this {{raises the question of whether}} it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. For example, in the first episode, a woman is kidnapped, and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's instructions, the police are therefore prepared to kill her. But Akane steps in, refusing to accept Sibyl's verdict, and manages to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. Consequently, this challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime necessarily correlates with actually committing the crime. According to Anime News Network, [...] "We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal".|$|E
500|$|Annie Hall [...] "is {{as much a}} {{love song}} to New York City {{as it is to}} the character," [...] {{reflecting}} Allen's adoration of the island of Manhattan. It was a relationship he explored repeatedly, particularly in films like Manhattan (1979) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986). Annie Hall's apartment, which still exists on East 70th Street between Lexington Avenue and Park Avenue is by Allen's own confession his favorite block in the city. Peter Cowie argues that the film shows [...] "a romanticized view" [...] of the borough, with the camera [...] "linger on the Upper East Side [...] the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> does not trouble its characters." [...] By contrast, California is presented less positively, and David Halle notes the obvious [...] "invidious intellectual comparison" [...] between New York City and Los Angeles. While Manhattan's movie theaters show classic and foreign films, Los Angeles theaters run less-prestigious fare such as House of Exorcism and Messiah of Evil. Rob's demonstration of adding canned laughter to television demonstrates the [...] "cynical artifice of the medium". New York serves as a symbol of Alvy's personality ("gloomy, claustrophobic, and socially cold, but also an intellectual haven full of nervous energy") while Los Angeles is a symbol of freedom for Annie.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{criminal}} justice professor Cyndi Banks, the War on Terror, like the War on Drugs, became {{the context of}} a significant expansion of SWAT policing. Whereas some have attributed this expansion to [...] "mission creep" [...] and the militarization of police, other scholars argue that increased SWAT policing is a response to real or perceived moral panics associated with <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> and terrorism. Banks writes that SWAT team employment of military veterans has influenced their tactics and perspective.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to Japan, {{a more open}} immigration policy has allowed Australia, Canada, and the United States to grow their workforce despite low fertility rates. An expansion of immigration is often rejected {{as a solution to}} population decline by Japan's political leaders and people. Reasons include a <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> foreign <b>crime,</b> a desire to preserve cultural traditions, and a belief in the ethnic and racial homogeneity of the Japanese nation.|$|R
5000|$|Research {{shows that}} <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> {{increasing}} <b>crime</b> {{is often the}} cause of moral panics. Recent {{studies have shown that}} despite declining crime rates, this phenomenon, which often taps into a populations' [...] "herd mentality," [...] continues to occur in various cultures. Japanese jurist Koichi Hamai explains how the changes in crime recording in Japan since the 1990s caused people to believe that the crime rate is rising and that crimes were getting increasingly severe.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the penal development in China {{over the last six}} decades to understand the ways in which populist punitiveness functions in the Chinese political and social contexts. It argues that populist punitiveness in China is a ‘top-down’ process whereby manipulative political elites play on public anxieties and <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> and social insecurity to serve different political objectives of the Chinese Communist Party. While public sentiment was promoted and reflected in penal policy in revolutionary (1950 s- 1970 s) and reform (1970 s- 1990 s) China, their influence, in the post-reform era (2000 s-), has been blocked or filtered by the political will due to the emergence of a series of moderate political agendas.

2500|$|Using {{profits from}} the Lind tour, Barnum's next {{challenge}} was to change public attitudes about the theater. Widely seen as 'dens of evil,' Barnum wanted to position them as palaces of edification and delight, and as respectable middle-class entertainment. He built the city's largest and most modern theater, naming it the [...] "Moral Lecture Room." [...] He hoped this would avoid seedy connotations and attract a family crowd and win {{the approval of the}} moral crusaders of New York City. He started the nation's first theatrical matinées, to encourage families and to lessen the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> He opened with The Drunkard, a thinly disguised temperance lecture (he had become a teetotaler after returning from Europe). He followed that with melodramas, farces, and historical plays, put on by highly regarded actors. He watered down Shakespearean plays and others such as Uncle Tom's Cabin to make them family entertainment.|$|E
50|$|Women's <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> {{refers to}} women's {{fear of being}} a victim of crime, {{independent}} of actual victimization. Although <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> is a concern for people of all genders, studies consistently find that {{women around the world}} tend to have much higher levels of <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> than men, despite the fact that in many places, and for most offenses, men's actual victimization rates are higher. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> is related to perceived risk of victimization, but is not the same; <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> may be generalized instead of referring to specific offenses, and perceived risk may also be considered a demographic factor that contributes to <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> Women tend to have higher levels for both perceived risk and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
50|$|Urban {{and rural}} {{communities}} {{tend to have}} very different levels of <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> Rural areas are almost always perceived by residents and outsiders as safer, so it is often assumed that <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> levels will be lower there. Still, 2005 research in New Zealand and the United Kingdom noted that <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> levels in rural areas is on the rise, and found that sources of <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> among rural women often include perceived encroachment of urban influence (through people or attitudes) into their communities.|$|E
50|$|On January 20, 1982, MTA Chairman Richard Ravitch {{told the}} {{business}} group Association for a Better New York, {{that he would}} not let his teenage sons ride the subway at night, and that even he, as the subway chairman, was nervous riding the trains. The MTA began to discuss how the issue could be the ridership issue could be fixed, but by October 1982, mostly due to fears about transit crime, poor subway performance and some economic factors, ridership on the subway was at extremely low levels matching 1917 ridership. Within less than ten years, the MTA had lost around 300 million passengers, mainly because <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> In July 1985, the Citizens <b>Crime</b> Commission <b>of</b> New York City published a study showing this trend, fearing the frequent robberies and generally bad circumstances.

50|$|Generally, {{research}} has demonstrated that women from urban areas have higher levels of <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> Even within cities, fear levels may differ from neighborhood to neighborhood. Increased social disorganization in the neighborhood (as measured by homelessness, drug sales, vandalism, prostitution, etc.) and higher rates of neighborhood serious crime lead to higher levels of <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> for both men and women, but both factors have a stronger effect on women's <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
50|$|A 2014 {{study using}} data from 20 {{countries}} in Sub-Saharan Africa concluded that <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> has a stronger negative effect on women's subjective well-being compared to men's, with subjective wellbeing defined as self-reported satisfaction with life. In the study, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> had a statistically significant correlation with subjective wellbeing for females, but no significant correlation for males, suggesting that for {{the men in the}} study, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> was not an important factor in determining their happiness and life satisfaction.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the symbolic politics {{associated with the}} adoption of the omnibus $ 30 billion federal <b>crime</b> bill <b>of</b> 1994. Based upon critical race theory and close readings of Congressional hear-ings and print media coverage, we argue that race was the key to midnight basketball’s prominence in the legislative debates and that its introduction ultimately reduced prevention-oriented provi-sions included in the final legislation. The central empirical contribution is a content analysis that specifies how racially coded references to midnight basketball exerted their impact on the political process through the discursive framing of the bill. We find that while midnight basketball directly increased attention to race in the debates, its real impact was more indirect, serving to heighten <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> and produce images of criminals that made prevention appear misguided. In contrast to bottom-up theoretical approaches, these discursive shifts worked at the level of elite decision makers, the legislators themselves. The article concludes by drawing out the implications of this case study for theories of how the politics of race operate in the contemporary American political arena, especially those concerning crime control...|$|R
