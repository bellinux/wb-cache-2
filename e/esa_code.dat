In this paper, a FEM simulation of laminated shell structures with piezoelectric elements is used to study an active payload support developed as a technology demonstrator {{in the frame of}} an <b>ESA</b> program.

30|$|However, {{the methods}} for {{forecasting}} products from <b>CODE,</b> <b>ESA,</b> and UPC, {{as well as}} ARPG, presented in this manuscript are actually based on mathematical fitting without consideration of the physical processes. “Comparison of predicted VTEC maps” section shows that the performance of forecasting ionospheric VTEC maps was limited during geomagnetic storms on DOY 77, 174, and 355 in 2015. The main reason might be that the AARM model could not adapt to the sudden change in geomagnetic activity. On the other hand, {{the accuracy of the}} final VTEC maps might be lower during geomagnetic storms. Additionally, limited data availability and inhomogeneous distribution of GNSS stations could also impact the performance of forecasting. Therefore, a key priority for the prediction of global ionospheric VTEC maps in the future should be importing physical information in terms of solar and geomagnetic activities, such as the solar flux and Dst.|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of critical NASA space flight hardware is ensured through a damage tolerance program which is dictated in the fracture control requirements. The {{goal of a}} fracture control program is to ensure proper material selection and control, control of working stress levels, use of fracture resistant design concepts, manufacturing process control, {{and the use of}} qualified inspection procedures. The damage tolerance philosophy assumes that all components contain initial defects and the damage accumulation process is thus entirely crack propagation. The service capability of fracture critical components is determined by analysis and/or test. A large percentage of NASA fracture critical hardware is certified by analysis only and it is therefore imperative that the analysis code utilized contain the latest state of the art technology. Not all space contractors and vendors are able to develop and maintain an analysis code which meets this requirement. A response to this need has been fulfilled by the development of the NASA/FLAGRO (NASGRO) fracture mechanics code here at the Johnson Space Center. The NASGRO code is based primarily in Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) and is continually updated to meet to needs of the user community. Development assistance comes from other NASA centers as well as the European Space Agency (<b>ESA).</b> The <b>code</b> currently has a vast materials data file (over 350 different entries) which defines the material strength, fracture toughness, crack growth rate, and crack growth threshold. The code also allows for user defined inputs of data from other sources. The code also provides a large library of stress intensity factor solutions for numerous geometries and loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the derivation and validation of a numerical material model that predicts the highly dynamic behaviour of CFRP (carbon fibre reinforced plastic) under hypervelocity impact. CFRP {{is widely used}} in satellites as face sheet material in CFRP-Al/HC sandwich structures (HC = honeycomb) that can be exposed to space debris. A review of CFRP-Al/HC structures typically used in space was performed. Based on this review, a representative structure in terms of materials and geometry was selected for study in the work described here. An experimental procedure for the characterisation of composite materials is documented by Riedel et al. [ADAMMO - advanced material damage models for numerical simulation <b>codes.</b> <b>ESA</b> CR(P) 4397, EMI report 175 / 03, Freiburg: October 31, 2003. ]. The test results from the CFRP {{of the current study}} allow for the derivation of an experimentally based orthotropic continuum material model data set that is capable of predicting the mechanical behaviour of CFRP under hypervelocity impact. Such a data set was not previously available. In the work by Riedel et al. [Hypervelocity impact damage prediction in composites: part II - experimental investigations and simulations. International journal of Impact Engineering, 2006 : 33 : 670 - 80. ] an orthotropic material data set was used for modelling HVI on AFRP (aramid fibre reinforced plastic), which shows relatively high deformability before failure. The enhancements of the modelling approaches in previous studies [Riedel W, Harwick W, White DM, Clegg RA. ADAMMO - advanced material damage models for numerical simulation <b>codes.</b> <b>ESA</b> CR(P) 4397, EMI report I 75 / 03, Freiburg: October 31, 2003.

Final report, EMI report E 43 / 98, ESA CR(P) 4305, Freiburg: July 30, 1999. ] necessary to model brittle CFRP are specified. An experimental hypervelocity impact campaign was performed at two different two-stage light gas guns which encompassed both normal and oblique impacts for a range of impact velocities and projectile diameters. Validation of the numerical model is provided through comparison with the experimental results. For that purpose measurements of the visible damage of the face sheets and of the HC core are conducted. In addition, the numerically predicted damage within the CFRP is compared to the delamination areas found in ultrasonic scans...|$|R
40|$|A {{representative}} {{carbon fiber}} reinforced plastic/aluminum honeycomb sandwich panel (CFRP/Al HC SP) spacecraft structure has been modeled in the hydrocode AUTODYN using the state-of-the-art ADAMMO material model [Riedel W, Harwick W, White D, Clegg R. Advanced material damage models for numerical simulation <b>codes.</b> <b>ESA</b> CR(P) 4397, 2003] {{to study the}} performance of the structure during impact events that cause perforation and fragment ejection. A new procedure combining a series of existing theoretical methods has been developed and applied to derive a full set of coarse material data. The data set has been implemented in AUTODYN, and the results of the numerical simulation have been compared to experimental impact test data. For impact tests performed near the structural ballistic limit, quantitatively accurate results were obtained over a range of impact velocities and angles. A further increase in the projectile size resulted in significant destruction of the sandwich panel front face-sheet and diversion from the experimental damage measurements. Inspection of the numerical model has shown non-localized propagation of inter-laminar delaminations, possibly caused by an under-prediction of the laminate dynamic inter-laminar tensile strength. The effects of the delamination propagation occur over an extended time scale and were not found to affect the state and trends of the fragment cloud ejected into the satellite interior. Accordingly, experimental trends of fragment cloud dispersion have been qualitatively reproduced...|$|R
40|$|Preparations for the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Atmospheric Dynamics Mission (ADM-Aeolus), {{which is}} {{scheduled}} for launch in 2011, are in full progress. The direct detection high spectral resolution Doppler Wind Lidar (DWL) satellite instrument {{will be the first}} to measure wind profiles from space, from the surface up to 30 km altitude [1] and [2]. To achieve this, a laser at 355 nm pulsed at 100 Hz is pointed towards the atmosphere. Backscattered light, both from molecules and aerosols, is detected by two independent spectrometers. A dual channel Fabry-Perot spectrometer to measure both sides of the Rayleigh (molecule) spectral peak, and a high resolution Fizeau spectrometer to measure the location of the Mie (aerosol) peak. In preparation of this mission, besides the actual construction of the instrument and satellite, a number of supporting activities have been initiated by ESA, including instrument simulation and ground processing software development, ground and air-borne measurement campaigns, and studies dedicated to specific issues such as calibration and sampling strategies. An important part of the preparations is to study the possibilities of calibrating the wind results by means of surface reflections. To estimate the effect of water motion due to waves, a simple wave model has been combined with a reflectivity model of the water surface. This includes specular reflection on smooth water surfaces and Lambertian reflection on foam caused by wind streaks and breaking waves. The effect of subsurface reflection is still being investigated. Using this model, the average net water movement that will be observed by the DWL instrument is estimated. Another part of the preparations includes the development of Level 2 B (i. e., wind) processing software (L 2 Bp). This software will accept as input measurement data files (Level 1 B) and uses an estimate of the atmospheric temperature and pressure profiles (from a numerical weather prediction model) to retrieve the wind profile from the spectrometer data. This software will be made available by <b>ESA</b> as source <b>code,</b> free of charge, to all interested users in the meteorological/research community, and may be used as standalone software, or integrated as subroutine in a larger system for use in scientific or operational applications. The working of the L 2 Bp will be illustrated at the conference...|$|R
40|$|The {{control and}} the funding of cities, communes and provinces {{is one of the}} major stakes ahead of the {{regional}} election of June 2009. The following sections discuss four topics : the Communes Fund, the control regulations, the role of provinces, and the possible introduction of ESA standards on local level. The Walloon Region decree of July 15, 2008 reshapes in depth the Communes Fund for the first time since 1989. The new mechanism is more transparent and objective. It applies from 2008 on, but its effects on the financial situation of the communes will be marked mainly in the future. With the decree of November 22, 2007, and a new general regulation for communal accountancy the current Walloon government and parliament have also taken new measures to improve the respect of legal budgetary procedures by the local authorities. However, another, perhaps more efficient approach could be the creation of an external control body with broad powers of investigation, on the model of the federal Court of Auditors. As far as provinces are concerned, the main debate is not so much about the way they are funded but more fundamentally about their very role. The creation of Regions and Communities and the merger of communes have reduced the need for another intermediate political authority. Therefore the transfer of competences from the provinces to the Regions or Communities is sometimes seen as a rather simple way to reduce the overall government expenses. However, the economic composition of provincial budgets, in which wages and debt amount to more than two thirds of the total, strongly reduces the amount that could be saved. Nevertheless, the forthcoming legislature could be used by the provinces to analyze the fields in which their presence can foster a more efficient provision of public goods. Communes, cities and provinces belong to the sector of public administrations, known under ESA terminology as « Sector 13  ». Their budgets are therefore included in the computation of public deficit and debt used for the European Excessive Deficit Procedure. However, their current accountacy system is not shaped in accordance with ESA standards. Their budgetary realisations are translated into ESA terms by the Institute for National Accounts. The forthcoming legislature could be used to adapt the current system to <b>ESA</b> requirements. JEL <b>Codes</b> ? H 1, H 4, H 7. fiscal federalism, fiscal policy, local public economy...|$|R
30|$|The {{system model}} {{in this work}} is a typical {{multiple}} access wiretap channel (MAC-WT) 1, which has been intensively studied recently. However, all of these references [21 – 34] considered problems from an information-theoretical perspective and characterized the setting as a whole. Ender Tekin et al. characterized secrecy rate regions and an upper bound for the secrecy sum-rate for a Gaussian MAC-WT via the Gaussian encoding in [21]. They also addressed a fading MAC-WT in [22], providing achievable ergodic secrecy rate regions {{as well as its}} outer bounds and giving optimal power allocations to maximize the sum-rate. Hassan Zivari-Fard et al. [23] investigated a 2 -user MAC-WT with a common message which can be decoded by both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, and derived general inner and outer bounds on a secrecy capacity region for both discrete memoryless and Gaussian cases. The authors further addressed this type of MAC-WT (with a common message) in [24], where only one transmitter’s private messages should be kept secret from the adversary. They derived general inner and outer bounds for both imperfect and perfect secrecy conditions for the adversary under discrete memoryless, less noisy, and Gaussian versions of the MAC-WT. Yet, the secure degrees of freedom (DoF) of such Gaussian signaling-based schemes are zero, which means the schemes are suboptimal and leads to further work for new encoding techniques. One commonly used encoding technique is the real interference alignment [25 – 27]. Other techniques, e.g., uniform distributed source coding and polar coding, are also developed and applied for the MAC-WT [28 – 30]. Moreover, two alignment techniques, scaling-based alignment (SBA), and ergodic secret alignment (ESA), were proposed in [31] to achieve an ergodic secrecy rate region for a 2 -user fading MAC-WT. The SBA performs repetition coding at two consecutive time instances while the <b>ESA</b> performs repetition <b>coding</b> at two carefully chosen time instances. Another research direction of interest on the MAC-WT is secure DoF, which was also fully studied in recent years [25, 32 – 34]. Xie and Ulukus [25] derived the sum secure DoF of a K-user Gaussian MAC-WT. The entire secure DoF region of the K-user Gaussian MAC-WT was determined in [32]. Mukherjee and Ulukus [33] considered the secure DoF of the case with no eavesdropper’s channel state information (CSI). The results showed the sum secure DoF is less than that of the case with a subset or all of the transmitters knowing the eavesdropper’s CSI. The secure DoF of a MIMO MAC-WT was studied in [34], showing that the optimal sum secure DoF is affected by the number of eavesdropper antennas.|$|R
