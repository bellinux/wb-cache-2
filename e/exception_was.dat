5|$|The 10th {{were sent}} to Fort Concho in Texas where they were {{established}} on April 17, 1875. The <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> Carpenter's troop stationed at Fort Davis as of May 1, 1875.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the party}} {{maintained}} excellent health. The <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> the ship's engineer, Allan Ramsay, {{who had been}} taken ill with a heart condition in the Falklands during the outward voyage. He chose to remain with the expedition, but he grew steadily weaker as winter progressed. He died on 6 August, and was buried on the island.|$|E
5|$|On {{several of}} its websites, Hemi stated {{that it would not}} sell {{cigarettes}} to New York residents due to ongoing litigation there, but no <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> made to Illinois residents. Hemi's website directed customers to check with their respective states to determine the amount, if any, of state taxes associated with their order.|$|E
40|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted agreement on how <b>exceptions</b> <b>are</b> to be used. Many projects {{suffer from a}} mess of exceptions thrown across the system with no defined responsibility for catching them. This paper presents a simple component-based strategy addressing the following points: • How many and which <b>exception</b> classes <b>are</b> useful? • When should an <b>exception</b> <b>be</b> thrown? In Java: should it be a checked or an unchecked <b>exception?</b> • Who <b>is</b> responsible for catching exceptions? • How far may <b>exceptions</b> <b>be</b> thrown? Preconditions are considered in detail. The paper {{is based on the}} experience of many real large software projects. I...|$|R

5|$|Outside the military, Latin {{never became}} the {{language}} of everyday life in the East. An <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> the Roman colony of Berytus (present-day Beirut), where a Latin education could be obtained, and which became famous for its school of Roman law.|$|E
5|$|The {{covers for}} almost every issue of Air Wonder, Science Wonder, Wonder Stories and Wonder Stories Quarterly were painted by Frank R. Paul, who had {{followed}} Gernsback from Amazing Stories. The only <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> a cover image composed of colored dots, which {{appeared on the}} November 1932 issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavated}} grave-goods of the Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Gipeswic, {{including those}} found in burials under small barrows, were not particularly wealthy or elaborate. They lacked the strong characterization of a neighbouring late 6th century cemetery at a higher crossing of the river. One <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> a furnished grave {{that it has been}} suggested could have been that of a visitor from the Rhineland.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in North America on May 21, 2009, with Warner Bros. setting the American premiere on May 14, 2009, at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Elsewhere, Sony Pictures Entertainment released the film in most overseas territories on different dates in June. One <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> Mexico, however, because of the swine flu outbreak in the country, which forced Sony to push the release date to July 31, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The first copies were {{delivered}} to bookstores on September 10. Many were wary of it, {{due to its}} technical nature, and feared that sales would be low. An <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> Scribner's Bookstores, which placed large early orders. At Oak Ridge, the Manhattan Project's major production site, 8,000 copies were sold through the employee welfare organization. Similar arrangements were made for Los Alamos and Richland, which were located in areas where bookstores were scarce.|$|E
5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.|$|E

5|$|An <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> {{made for}} Christians to {{participate}} in Christmas ceremonies in Bethlehem. Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan (which {{was not an option}} for Israelis) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} NFF awarded an annual license to clubs which {{permitted}} {{them to play}} in the top two divisions. This included a series of criteria that the home venue needed to meet. As Briskeby was severely substandard to the criteria, Ham-Kam was required to apply for annual exemptions. These were only awarded to clubs who were actively working on upgrading or building new venues. If an <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> not granted, the club would either be relegated to the Second Division (the third tier), or would have to play their home games at an approved stadium in another town.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, the eight-hour day {{had become}} common in American industry. One <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> in steel mills, where workers labored through a twelve-hour workday, {{seven days a}} week. Hoover {{considered}} this practice barbaric, and got Harding to convene a conference of steel manufacturers {{with a view to}} ending it. The conference established a committee under the leadership of U. S. Steel chairman Elbert Gary, which in early 1923 recommended against ending the practice. Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result, which was printed in the press, and public outcry caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight-hour day.|$|E
2500|$|Software {{exception}} handling {{and the support}} provided by software tools differs somewhat from what <b>is</b> understood under <b>exception</b> in hardware, but similar concepts are involved. In programming language mechanisms for {{exception handling}}, the term <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> typically used in a specific sense to denote a data structure storing information about an exceptional condition. One mechanism to transfer control, or raise an <b>exception,</b> <b>is</b> known as a throw. The <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> said to be thrown. Execution is transferred to a [...] "catch".|$|R
50|$|<b>Exceptions</b> <b>are</b> {{different}} from branches and jumps, because those other control flow changes are {{resolved in the}} decode stage. <b>Exceptions</b> <b>are</b> resolved in the writeback stage. When an <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> detected, the following instructions (earlier in the pipeline) are marked as invalid, and as they flow {{to the end of}} the pipe their results are discarded. The program counter is set to the address of a special exception handler, and special registers are written with the exception location and cause.|$|R

5|$|By 1926, {{the piece}} of current NY9N from Hague to Ticonderoga was {{designated}} as the easternmost leg of NY47, which continued west to Chestertown on modern NY8. In 1927, most of NY6 north of Round Lake was replaced by US9 when U.S. Highways were first signed in New York. The lone <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> between Elizabethtown and Keeseville, where US9 followed a previously unnumbered highway to the east instead. The bypassed section of NY6 between the two locations was redesignated as NY9W at this time. NY9W was renumbered to NY9N {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, eliminating the alphanumerical duplication between itself and US9W.|$|E
5|$|Compliance {{with the}} law is checked when {{vehicles}} pass through a weigh station, often located at the borders between states or {{on the outskirts of}} major cities, where the vehicle may be weighed and measured. The one exception to the formula allows a standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to weigh the maximum legal gross weight. This <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law.|$|E
5|$|Dalmatian cities {{remained}} {{loyal to}} Mary and Sigismund, not least {{thanks to the}} couple's alliance with Venice. A notable <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> Klis, which supported the rebellious nobleman John of Palisna. Tvrtko {{took control of the}} Klis Fortress in July 1387, which enabled him to launch attacks on Split. Although the Bosnian army laid waste to the areas of Split and Zadar, the cities refused to capitulate. Their officials were willing to honour King Tvrtko but insisted that Queen Mary and King Sigismund were their legitimate sovereigns. Ostrovica Fortress submitted to Tvrtko in November, followed by Trogir.|$|E

5|$|Each club {{needed to}} {{progress}} through four rounds {{to reach the}} final. Matches were contested over two legs, with a match at each team's home ground. The majority of Liverpool's ties were won by at least two goals, the <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, which Liverpool won on the away goals rule. Borussia Mönchengladbach's ties were predominantly one-sided. The West German team won by at least four goals in all four of their ties, a 9–2 aggregate victory over Kaiserslautern represented their biggest margin of victory.|$|E
5|$|Estate house design {{declined}} in {{importance in the}} twentieth century. An <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> the work undertaken by John Kinross (1855–1955). Beginning with the reconstruction of Thurston House, Dunbar, from 1890, he undertook a series of major country house designs. The most important was Manderston House (1901–03), built for James Miller in the Adam style. Skibo Castle was rebuilt for industrialist Andrew Carnegie (1899–1903) by Ross and Macbeth. English architect C. H. B. Quennell designed a neo-Georgian mansion at Altmore (1912–14) for {{the owner of a}} Moscow department store. There was a lull in building after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of rural country houses.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, {{everyone}} was aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push. A notable <b>exception</b> <b>was</b> Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, {{who was one of the}} very few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being brought from the field of battle, having been wounded in action.|$|E
5000|$|No new <b>exceptions</b> should <b>be</b> {{thrown by}} {{methods of the}} subtype, except where those <b>exceptions</b> <b>are</b> {{themselves}} subtypes of exceptions thrown by the methods of the supertype.|$|R
2500|$|If an <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> thrown and {{not caught}} (operationally, an <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> thrown {{when there is}} no {{applicable}} handler specified), the uncaught <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> handled by the runtime; the routine that does this is called the [...] The most common default behavior is to terminate the program and print an error message to the console, usually including debug information such as a string representation of the exception and the stack trace.

5000|$|If no [...] block {{matches the}} type of the thrown exception, the {{execution}} of the outer block (or method) containing the ... statement is discontinued, and the <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> passed up and outside the containing block (or method).
