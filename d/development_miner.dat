City 2 ̆ 2 biography 2 ̆ 2 was very much just that-a collective biography of the men who made the city what it was. As the discipline of urban history has matured, the view that tied each community 2 ̆ 7 s development to the unique personalities of its leaders has given way to an interest in the process of urbanization and the examination of cities as case studies, important primarily because of what they say about the larger urban experience. Craig Miner 2 ̆ 7 s Wichita is a throwback to the old city biography, not only in its delight in the particular but also in its thesis that Wichita 2 ̆ 7 s elite was the key ingredient in the town 2 ̆ 7 s <b>development.</b> <b>Miner</b> contends, for instance, that Wichita 2 ̆ 7 s brief but profitable involvement in the cattle trade was due less to the town 2 ̆ 7 s fortuitous location than to the alertness and aggressiveness of its businessmen. Taking issue with Robert Dykstra and others who have emphasized the divisions among Wichita 2 ̆ 7 s business leaders, Miner finds a broad consensus in the urge to promote Wichita as a place to make money. The argument has merit and comports with the view of a few historians who in recent years have taken an idiosyncratic approach to urban history by reasserting the importance of every city 2 ̆ 7 s own character and personality. Unfortunately, Miner 2 ̆ 7 s is a weak effort. Wichita 2 ̆ 7 s business community and political leaders, except for a few notables, are not identified or described in any detail, nor are they compared to those of other Kansas towns. Miner can not demonstrate that Wichita 2 ̆ 7 s businessmen were any more farsighted or aggressive than other entrepreneurs on this urban frontier. Miner asserts his thesis rather offhandedly, for to elaborate would interrupt the narrative. The book lacks conceptual sophistication...|$|E

The following research {{methods have been}} applied: contrastive-comparative analysis of literature on historic, sociological, political science, philosophic and economic issues; the method of statistical processing of the information; historical-typological analysis and generalization of documents in force and archival materials; the method of historical simulation. The authors gradually identified the most relevant political causes and factors affecting the <b>development</b> of <b>miner</b> protest campaigns in 1992 – 1999. Their interdependence on economic and socio-cultural aspects of phenomenon under consideration is also revealed. A comparative analysis with the “perestroika” period (1989 – 1991) was carried out. The authors made a conclusion that socio-political and socio-economic processes in coal mining regions were highly dependent on {{the policy of the}} federal center. The «experimental» nature of reforms in coal mining industry was not supported by additional political powers of leaders in coal mining territories, as the result, the policy was far behind economy and the social sphere of miners. Regional and local authorities were in the conditions of natural (market) selection; therefore, they spent most of their time keeping their political positions by any means, without any attempts to solve the problems in miner towns and settlements...|$|R

The collections of the Slovak Mining Museum are of an unusual character. The majority of our collections originate from regional products, in no other museum you can find such a collection. The history of Banská Sˇtiavnica has always been connected with mining. The town was not transformed into a business-market place {{because it was not}} situated on trade routes, nor was it essential for the town because rich sources of ore were sufficient. Invention and implementation of technical innovations for increasing production of ore or its more effective processing, brought improvements in production. Various artists and architects, who created monumental pieces, sculptures of The Holy Trinity church and technical innovations of mining devices, were invited to work and left excellent examples of their work for everyday use, such as the interior of the Kammerhof building with frescos and ceramic tile stoves, goldsmith products for churches and parishes, documents of book culture from the 16 th to 18 th centuries.

40|$|International audienceInsect pest {{development}} is often linearly related to air temperature, without {{taking into account}} the multiple interactions between the particular host plant and pest, the microclimatic conditions actually experienced by the insect, and the non-linear response of insect development rate to temperature. In this study, using an integrative biophysical model, we have investigated effects of both climatic and tree structure changes on the development of a phytophagous leaf mining moth (Phyllonorycter blancardella) {{taking into account the}} heterogeneous microcli- matic conditions provided by its host plant, the domestic apple (Malus domestica), the larval body temperature rather than the ambient air temperature, and a non-linear development rate model. Hourly body temperature dynamics of larvae homogeneously dispersed in tree canopies were simulated from hourly meteorological conditions (medium IPCC climate change scenario) within the canopy of apple trees. To analyse the effect of tree architecture on leaf <b>miner</b> <b>development,</b> both pruned and unpruned trees, and one, two and three scaffold branched trees were used. Body temperature dynamics was used to compute larval development time and mortality following the non-linear developmental model for this insect. The results showed that tree pruning influences significantly larval development time and mortality. Nevertheless, the effects of manipulating tree structure on larval develop- ment and survival were relatively weak compared with the impact of chosen climate variations. This survey also showed that the variability in insect development time within a year and insect mortality change markedly with climatic variations, and highlights the importance of using non-linear rate curves and insect body temperatures instead of air temperature in forecasting models of climate-related insect pest outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Pharmacodynamics (PD) {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between drug concentration and drug effect on target sites. This field has recently gained attention as studies involving PD Drug-Drug interactions (DDI) assure discovery of multi-targeted drug agents and novel efficacious drug combinations. A PD drug combination could be synergistic, additive or antagonistic depending upon the summed effect of the drug combination at a target site. The PD literature has grown immensely {{and most of its}} knowledge is dispersed across different scientific journals, thus the manual identification of PD DDI is a challenge. In order to support an automated means to extract PD DDI, we propose Pharmacodynamics Miner (PD-Miner). PD-Miner is a text-mining tool, which is capable of identifying PD DDI from in vitro PD experiments. It is powered by two major features, i. e., collection of full text articles and in vitro PD ontology. The in vitro PD ontology currently has four classes and more than hundred subclasses; based on these classes and subclasses the full text corpus is annotated. The annotated full text corpus forms a database of articles, which can be queried based upon drug keywords and ontology subclasses. Since the ontology covers term and concept meanings, the system is capable of formulating semantic queries. PD-Miner extracts in vitro PD DDI based upon references to cell lines and cell phenotypes. The results are in the form of fragments of sentences in which important concepts are visually highlighted. To determine the accuracy of the system, we used a gold standard of 5 expert curated articles. PD-Miner identified DDI with a recall of 75 % and a precision of 46. 55 %. Along with the <b>development</b> of PD <b>Miner,</b> we also report development of a semantically annotated in vitro PD corpus.

Neste sentido, descreve-se o ambiente em que os Planos foram formulados, analisam-se suas premissas, os processos de prioriza????o das estrat??gias, al??m do processo argumentativo contido nos Planos. Para tanto, nesta tese adota-se o estudo de caso ??nico e longitudinal, combinado com o m??todo da grounded theory, e an??lise de discurso para o tratamento e an??lise dos dados. A partir deste estudo, o autor defende o planejamento estrat??gico governamental como um ritual constru??do socialmente que visa dar legitimidade as decis??es governamentais. Assim, o processo de planejamento como institui????o pol??tica suficientemente adapt??vel, complexa e coesa deveria ser capaz de absorver e ordenar a participa????o de grupos de interesse numa arena capaz de assistir ?? luta entre esses interesses, sem que o conflito acabe em caos. Nesta perspectiva, o processo de planejamento estrat??gico governamental deveria alocar recursos e valores a favor da sociedade, num esfor??o conjunto de produzir e implementar pol??ticas p??blicas de maneira democr??tica. O autor defende que o processo de constru????o do planejamento governamental ?? uma constru????o social. Como tal, muitas vezes, apoia-se em s??mbolos e rituais cujos significados, em alguma medida, s??o compartilhados socialmente. Na constru????o deste discurso legitimador, o processo de planejamento estrat??gico governamental se torna um espa??o de competi????o entre discursos e regimes de verdade. Entre os s??mbolos usados na constru????o dos Planos, no sentido de se obter legitimidade, alguns se destacaram: a efici??ncia do setor privado, a racionalidade t??cnica, o l??der-her??i e a import??ncia pol??tica de Minas Gerais. Al??m dos s??mbolos, o processo de planejamento governamental ?? marcado por diversos ritos, por exemplo, a participa????o social ou a participa????o do Poder Legislativo, que visam conferir legitimidade ao processo. Observa-se ainda que estes rituais de participa????o s??o extremamente formais e n??o produzem participa????o efetiva. Pelo contr??rio, o que se observou nos processos estudados ?? que a constitui????o destes Planos est?? diretamente ligada a um n??mero muito pequeno de pessoas que fazem parte do Poder Executivo. Assim, o processo de planejamento estrat??gico governamental deve ser visto como uma s??rie de eventos que dependem de uma cadeia complexa de intera????es rec??procas, sendo que, muitas vezes, esta cadeia n??o pode ser prevista ou controlada. Assim, apresenta-se uma cr??tica ao planejamento estrat??gico ???cl??ssico???, com seus diagramas e seus gr??ficos, que transmite um ideal de que tudo ficar?? bem desde que as regras sejam seguidas e que as boas pr??ticas gerenciais sejam respeitadas. O que se observa nos processos estudados ?? um processo fluido, marcado pelas idas e vindas. Na formula????o do planejamento estrat??gico governamental de Minas Gerais e seus instrumentos verifica-se a exist??ncia de fluxos distintos e simult??neos. De um lado, discute-se a vis??o, a an??lise do ambiente externo, os objetivos priorit??rios e as estrat??gias, de outro, s??o formulados os programas. This thesis aims {{to question}} the assumptions of instrumental rationality of government planning process, from {{the analysis of the}} process of formulation of Integrated <b>Development</b> Plans <b>Miners</b> and their consequences Plans Multi-year Government Action in the period 1995 - 2011. In this, describes the environment in which plans were formulated, analyze its premises, processes of prioritization of strategies beyond the argumentative process contained in the Plans. Therefore, in this thesis we adopt the single case and longitudinal study, combined with the method of grounded theory and discourse analysis for the processing and analysis of data. From this study, the author defends the government strategic planning as a socially constructed ritual that seeks to legitimize government decisions. Thus, the planning process as a political institution sufficiently adaptable, and cohesive complex should be able to absorb and organize the participation of interest groups in an arena able to watch the fight between these interests without the conflict ends in chaos. In this perspective, the process of strategic planning government should allocate resources and values in favor of the company, in a joint effort to produce and implement public policies in a democratic manner. The author argues that the process of construction of government planning is a social construction. As such, it often relies on symbols and rituals whose meanings, to some extent, are socially shared. In the construction of this discourse legitimizing the government strategic planning process becomes a space of competition between discourses and regimes of truth. Among the symbols used in the construction of plans, in order to obtain legitimacy, some stood out: the efficiency of the private sector, technical rationality, the hero-leader and the political importance of Minas Gerais. In addition to the symbols, the government planning process is marked by several rites, for example, social participation or the participation of the legislature, which aim to confer legitimacy. We also observe that these rituals are extremely formal participation and do not produce effective participation. Rather, what is observed in the studied processes is that the formation of these plans is directly linked to {{a very small number of}} people who are part of the executive branch. Thus, the governmental strategic planning process should be viewed as a series of events that depend on a complex chain of reciprocal interactions, and often this chain can not be predicted or controlled. Thus, it presents a critique of strategic planning "classic", with their diagrams and their graphs, which transmits an ideal that everything will be fine as long as the rules are followed and that good management practices are respected. What is observed in the processes studied is a fluid process, marked by the comings and goings. In the formulation of strategic planning government of Minas Gerais and its instruments verified the existence of separate, simultaneous streams. On the one hand, discusses the vision, the analysis of the external environment, the priority goals and strategies, on the other, are formulated programs...|$|R
