5|$|Government {{authorities}} {{wanted to}} destroy {{the last vestiges of}} these Nazi landmarks. The construction of the buildings in the area around the Führerbunker was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
5|$|At the {{concluding}} Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced {{his and his}} descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> to the Mediterranean. Spain also ceded {{the rights to the}} lucrative asiento (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain.|$|E

50|$|Another {{concept that}} Fusebox {{encourages}} is to parameterize any <b>exit</b> <b>points</b> {{in a web}} page, coding them as variables that are set in the circuit control file. These <b>exit</b> <b>points</b> are known as XFAs - eXit FuseActions. The idea is that by parameterizing the <b>exit</b> <b>points</b> in a web page, the flow of control can be updated more easily, allowing more reuse of web pages or fragments thereof.|$|R

5|$|In 1989 Eastern Harbour Crossing was {{completed}}. Kwun Tong Bypass {{was completed}} in 1991. To construct an interchange for both roads, the intersection between Lei Yue Mun Road and Kai Tin Road was rebuilt into a flyover-roundabout. This made Lam Tin {{a bridge between the}} Eastern Harbour Crossing and the Kwun Tong Bypass of Route 2, with Lei Yue Mun Interchange as the <b>exit</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
5|$|Making or {{recording}} a payment using the card for public transport or purchases at Octopus-enabled retailers {{can be done}} by holding the card against or waving it over an Octopus card reader from up to a few centimetres away. The reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a beep, and displaying the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card. Standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0.3 seconds, while that of readers used for retailers is 1 second. When using the MTR system, the entry point of commuters is noted when a passenger enters, and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users validate their cards again at the <b>exit</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
5|$|Portal is a single-player first-person action/puzzle {{game that}} was first {{available}} {{as part of}} The Orange Box. The game consists primarily {{of a series of}} puzzles that are solved by creating portals through which the player and simple objects can use the portals in order to reach an <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> while being ordered by an AI-programmed robot named GLaDOS throughout the game. The portal system and the unusual physics it creates are the emphasis of this game. Portal was a surprise favorite of The Orange Box, receiving widespread praise and several Game of the Year awards.|$|E

5|$|Through the {{enclosure}} ran the processional path, which {{led from the}} temple entrance through the main gate in {{the enclosure}} wall. The path was frequently decorated with sphinx statues and punctuated by barque stations, where the priests carrying the festival barque could set it down to rest during the procession. The processional path usually ended in a quay on the Nile, which served as the entrance point for river-borne visitors and the <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> for the festival procession when it travelled by water. In Old Kingdom pyramid temples, the quay adjoined an entire temple (the valley temple), which {{was linked to the}} pyramid temple by the processional causeway.|$|E
5|$|Badami, also {{referred}} to as Vatapi, Vatapipura, Vatapinagari and Agastya Tirtha in historical texts, the capital of Chalukya dynasty in the 6th century, is at the <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> of a ravine between two steep mountain cliffs. Four cave temples in the escarpment of the hill to the south-east of the town were carved into the cliff's monolithic stone face. The escarpment is above a man made lake called Agastya Lake, created by an earthen dam faced with stone steps. To the west end of this cliff, at its lowest point, is the first cave temple. The largest and highest cave is Cave 3, which is further to the east on the northern face of the hill. The fourth cave, Cave 4, is a few steps down further east.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988–89, several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews. In April 1988, the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo-journalists. Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery. The interior floor of the Vorbunker {{was covered with a}} muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years. Old empty wine bottles were found {{on the floor of the}} kitchen and wine store room. Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of the bunk beds used by the Goebbels children. At the end of the hallway were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker. However, the men could go no further than the mid-landing, as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947. After these inspections, work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex. The Vorbunkers top and external walls were the first structures to be torn down. The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E

25|$|Like other volcanoes {{around the}} Pacific Ocean, Mayon {{is a part}} of the Pacific Ring of Fire. It is on the {{southeast}} side of Luzon, close to the Philippine Trench, which is the convergent boundary where the Philippine Sea Plate is driven under the Philippine Mobile Belt. When a continental plate meets an oceanic plate, the lighter and thicker continental material overrides the thinner and heavier oceanic plate, forcing it down into the Earth's mantle and melting it. Superheated magma and gases may be forced through weaknesses in the continental crust caused by the subduction of the oceanic plate, and one such <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> is Mayon.|$|E
