5|$|The small pro-democracy Monday demonstrations soon swelled into {{crowds of}} {{hundreds}} of thousands of people in cities across East Germany. The East German leadership considered using force but ultimately backed down, lacking support from the Soviet Union for a violent Tiananmen Square-style military intervention. Reformist members of the East German Politbüro sought to rescue the situation by forcing the resignation of the <b>hardline</b> Party chairman Erich Honecker, replacing him in October 1989 with the marginally less <b>hardline</b> Egon Krenz.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to England, {{he continued to}} advise the British government on colonial matters, calling for <b>hardline</b> responses to ongoing difficulties in Massachusetts that culminated in the 1773 Boston Tea Party. He suffered a stroke in 1771 and died in 1779, leaving a large family.|$|E
5|$|Mondlane's {{immediate}} successor was {{the moderate}} Rev. Uria Simango, {{who had served}} under him, as FRELIMO's vice-President, from its formation until 1969. In the post-assassination power-struggle, Simango was ousted by the more <b>hardline</b> Samora Machel and Marcelino dos Santos, expelled from FRELIMO and eventually arrested and executed, post-Independence, in 1975.|$|E

60|$|Mr. <b>Hardlines</b> {{had many}} enemies, {{all in the}} Civil Service, one of the warmest of whom was Mr. Oldeschole, of the Navigation, and at first they rejoiced greatly that Job's wish had been {{accomplished}} on their behalf, and that their enemy had written a book. They were down on Mr. <b>Hardlines</b> with reviews, counter pamphlets, official statements, and indignant contradiction; but Mr. <b>Hardlines</b> lived through this storm of missiles, and got his book to be fêted and made much of by some Government pundits, who were very bigwigs indeed. And at last he was invited over to the building on the other side, {{to discuss the matter}} with a President, a Secretary of State, a Lord Commissioner, two joint Secretaries, and three Chairmen.|$|R

5|$|On 19 May 1991, the Croatian {{government}} held {{a nationwide}} referendum on {{a declaration of}} sovereignty. In Vukovar, as elsewhere in Croatia, <b>hardline</b> Serb nationalists urged Serbs to boycott the referendum, while moderates advocated using the poll to register opposition to independence. Many local Serbs did vote, but the referendum passed with 94 percent nationally voting in favour.|$|E
5|$|While Brezhnev was plotting, Podgorny's {{position}} within the Politburo grew stronger. Podgorny {{had been able to}} win support from the <b>hardline</b> communists due to Brezhnev's liberal-minded policy regarding Yugoslavia, military disarmament deals with the First World, and forcing East Germany into a concession with West Germany in the Berlin negotiations.|$|E

60|$|It {{was thus}} that Mr. <b>Hardlines,</b> the chief clerk, {{expressed}} himself. He did not, however, send {{in a medical}} certificate, nor apply for a pension; and the first apparent effect of the little lecture which he had received from the Chairman, was the admission into the service of Alaric Tudor. Mr. <b>Hardlines</b> was soon forced {{to admit that the}} appointment was not a bad one, as before his second year was over, young Tudor had produced a very smart paper on the merits--or demerits--of the strike bushel.|$|R
5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a <b>hardline</b> on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.|$|E
5|$|Czechoslovakia's <b>hardline</b> {{communist}} government agreed {{to close its}} border with East Germany to choke off the exodus. The closure produced uproar across East Germany and the GDR government's bid to humiliate refugees by expelling them from the country in sealed trains backfired disastrously. Torn-up identity papers and East German passports littered the tracks as the refugees threw {{them out of the}} windows. When the trains passed through Dresden, 1,500East Germans stormed the main railway station in an attempt to board. Dozens were injured and the station concourse was virtually destroyed.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II to {{his death}} in April 1985, Enver Hoxha pursued a style of {{politics}} informed by <b>hardline</b> Stalinism as well as elements of Maoism. He broke with the Soviet Union after Nikita Khrushchev embarked on his reformist Khrushchev Thaw, withdrew Albania from the Warsaw Pact in 1968 in protest of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, and broke with the People's Republic of China after U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China.|$|E

5|$|Sultan Iskandar and {{his family}} members were not prosecuted for their past {{violations}} of the law on grounds that the royal immunity was still applicable when the incidences occurred. Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was prompted {{to take steps to}} rehabilitate his public image, which was more or less tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have toned down somewhat on his <b>hardline</b> image and appeared to be somewhat more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain their loyalty to him.|$|E
5|$|A {{battle for}} Mogadishu {{followed}} {{in the first half}} of 2006 in which the ARPCT confronted the ICU. However, with local support, the ICU captured the city in June of the year. It then expanded its area of control in south-central Somalia over the following months, assisted militarily by Eritrea. In an effort at reconciliation, TFG and ICU representatives held several rounds of talks in Khartoum under the auspices of the Arab League. The meetings ended unsuccessfully due to uncompromising positions retained by both parties. <b>Hardline</b> Islamists subsequently gained power within the ICU, prompting fears of a Talibanization of the movement.|$|E
6000|$|When it was {{declared}} {{to the world}} of Downing Street that Sir Gregory <b>Hardlines</b> was to be a great man, to have an office of his own, and to reign over assistant-commissioners and subject secretaries, there was great commotion at the Weights and Measures; and when his letter of resignation was absolutely there, visible to the eyes of clerks, properly docketed and duly minuted, routine business was, for a day, nearly suspended. Gentlemen walked in and out from each other's rooms, asking this momentous question--Who was to fill the chair which had so long been honoured by the great <b>Hardlines?</b> Who was to be thought worthy to wear that divine mantle? ...|$|R

5|$|Nicholson was {{at first}} seen as an {{improvement}} over the Catholic Thomas Dongan, the outgoing governor. However, the province's old guard was unhappy that Andros removed all of the provincial records to Boston, and then Nicholson alarmed the sometimes <b>hardline</b> Protestant population by preserving the trappings of the chapel in Fort James that Dongan and the handful of New York's Catholics had used for worship. In response to a rumored Dutch invasion of England (a rumor {{that turned out to}} be true), Nicholson in January 1689 ordered the provincial militias to be on alert to protect the province for the king. Unknown to Nicholson, events in England had already changed things.|$|E
5|$|Suslov {{lost much}} of the {{recognition}} and influence he had earned following the reshuffle of the Soviet leadership after Stalin's death. However, by the late 1950s, Suslov had risen to become {{the leader of the}} <b>hardline</b> opposition to Nikita Khrushchev's more moderate leadership. After Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, Suslov supported the establishment of a collective leadership. He also supported inner-party democracy and opposed the reestablishment of the one-man rule as seen during the Stalin and Khrushchev Eras. During the Brezhnev Era, Suslov was considered to be the Party's Chief Ideologue and second-in-command. His death on 25 January 1982 is viewed as starting the battle to succeed Leonid Brezhnev in the post of General Secretary.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the 1745 Jacobite rising {{decimated}} the antiquated social structure based around clans lorded over by chieftains. This liberalized the Scottish way of life by allowing citizens to own land and keep the profits instead of giving all profits to the chieftains who owned all the land. Their literate foundation allowed the Scots to become economically literate {{and take advantage of}} trade. Edinburgh and Glasgow became epicenters of intellectual thought. There existed in Scotland a clergy who believed that a moral and religious foundation was required for, and compatible with, a free and open sophisticated culture, which moderated <b>hardline</b> conservatives. Herman presents biographies of Francis Hutcheson, Henry Home (Lord Kames), Robert Adam, Adam Smith, and others to illustrate the Scottish development.|$|E
60|$|But {{the great}} {{glory of the}} day was the {{presence}} of Sir Gregory <b>Hardlines.</b> It was a high honour, considering all that rested on Sir Gregory's shoulders, for so great a man to come {{all the way down to}} Hampton to see a clerk in the Weights and Measures married.|$|R
60|$|And then, for {{a period}} of six months, the light of Mr. Hardlines' face ceased to shine on the {{children}} of the Weights and Measures, and they felt, one and all, that the glory had in a certain measure departed from their house. Now and again Mr. <b>Hardlines</b> would look in, but he did so rather as an enemy than as a friend. There was always a gleam of antagonistic triumph in his eye, which showed that he had not forgotten the day when he was called in question for his zeal. He was felt to be in opposition to his own Board, rather than in co-operation with it. The Secretary and the Assistant-Secretaries would say little caustic things about him to the senior clerks, and seemed somewhat to begrudge him his new honours. But for all this Mr. <b>Hardlines</b> cared little. The President and the Secretary of State, the joint Secretaries and the Chairmen, all allowed themselves to be led by him in this matter. His ambition was about to be gratified. It was his destiny that he should remodel the Civil Service. What was it to him whether or no one insignificant office would listen to his charming? Let the Secretary at the Weights and Measures sneer as he would; he would make that hero of the metallic currency know that he, Mr. <b>Hardlines,</b> was his master.|$|R

5|$|At the time, the Vietnamese {{military}} was highly factionalized in complicated and unusual ways, {{and it was}} not clear where the sympathies of the respective officers lied. Thi was pro-Buddhist, but he and Kỳ had been suspected of mooting a coup attempt against Khánh in September 1964, and he had also been reported by the CIA in December 1964 as having vowed to kill Khánh. Although Kỳ had made comments hinting threats to Khánh, he was also known to be strongly opposed to nominally <b>hardline</b> Catholic Diệm supporterssuch as Thảowho were currently the frontrunners to launch the coup. Meanwhile, the likes of Thiệu, Có and Cang, whom the Americans favored, and were Catholic-aligned in more moderate ways, were cautious in comparison to the flamboyant and impetuous Kỳ and Thi. They maintained a guarded approach, waiting to see what the other officers would do, rather than boldly taking the initiative. For his part, Kỳ was reported by US intelligence to have privately predicted that Khánh would be ousted in an efficient manner without bloodletting and replaced by Thiệu.|$|E
5|$|At this point, McCain's {{politics}} were mainly {{in line with}} President Ronald Reagan; this included support for Reaganomics, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills. He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its <b>hardline</b> stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua. McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained {{a spot on the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam, and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.|$|E
5|$|Jaruzelski's Poland {{depended}} on low-cost deliveries of industrial staple commodities from the Soviet Union and meaningful Polish reforms, economic or political, were not feasible during {{the rule of}} the last three conservative Soviet general secretaries. The perestroika and glasnost policies of the Soviet Union's new leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, were therefore a crucial factor in stimulating reform in Poland. Gorbachev essentially repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had stipulated that attempts by its Eastern European satellite states to abandon the communist bloc would be countered by the Soviet Union with force. The developments in the Soviet Union altered the international situation and provided a historical opportunity for independent reforms in Poland. The <b>hardline</b> stance of US President Ronald Reagan was also helpful. David Ost stressed the constructive influence of Gorbachev. With his support for Polish and Hungarian membership in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and for the East European pluralistic evolution in general, the Soviet leader effectively pushed East Europe toward the West.|$|E
