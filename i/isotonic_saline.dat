40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of nasal saline irrigation in adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library. REVIEW METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed, and 2 authors independently screened publications. The design of selected studies was assessed on directness of evidence and risk of bias. RESULTS: Of 1596 publications, 1 open-label randomized trial with high directness of evidence and moderate risk of bias was included. In this study, 127 patients were randomly allocated to <b>isotonic</b> nasal <b>saline</b> irrigation or <b>isotonic</b> nasal <b>saline</b> spray, as added to their usual medication. The mean 20 -Item Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT- 20) scores of those treated with nasal irrigation improved more than those allocated to nasal spray. While the authors consider an improvement of 16 or more to be clinically meaningful, the changes from baseline in mean SNOT- 20 scores of those treated with irrigation (and the differences with those treated with nasal spray) at 2, 4, and 8 weeks were 12. 2 (difference 5. 5, [95 % confidence interval - 0. 04 to 11. 0]), 16. 2 (difference 8. 8 [3. 2 to 14. 4]), and 15. 0 (difference 6. 5 [0. 4 to 12. 6]), respectively.

40|$|The {{expression}} of the osmosensitive sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter (SMIT) is regulated by multiple tonicity-responsive enhancers (TonEs) in the 5 '-flanking region of the gene. In response to hypertonicity, the nuclear abundance of the transcription factor TonE-binding protein (TonEBP) is increased, and the transcription of the SMIT gene is induced. Transport system A for neutral amino acids, another osmosensitive mechanism, is progressively stimulated if amino acid substrates are not present in the extracellular compartment. Under this condition, as in hypertonicity, cells shrink and mitogen-activated protein kinases are activated. We demonstrate here that a clear-cut nuclear redistribution of TonEBP, followed by SMIT expression increase and inositol transport activation, is observed after incubation of cultured human fibroblasts in Earle's balanced salts (EBSS), an <b>isotonic,</b> amino acid-free <b>saline.</b> EBSS-induced SMIT stimulation is prevented by substrates of system A, although these compounds do not compete with inositol for transport through SMIT.

40|$|AbstractNasal {{irrigation}} plays a non-negligible role in {{the treatment}} of numerous sinonasal pathologies and postoperative care. There is, however, a wide variety of protocols. The present review of the evidence-based literature sought objective arguments for optimization and efficacy. It emerged that large-volume low-pressure nasal douche optimizes the distribution and cleansing power of the irrigation solution in the nasal cavity. Ionic composition and pH also influence mucociliary clearance and epithelium trophicity. Seawater is less rich in sodium ions and richer in bicarbonates, potassium, calcium and magnesium than is <b>isotonic</b> normal <b>saline,</b> while alkaline pH and elevated calcium concentration optimized ciliary motility in vitro. Bicarbonates reduce secretion viscosity. Potassium and magnesium promote healing and limit local inflammation. These results show that the efficacy of nasal irrigation is multifactorial.

40|$|Background: Prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) {{is high in}} elite athletes, {{especially}} after many years training in cold and dry air conditions. The primary treatment of EIB is inhaling a short-acting beta- 2 -agonist such as salbutamol.

The use of nebulized <b>isotonic</b> <b>saline</b> or tap water to prevent EIB has not been studied before, raising questions about safety and efficacy. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the acute effect of nebulized <b>isotonic</b> <b>saline</b> or salbutamol on EIB in elite speed skaters following a 1, 500 -meter race. Methods: This randomized controlled trial compares single dose treatment of 1 mg nebulized salbutamol in 4 mL of <b>isotonic</b> <b>saline,</b> or with 5 mL of <b>isotonic</b> <b>saline.</b> A minimum of 13 participants will be allocated in each treatment group.
