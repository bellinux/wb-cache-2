5000|$|Autocarro Sahariano SPA AS.37. This vehicle, {{also based}} on the TL.37 {{artillery}} tractor, was capable of higher speed (50 km/h); the cargo capacity was also increased about 25% to 4,190 kg. The AS.37 had a <b>flat</b> <b>truck</b> bed with two benches facing each other. Starting in 1941, {{some of them were}} armed with a 20mm Breda cannon.|$|E
50|$|Other {{special bodies}} graced {{the pages of}} the 400E range catalogue, {{including}} tower wagons, luton vans, and an unusual <b>flat</b> <b>truck</b> with an air compressor.

The Powertruc name appeared at the front in place of the usual Thames nameplate.|$|E
50|$|In 1909 {{the company}} instituted a shuttle {{passenger}} service over the bridge, between Connel Ferry and Benderloch, by motor charabanc converted with railway wheels. The service ran on Sundays also, {{even though the}} C&OR did not operate a Sunday service on {{the remainder of the}} network. The charabanc also conveyed a <b>flat</b> <b>truck</b> by request, on which private motor cars could be conveyed, for a fare of 15 shillings. The driver and any passengers remained in their own vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Railways also employ <b>flatbed</b> <b>trucks</b> in {{engineering}} trains and freight trains. In Britain and the Commonwealth the term bogie flat is often {{applied to a}} bogie <b>flatbed</b> <b>truck.</b> Although less common, <b>flatbed</b> railway <b>trucks</b> on rigid frames and axles are sometimes used, with both 4-wheel and 6-wheel versions being extant. In British English, the term 'truck' most commonly relates to railway vehicles, with the word 'lorry' more commonly applied to road vehicles.|$|R

50|$|But in 1896 the {{underframe}} {{was used}} to build the replacement K5 <b>flat</b> <b>truck.</b> In this reincarnation it was fitted with water tanks. Thirteen years later it was placed 'off Register'. In its third life, in 1910, it became K 112, a Crane Truck. In 1911 the original K 112 was found running, and so the duplicate ex K 5 was returned to that number, which it kept. It was scrapped in 1927, but was {{not found in the}} 1925 stocktake.|$|E
50|$|In forests or on islands {{where there}} is no water {{available}} for firefighting or emergency cases, flextanks can easily be placed on places where normal traffic is impossible. Flextanks can also be transported fully loaded under a helicopter or on deck of a ship or boat or on a <b>flat</b> <b>truck</b> to enable quick delivery of water or fuels or other liquids in emergency circumstances. Flextanks have been successfully used for firefighting in Russia and Greece and salvage operations in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|A {{small set}} of sidings {{existed at the}} south end of Ipswich station on the up side of the tracks {{adjacent}} to the tunnel. Only one track was accessible from the main line the other sidings being accessed from a wagon turntable. Shunting horses were used in this location to position the vehicles and Ipswich had an allocation of around 30 horses in the 1890s. One track off the wagon turntable led to a small shed which housed a steam fire engine mounted on a <b>flat</b> <b>truck.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Honda Ridgeline is a {{sport utility}} truck (SUT) by Honda and is {{categorized}} {{by some as}} a lifestyle pickup. [...] The Ridgeline is built using a unibody frame with a transvers-mounted engine, four-wheel independent suspension, flat cabin floor, <b>flat</b> <b>truck</b> bed, dual-action tailgate, an In-Bed Trunk, all-wheel drive —as well as front-wheel drive for select 2017-2018 US models—, and is only offered in a crew-cab/short-box configuration. [...] The first Honda Ridgeline went on sale in March 2005 as a 2006 model. This SUT was initially built by Honda of Canada Manufacturing until 2009 when assembly was relocated to Honda Manufacturing of Alabama. [...] Production of the first generation Honda Ridgeline ended in mid-2014. [...] After a two-year hiatus, a newly redesigned second generation Honda Ridgeline went on sale in late June 2016 as a 2017 model.|$|E
50|$|The video {{opens with}} two {{sinister}} backwoods brothers {{driving in the}} California desert, talking {{about what to do}} with the box that lies in the back of their <b>flat</b> <b>truck.</b> They finally decide to sink it to the bottom of the river. Then a flashback shows vocalist Brandan Schieppati and his on-screen bride, actress Susannah Mills, breaking down in front of a diner that includes patrons chained to their tables. Keyboardist Marta Peterson plays a knife-wielding psychotic waitress, and her two brothers, the ones seen at the beginning of the video, are also there. Brandan is then overpowered by the backwoods sadists. At the end, the truck is shown again and the box falls off the back. Apparently, Brandan was in it, because we see him escape. The final scene shows him, gleaming two-foot tire jack in hand, going back into the diner to save his bride from the sinister clutches of the villains.|$|E
50|$|For {{the surface}} lines, two T Stock cars were {{converted}} into sleet locomotives in 1961. They were permanently coupled together, and never ran independently. The de-icing equipment was fitted {{to the inner}} motor bogies, rather than being carried by separate bogies as on the tube-sized sleet locomotives. The cars were renumbered ESL118A and ESL118B, previously being 2758 and 2749 respectively. The locomotives {{were part of a}} leaf clearing experiment between 1978 and 1979, when they were marshalled into a train containing a brake van, a flat car, and Metropolitan electric locomotive Sarah Siddons. The flat car had two 2000 imp gal water tanks and a Merlin bus engine mounted on it, which was used to spray water at high pressure onto the running rails. L149, a ballast motor car, replaced the sleet locomotives in 1979. In 1980, the <b>flat</b> <b>truck</b> was coupled between ESL118A and ESL118B to form a leaf cleaning train, and the high-pressure sprays were augmented by a mixture of sand and chromium or stainless steel granules, which was applied to the rails in a gel to improve adhesion. The metal granules ensured that the track signalling circuits continued to operate.After being withdrawn, both cars were preserved and are currently located at the Spa Valley Railway.|$|E

50|$|In 1940, Brush {{required}} {{some small}} battery-electric tractor units, but as none were commercially available, they asked AC Morrison of AE Morrison and Sons (later Morrison-Electricar) {{to produce a}} design for one. Morrisons produced a 3-wheeled design, which Brush then used to manufacture a number of units for internal use. Subsequently, they began selling them on the open market, and shipped a large order to Russia in 1941. They added battery electric road vehicles to their product list in 1945, buying the designs and manufacturing rights from Metropolitan Vickers, so that early Brush vehicles are almost indistinguishable from late Metro-Vicks. 3-wheeled vehicles were marketed as the Brush Pony, and they also produced 4-wheeled vehicles. In 1948 they added a 2-ton chassis to their range, which could be supplied with a large van, standard van, <b>flat</b> <b>truck</b> or milk float body. The welded box-section chassis was fitted with semielliptic springs and a Lockhead hydraulic braking system. The 36-cell 290 Ahr battery was mounted {{on both sides of}} the central spine. The electric motor was connected to a banjo-type rear axle by a Layrub propellor shaft. In common with other Brush vehicles, control was by a double-depression foot pedal, where the first depression gave two stages of control with the two halves of the battery connected in parallel, and the second depression gave a further two stages with the batteries in series.|$|E
