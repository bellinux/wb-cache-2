40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{association}} between the corporate governance and the dividends payout for a panel of Indian firms over the period 1994 - 2000. We explain {{the differences in the}} dividend payout behavior of the firms with the help of firm’s financial structure, investments opportunities, <b>dividend</b> <b>history,</b> earnings trend and the ownership structure. We find a positive association of dividends with earnings trend and investments opportunities. Debt equity ratio is found to be negatively associated, whereas past in-vestment opportunities exert a positive impact on dividends. Ownership by the corporate and directors is positively related with dividends payout in level, and corporate ownership is negatively related in square. Institutional ownership has inverse effect on dividends in comparison to corporate ownership in levels as well as in its squares. We find no evidence in favor of association between foreign ownership and divided payout growth...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} investigates the interaction of changes in accounting standards with institutions such as investor protection laws and corporate governance mechanisms. We examine the unintended consequences of fair value accounting in determining mandated preferred dividends. We study the case of Russian energy conglomerate UES, which had a good corporate governance track record and a consistent <b>dividend</b> <b>history.</b> Following its adoption of fair value accounting, UES reported the highest quarterly profit in world corporate history, but it subsequently omitted dividends for all its shareholders. The case analysis suggests that the transitory nature of fair value adjustments and the interaction with the investment policy were important considerations in justifying the dividend omission. The reduction in preferred dividends was not offset by any capital gains, {{and led to a}} wealth transfer from preferred to ordinary shareholders. Thus, requiring the use of fair value accounting when determining the dividend distribution base can lead to unintended consequences and increase agency costs for minority shareholders...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dividend}} policy adjustments of eighty NYSE firms to protracted financial distress {{as evidenced by}} multiple losses during 1980 - 85. Almost all sample firms reduced dividends, {{and more than half}} apparently faced binding debt covenants in years they did so. Absent binding debt covenants, dividends are cut more often than omitted, suggesting that managerial reluctance is to the omission and not simply the reduction of dividends. Moreover, managers of firms with long <b>dividend</b> <b>histories</b> appear particularly reluctant to omit dividends. Finally, some dividend reductions seem strategically motivated, e. g., designed to enhance the firm's bargaining positions with organized labor.

40|$|Alaska’s Permanent Fund Dividend (Dividend) is {{an annual}} payment to {{eligible}} residents derived from state investment earnings on mineral royalties. Since 1982, the Dividend has averaged a payout of approximately $ 1, 000 annually. The Permanent Fund Dividend program allows a parent, guardian, or other authorized representative {{to claim a}} Dividend {{on behalf of a}} child. Yet Alaska law currently imposes no requirements whatsoever on how parents use a child’s Dividend. This Note questions Alaska’s lack of parental duty when it comes to managing children’s Dividends. Part I sketches the Permanent Fund <b>Dividend’s</b> <b>history</b> and motivations, the mechanics of the program itself, and the case law that has developed regarding parental duty under the program. Part II then proposes that the way in which a child’s Dividend is characterized influences what sort of parental duty (if any) attaches. In Part III, a reinterpretation of the Dividend as income rightly belonging to the child is offered as a compelling alternative to current doctrine. This Note concludes that the lax treatment of a child’s Dividend under current Alaska law is suspect, and argues that an income conception that imputes a higher degree of parental duty better advances the program’s aims...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{empirical}} research has established that dividend changes {{are associated with}} significant abnormal returns. This association is rationalized {{on the basis that}} the dividend announcement acts as a signal of future earnings. Another body of research has documented the existence of intra-industry transfers of information where news about one firm is extrapolated to other companies in the same industry. Earnings information transfers {{have been found to be}} positive in nature, with good news about one company leading to stock price increases for rival firms. Linking dividend signaling and information transfer, tests were constructed to ascertain whether the dividend change of one firm is associated with the stock price performance of other companies in the same industry. The results indicate there is some small positive information transfer. The magnitude of information transfer is related to the degree of the dividend surprise, the recent <b>dividend</b> <b>history</b> of the other companies, and correlations in stock returns between the dividend announcer and the other companies. Information transfer is found to affect earnings and earnings growth estimates of the other firms and this leads to revisions in their stock prices...|$|E
40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{incremental}} information content of cash flow over Profits and Previous Year 2 ̆ 7 s Dividends in explaining changes in cash dividends. The seminal study of dividend policy found the existing rate of dividends was the benchmark for declaring dividends, making {{the change in}} rate {{the focus of the}} decision. It was found that current net earnings the most highly correlated with dividend policy. This study looks at cash flow as a variable in the dividend-change model, considering different circumstances and different measures. The relationship is allowed to vary for increases versus decreases in cash, and also depending on the firm 2 ̆ 7 s recent <b>dividend</b> <b>history.</b> The appropriateness of a Cash Flow from Operations (CFOP) variable in the dividend model is examined, and compared with alternative measures. For firms with dividend increases a measure of sustainable funds represents a broader concept of liquidity than cash alone. For firms with dividend decreases, it is likely that cash beyond that from operations is considered before making a decision to decrease dividends. Thus, three measures of Cash-Availability (CA) are tested: CFOP, Net Current Operating Funds and Total Cash Flow before dividends (TCF). NCOF is an indication of those sustainable funds which may be considered as available cash before increasing dividends. TCF is intended to capture the 2 ̆ 7 extended 2 ̆ 7 definition of CA considered before decreasing dividends...|$|E
40|$|Why do firms pay dividends? If they didn’t their asset {{and capital}} {{structures}} would eventually become untenable as {{the earnings of}} successful firms outstrip their investment opportunities. Had they not paid dividends, the 25 largest long-standing 2002 dividend payers would have cash holdings of $ 1. 8 trillion (51 % of total assets), up from $ 160 billion (6 % of assets), and $ 1. 2 trillion in excess of their collective $ 600 billion in long-term debt. Their dividend payments prevented significant agency problems since the retention of earnings would have given managers command over an additional $ 1. 6 trillion without access to better investment opportunities and with no additional monitoring. This logic suggests that firms with relatively high amounts of earned equity (retained earnings) are especially likely to pay dividends. Consistent with this view, the fraction of publicly traded industrial firms that pays dividends is high when the ratio of earned equity to total equity (total assets) is high, and falls with declines in this ratio, becoming near zero when a firm {{has little or no}} earned equity. We observe a highly significant relation between the decision to pay dividends and the ratio of earned equity to total equity or total assets, controlling for firm size, profitability, growth, leverage, cash balances, and <b>dividend</b> <b>history.</b> In our regressions, earned equity has an economically more important impact than does profitability or growth. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that firms pay dividends to mitigate agency problems. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to provide}} a modern {{perspective}} {{on the role of}} dividends in smaller developed countries such as Ireland by examining views regarding the determinants of payout levels, the role of taxation and the relevance of conventional signalling theory. Design/methodology/approach – The study employs semi-structured interviews with the financial directors of 20 leading Irish companies. Findings – The results suggest support for the notion that dividend policy affects share valuations. However, views regarding this issue – and the role of taxation and signalling theory – vary markedly between quoted and unquoted firms as well as depending on firms' <b>dividend</b> <b>histories.</b> Research limitations/implications – The study suffers from the problem that in interview-based research the participants are necessarily a self-selecting group. Notwithstanding this point, the evidence suggests that the views of managers in a nation with a small, but highly developed, stock market are in line with those in countries with much larger exchanges. Further research could usefully extend the analysis and establish whether similar views exist in other countries with relatively small stock markets, but where the exchange is in an “emerging” rather than “developed” state. Originality/value – The contribution of the paper comes from the uniqueness of the Irish setting: the Irish market is relatively small but, unlike many similarly sized markets, it is highly-developed, with long-term historical links to the London Stock Exchange. The results, therefore, provide evidence {{about the extent to which}} earlier findings based on the world's largest developed markets also prevail in those that are more modestly sized.

40|$|Purpose –A growing {{strand of}} {{literature}} {{has focused on}} the returns performance of zero dividend stocks. This paper seeks to provide new evidence on the link between dividend payment and returns history and firms’ subsequent stock market performance. Design/methodology/approach - Prior research draws a distinction between those stocks which have never paid dividends and those which formerly paid dividends but subsequently ceased, implicitly using the latter as a measure of financial distress. The analysis is expanded beyond the role of payment history, and also the importance of earnings and past returns in the performance of UK zero-dividend stocks is considered. Findings -In contrast with the prior US evidence, it was found that payment history is not a significant determinant of returns, while past returns play a far greater role. However, this explanatory power seems to be diminishing over time. Research limitations/implications- The paper extends the existing knowledge about the behaviour of UK zero dividend stocks and establishes a benchmark for future research in the area. Practical implications- The prevalence of zero dividend stocks has grown over time. In the US, the proportion of listed companies paying dividends fell from 66. 5 per cent in 1978 to only 20. 8 per cent in 1999. In the UK, the proportion of companies omitting dividends rose to 25. 2 per cent in 1999, from previous recession-year high points of 16. 1 per cent in 1982 and 17. 9 per cent in 1992. This paper provides new evidence of practical value to investors in this class of stocks. Originality/value - The paper presents original {{research in the area of}} dividend policy and stock returns, which should be of interest to both academic and practitioner audiences. <b>Dividends,</b> <b>History,</b> Payments, Stock return...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{dividend}} paying firms {{has been on}} the decline since the popularity of stock repurchases in the 1980 s, and the recent financial crisis has brought about a wave of dividend reductions and omissions. This dissertation examined the U. S. firms and American Depository Receipts that are listed on the U. S. equity exchanges according to their <b>dividend</b> paying <b>history</b> in the previous twelve quarters. While accounting for {{the state of the economy}}, the firm’s size, profitability, earned equity, and growth opportunities, it determines whether or not the firm will pay a dividend in the next quarter. It also examined the likelihood of a dividend change. Further, returns of firms were examined according to their <b>dividend</b> paying <b>history</b> and the state of the economy using the Fama-French three-factor model. ^ Using forward, backward, and step-wise selection logistic regressions, the results show that firms with a history of regular and uninterrupted dividend payments are likely to continue to pay dividends, while firms that do not have a <b>history</b> of regular <b>dividend</b> payments are not likely to begin to pay dividends or continue to do so. The results of a set of generalized polytomous logistic regressions imply that dividend paying firms are more likely to reduce dividend payments during economic expansions, as opposed to recessions. Also the analysis of returns using the Fama-French three factor model reveals that dividend paying firms are earning significant abnormal positive returns. ^ As a special case, a similar analysis of dividend payment and dividend change was applied to American Depository Receipts that trade on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX exchanges and are issued by the Bank of New York Mellon. Returns of American Depository Receipts were examined using the Fama-French two-factor model for international firms. The results of the generalized polytomous logistic regression analyses indicate that dividend paying status and economic conditions are also important for dividend level change of American Depository Receipts, and Fama-French two-factor regressions alone do not adequately explain returns for these securities. ...|$|R
40|$|We study a Bayesian-Nash {{equilibrium}} {{model of}} insider trading in continuous time. The {{supply of the}} risky asset {{is assumed to be}} stochastic. This supply can be interpreted as noise from nonrational traders (noise traders). A rational informed investor (the insider) has private information on the growth rate of the dividend flow rewarded by the risky asset. She is risk averse and maximizes her inter-temporal utility rate over an infinite time-horizon. The market is cleared by a risk neutral market maker who sets the price of the risky asset competitively as the conditional present value of future dividends, given the information supplied by the <b>dividend</b> <b>history</b> and the cumulative order flow. Due to the presence of noise traders, the market demand does not fully reveal the insider's private information, which slowly becomes incorporated in prices. An interesting result of the paper is that a nonstandard linear filtering procedure gives an a priori form for the equilibrium strategy to be postulated. We show the existence of a stationary linear equilibrium where the insider acts strategically by taking advantage of the camouflage provided by the noise which affects the market maker's estimates on private information. In this equilibrium, we find that the insider's returns on the stock are uncorrelated over long periods of time. Finally, we show that the instantaneous variance of the price under asymmetric information lies between the instantaneous variance of the price under complete and incomplete information. The converse inequalities hold true for the unconditional variance of the price. Â© Springer-Verlag 2009...|$|E
40|$|Essay One: Can Firms Build Capital-Market Reputation to Substitute for Poor Investors Protection? Evidence from Dividend Policies The {{existing}} literature on law and finance generally assumes that firms are passive {{recipients of the}} influence of investor protections on their ability to raise external financing. In this paper, we empirically identify a commitment mechanism, i. e., dividend payouts, which firms use to compensate for country-level weak protection of shareholders and to establish capital market reputation so that they obtain better access to equity markets. We show that growth firms in countries where legal protection of outside investors is weak tend to initiate dividends early and pay a higher level of dividends both as compared to their counterparts in strong protection countries and as compared to mature firms in the same legal regime. As evidence of better access to equity markets, in weak protection countries, a good <b>dividend</b> <b>history</b> (i. e., three years of consistently high dividend payouts) allows growth and equity dependent firms in low protection countries to raise more equity financing. Essay Two: Stock Market Liberalization and Financial Constraints: Firm-level Evidence from Emerging Markets While the {{existing literature}} generally finds a positive effect of a country’s stock market liberalization on its economic growth, industry expansion and firm performance, little is known as to how the effect takes place, and the results are often plagued by endogeneity problem. In this paper, we empirically identify reducing a firm’s financial constraint is a channel through which market liberalization affects real activity. Using firm-level data from major emerging markets, we show firms that are investable by foreign investors are associated with lower cash flow sensitivity of cash, and the negative relation results from small firms, growth firms, and firms in countries with well developed financial systems. We also find this negative relation is weakened during recessions. Firm fixed effects models suggest the relation between stock market liberalization and decrease in financial constraint is causal rather than pure correlation...|$|E
