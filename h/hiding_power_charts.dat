Black earth from Vicoforte (Piedmont) exhibits good properties which are improved particularly when mixed with oil and egg. The lime technique improves the <b>hiding</b> <b>power,</b> even if the final colour becomes greyish, as well as when the pigment is mixed with animal glue.

30|$|Shen Kuo [36] {{explained}} {{that there were}} a number of methods to correct writing errors: (1) scrapping (which damages the paper); (2) glue a piece of paper over the writing (which has the disadvantage of potential detachment); (3) painting over with a white paint fen (粉) (which has the disadvantage of not having a high <b>hiding</b> <b>power</b> and multiple layers would be needed); (4) paint over with orpiment (which has the best <b>hiding</b> <b>power</b> and one layer would be sufficient). Finally he stated that this was the reason why ancients prefer qian huang (铅黄 or literally ‘lead yellow’) for painting over error. In the context, one would assume that this meant a lead white and orpiment mixture, but massicot is also commonly referred to as qian huang.|$|R
