5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is called}} Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake, {{named after the}} United States President {{who presided over the}} authorization and completion of the dam. Creation of the reservoir forced the relocation of over 3,000 people, including Native Americans whose ancestral lands were partially flooded. While the dam does not contain fish-ladders, neither does the next <b>down-stream</b> dam, Chief Joseph Dam. This means that no salmon ever reach the Grand Coulee Dam, rendering the possibility of added fish-ladders superfluous. Despite this, the second large dam <b>down-stream,</b> Rocky Reach Dam, does contains an intricate system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning. Being itself 473 miles upstream of the mouth of the Columbia River, there is currently no issue with salmon spawning that Grand Coulee or Chief Joseph dams are at fault for.|$|E

There are many pathways and they all are related to create a network. But how can every protein find the right way more fast than possible? How can it find the right <b>down-streaming</b> kinase in the cellular sea and not another very similar kinase? Every signal transduction pathway can be seen as two distincted processes: the signal must reach every kinase and then it must travel through the enzyme until its active site: quantum walks could be the answer to both the questions...|$|R

Having crossed the Dyle at this point, he left a detachment there, consisting of the sharpshooters of the Fusilier Battalion of the 8th Regiment and those of the 1st Battalion of the 30th Regiment, under Major Ditfurth, whom he directed to destroy the bridge immediately. He then detached the 2nd Battalion of the 30th Regiment and his two squadrons of the Kurmark Landwehr Cavalry, as a reinforcement to Zepelin at Wavre. With the remainder of his brigade, he then continued his march.|$|E

In combination with parity schemes, failures of single server nodes can be tolerated, so that such systems reach {{a certain degree of}} fault tolerance. In this paper such a distributed server system is analyzed. Data objects are stored in a data layout according to RAID level 3 among disk subsystems of different computers. An access control provides concurrent up- and <b>down-streaming</b> of data objects to/from the distributed storage system with ensured data consistency. This consistency control is described in combination with the handling of faulty server nodes and faulty clients. Furthermore, performance is measured with several access patterns. An application of that technique is for instance a distributed video server, allowing permanently updates without interrupting access...|$|R

40|$|Allergic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases such}} as food allergy, asthma, sinusitis and atopic dermatitis are increasing worldwide. This study {{examined the effects of}} aqueous extract of Mosla punctulata on mast cell-mediated allergic inflammation and studied the possible mechanism of action. Aqueous extract of Mosla punctulata inhibited compound 48 / 80 -induced systemic and immunoglobulin E-mediated local anaphylaxis and it also reduced intracellular calcium level and <b>down-streamed</b> histamine release from mast cells. In addition, aqueous extract of Mosla punctulata decreased gene expression and secretion of tumour necrosis factor alpha, an important proinflammatory cytokine, in mast cells. The inhibitory effect on tumour necrosis factor alpha expression was nuclear factor kappa B dependent. The results indicate that aqueous extract of Mosla punctulata inhibited mast cell-mediated allergic inflammatory reaction by suppressing histamine release and expression of tumour necrosis factor alpha, and involvement of calcium and nuclear factor kappa B in these effects. Hence it can be concluded that, the aqueous extract of Mosla punctulata might be a possible therapeutic candidate for allergic inflammatory disorders...|$|R
30|$|Transient {{elevations}} in cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration {{are believed}} to be involved in a multitude of physiological processes, including responses to abiotic stresses, hormones, and pathogens [21]. In the case of HA-treated seedlings, we found a significant increase of Ca 2 + influx in roots (Figure  4), as well as an enhanced expression of OsTPC 1 voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels (Figure  7) that was concomitant to an increased CDPK activity (Figure  6). In fact, it is known that Ca 2 + channels are known to contribute to short transient Ca 2 + influx in response to various stimuli, including chilling and microbial interaction [49]. Among the possible effects attributed to the cytosolic increase of Ca 2 + concentration and <b>down-streaming</b> signaling events, we may include a regulatory H+ efflux activity in the elongation/differentiation root zone. Indeed, H+-ATPase enzyme is stimulated by external anion concentrations [39, 40] and inhibited by Ca 2 + [27]. Hypothetically, during the plant cell cycle, transient cell expansion (growth phase) related to apoplastic proton efflux may be followed by its inhibition by the calcium influx. A cascade signalization of protein-kinase-mediated protein phosphorylation may result in cell and tissue morphogenesis (differentiation phase).|$|R

40|$|Examples of {{stratification}} {{from nine}} tropical upland lakes, two in Uganda and seven in Ethiopia, arc describccl. Strong thermal gradients were often developed from diurnal warm-ing in the 0 - 5 -m layer. In some productive lakes, these gradients frequently trapped photo-synthetic oxygen to folm well-defined maxima. They somctimcs also delimit deeper, oxygen-poor layers in some highly productive lakes. One lake showed nocturnal mixing with com-plete deoxygcnation, {{followed by a}} superficial restratification and pho,tosynthctic rcoxygena-tion by day. Dccpcr thermal gradients often determined the course of oxygen depletion at lower lcvcls, and in some lakes also dctcrmincd other aspects of chemical stratification, including the deep accumulation of Ca++ and HCO,- ions. Considerable variation of the stratification was fou~~cl in the Ethiopian Lake Awassa, both in time and horizontally over the lake basin, with some evidence that the dccpcr layer was formed by <b>down-streaming</b> from locally cooled margins. Comparison is made with other lakes at similar altitudes in equatorial Africa. Although seasonal changes arc inadequately known, the incidence of complete mixing probably varies from very frequent (polymictic lakes) to very infrcqucnt (oligomictic or meromictic lakes), and is dctcrmincd by both depth {{and shape of the}} lake basin...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorylation plays vital {{roles in}} the {{regulation}} of GPCRs functions. The apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) system {{is involved in the}} regulation of cardiovascular function and central control of body homeostasis. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry, we first identified phosphorylated serine residues in the C-terminus of APJ. To determine the role of phosphorylation sites in APJ mediated G protein-dependent and -independent signaling and function, we induced a mutation in the C-terminal serine residues and examined their effects on the interaction between APJ with G protein or GRK/β-arrestin and their <b>down-streaming</b> signaling. Mutation of serine 348 led to an elimination of both GRK and β-arrestin recruitment to APJ induced by apelin- 13. Moreover, APJ internalization and G protein-independent ERK signaling were also abolished by point mutation at serine 348. In contrast, this mutant at serine residues had no demonstrable impact on apelin- 13 induced G protein activation and its intracellular signaling. These findings suggest that mutation of serine 348 resulted in GRK/β-arrestin inactive. However there was no change in the active G protein thus APJ conformation was biased. These results provide important information on the molecular interplay and impact of the APJ function, which may be extrapolated to design novel drugs for cardiac hypertrophy based on this biased signal pathway...|$|R
40|$|Background: Due to its {{extensive}} {{arsenal of}} virulence factors and inherent resistance to antibiotics, Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{is a threat}} particularly in immunocompromised patients. Considering {{the central role of}} quorum sensing in the production of virulence factors, inhibition of bacterial communication mechanism constitute an opportunity to attenuate pathogenicity of bacteria resistant to available antibiotics. Our study aimed to assess the anti-quorum sensing activity of Anogeissus leiocarpus, traditionally used in Burkina Faso, for the treatment of infected burn wounds. Methods: Investigations were carried out on methanol extract from A. leiocarpus stem bark. The reporter strains Chromobacterium violaceum CV 026 and P. aeruginosa PAO 1 derivatives were used to evidence any interference with the bacterial quorum sensing and expression of related genes. P. aeruginosa PAO 1 was used to measure the impact on pyocyanin production. Results: At a sub-inhibitory concentration (100 µg/mL), A. leiocarpus methanol extract quenched the quorum sensing mechanism of P. aeruginosa PAO 1 by <b>down-streaming</b> the rhlR gene, with a subsequent reduction of pyocyanin production. Moreover, the antioxidant polyphenols evidenced are able to reduce the oxidative stress induced by pyocyanin. Conclusion: The antioxidant and anti-quorum sensing activities of A. leiocarpus stem bark could justify its traditional use in the treatment of infected burn wounds...|$|R

As a result, the microorganisms, process biochemistry, manufacturing, and <b>down-streaming</b> processing, as well as the bioactive metabolites released by the fermenting organisms and, above all, the healthy functions of these foods were extensively researched. The application and progress of biotechnology and biochemistry of traditional fermented food systems are different from each other, as the microorganisms and the food matrices vary widely.

40|$|As {{autonomous}} GPS waypoint tracking {{has been}} achieved for 50 cm 500 gram MAVs, this paper focuses on autonomous interaction with the world and higher level interaction with the operators. Image Analysis is performed on <b>down-streamed</b> images in order to es-timate altitude above ground, map the surroundings and detect targets of interest. Detected targets are collected, ordered by certainty and pre-sented to the user for validation. Furthermore information from all levels of sophistication ranging from flight level to mission level are merged in a single intelligence map allowing the operator to chose the level of inter-action. The resulting system enables extremely easy task definitions such as search this area for, determine the location of this visual target very pre-cisely identify target at this location. With no user intervention other than {{the launch of the}} vehicle this mission can be performed. However during tasks where the MAV has less certainty such as for instance during search missions, help of the operator is asked and user validation can speed up the search process or enhance the difficult maneuvers. As MAV become more and more important, the number of MAVs per operator has to be increased. In order to achieve this, mission-level communication greatly reduces the cognitive workload of the operator. Autonomous interaction with the world allow the MAVs to operate on them selves while asking operator input only when useful to improve the mission performance...|$|R
