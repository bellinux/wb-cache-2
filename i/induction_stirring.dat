Oxide film defects are generated in both processing methods. Oxide films formed during casting are a major type of defect observed in the microstructures of aluminium alloys products. It {{has been found that}} pouring of molten metal into a mould and <b>induction</b> <b>stirring</b> lead to different forms of oxide defects. Under <b>induction</b> <b>stirring,</b> such low-density entrained defects are found to be carried to near the surface of the liquid aluminium alloys and submerged surface oxide films become entangled. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the years}} {{numerous}} {{computational fluid dynamics}} models have been developed in order to study the fluid flow in gas and induction stirred ladles. These models are used to gain insight in the industrial processes used in ladle treatment of steel. A unified model of an induction stirred Ladle in two and three dimensions is presented. <b>Induction</b> <b>stirring</b> of molten steel is a coupled multi-physics phenomena involving electromagnetic and fluid flow. Models presented in this thesis gives a more accurate description of the real stirring conditions and flow pattern, by {{taking into account the}} multi-physics behavior of the <b>induction</b> <b>stirring</b> process in an induction stirred ladle. This thesis presents a formulation of coupled electromagnetic and fluid flow equations. The coupled electromagnetic and fluid flow equations are solved using the finite element method in two and three-dimensions. The simulation model is used to predict values of steel velocities and magnetic flux density. The simulation model is also used to predict the effect of increased current density on flow velocity. Magnetic flux density values obtained from the model are verified against experimental values.  QC 2012061...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} {{non-metallic}} inclusions {{is very important}} for the improvement of performance during the application of tool steel. This present study was performed to see the effect of changing of some process parameters during the vacuum degassing of the melt and how these changing parameters affects the characteristics of inclusions in tool steel. The main parameters that were changed during the vacuum degassing were the change of <b>induction</b> <b>stirring,</b> argon flow rate from both the plug 1 and 2 and different ladle ages for different heat. Electrolytic extraction method was used to observe the morphology and characteristics of inclusions as a 3 dimensional view in tool steel. Four lollipop samples from four different heats were used for the experiment and all the samples were after vacuum (AV) degassing. In this study four different types of inclusions were found and they are classified as type 1, 2, 3 and 4. Of them type 1 inclusion was the major one with mostly spherical shaped. This study shows that among the three parameters, <b>induction</b> <b>stirring</b> has the biggest effect for the total number of inclusions per volume in the sample than the other two parameters Heat 4 A showed the lowest number of inclusions per volume comparing with the other heats. The main reason behind this can be said that the <b>induction</b> <b>stirring</b> was the lowest comparing with the other heats with moderate argon flow and ladle age of 12. Extreme value analysis was used in this study to predict the probability of getting largest size inclusions in a certain volume of the metal. For the prediction of the largest inclusion size, both the electrolytic extraction (3 D) and cross-sectional (2 D) method was used. Later in this study comparison was done to determine the accuracy of both the methods and it is concluded that for the type 1 inclusions electrolytic extraction method shows almost similar trend with cross-sectional method and electrolytic extraction method shows better accuracy for the prediction of largest size inclusions than the cross-sectional method. Electrolytic Extraction method is also applicable for the prediction of largest size inclusions for multiple types of inclusions...|$|E

40|$|Fundamental {{issues related}} to the {{selection}} of a metallic fuel casting furnace design are presented and discussed including heating mechanisms, casting issues, crucible design, and {{issues related to}} the mass transport of americium. The process of evaluating all of these different criteria is undertaken to select a concept that would have the greatest chance of success for casting americium in a metallic fuel rod. Based on this evaluation process, a concept for the casting of metallic fuel pins containing high vapor pressure materials is selected and discussed. The important physics of this concept include mass transport of americium from the melt, <b>induction</b> heating and <b>stirring</b> of the melt, plus casting of long slender fuel rods.

40|$|The pseudo-spectral {{solution}} method {{offers a}} flexible and fast {{alternative to the}} more usual finite element/volume/difference methods, particularly when the long-time transient behaviour of a system is of interest. Since the exact solution is obtained at the grid collocation points superior accuracy can be achieved on modest grid resolution. Furthermore, the grid can be freely adapted with time and in space, to particular flow conditions or geometric variations. This is especially advantageous where strongly coupled, time-dependent, multi-physics solutions are investigated. Examples include metallurgical applications involving the interaction of electromagnetic fields and conducting liquids with a free sutface. The electromagnetic field then determines the instantaneous liquid volume shape and the liquid shape affects in turn the electromagnetic field. In AC applications a thin "skin effect" region results on the free surface that dominates grid requirements. Infinitesimally thin boundary cells can be introduced using Chebyshev polynomial expansions without detriment to the numerical accuracy. This paper presents a general methodology of the pseudo-spectral approach and outlines the solution procedures used. Several instructive example applications are given: the aluminium electrolysis MHD problem, <b>induction</b> melting and <b>stirring</b> and the dynamics of magnetically levitated droplets in AC and DC fields. Comparisons to available analytical solutions and to experimental measurements will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{cleanliness}} as {{a function}} of stirring practice during vacuum degassing treatment have been investigated in industrial studies at the steel plants of SSAB Special Steels in Oxelösund and Uddeholm AB in Hagfors. The cleanliness was examined with regards to the contents of sulphur, nitrogen and large inclusions (> 10 µm). The stirring practice during the vacuum degassing treatment has been studied with respect to time, namely by shortening the vacuum degassing treatment time from 24 to 15 minutes. Furthermore, the effect of the stirring intensity was studied by measuring the open eye zone using camera recordings. The focus has been to study the effect of a shortened vacuum degassing time as well as a controlled stirring intensity on the steel cleanliness. Moreover, study the effect of subsequent <b>induction</b> <b>stirring,</b> after vacuum degassing, on the amount of inclusions. By taking steel and slag samples taken before and after the vacuum degassing treatment, the different stirring practices could be investigated. It should be noted that all heats reached the desired composition regardless of the treatment time and stirring practice. The results from the trials at SSAB Special Steels showed that the stirring practice during vacuum degassing {{have an effect on the}} total number of inclusions. The strong argon stirring during vacuum degassing with visible open eyes resulted in an average increase of 400 % of the total amount of inclusions > 10 µm. However, no difference between a vacuum degassing time of 24 or 15 minutes was seen with respect to the increased amount of inclusions, denitrogenization or desulphurization. During the subsequent <b>induction</b> <b>stirring,</b> which was softer with no open eyes, the effect of the stirring practice was unclear due to overlapping confidence intervals. An average decrease of 65 % of the total amount of inclusions > 10 µm was seen for the heats  with non-overlapping confidence intervals. Based on these results it can be suggested that the use of a soft <b>induction</b> <b>stirring</b> after the vacuum degassing treatment as a possible process change to reach lower amounts of large inclusions. The stirring intensity during the vacuum degassing treatment was measured as the average ladle eye size during the trials at Uddeholm AB. This, due to that stronger stirring results in larger ladle eye zone. The results show that the amount of smaller inclusions ( 22. 4 μm). Moreover, the denitrogenization and desulphurization was not affected by the changed stirring intensity during vacuum degassing. It was also found that the average ladle eye size did not correlate to the logged average argon flow.   QC 20150522 </p...|$|E
40|$|Near-net shape casting of wrought {{aluminium}} alloys {{has proven to}} be difficult due to a tendency towards hot tearing during cooling. Rheocasting, or semi-solid metal (SSM) processing followed by high pressure die casting (HPDC), has recently been shown to be an effective alternative to conventional die casting, yielding near-net shape {{wrought aluminium}} alloy castings with less risk of hot tearing. This casting process involves pouring the liquid metal into a processing cup, which is then transferred into a coil for <b>induction</b> <b>stirring</b> and simultaneous forced air cooling. When the metal reaches the semi-solid casting temperature, the resultant slurry is transferred to a high pressure die casting machine and cast to near-net shape. This modifies the ascast microstructure, yielding a more globular primary phase and results in mechanical properties in the -T 6 condition closely approaching those of wrought material in the same condition. Little information is currently available on the response of SSM-HPDC material to welding. This project investigated the influence of autogenous laser and gas tungsten arc welding on the microstructure and mechanical properties of aluminium 7017 after rheocasting. It is possible to successfully weld this material without solidification or liquation cracking. The effect of welding on the rheocast microstructure in the heat-affected zone and weld metal was shown, and the hardness and tensile properties of the resulting joints in the as-welded condition were tested and related to the microstructures achieved...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} removal of {{inclusions}} in stirred ladles hasbeen studied. First, {{the importance of}} different growthmechanisms suggested in the literature were studied. Simulationresults from a fundamental model of an induction-stirred ladlehave been used as input in the calculations. Based on thegrowth calculations {{it was concluded that}} four of the growthmechanisms need not to be considered since they contribute solittle: i) diffusion of oxygen and aluminum to the inclusionsurface, ii) diffusion coalescence, iii) Brown motioncollision, and iv) laminar shear collision. The majorcontributor to inclusion growth is turbulent collision. Growthdue to Stoke's collisions is also somewhat important if largedifferences among inclusion sizes exist. Growth of inclusions in gas stirred ladles was studied usinga similar approach as the one for induction stirred ladles, butwith use of simulation results from a fundamental mathematicalmodel of a gas-stirred ladle. Similarly to what was found inthe case of <b>induction</b> <b>stirring,</b> it was found that turbulentcollisions and Stokes collisions appeared to be the majormechanisms for inclusion growth. The contribution of laminarshear collisions to growth was deemed negligible compared tothat of turbulent collisions. For the gas stirred ladle different removal mechanisms werealso studied, based on input data from a mathematical model ofa gas-stirred ladle. It was found that different modelssuggested to predict the inclusion removal due to bubbleflotation gave very different results. Also, all models assumeda spherical shape of the gas bubbles, which was found to beless realistic. Therefore, a new model for inclusion removal byspherical cap bubble flotation was developed. In the newcalculations, the most important mechanisms of inclusionremoval were found to be removal to the top slag and removal bybubble flotation, assuming spherical-cap bubbles and planecontact. When the bubbles were assumed to be spherical,resulting removal rates were lower than when they were assumedto be spherical caps. Based on these results it is concludedthat {{more research is needed to}} obtain a better understandingof the importance of bubble flotation on inclusion removal. Experiments are clearly needed to determine which modelconcepts produce predictions in best agreement withcorresponding data from actual steelmaking processes. NR 2014080...|$|E
