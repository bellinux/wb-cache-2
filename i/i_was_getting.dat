5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E

500|$|Upon retirement, Barkley {{was later}} quoted as stating, {{in regard to}} his career, [...] "I was fairly controversial, I guess, but I regret only one thing—the {{spitting}} incident. But you know what? It taught me a valuable lesson. It taught me that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> way too intense during the game. It let me know I wanted to win way too bad. I had to calm down. I wanted to win at all costs. Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game, I only thought about winning." ...|$|E
500|$|Drummer Mick Avory {{has offered}} an {{alternate}} {{explanation for the}} song's lyrics, claiming that [...] "Lola" [...] was partially inspired by Avory's frequenting of trans bars in west London. Avory said, [...] "We used to know this character called Michael McGrath. He used to hound the group a bit, because being called The Kinks did attract these sorts of people. He used {{to come down to}} Top of the Pops, and he was publicist for John Stephen's shop in Carnaby Street. He used to have this place in Earl's Court, and he used to invite me to all these drag queen acts and transsexual pubs. They were like secret clubs. And that's where Ray [...] got the idea for 'Lola'. When he was invited too, he wrote it while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> drunk".|$|E
500|$|Robinson also {{competed for}} the Michigan men's {{track and field}} team during his {{freshman}} year. In January 2010, Robinson told a reporter, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> recruited I always wanted to run track and play football. It helped me move faster on the football field." [...] Michigan track coach Fred LaPlante said Robinson {{had one of the}} 10 fastest 100-meter high-school times in the United States in 2009 and described Robinson the sprinter as [...] "one of the four or five best guys in the Big Ten." [...] LaPlante emphasized Robinson's [...] "quickness":"One thing in football that you don't see in track is quickness. He's incredibly quick and his lateral movement is unbelievable and his ability to go in one direction and get in another. The perception people have is that's speed. That's not speed, that's quickness." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1989, Hawke {{made his}} {{breakthrough}} appearance in Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society, playing {{one of the}} students taught by Robin Williams's inspirational English teacher. The Variety reviewer noted [...] "Hawke, as the painfully shy Todd, gives a haunting performance." [...] The film received considerable acclaim, winning the BAFTA Award for Best Film and an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. With revenue of US$235million worldwide, it remains Hawke's most commercially successful picture to date. Hawke later described the opportunities he was offered {{as a result of the}} film's success as critical to his decision to continue acting: [...] "I didn't want to be an actor and I went back to college. But then the [...] success was so monumental that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> offers to be in such interesting movies and be in such interesting places, and it seemed silly to pursue anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|Cher's final studio album for Geffen Records, Love Hurts (1991), {{stayed at}} {{number one in}} the UK for six weeks and {{produced}} the UK top-ten single [...] "Love and Understanding". The album was certified gold by the RIAA. In later years, Cher commented that her Geffen label [...] "hit years" [...] had been especially significant to her, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> to do songs that I really loved... songs that really represented me, and they were popular!" [...] She released the exercise book Forever Fit in 1991, followed by the 1992 fitness videos [...] and [...] She embarked on the Love Hurts Tour during 1992. That year, the UK-only compilation album [...] peaked at {{number one in the}} country for seven weeks. It features three new songs: [...] "Oh No Not My Baby", [...] "Whenever You're Near", and [...] "Many Rivers to Cross".|$|E
500|$|Lauren {{is portrayed}} by actress Ashley Fink. She made routine guest {{appearances}} throughout the first season, {{and became a}} member of the McKinley High glee club in the episode [...] "Special Education". Upon receiving the script in which Lauren joins the club, Fink initially reacted with disbelief. She commented, [...] "I didn't quite believe it at first, I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> Punk'd." [...] She said that being cast in Glee makes her feel like [...] "the luckiest girl in the world". Fink's favorite element of Glee is how series creator Ryan Murphy manages to take the underdogs and make them shine. She said, [...] "In life, there's so much diversity, and it's not necessarily represented on television. I think Glee is one of the few shows that actually displays the diversity and it’s just so inspirational." [...] When asked about her casting process, Fink said: ...|$|E

"Well," [...] said Miss Lucretia, [...] "as <b>I</b> said, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{very fond}} of the girl, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> willing to do my duty, {{whatever}} it may <b>be.</b> And <b>I</b> also wished to say, Mrs. Merrill, that I have thought about another matter very carefully. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> willing {{to provide for the}} girl. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> too old to live alone. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> too old, indeed, to do my work properly, as I used to do it.

500|$|Richard Elfman {{had never}} gone to film school when {{production}} started, and [...] "I didn't know what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> into." [...] The production, {{from its original}} 16mm roots to its finish, took three years. Cast and crew members would sleep on the film's stage, wearing spare gorilla suits to stay warm. Among the film's artistic influences included 1940s big band and jazz music and Max Fleischer cartoons of the 1930s (such as Betty Boop). Some of the film's cast {{was made up of}} non-professionals cast off the street. In one scene, Richard Elfman brought in a young man to mouth the words of [...] "Bim Bam Boom", but when he was put in front of the camera, he stood there as the scene was shot. Elfman left the scene in the film by editing in Bright's lips over the actor's face. Another scene featured homeless men.|$|E
500|$|Years later, {{reflecting}} on his tenure with the Royals, Affeldt said, [...] "I was pretty frustrated. I wanted to quit. I didn't {{want to go}} to the ballpark. I was just failing a lot. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> hurt. I didn't understand my role. I bounced around and I just didn't enjoy the game." [...] At the trade deadline on July 31, Affeldt was traded along with Denny Bautista to the Colorado Rockies for Ryan Shealy and Scott Dohmann. [...] Affeldt recalled, [...] "When [...] traded me, he said, 'I feel like I need to give you a fresh start. You can learn to enjoy the game again.' [...] I have a lot of respect for him now because he saw that. It was a move that had to be made for me to be able to continue playing baseball. I'm very thankful for it." ...|$|E
500|$|When he {{graduated}} from Alabama, Hutson did not plan on playing professionally, since the NFL was not highly regarded in the South compared to college football. But Green Bay Packers head coach Curly Lambeau saw Hutson as the perfect receiver for his passing attack, {{which at the time}} was headed by quarterback Arnie Herber and end John [...] "Blood" [...] McNally. Before the draft existed, college players could sign with any team they wanted, and while Hutson did sign a contract with Green Bay, he had also signed a contract with the NFL's Brooklyn Dodgers. Both contracts came to the NFL office at the same time, and NFL president Joseph Carr declared that Hutson would go to Green Bay, as the Green Bay contract had an earlier date of signing. Hutson later stated he chose the Packers because they offered the most money—$300 a game. [...] "That was far and above what they had ever paid a player," [...] said Hutson. [...] "Each week they'd give me a check for $150 from one bank and $150 from another so nobody would know how much <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> paid." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{his four}} years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one {{reporter}} described as [...] "a strange love-hate relationship" [...] with Coach Bo Schembechler. Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a [...] "tough coach", and it was [...] "not easy at all" [...] playing for him. Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: [...] "Butch {{can be a real}} load." [...] By the 1981 season, Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk, saying: [...] "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country." [...] Woolfolk, too, concluded in the end that Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept after me. He kept saying <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> too fancy. He kept saying, 'You're a big back, a fast back, and you ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|By 1962, Glock {{had persuaded}} the BBC {{management}} {{to increase the}} orchestra's budget to allow for joint principals in the string sections, to attract top musicians who could play in the BBC SO without having {{to give up their}} solo or chamber careers. The following season, he was able to engage joint principals for the wind section, including as Jack Brymer and Terence MacDonagh, formerly members of Beecham's celebrated [...] "Royal Family" [...] in the RPO. The problem remained that recruiting rank-and-file string players was difficult: although the BBC offered secure employment and a pension, it did not pay as well as its London rivals. After 1964, the BBC SO {{was the only one of}} the five London symphony orchestras that was not self-governed, and some musicians felt that the BBC SO's constitution as a body of salaried employees, with no say in the management or repertory of the orchestra, attracted an unadventurous type of player. A former member of the BBC SO said in 1979, I felt <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> too secure ... the BBC Symphony you can be a poor player, but if you're on time and never moan at the conductor … you'll have no trouble... I think the BBC Symphony lost some good young players because the management got their priorities wrong.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{widespread}} {{success has}} made it indispensable to the band's live setlists and has been performed over 640 times since 1991 making it the band's second most performed song behind [...] "Give it Away". Unlike several of the Chili Peppers' other songs, [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] is not interpreted in a different manner than {{what is on the}} record—aside from being played acoustically, the track is performed the same as it appears on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Kiedis is, however, notorious for being incapable of achieving several high notes in live performances; the vocalist has noted that he sometimes forgets or rearranges song lyrics in the verses. Therefore, the song has sometimes suffered from his limitations as a singer. After being released as a single in March 1992, the song would be included in virtually all concerts; Frusciante, however, began to resent the song's popularity and would play convoluted intros, purposefully throwing Kiedis off. An example of this was during a televised performance on the highly rated program Saturday Night Live on February 22, 1992. Kiedis said that it [...] "felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> stabbed in the back and hung out to dry in front of all of America while [...] was off in a corner in the shadow, playing some dissonant out-of-tune experiment." [...] The guitarist used a distortion pedal for the ending verse and screamed incomprehensibly into the microphone when providing backup vocals, neither of which were originally planned or typical of live performances. Nevertheless, sales of Blood Sugar Sex Magik skyrocketed following the show.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} this decline in her career, Mukerji lost weight and underwent a complete makeover. In 2009, she collaborated for the ninth time with Yash Raj Films on Dil Bole Hadippa!, a romantic comedy opposite Shahid Kapoor. Mukerji had high expectations from the film in which she played a cricket-obsessed Punjabi village girl masquerading as a man; it was hugely hyped before release and had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. The Economic Times critic Gaurav Malani was disappointed with the picture and wrote, [...] "Rani Mukherjee {{comes up with a}} spirited performance but her mock sob-whine-whimper do not amuse anymore. Also after a point you dislike visualizing the charming actress as the moustached male player." [...] The film was Mukerji's fourth economic failure in a row. When questioned about her recent spate of flops with the Yash Raj Films banner, she stated, [...] "An actor is here to act and pick great roles and scripts. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> great roles from Yash Raj at that point, roles that any actor would give an arm to do. I stand by those films regardless of their fate". Later that year, she featured as a talent judge for the Sony Entertainment Television reality show Dance Premier League. She said that appearing on television would make her [...] "more accessible" [...] to the audiences and help her [...] "gain visibility" [...] when she was [...] "not doing too many films". Mukerji did not make any screen appearances in 2010.|$|E
500|$|Welles said, [...] "the {{film was}} not {{intended}} as a lament for Falstaff, but {{for the death of}} Merrie England. Merrie England as a conception, a myth which has been very real to the English-speaking world, and is to some extent expressed in other countries of the Medieval epoch: the age of chivalry, of simplicity, of Maytime and all that. It is more than Falstaff who is dying. It's the old England dying and betrayed." [...] Many film theorists and Welles biographers have written about the recurrent theme of the [...] "Lost Eden" [...] in Welles's work and of characters who are nostalgic for an idealized past, which Welles called [...] "the central theme in Western culture." [...] Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that [...] "even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive of such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit." [...] Film scholar Beverle Houston argued that this nostalgia made Welles's depiction of Falstaff infantile and called his performance a [...] "ower baby...an eating, sucking, foetus-like creature." [...] Welles also called Falstaff [...] "the greatest conception of a good man, the most completely good man, in all of drama", and said that [...] "the closer I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> to Falstaff the less funny he seemed to me. When I played him before in the theater, he seemed more witty than comical. And in bringing him to the screen, I found him only occasionally, and only deliberately, a clown." ...|$|E
