500|$|On {{that first}} mission, Tibbets saw in {{real-time}} that his bombs were falling on innocent civilians. [...] At the time, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "People are getting killed down there that don't have any business getting killed. [...] Those are not soldiers." [...] But {{then he thought}} back to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor. [...] This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program {{and ended up in}} drug sales. [...] The reason why they had failed the program was because [...] "they had too much sympathy for their patients", which [...] "destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities". [...] It dawned on Tibbets that: ...|$|E
500|$|Jean became show runner of The Simpsons at {{the start}} of the third season (1991) {{together}} with Reiss. A show runner has the ultimate responsibility of all the processes that an episode goes through before completion, including the writing, the animation, the voice acting, and the music. When Jean began his tenure as show runner, the only thing <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> every day was [...] "Don't blow it and screw up this thing everyone loves." [...] The first episode Jean and Reiss ran was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] (aired September 19, 1991), and they felt a lot of pressure on them to make it good. They were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script in order to improve its humor. Jean said he [...] "kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough.'" [...] Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E
500|$|After Obama {{secured the}} nomination, Bayh {{endorsed}} the Senator from Illinois and was {{mentioned as a}} possible running mate. He was included on the initial shortlist, which was then whittled down to four names: Bayh, Senator Joe Biden of Delaware, Governor Tim Kaine of Virginia and Governor Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas. On August 22, the eve of Obama's scheduled unveiling of his running mate, NBC News reported that Bayh and Kaine had been informed {{that they were not}} chosen. Obama opted instead for Biden. Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe later wrote in his book The Audacity to Win, which was published in November 2009, that Bayh had been a [...] "coin toss" [...] away from becoming Obama's running mate. Plouffe and David Axelrod had interviewed the finalists and Plouffe said that Bayh's answers were [...] "substantively close to perfect, if cautiously so." [...] He recalled {{that at the time of}} the interview <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "there's no way this guy will color outside the lines... Bayh's up side and down side are probably the closest spread of the three", compared to Biden, who could [...] "reach higher heights but could cause us real pain." [...] As Obama approached a decision, he told Plouffe [...] "it's a coin toss now between Bayh and Biden, but Kaine is still a distinct possibility." [...] On August 17, Obama told Axelrod simply, [...] "I've decided. It's Biden." ...|$|E
60|$|He walked on, {{counting}} as regularly as <b>he</b> could, and <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that <b>he</b> {{never before}} realized how long fifteen minutes were.|$|R
6000|$|Pitt stooped {{and picked}} them up, amazed at so much wealth. [...] "Not that," [...] Rawdon said. [...] "I hope {{to put a}} bullet into the man whom that belongs to." [...] <b>He</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> {{it would be a}} fine revenge to wrap a ball in the note and kill Steyne with it.|$|R
60|$|That other love also, that squalid love of his, was {{in truth}} no vision--was a stern, palpable reality, very {{difficult}} to get rid of, and one which <b>he</b> often <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> would very probably swallow up that other love, and drive his sweet dream far away into utter darkness and dim chaotic space.|$|R
2500|$|One {{film that}} had a lasting {{impression}} on Panahi was Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948). Panahi has {{said that when he}} first saw this film <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "here is a film that does not lie to me." [...] At the same time Panahi began experimenting with photography and making short films with an 8mm film camera. He also acted in one film and assisted Kanoon's library director in running a program that taught children how to operate a film camera. Starting at the age of twelve, Panahi would work after school in order to afford to go see films. His impoverished childhood helped form his humanistic worldview that would later manifest itself in his films.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, before Beijing {{had been}} awarded the games, the city held a bidding process {{to select the}} best arena design. Multiple {{requirements}} including the ability for post-Olympics use, a retractable roof, and low maintenance costs, were required of each design. The entry list was narrowed to thirteen final designs. Of the final thirteen, Li Xinggang of China Architecture Design and Research Group (CADG), said after he placed {{the model of the}} [...] "nest" [...] proposal at the exhibition hall and saw the rival entries <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "We will win this." [...] The model was approved as the top design by a professional panel and later exhibited to the public. Once again, it was selected as the top design. The [...] "nest scheme" [...] design became official in April 2003.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{compared}} {{the words of}} [...] "God led the people about," [...] to a merchant who bought a cow for use in his home and not for slaughter. As the merchant's house was near the slaughterhouse, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> that he had better lead the new cow home by another route, for if he led the cow past the slaughterhouse and it saw the blood there, it might turn tail and flee. Similarly, as the inhabitants of Gaza, Ashkelon, and {{the land of the}} Philistines were ready to rise against the Israelites on their departure from Egypt, God thought that the Israelites must not see the battle, lest they return to Egypt, as God says in [...] "Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt." [...] So God led them by another route.|$|E
5000|$|To {{balance the}} record, Earl Wild {{acknowledged}} Hofmann’s style {{as the biggest}} influence on him gaining a fluid and flexible technique: ‘His interpretations were always delivered with great logic and beauty.’ Jorge Bolet {{is reported to have}} said that whenever he heard either Rachmaninoff or Hofmann, <b>he</b> always <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> ‘Every note that they play - that is what I would like to play.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, an' {{you are one}} of {{the biggest}} of them," [...] thought Fred Westly, but <b>he</b> kept his <b>thoughts</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> while Paul muttered {{something}} about being well protected, and having no occasion to be afraid.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{shall be}} five hundred," [...] said Mr. Grey, remembering that now had come {{the time for}} doing {{to one of the}} Carroll family the good things of which <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] "As Mr. Matterson is a clergyman of whom I have heard nothing but good, it shall be five hundred." [...] He had in truth heard nothing either good or bad {{respecting}} Mr. Matterson.|$|R
6000|$|Geoffrey, sipping his tea, smiled grimly {{behind the}} shelter of his cup. [...] "She does it uncommonly well," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I {{understand}} it," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "Mrs. Housekeeper is mad. Oh, dear, dear me--Bedlam is {{the only}} place for her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something has happened," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> Then {{he opened}} Mary's letter. It was dated Tuesday, that is, two days before, and ran: ...|$|E
60|$|Anne did not reply, being much {{exercised}} {{in trying to}} get her hand away from the one that imprisoned it; and whatever the miller <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> kept <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> because it disturbed his smoking to speak.|$|R
60|$|Walter {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that breakfast, eaten in the dark, was a very inferior meal to dinner before a great fire. However, <b>he</b> kept his <b>thoughts</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> and, as soon as he had finished, went to aid Larry in saddling the horses.|$|R
60|$|That evening Bridge {{sat for a}} {{long time}} scrutinizing Billy through half-closed lids, and often he found his eyes {{wandering}} to the red ring about the other's wrist; but whatever may have been within his <b>thoughts</b> <b>he</b> kept <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh {{that the}} black raven were here to help me!' <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> And in a moment the black raven was perched on his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|When the squire saw this, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> 'The horses {{will come}} {{the same way}} if I don't open the door,' so he did this.|$|E
6000|$|... "This fellow is shamming dead," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> {{and lifted}} his gun, for in those times we {{could not afford to}} nurse sick Kaffirs.|$|E
60|$|Therefore Francis Hammond {{had never}} <b>thought</b> of taking <b>to</b> the {{profession}} of arms in his own country; though, when the news arrived in Venice of desperate fighting at sea with the Genoese, <b>he</b> had <b>thought,</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> that the most glorious thing in life must be to command a well-manned galley, as she advanced to the encounter of an enemy superior in numbers. He had never dreamed that such an aspiration could ever be satisfied--it was merely one of the fancies in which lads so often indulge.|$|R
5000|$|However, as {{his second}} wife Cosima Wagner later {{reported}} on 22 April 1879, this account had been colored by {{a certain amount of}} poetic licence: Richard today recalled the impression which inspired his [...] "Good Friday Music"; he laughs, saying <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "In fact it is all as far-fetched as my love affairs, for it was not a Good Friday at all - just a pleasant mood in Nature which made me think, 'This is how a Good Friday ought to be'".|$|R
6000|$|Up to this, Barry {{had hardly}} listened {{to what the}} doctor had been saying; {{but now he was}} all attention. [...] "So that is to be his price," [...] <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "he'll cost me dear, but I suppose he must have it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If she REALLY could pledge herself,' <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> with passionate insistence {{but hardly}} any hope. Yet a curious little irresponsible {{laughter}} {{appeared in his}} heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll show Andrew that I {{mean to be}} on time," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> as {{he turned}} into the street upon which the stable was situated.|$|E
60|$|The signal officer nodded, {{and drank}} the liquor. As he smacked his lips while going on deck, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> these nabobs drink famous good wine.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{was also}} a regular guest on various talk shows, {{including}} The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and Late Night with David Letterman, on which he appeared 50 times. Letterman, who knew Williams for nearly 40 years, recalls seeing him first perform as a new comedian at the Comedy Store in Hollywood, where Letterman and other comedians had already been doing stand-up. [...] "He came in like a hurricane," [...] said Letterman, who said <b>he</b> then <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "Holy crap, there goes my chance in show business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{certainly}} didn't {{write to}} you; but I came here to-day {{expecting to see}} you, and meaning {{to ask you to}} be my wife. I learned from my brother ("there can be no falsehood in putting it that way," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> vainly <b>to</b> <b>himself)</b> that you were to be here; and I determined to seize the opportunity. Ernest meant to have come, too, but I believe he must have lost the train at Clapham Junction." [...] That was all literally true, and yet it sounded simple and plausible enough.|$|R
500|$|Next, Hopkins and Fats {{played against}} Mosconi and Mizerak in doubles seven-ball, then nine-ball. Wanderone and Mosconi {{ultimately}} played a one-on-one game of seven-ball; Wanderone won the match. During the exhibition, {{a very quiet}} and genteel Mosconi blocked Wanderone's rough-and-tumble banter by wearing ear plugs; yet that failed to stop Wanderone from putting on a show for his fans. In an interview, Wanderone was asked about his strategy to defeat Mosconi, and replied that <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "I'll make [...] on the break and end it... then I'll help carry Willie out on a stretcher." ...|$|R
6000|$|The priest {{signed to}} her quietly {{to return to}} the stool. [...] "I never {{suspected}} the child had so much spirit in her," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lieutenant D'Hubert {{could not}} be {{altogether}} unsympathetic toward that sentiment. This little fellow is a lunatic, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> {{but there is something}} in what he says.|$|E
6000|$|... "See {{the work}} of Hokosa," [...] <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] "Moses set up a serpent to save the people; yonder wizard sets up one to destroy them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing. Only {{sometimes}} {{it seems to me}} as if he hadn't read because he loved it, but because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it due <b>to</b> <b>himself.</b> But maybe I'm mistaken. I could imagine a delicate poem shutting up half its sweetness from his cold, cold scrutiny,--if you will excuse the floweriness of the idea." ...|$|R
60|$|Aynsley {{saw that}} she was on her guard. Girls, he understood, often had a {{partiality}} for mailboat officers who were generally men of prepossessing appearance and manners. However, <b>he</b> kept his <b>thoughts</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> for <b>he</b> was usually diffident with Ruth. Although he had long admired her, he knew that he would not gain anything by an attempt to press his suit.|$|R
6000|$|Undy {{turned it}} in his hand as though the {{proposed}} task were singularly disagreeable <b>to</b> him. Why, <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>to</b> <b>himself,</b> should he be thus browbeaten by a dirty old Newgate lawyer? Why not pluck up his courage, and, at any rate, show that he was a man? 'No,' said he, 'I will not read it.' ...|$|R
