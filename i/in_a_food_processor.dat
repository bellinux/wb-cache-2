40|$|Photolithography is a {{technique}} used to deposit metals onto substrates in specific patterns. The process uses light to transfer geometric patterns onto a light sensitive photoresist {{on the surface of}} a substrate. We have built a low-cost, maskless photolithography system assembled from a computer, a consumer projector, and a microscope. The photoresist is spun <b>in</b> <b>a</b> modified <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> and baked on a standard hot plate. Exposing the photoresist only takes a few minutes and allows for multiple runs on the same substrate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> short amount of time. Through multiple exposures, we can make features ranging from approximately 1 μm to 785 μm, which is especially useful when making contacts using the large features. The goal for this photolithography system is to make small electrical leads to study graphene, a two-dimensional material...|$|R

40|$|Lithographic {{processing}} {{has been}} the key technology responsible for the rapid advances in microelectronics, but is typically not accessible to undergraduates. We have developed a maskless photolithographic system that can be assembled from a consumer projector and a trinocular microscope. This system allows students to design and print custom patterns into photoresist in less than 30 min, without using a clean room, a mask facility, or a chrome-etch bath. Students can create and evaluate patterns, make changes to their design, or add additional layers of aligned patterns <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single laboratory session. The rapid turnaround time and low cost of ownership is useful for low-resolution (∼ 10 [*]μm) prototyping. Photoresist is spun <b>in</b> <b>a</b> modified <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> and baked on a standard hot plate. Mating pieces were machined from aluminum. Only the {{digital light processing projector}} and <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> are modified, so the microscope, camera, and computer need not be dedicated to the system.

30|$|Crambe seeds, both {{wild type}} and high erucic, were grinded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> to obtain <b>a</b> powder. The powder (25  g) was mixed with 150  ml heptane in Erlenmeyer flask and stirred by {{magnetic}} stirrer (600  rpm) {{at room temperature}} for about 20  h. The mixture was vacuum filtered by use of Schott filter (No. 3). The filter cake was washed with pure heptane and dry Na 2 SO 4 was added to the combined heptane phases to remove possible traces of water. The salt was removed by filtration using cotton as <b>a</b> filter <b>in</b> <b>a</b> regular funnel. The salt was washed with pure heptane and filtrated again. All heptane fractions were collected. Heptane was evaporated by use of a vacuum rotary evaporator (Heidolph, W 60) at room temperature, the cooling water temperature was kept at 5  °C. The obtained yields were 26  % for wild type Crambe oil and 29  % for high erucic Crambe oil.|$|R
2500|$|Caster (or castor) (0.35mm), a {{very fine}} sugar in Britain and other Commonwealth countries, so-named because the grains are {{small enough to fit}} through a castor which is small vessel with a {{perforated}} top, from which to sprinkle sugar at table.

5000|$|The cake has a {{reputation}} as being difficult to make, but this is no longer as true as it once was. When the recipe originated, there were no stand mixers, nor electric hand mixers, and even hand-crank eggbeaters were not universally available, which meant a lot of hard labor beating egg whites to frothy soft peaks. The wood-fired ovens of the time had no thermostats, making it difficult to produce a white cake. The pecans, raisins and coconut had to be chopped by hand or, more often, put through a meat grinder. [...] The filling ingredients can be chopped <b>in</b> <b>an</b> electric <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> today. Modern refrigeration also makes it easier to produce a stiff filling, allowing one to build an orderly multi-layer cake, rather than a sticky, lopsided dessert. Even with modern conveniences, making a traditional Lane cake is still quite a task to undertake. It is still a special cake, best made several days <b>in</b> advance of <b>an</b> important family event, so the flavors have time to mingle. During the war, Lane cakes were a favorite among service men lucky enough to receive one for Christmas. By the time the cake arrived overseas, the spirits, raisins and cake had fermented into a special delight. Many southern families have stories of [...] "the best cake ever tasted".|$|R
30|$|Fresh {{flying fish}} (Cypselurus poecilopterus) kept in ice at retail stores was {{obtained}} from a local seafood market in Hengchun Township, Pingtung County, Taiwan. The fish wrapped in aseptic bags was placed in ice, and transported to the laboratory immediately. The white muscle in dorsal parts of the flying fish was aseptically cut <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vertical laminar flow hood. After the white muscle of flying fish was washed with ethanol–acetone (1 : 1, v/v) to kill the microflora {{on the surface of}} fish muscle and rinsed with sterile water to avoid the ethanol–acetone residue (Tsai et al. 2005 a), it was placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sterile <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> ground to mince, and mixed with diluted culture suspension of S. xylosus by blending at low speed to prepare a contamination level of 1  ×  105 CFU/g for studies. The inoculated samples were then aseptically transferred to sterile polyethylene bags (30  g/bag) and stored at - 20, 4, 15, 25, and 35 °C. Growth of S. xylosus and formation of TVBN and histamine were monitored at 6, 12, 24, and 48  h for samples stored at 25 and 35 °C. For samples stored at 4 and 15 °C, analyses were performed every 24  h for 4 d. Fish samples that were stored at − 20 °C were analyzed for bacterial loads at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8  weeks. All analyses were conducted in triplicate for each sampling time. Results were reported as means of triplicate determinations.|$|R
40|$|The total soluble {{solids content}} (TSSC) shows high {{positive}} correlation with sugars content, and therefore is generally accepted {{as an important}} quality trait of fruits. In melon, this evaluation is usually done by grinding {{a slice of the}} fruit's pulp <b>in</b> <b>a</b> household <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> straining the ground material and then proceeding the TSSC determination in the resulting juice. This evaluation is labor-intensive and {{takes a long time to}} complete. An alternative process was delineated for obtaining the juice: the pulp of the fruit slice would be transversally cut one or more times, and longitudinally pressed by hand to obtain the juice. The objective of this work was to compare processes for obtaining juice to evaluate TSSC in melons. Fifty, 15, and 15 fruits of the Galia, Yellow, and Cantaloupe type melons were evaluated, respectively. Each fruit was considered as a block, and was longitudinally split into six fractions with similar sizes, which corresponded to the plots. The following treatments were evaluated: fraction without cuts, fractions with one, three, five, or seven transversal cuts, and the fraction treated by the conventional process. It was concluded that the procedure by which the melon slices of Galia, Yellow and Cantaloupe types are pressed for obtaining the juice to evaluate TSSC can overestimate this content. This would probably be due to the fact that the most internal section of the mesocarp presents greater TSSC than the portions closer to the epicarp...|$|R
5000|$|Caster sugar (also {{referred}} to as superfine or baker's sugar) has a larger particle size than powdered sugar, approximately half that of granulated sugar. It is commonly used in baking and cold mixed drinks because it dissolves faster than granulated white sugar.

40|$|A typical {{computer}} user {{deals with}} a large variety of documents, such as text files, spreadsheets, and web pages. The applications for constructing and modifying these documents are called editors (e. g. text editors, spreadsheet applications, and HTML editors). Despite the apparent differences between editors, the core editing behavior, whether performed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> word-processor or a spreadsheet, is largely similar: document fragments may be copied and pasted, and new parts of the document may be constructed by selecting from menus or entering text. Proxima is a generic editor suitable for {{a large number of}} document types. Similar to the way <b>in</b> which <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> can replace several different appliances, a generic editor can replace several different editors. A generic editor offers a number of advantages. For instance, instead of having lots of specialized editors, there is only a single application with a uniform user interface. But the most important advantage is that building an editor for a new document type requires {{only a fraction of the}} effort compared to conventional methods. This is especially useful for building editors for XML documents. In spite of the advantages, generic editors are not in widespread use. Existing editors often only allow a user to edit the internal structure of the document, which is experienced as restrictive. More user friendly are presentation-oriented editors, which allow the presentation of the document on the screen to be directly manipulated. However, these editors are only applicable to a limited class of (mainly textual) document types. In contrast, Proxima offers presentation-oriented editing on complex graphical presentations, which may contain derived values. An important aspect of Proxima is its layered architecture. The problem of offering presentation-oriented editing behavior is thereby split up in several simpler subproblems. The thesis describes the design and the architecture of Proxima, and contains a formal specification of the editor. A prototype of Proxima has been implemented in the functional language Haskell. Although the prototype is still <b>in</b> <b>a</b> preliminary state, it is already straightforward to instantiate editors for complex documents. The resulting editors are powerful, yet easy to use...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} three cheese powder matrix reference materials (IRMM- 359 a-c) and their certification for testing of the presence/absence of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin A (SEA). Raw milk cheese was decrusted, cut into cubes, chopped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> kitchen-type <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> for <b>a</b> short time, freeze-dried, cryogenically milled, and mixed (blank material IRMM- 359 a). Moreover, a second portion of raw milk cheese was decrusted and cut into cubes. After addition of water and spiking with a solution of SEA, the sample was homogenised using a high-speed grinder (Ultra-Turrax). The cheese slurry was freeze-dried, cryogenically milled and mixed with blank cheese powder to obtain the two SEA-containing materials at SEA target levels of 0. 1 and 0. 25 ng/g cheese, respectively (IRMM- 359 b, IRMM- 359 c). Between unit-homogeneity was quantified and stability during dispatch and storage were assessed in accordance with ISO Guide 35 : 2006. The minimum sample intake is 15. 1 g cheese powder (representing 25 g of cheese after reconstitution) per replicate analysis (n= 5), as stipulated in Commission Regulation 1441 / 2007, and therefore no dedicated study on the minimum sample intake was performed. The reference material was characterised <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interlaboratory comparison of laboratories of demonstrated competence and adhering to ISO/IEC 17025 and using the European Screening Method with the VIDAS SET 2 and the Ridascreen SET Total for detection (further on named ESM/VIDAS and ESM/Ridascreen, respectively) [4]. Technically invalid results were removed, but no outlier was eliminated on statistical grounds only. Certified values are reported as probability of detection and expressed as either diagnostic specificity (ratio of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives) for the blank material, or diagnostic sensitivity (ration of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives) for the SEA-containing materials. Uncertainties for homogeneity and stability were estimated, but not used for an uncertainty budget {{due to the nature}} of the certified values (presence/absence certification). Instead, the certified values are expressed as intervals with a 95 % level of confidence. The preparation and processing of the material, homogeneity and stability studies, and the characterisation are described hereafter and the results are discussed. JRC.

5000|$|Burmese tofu (တိုဖူး; [...] or [...] ) is a food of Shan origin, {{made from}} water and flour ground from yellow split peas and the Burmese version of {{chickpea}} flour, {{also known as}} besan flour, in a fashion similar to polenta. The flour is mixed with water, turmeric, and a little salt and heated, stirring constantly, until it reaches a creamy consistency. It is then transferred into a tray and allowed to set. It can also be made using dried chickpea instead of processed flour. In this process, dried chickpeas are soaked overnight. Once the peas have been re-hydrated, they are pureed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> {{with some of the}} liquid used to soak the peas, then allowed to set for a couple of hours. Much of the top layer of clear liquid is then skimmed off and the remaining puree is brought to a boil with turmeric and salt and cooked and set {{in the same manner as}} the version using chickpea flour. It is matte yellow in colour, jelly-like but firm in consistency, and does not crumble when cut or sliced. It may be eaten fresh as a salad or deep fried.
