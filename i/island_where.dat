5|$|In this {{flat and}} marshy area, the {{branches}} and roots of mangrove trees form dams where deposits of oyster shells naturally accumulate along with mud and plant detritus. These tangles help retain soil, {{a process which}} expands the <b>island</b> <b>where</b> the power of tidal race would normally have the opposite effect.|$|E

5|$|Known to Māori as tī kōuka, {{the tree}} {{was used as a}} source of food, {{particularly}} in the South <b>Island,</b> <b>where</b> it was cultivated in areas where other crops would not grow. It provided durable fibre for textiles, anchor ropes, fishing lines, baskets, waterproof rain capes and cloaks, and sandals. Hardy and fast growing, C.australis is widely planted in New Zealand gardens, parks and streets, and numerous cultivars are available. The tree can also be found in large numbers in island restoration projects such as Tiritiri Matangi <b>Island,</b> <b>where</b> it was among the first seedling trees to be planted.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in November 1895, {{artist and}} author Alfred Lambourne {{spent a year}} living on the remote Gunnison <b>Island,</b> <b>where</b> {{he wrote a book}} of musing and poetry, Our Inland Sea. From November 1895 to March 1896, he was alone. In March, a few guano sifters arrived to harvest and sell the guano of the nesting birds as fertilizer. Lambourne {{included}} musings about these guano sifters in his work. Lambourne left the island early in the winter of 1896 along with the first group of guano sifters.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{plentiful}} {{in the waters}} surrounding the <b>island,</b> <b>where</b> one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.|$|E

5|$|If {{the police}} {{identified}} Bostic {{even before the}} shooting occurred, he would have faced a two-year prison sentence for violating the terms of his parole, since he was out past his curfew. After the shooting, police discovered the BMW had been stolen from the Five Towns Mitsubishi car dealership in Inwood, Long <b>Island,</b> <b>where</b> Bostic worked as a salesman. A motor vehicle theft or gun possession conviction would have been Bostic's third felony, likely resulting in a lengthy prison sentence.|$|E

5|$|In April 1945, {{after months}} of {{lobbying}} by Potts—who was keen {{to get back into}} action himself after having been relieved of his previous command during the Kokoda campaign—the 7th Battalion was transferred to Torokina on Bougainville <b>Island,</b> <b>where</b> the Japanese garrison was still holding out. In June they moved up the Numa Numa Trail to Pearl Ridge in the central sector of the <b>island</b> <b>where</b> they relieved the 27th Battalion. Almost immediately they began aggressive patrols in order to dominate the Japanese in their area of operations and were tasked with the capture of several key positions including Wearne's Hill, Base Point 3, Tokua and Sisivie and to establish a forward position in the Wakunai Valley. Over {{the course of the next}} three months until the end of the war, the battalion captured 25 positions and killed around 200 Japanese soldiers.|$|E

5|$|In October 1915 {{pack ice}} in the Weddell Sea had sunk Endurance, leaving Shackleton and his companions adrift on a {{precarious}} ice surface. Throughout the duration of their survival, the group drifted northward until April 1916, when the floe on which they had encamped broke up. They then made their way in the ship's lifeboats to Elephant <b>Island,</b> <b>where</b> Shackleton decided that {{the most effective means}} of obtaining rescue would be to sail one of the lifeboats to South Georgia.|$|E

5|$|Ophelia moved {{extremely}} {{slowly in}} and around North Carolina, causing the storm to drop more than 10inches (254mm) of rain on many coastal areas. The highest amount measured was from Oak <b>Island,</b> <b>where</b> 17.5inches (445mm) was registered. In addition, storm surges of 7–12feet (2–4m) were recorded, particularly in low-lying inlets of Pamlico Sound. At the storm's peak, over 240,000 customers were without power in coastal North Carolina. One indirect fatality was reported due to a traffic accident related to Ophelia, although no direct deaths were recorded.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestor}} of Noronhomys {{may have been}} a semiaquatic animal, similar to living Holochilus or Lundomys, that arrived on Fernando de Noronha by chance on a floating log. The morphology of the limb bones in Noronhomys suggests that the animal was not semiaquatic like its relatives, but terrestrial, consistent with its occurrence on a small <b>island,</b> <b>where</b> streams and pools are rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} produced waves up to 3ft (0.9m) around Anna Maria <b>Island,</b> <b>where</b> {{two people}} died of fatigue-related heart attacks after {{being caught in}} a rip current. Heavy rainfall in the New Orleans, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama areas—aided by instability from {{the remnants of the}} depression—flooded streets, inundating an apartment complex in the former city and cutting power to 1,921 customers in the latter city. Forty homes and businesses were flooded in Avoyelles Parish. Rainfall accumulations peaked south of Natchez, Mississippi, where 13.9in (353mm) was documented.|$|E
