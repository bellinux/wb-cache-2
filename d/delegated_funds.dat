30|$|In {{the context}} of the Peatlands fire risk {{management}} project, social scientists worked to better understand the institutional context for fire management at district and provincial levels. This included an investigation of the current fire early warning system and practices, the roles of government agencies and local communities, and the availability of alternatives to fire use for land clearing, through district- and provincial-level interviews and community meetings. Through this research, it was determined that decisions about the fire management system used by farming households and community plantations are primarily made at the provincial level, with their implementation (and <b>funding)</b> <b>delegated</b> to the district and village levels. The clarity of roles and responsibilities mean that {{a relatively small number of}} key staff at the provincial level needed to be convinced of the utility of seasonal fire risk information. This is one of the factors that facilitated government action and enabled the development of provincial level fire use policy that was guided by the fire early warning tool.|$|R

40|$|IMF {{conditionality}} is controversial, and assessments reflect {{assumptions about}} the degree of delegation the organization enjoys from its member countries. We use a dataset drawn from the IMF’s records of conditionality to test two models of the design of conditionality: a public-choice and an informal governance model. Public-choice critics argue that the Fund is an out-of-control agency that seeks to maximize its importance by imposing {{the highest levels of}} conditionality the market will bear. To the contrary, we find that the Fund has refrained from exploiting the vulnerability of particular countries to maximize the scope of conditionality. Alternatively, critics of major-power influence in the IMF claim that conditionality reflects the interests of the major shareholders rather than the needs of borrowing countries. We find evidence of U. S. influence, which operates to constrain conditionality, but only in vulnerable countries that are important recipients of U. S. aid. In ordinary countries under ordinary circumstances, broad authority is <b>delegated</b> to the <b>Fund,</b> which adjusts conditionality to accommodate local circumstances and domestic political opposition...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} how {{the interaction}} between social institutions {{on the one hand}} and actors' strategies and interests on the other hand is shaping European integration in research policy. We specifically focus on the implications of the existence of different conceptions of European integration (logics) on the emerging landscape of research funding programs jointly managed by the European Union (EU) and National States (joint programs). Our results display the central role of the introduction of a logic of coordination by the EU; it created a breeding ground for a new generation of programs and, at the same time, allowed to make the integration model more flexible and acceptable to National States (as funding became only virtually integrated). Most newly created programs were characterized by largely symbolic commitments and very small budgets, while stronger commitments had to be constructed through successive steps of integration. This process was highly selective and dependent on the presence of strong interests from the research community; additional funding from the EU was critical to ensure stability of national commitments. Further, National States by large <b>delegated</b> to independent <b>funding</b> agencies the management of national participations: delegation allowed to achieve greater homogeneity among national participants, but also to decouple decisions to participate (driven by compliance to institutional pressures) from the level of resources to be committed (driven by national interests). While in the year 2000, the European Research Area (ERA) strategy of coordinating national research policies was largely an empty concept, our case study shows how in the following decade, it was filled in with specific experiences and practices, led to the redefinition of actors' understanding of European integration and roles in European research policies and, ultimately, to the emergence of original models of integration...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, I explore {{the problem of}} optimal {{contracting}} under delegation of information acquisition. I study a model where equity-holders of a <b>fund</b> <b>delegate</b> their portfolio allocation to a fund manager in an environment where: i) the expected return of the implemented portfolio depends on the ex-ante unknown future price of an asset, ii) the manager can acquire costly information about the future price, and iii) information acquisition is unobservable and unverifiable. I characterize the optimal contract which incentivizes the manager to obtain information and take the profit-maximizing position based on the available information. I show that the optimal contract implies a premium for positions against the publicly available information: a long position when an asset is considered overvalued, and vice versa. This premium leads the manager to adopt contrarian positions more often than the first best. I argue that this ‘bias against the flow’ is supported by empirical evidence. In the second chapter, I explore the impact of Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) on capital markets. I argue that the source for potential inefficiencies arising from CRAs might be more pathological than the literature recognizes; {{even in the absence}} of conflicts of interest or other distortions resulting from players’ behavior, a CRA might have an adverse effect on critical economics variables. I develop a model of investment financing which, similarly to capital markets, is characterized by information asymmetry and lack of commitment. In the benchmark setting, the CRA is capable of perfect monitoring and reveals its private information truthfully and without cost. I explore the impact of such an “ideal” CRA on the interest rate and the probabilities of project financing and default. I find that introducing such a CRA may lead to under-financing of projects with a positive net present value (NPV) that would otherwise be financed; a higher expected interest rate; and a higher expected probability of default. These findings relate to the feedback effect, which is inherent in capital markets, and its asymmetric impact on firms of different quality. I evaluate the policy of restricting CRAs to provide hard evidence with their ratings, and suggest that it might have an unfavorable effect on the probabilities of project financing and default. In the third chapter, I explore the problem of security design with endogenous implementation choice. I study an economy where an entrepreneur raises capital to finance an investment project. My focus is on an environment where the entrepreneur shares the same characteristics as the representative entrepreneur in crowdfunding platforms: i) there is no record regarding her ability, ii) she might be associated with a negative-NPV project, and iii) she has limited liability. Asymmetric information regarding the entrepreneur’s ability between the entrepreneur and potential investors gives rise to a signaling game when the former issues securities to raise capital. I characterize the optimal security, and show that it is always optimal to reward the non-implementation of the project after financing takes place. I show that compared to a case where the entrepreneur is obliged to implement the project after raising capital, endogenizing the project implementation choice: i) prevents market breakdown, ii) leads to a more efficient allocation of resources, and iii) strengthens the incentive of an entrepreneur to invest in her productivity...|$|R
40|$|Improvement' {{has been}} the focus in {{extensive}} studies of agricultural change. The term has been frequently used to emphasise productivity and efficiency. In the early decades of this study period 1800 - 1920, the contributory processes were portrayed as strongly reflecting the influence of landowners of high status. From the mid-nineteenth century, changes were progressively effected by market conditions, migration from the countryside and the application of science, technology and innovative husbandry. The more specialised and market orientated systems that evolved, created a need for new skills in farmers and workers to successfully apply improvements in practice. Knowledge, understanding, the capacity to make informed decisions, and the ability to interact with a new order of professionals, were necessary for successful adjustment. The development of a more responsive and accessible approach to education was crucial to competitiveness in a period of specialisation in farming systems and the greater globalisation of trade. This research is focussed on Cumbria as a case study, set in the context of Northern England, subject to wider national and international influences. Key European states and the New World provide a wider setting for comparison and interaction. Cumbria as a relatively remote pastoral area was perceived by some observers as an unlikely setting for leadership in improved agriculture. Paradoxically {{at the end of the}} study period, its high reputation for progressive livestock husbandry and breeding suggests that improvement had been significant. The study argues that improvement is more complex than the paternalistic development of productivity. Less emphasis has been afforded by scholars to the complex processes and contributions of education, extension and capacity building to successful adjustment. This thesis proposes that local leadership linked to a network or 'invisible college,' has incrementally over the study period built the capacity and confidence to apply improvement with a strong element of mutuality. The thesis contends that in the changes from an agrarian to a more urbanised and industrialised society, agriculture and its development became a marginalised activity in respect of government policy and the related commitment to research, education and extension through a systematic publicly funded and integrated range of services The thesis is divided into nine chapters. The first two provide a context to the subject and Cumbria's validity as a region for the study through an examination of key characteristics having a bearing on the research. Chapter Three considers a review of literature, sources and their interpretation. Five chapters form the main case study. Individual initiatives form Chapters Four and Five for the period c. 1800 - 1870. Chapters Six and Seven analyse the period of transition c. 1870 - 1900 during which the application of science through. / organisations was characterised by mutuality and led to the introduction of public <b>funding</b> <b>delegated</b> to local authorities. The development of systematic formal agricultural education and extension during the period c. 1895 - 1920, through more visible structures forms the core of Chapter Seven. In Chapter Eight a study of the emergence of publicly funded provision in five neighbouring north of England counties places the Cumbria case in context. The conclusions in chapter nine find that agriculture, and ipso facto agricultural education and extension during the study period, became marginalised as the drift of power moved from the landed to urban and industrial interests. Paradoxically, improvement through individual leadership, innovation and mutuality formed a continuum of capacity building at all stages, spatially embracing regional, national and international links. Regional interactions between the actors in the six counties of northern England developed provision with different emphases in higher education, research, extension and instruction for typical farmers and workers, in which Cumbrian outcomes were exemplars of national note, within the constraints of financial resources.

40|$|There can be few {{who would}} {{argue with the}} notion that the nature of dental {{practice}} in the United Kingdom has changed dramatically {{over the last couple of}} decades. A variety of factors, including new clinical techniques, growing consumerism, a much greater awareness of health-related and well-being issues in the public at large, as well as a marked deregulation within the dental profession, the development of vocational training and recently mandatory lifelong learning, the growing number of females working in the profession, and an increasing reluctance of young dentists to finance dental practices have all combined to create an environment which has enabled and encouraged a move away from traditional forms of dental care delivery. Instead, there has been considerable growth in independently-funded practice and a commensurate growth in the number of practices operating under a corporate body umbrella of one form or another. Currently there are 27 corporate bodies registered with the General Dental Council (GDC) with the likelihood of more in the future given the proposed GDC review. This will no doubt take into consideration European law, under which the restriction within the Dentist's Act on the number of corporate bodies is likely to be untenable. Although they still have only a small share of the dental market [...] with 4 % of all dentists in the UK in 1999 [...] they have expanded rapidly from a small base. The data available at the time the paper was written indicate that the global total of fees earned from dentistry in the UK in the financial year 2001 / 2002 was almost 3 billion Pounds, of which 1. 9 billion Pounds (64 %) came from NHS fees and 1. 1 billion Pounds (36 %) from private fees. Of this 1. 9 billion Pounds received in NHS fees in 2001 / 2002, 0. 55 billion Pounds were paid by patients who were not exempt from charges, bringing the total amount actually paid out of patients' pockets for dental treatment to 1. 65 billion Pounds. Compare these figures with 1996 / 1997 when NHS fees stood at 1. 6 billion Pounds (71 %) and private fees at 0. 6 billion Pounds (29 %) and it can be seen that while the size of the whole market has grown NHS fees have risen by around 18 % while private sector fees have gone up by 64 % during the same period. It cannot be said therefore that NHS dentistry has disappeared although it is clear that access to NHS dentistry has been and may still be difficult in some parts of the country. The Department of Health in England has responded by developing 'access centres' and in the recently published Options for Change sets out sweeping proposals to revitalise NHS dentistry and <b>delegate</b> decisions over <b>funding</b> to a local level. It is far from clear what the consequences of these changes will be. However, one possible scenario is that in many parts of the UK, although relief of pain, prevention and restoration of function will be funded by the NHS, other than in 'special circumstances' such as after trauma and inherited conditions 'cosmetic embellishment' will not be funded. In which case, ever increasing public interest in personal appearance may well lead to further growth in private dentistry. Against a background of change and uncertainty, this series of articles explores some of the issues facing dentists coming to terms with working in this brave new world. This first part examines an aspect of dental practice that is seldom discussed openly and yet is of such fundamental importance that it is the cornerstone of all successful practices and the main fault line in unsuccessful ones, namely the nature and strength of practice values. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
