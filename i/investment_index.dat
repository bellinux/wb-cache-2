It was prompted by concern about Nestlé's [...] "aggressive marketing" [...] of breast milk substitutes, particularly in less economically developed countries (LEDCs), largely among the poor. The boycott was officially suspended in the U.S. in 1984, after Nestlé agreed to follow an international marketing code endorsed by the World Health Organization. [...] The boycott was also ended in the UK by several organisations including the General Synod of the Church of England in July 1994, the Royal College of Midwives in July 1997, and the Methodist Ethical Investment Committee in November 2005 and the Reformed Churches in November 2011 {{as a result of}} the company’s inclusion in the responsible <b>investment</b> <b>index</b> FTSE4Good Responsible <b>Investment</b> <b>Index.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A {{commodity}} {{index fund}} is a fund whose assets are invested in financial instruments based on or {{linked to a}} commodity index. In just about every case the index {{is in fact a}} Commodity Futures Index. The first such index was the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) Index, which began in 1958. Its construction made it unuseful as an <b>investment</b> <b>index.</b> The first practically investable commodity futures index was the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, created in 1991, and known as the [...] "GSCI". The next was the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index. It differed from the GSCI primarily in the weights allocated to each commodity. The DJ AIG had mechanisms to periodically limit the weight of any one commodity and to remove commodities whose weights became too small. After AIG's financial problems in 2008 the Index rights were sold to UBS and it is now known as the DJUBS index. Other commodity indices include the Reuters / CRB index (which is the old CRB Index as re-structured in 2005) and the Rogers Index.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} said that "home bias" exists among investors due to informational {{disadvantage}} involved in cross-border investment. But, real estate has become a major asset class and cross-border real estate investment has been surging. Behind this phenomenon is heightened awareness among investors of the modem portfolio theory and the benefits of diversification. Japan is not an exception. Since late 1990 's, a large amount of capital has flowed into Japanese real estate markets. The markets have also experienced significant transformation. However, in the eyes of foreign investors they are far from transparent due to, among other things, lack of reliable <b>investment</b> <b>indices</b> of commercial real estate. Such indices cannot be generated overnight, and lack of such indices can be a critical issue for global real estate investors. This issue is contributing to under-investment in Japan's real estate from overseas. Facing this problem, researchers and industry practitioners launched a number of <b>investment</b> <b>indices</b> for private real estate in recent years, each of which has strong and weak points. Compared to other indices, the ARES J-REIT Property Index seems potentially the most reliable and promising index for Japanese commercial real estate. (cont.) The purposes {{of this paper is to}} analyze and compare various <b>investment</b> <b>indices</b> for Japanese private real estate; to understand distortions i. e. the "lagging" and "smoothing" effects involved in appraisal-based <b>investment</b> <b>indices</b> to see the "true" pictures of private real estate returns; and then to apply such indices to an international portfolio analysis to see the relative position of Japan's private real estate as a global asset class. Simulations are used to understand the mechanism of appraisal-based <b>investment</b> <b>indices.</b> Introductory sections provide some background on globalization of real estate and issues with Japanese real estate markets. by Takashi Endo.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the {{organization}} of space seek to define the nature of monuments within a local context. This approach to monumental space requires a distinction between monuments and landscapes, where the latter is merely a setting for the former. This thesis challenges the above distinction, and recognizes that terraces are monumental constructed landscapes. As monuments, terraces compete with their surroundings {{as well as with}} similar structures at other sites. The monumental Cimon terrace under the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis is a case study, and its relationship with its surrounding monuments and with terraces at Delphi and Persepolis is explored. The terraces are compared based on their implied <b>investment</b> <b>index</b> values, a calculated ratio of the maximum volume of stone to the area of the horizontal space. In comparison to terraces at Delphi and Persepolis, the implied <b>investment</b> <b>index</b> value of the Cimon terrace is the largest, and therefore the Cimon terrace is the largest expression of power between the sites...|$|E
