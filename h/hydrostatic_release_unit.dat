40|$|Calcium release during excitation-contraction {{coupling}} of {{skeletal muscle}} cells is {{initiated by the}} functional interaction of the exterior membrane and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), mediated by the "mechanical" coupling of ryanodine receptors (RyR) and dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR).

Our objective was to determine whether endurance exercise training could attenuate the deleterious effects of hypertension on calcium <b>release</b> <b>unit</b> components and Ca 2 + sparks in left ventricular myocytes of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Male Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats (4 months of age) were divided into 4 groups: normotensive (NC) and hypertensive control (HC), and normotensive (NT) and hypertensive trained (HT) animals (7 rats per group). NC and HC rats were submitted to a low-intensity treadmill running protocol (5 days/week, 1 h/day, 0 % grade, and 50 - 60 % of maximal running speed) for 8 weeks. Gene expression of the ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR 2) and FK 506 binding protein (FKBP 12. 6) increased (270 %) and decreased (88 %), respectively, in HC compared to NC rats. Endurance exercise training reversed these changes by reducing RyR 2 (230 %) and normalizing FKBP 12. 6 gene expression (112 %). Hypertension also increased the frequency of Ca 2 + sparks (HC= 7. 61 ± 0. 26 vs NC= 4. 79 ± 0. 19 per 100 µm/s) and decreased its amplitude (HC= 0. 260 ± 0. 08 vs NC= 0. 324 ± 0. 10 &# 916;F/F 0), full width at half-maximum amplitude (HC= 1. 05 ± 0. 08 vs NC= 1. 26 ± 0. 01 µm), total duration (HC= 11. 51 ± 0. 12 vs NC= 14. 97 ± 0. 24 ms), time to peak (HC= 4. 84 ± 0. 06 vs NC= 6. 31 ± 0. 14 ms), and time constant of decay (HC= 8. 68 ± 0. 12 vs NC= 10. 21 ± 0. 22 ms).

40|$|AbstractMuscle fibers release {{large amounts}} of calcium from an {{internal}} compartment, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), during activation. Two proteins {{are involved in this}} process and its control: plasma membrane calcium channels, or dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), and SR calcium release channels, or ryanodine receptors (RyRs). The two proteins form part of a structural complex, perhaps unique to muscle cells, which allows an interaction between plasma membrane and SR, resulting in calcium release from the latter. The surface–SR interaction {{is a step in the}} coupling between electrical events in the plasma membrane and contraction (excitation–contraction coupling). The structural complexes have been called calcium <b>release</b> <b>units.</b> One key to further understanding the control of calcium homeostasis in muscle is knowledge of how DHPRs and RyRs assemble into calcium <b>release</b> <b>units.</b> We have studied the development of avian myocardium, using immunocytochemistry to locate DHPRs and RyRs and electron microscopy to follow the formation of calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> containing feet (RyRs) and large membrane particles (presumably DHPRs). We find that the initial step is a docking of SR vesicles to the plasma membrane, followed by the appearance of feet in the junctional gap between SR and plasma membrane. Feet aggregate in ordered arrays, and the arrays increase in size until they fill the entire junctional gap. Clustering of membrane particles, presumably DHPRs, is apparently coupled to clustering of feet, since the two junction components assemble within patches of membrane of approximately equal size and containing an approximately constant ratio of particles to feet. Thus, despite the fact that no evidence exists for a direct interaction between DHPRs and RyRs in cardiac muscle, some mechanism exists to ensure that the two molecules are clustered in proximity to each other and in the appropriate proportion...|$|R

40|$|Local {{character}} of calcium release in cardiac myocytes, {{as defined by}} confocal recordings of calcium sparks, implies independent activation of individual calcium release sites based on ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel recruitment. We constructed virtual calcium release sites (vCRSs) composed of a variable number of RyR channels distributed in clusters {{in accordance with the}} experimentally observed cluster size distribution. The vCRSs consisted either of a single virtual calcium <b>release</b> <b>unit,</b> in which all clusters shared a common dyadic space, or of multiple virtual calcium <b>release</b> <b>units</b> containing one cluster each and having separate dyadic spaces. We explored the stochastic behavior of vCRSs to understand the activation and recruitment of RyRs during calcium sparks. RyRs were represented by the published allosteric gating model that included regulation by cytosolic Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +. The interaction of Mg 2 + with the RyR Ca 2 +-binding sites and the refractory period of vCRSs were optimized to accord with the experimentally observed calcium dependence of calcium spark frequency. The Mg 2 +-binding parameters of RyRs that provided the best description of spark frequency depended on the number of RyRs assembled in the virtual calcium release sites. Adequate inhibitory effect of Mg 2 + on the calcium dependence of RyR open probability was achieved if the virtual calcium release sites contained at least three clusters. For the distribution of the number of open RyRs in evoked calcium sparks to correspond to the experimentally observed distribution of spark calcium release fluxes, at least 3 clusters had to share a common virtual calcium <b>release</b> <b>unit,</b> in which ~ 3 RyRs open to form an average spark. These results reconcile the small cluster size and stochastic placement of RyRs in the release sites with the estimates of the amount of RyR protein, volume density of calcium release sites, and the size of calcium release sites in rat cardiac myocytes...|$|R
