Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was {{reminded}} of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it." [...] When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen's Club 42 years later, Riegels quipped, [...] "Believe me, I feel I've earned this." ...|$|E

The first time <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> Steve did for the band was when he broke his hand in Michigan. Tried to punch through a wall and busted his hand. So we had Fred Coury come in from Cinderella for the Houston show. Fred played technically good and steady, but the songs sounded just awful. They were written with Steve playing the drums and his sense of swing was the push and pull that give the songs their feel. When that was gone, it was just... unbelievable, weird. Nothing worked." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reiterating {{some of his}} November 2006 comments, Wonggoun {{explained}} that the January 6, 1994 killing was not planned, and resulted from an argument. [...] According to Wonggoun, not only had his wife accrued over US$20,000 in gambling debts, but {{on the day of}} the killing, he learned that Sopha was pregnant and he was [...] "100 percent" [...] sure the child wasn't his.

I hit her one time and she fell on the floor, and after that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> I did, I lost control of myself ... everything was just dark." [...] Wonggoun explained to Colonel Burd that it was never his intention to kill his wife, but that [...] "I was mad. [...] I wanted to teach her a lesson." [...] Arguing for a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, defense attorneys showed that Wonggoun's own frank candidness about the killing, as well as his [...] ", being in the sudden heat of passion, [...] the only explanation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Referee Hansson told Sveriges Radio Blekinge [...] "I cannot {{comment on}} the game itself but life must go on. I will ride this storm as well". In his first {{substantial}} {{comment on the}} incident, Hansson spoke to the regional Swedish newspaper [...] on 24 November. While repeating the fact that FIFA rules prevented him commenting on the game until the investigation concluded, he said the incident was neither his or his referee team's fault. Referring to a graphic illustration printed earlier in The Times and reproduced in some Swedish newspapers, he said [...] " [...] clears the whole refereeing team in this incident". The picture, titled 'Why the referee missed it', purported to show how neither the referee or the assistant referee could have seen the handball incident, due {{to the presence of}} three Irish players blocking Hansson's view from his position {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, and Irish goalkeeper Shay Given's position obscuring the sightline of the assistant referee, Nilsson, who was standing on the right hand touchline. He also stated that the reaction to the game had made him consider quitting his job as a referee. On 21 June, during the World Cup finals, Hansson said, [...] "After the game, we were sitting in the dressing room and I cried. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> a mistake it was." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1950, Sal gets the itch to travel again while Dean is working as a parking lot {{attendant}} in Manhattan, living with his girlfriend Inez. Sal notices {{that he has been}} reduced to simple pleasures—listening to basketball games and looking at erotic playing cards. By bus Sal takes to the road again, passing Washington, D.C., Ashland, Cincinnati, and St. Louis, and eventually reaching Denver. There he meets Stan Shephard, and the two plan to go to Mexico City when they learn that Dean has bought a car and is on the way to join them. In a rickety '37 Ford sedan the three set off across Texas to Laredo, where they cross the border. They are ecstatic, having left [...] "everything behind us and entering a new and unknown phase of things." [...] Their money buys more (10 cents for a beer), police are laid back, cannabis is readily available, and people are curious and friendly. The landscape is magnificent. In Gregoria, they meet Victor, a local kid, who leads them to a bordello where they have their last grand party, dancing to mambo, drinking, and having fun with prostitutes. In Mexico City Sal becomes ill from dysentery and is [...] "delirious and unconscious." [...] Dean leaves him, and Sal later reflects that [...] "when I got better <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> a rat he was, but then I had to understand the impossible complexity of his life, how he had to leave me there, sick, to get on with his wives and woes." ...|$|E
50|$|I had a {{completely}} different idea for the cover at first. We'd already reserved the space, decided the hair and makeup and everything. But after the incident, as is typical of me, I suddenly changed my mind. I knew it wasn't the time for gaudiness, for elaborate sets and costumes.

2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>what</b> she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E

Faced with this ultimatum, Verne decided conclusively to continue his literary life and refuse the job, writing: [...] "Am I not right to follow my own instincts?
