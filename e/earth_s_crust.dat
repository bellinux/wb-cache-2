40|$|Maps of the {{remanent}} {{magnetic field}} of Mars show demagnetized zones within and around giant impact basins. It {{is likely that}} vast regions of the Martian crust were demagnetized due to a shock-induced phase change or magnetic transition of magnetic minerals in the crust. This hypothesis {{is supported by the}} fact that around the Hellas and Argyre basins, the edges of the unmagnetized zones roughly correspond with peak shock pressure contour lines of a few GPa.

40|$|Introduction: Potassium (K) {{as a large}} ion lithophile element has dominantly been {{concentrated}} in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>crust</b> and the mantle through differentiation, and {{in the form of}} K- 40 contributes to the planet s heat budget. However, whether or not K also enters core-forming phases, has been debated for over three decades. Arguments favoring entry of K in the core are based on: (1) K-sulfide (with Fe, Ni, Cu, Na, and Cl; djerfisherite) found in highly reduced enstatite chondrites (or aubrites, enstatite achondrites); (2) demonstration that K, owing to an s-d electronic switch at high-pressure, exhibits transition- element like character, (3) solubility of measurable K in Fe-Ni-S liquids at high pressure, temperature conditions, and (4) models of cooling of the core that seem to require, besides convection, some form of radioactivity, and thus lending support to the experimental work. In this contribution, we assess the effect of sequestering K in the core, as it is perhaps an element that is a key to reconciling geochemistry, paleomagnetism, accretion, and thermal evolution models for the planet...|$|E

The experiments were conducted {{to examine the effects of}} time, concentration, pH, temperature on the uptake process assess at low concentrations and the composition and morphology of the precipitated carbonates. The kinetic data corresponding to adsorption were adequately described by the pseudo-second order rate equation. At equilibrium, the extent of adsorption on both minerals followed the order Cd 2 + > Mn 2 + > Ba 2 +. Precipitation of metal carbonates proceeded at a slower rate and led to large removal of the ions under consideration. The mass fractions of the precipitated metal carbonates were determined using quantitative XRD. For this purpose, empirical equations were developed for binary carbonate mixtures. FTIR was used to follow the possible modifications in vibrational modes of calcite and aragonite, and the newly emerging vibrations of various carbonate phases. According to SEM results, BaCO 3 crystals appeared to be 1 - 2 micrometers in size with an olivary-like shape and MnCO 3 crystals assumed a cubic shape with 200 - 400 nm size.

40|$|The {{biosphere}} {{comprises the}} <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>crust,</b> atmosphere, oceans, and ice caps {{and the living}} organisms that survive within this habitat. The discoveries of barophilic chemolithoautotrophic thermophiles living deep within the crust and in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, and psychrophiles in permafrost and deep within the Antarctic Ice Sheet indicate the Earth s biosphere is far more extensive than previously recognized. Molecular biomarkers and Bacterial Paleontology provide evidence that life appeared very early on the primitive Earth and {{the origin of the}} biosphere is closely linked with the emergence of life. The role of comets, meteorites, and interstellar dust in the delivery of water, organics and prebiotic chemicals has long been recognized. Deuterium enrichment of seawater and comets indicates that comets delivered oceans to the early Earth. Furthermore, the similarity of the D/H ratios and the chemical compositions of CI carbonaceous meteorites and comets indicate that the CI meteorites may be remnants of cometary nuclei with most volatiles removed. Comets, meteorites, and interstellar dust also contain complex organic chemicals, amino acids, macromolecules, and kerogen-like biopolymers and may have {{played a crucial role in}} the delivery of complex organics and prebiotic chemicals during the Hadean (4. 5 - 3. 8 Gyr) period of heavy bombardment. The existence of indigenous microfossils of morphotypes of cyanobacteria in the CI and CM carbonaceous meteorites suggests that the paradigm that life originated endogenously in the primitive oceans of early Earth may require re-consideration. Recent data on the hot (300 - 400 K) black crust on comet P/Halley and Stardust images of P/Wild 2 showing depressions, tall cliffs, and pinnacles, indicate the presence of thick, durable, dark crusts on comets. If cavities within the ice and crust sustain vapor pressures in excess of 10 millibar, then localized pools of liquid water and brines could exist within the comet. Since life exists on Earth wherever there is liquid water, it is suggested that comets might also harbour viable and/or cryopreserved microbiota...|$|E
40|$|Information on {{magnetisation}} of <b>earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>crust</b> {{comes from}} the study of magnetic anomalies measured at various elevations using ground, airborne and satellite data, as well as studies of deep-seated rocks exposed at the surface. In the Western Gneiss Region (WGR), western Norway, two well exposed bodies of garnetiferous peridotites lay on the island Otrøya. The WGR is a 25. 000 km 2 window of Proterozoic Baltica continental crust exposed in the Scandinavian Caledonides, {{and is one of the}} largest exposures of deeply subducted rocks on earth. The two bodies exposed on Otrøya contain evidence of the early stability of Archean tectonometamorphic megacrystic mineral assemblages that include high P/T enstatites and majoritic garnet (presently exsolved into Proterozoic and Scandian tectonometamorphic assemblages) (Van Roermund, 2008). The magnetic properties and anomaly responses of these peridotites and their immediate enclosing bedrocks were investigated by sampling orientated blocks, conducting magnetic measurements in field and at lab, as well as conducting a ground magnetic survey. This provides us with information on the magnetic properties of deeply subducted mantle fragments, and adds to the knowledge of what is magnetic in the lower crust and lithospheric mantle. The study of the two peridotite bodies at Otrøya displays several morphologies of magnetite, mostly displaying as discrete forms within seams and cracks, but also as well-defined rims around chromites. The remanent intensity and susceptibility of the rocks are low, however the remanent intensity is somewhat varying. The directions of remanent magnetisation within measured specimens are both negative and positive with positive directions commonly displaying the same direction as the ambient field as well as commonly carrying weaker intensities than the negative. All of the above could be indicative of several stages of magnetite creation, and/or several events of recording of natural remanent magnetisation. The immediate constricting bedrocks displayed substantially higher remanent and induced intensities. Within the measured specimens both intensities were varying with the remanence displaying the largest variance in addition to showing both positive and negative directions. This was reflected in the anomaly map created from the ground magnetic survey due to anomalies, both high and low, displaying within these bedrocks. However, the peridotites correlate with wide anomaly lows. With 2 D modelling a magnetic profile over the area was investigated with susceptibility and geometry of the bodies as input parameters. It became evident that the susceptibility contrast of the peridotites and the constricting bedrocks, as well as their geometries, could create anomaly lows as displayed in the anomaly map. However, it could not explain the most negative anomaly responses an indication on remanence being of importance...|$|E

40|$|The average {{concentration}} of manganese in the <b>earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>crust</b> is nearly 0. 1 %, {{making it the}} fourth most abundant of the metals in commercial use. Manganese alloys are mainly consumed as alloying elements in the steel industry. Manganese ores are extracted at mining sites and smelted to manganese alloys at smelting sites. In the production of manganese alloys, the problem {{is to find the}} optimal combination of ores, fluxes, coke, and slag to feed the furnaces that yields alloys that meet customer specifications and to optimally decide the volume, composition, and allocation of the produced slag between furnaces. The alloys are either sold or further refined and then sold. The authors name the problem as the manganese alloy multi-plant production problem. Current decisions in the industry are based on experience and process knowledge and are denoted as single furnace optimisation. Single furnace optimisation is the practice of optimising the profit for each single furnace without considering the overall production. A multi-plant optimisation model can provide decision support to the industry and improve the current practice. A pooling problem formulation is presented to solve the problem. To the authors knowledge, little work has been done on formulating the pooling problem for production of manganese alloys, and no formulations for multi-plant production exist in this industry. The formulation presented is flow and quality based and is a hybrid between the standard and the general pooling problem. The model is, however, subject to simplifying assumptions that may limit how realistic it is in its current state. The bilinear terms in the mathematical formulation are linearised using the Multiparametric Disaggregation Technique (MDT) and the formulation is implemented in the linear solver FICO Xpress. To the authors knowledge, this is the first model that applies the MDT to solve largescale, real instances. The model is applied to test instances based on the industrial partner Eramet Norway s plant layout and solved to a global optimality within 3 % using the MDT-algorithm. The computational study shows that the optimisation model presented can solve problem sizes of up to ten furnaces to a global optimality gap within 8 % for the allotted run time, that the MDT scales well with the problem sizes tested, and that our model outperforms single furnace optimisation. It {{should be noted that the}} single furnace optimisation practice is based on mimicking the actual practice by using our model and not actual practice results. Comparing the model to real production data remains an objective, but the results indicate that multi-plant production planning can be of considerable value to manganese alloy production...|$|E
40|$|In {{complete}} darkness, a NASA observatory waits. When {{an eruption}} {{of boiling water}} billows from a nearby crack in the ground, the observatory s sensors seek particles in the fluid, measure shifts in carbon isotopes, and analyze samples for biological signatures. NASA has landed the observatory in this remote location, far removed from air and sunlight, to find life unlike any that scientists have ever seen. It might sound like a scene from a distant planet, but this NASA mission is actually exploring an ocean floor right here on Earth. NASA established a formal exobiology program in 1960, which expanded into the present-day Astrobiology Program. The program, which celebrated its 50 th anniversary in 2010, not only explores the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe, but also examines how life begins and evolves, and what the future may hold for life on Earth and other planets. Answers to these questions may be found not only by launching rockets skyward, but by sending probes in the opposite direction. Research here on Earth can revise prevailing concepts of life and biochemistry and point to the possibilities for life on other planets, as was demonstrated in December 2010, when NASA researchers discovered microbes in Mono Lake in California that subsist and reproduce using arsenic, a toxic chemical. The Mono Lake discovery {{may be the first}} of many that could reveal possible models for extraterrestrial life. One primary area of interest for NASA astrobiologists lies with the hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. These vents expel jets of water heated and enriched with chemicals from off-gassing magma below the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>crust.</b> Also potentially within the vents: microbes that, like the Mono Lake microorganisms, defy the common characteristics of life on Earth. Basically all organisms on our planet generate energy through the Krebs Cycle, explains Mike Flynn, research scientist at NASA s Ames Research Center. This metabolic process breaks down sugars for energy to fuel cellular functions. "We think this chemical process did not exist when life first formed on Earth," he says, "because it is based on oxygen being available, and there was little oxygen available on the early Earth. " It is possible that there are anaerobic regions beneath the sea floor in which life forms like those early non-Krebs Cycle microbes may yet exist. To detect and potentially collect samples of life emerging from hydrothermal vents, Flynn and his colleagues created Medusa, a multi-sensor instrument designed for long-term observation of diked vents on the ocean floor. When the vents erupt, Medusa assesses indicators of life within the expelled water. If the results are positive, the observatory collects samples and detaches from the ocean floor, making the long journey to the surface for retrieval by scientists. One of the indicators Medusa measures is the ratio of carbon isotopes in the water, namely carbon- 12 and carbon- 13. Living organisms preferentially take up carbon- 12, Flynn says, so examining the ratio of these isotopes can help to determine the source of carbon in an environment as either biological or non-biological. "On Mars, there is evidence of localized methane in the atmosphere, and that methane could come from biological sources or from geochemical ones," Flynn says. "Determining the background planetary carbon isotope ratios and then evaluating the specific carbon ratios in this methane would help to determine how it was formed. " A long-duration observatory similar to Medusa could one day provide essential evidence for or against the presence of life on the Red Planet or beneath the ice-crusted oceans of Europa...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Kırmızı çamur, alüminyum üretiminde, boksit cevherinden alümina üretmek içinkullanılan Bayer prosesi sonucunda oluşan bir atıktır. Nüfus ve şehirleşmedeki artışa paralel olarak alüminyum talebi de artmakta olup, alüminyum üreten tesisler için kırmızı çamurun depolanması ve bertaraf edilmesi en önemli sorunlardan biri haline gelmektedir. Arsenik ise, metal ile ametal arasında özelliğe sahip olup, gerek doğal olarak gerekse antropojenik kaynaklardan ötürü yerkabuğunda yaygın halde bulunan bir elementtir. Doğada inorganik ve organik halde bulunan arsenik, toksik ve kanserojen sınıfına girebildiğinden, son yıllarda yer altı ve yer üstü sularında karşılaşılan en önemli sorunlardan biridir. Bu çalışmada, kırmızı çamurun arseniğin uzaklaştırılması üzerindeki etkisi araştırılmıştır. Öncelikle {{adsorbent}} olan kırmızı çamur ile arseniğin uzaklaştırılması için optimum pH değeri, karıştırma süresi vekırmızı çamur miktarı saptanmıştır. pH 2, 5 ile pH 10 arasında farklı değerlerde çalışılmış ve sentetik olarak hazırlanan çözeltilerden en iyi adsorblanmanın pH 5, 5 ta olduğu gözlenmiştir. Kırmızı çamur miktarının incelendiği deneylerde, 0, 5 gr/lt kırmızı çamurun az miktarda olmasına rağmen etkin olduğu anlaşılmıştır. Farklı arsenik konsantrasyonlarında da sürdürülen çalışmalarda, 100 ppm e kadar oldukça yüksek bir verimle elde edilmiştir. 100 ppm üzerindeki yüksek konsantrasyonlarda arsenik etkinliğini arttırmak için kırmızı çamurun ısı ve asit ile aktifleştirilmesi yoluna gidilmiştir. Asit aktivasyonu ile istenilen sonuç elde edilemezken, 600 °C de ısı ile aktivasyon sonucu arsenik gideriminde yüksek konsantrasyonlarda verim artışı sağlanmıştır. Arsenik giderimi için bir diğer adsorban olan piritin, kırmızı çamur ile birlikte kullanımının da etkisi araştırılmış; ancak kırmızı çamurun tek başına daha etkin bir adsorban olduğu görülmüştür. Sentetik arsenik konsantrasyonundan elde edilen veriler bir de gerçek atık suya uygulanmak istenmiş ve Eti Maden Emet Bor tesislerindenalınan doğal pH sı 9 olan 38, 5 ppm arsenik içeren atık su numunesi ile de çalışmalar yapılmıştır. Bunun neticesinde doğal pH da 4 gr/lt kırmızı çamurun dahi yetersiz olduğu, ancak pH 5 değerinde arsenik gideriminde oldukça başarılı sonuçlar elde edilmiştir. Son olarak bu çalışmaya bir atık değerlendirme olarak baktığımızda, kırmızı çamur atığının kullanıma elverişliliğinin de göz önünde bulundurulması gerektiğinden, nakliyesinde kolaylık olması açısından pelet haline getirilmesi düşünülmüş ve elde edilen veriler ışığında iri ve ince boyutta peletler hazırlanıp bir de bunların arsenik adsorbsiyonu üzerindeki etkisi incelenmiştir. Bunun neticesinde ince peletlerle daha iyi sonuçlar elde edilmiş; ancak numune alma süreleri arttıkça arsenik giderme veriminin azaldığı gözlenmiştir. Arsenic exhibits {{properties of}} metal and non metal. Due to both natural and anthropogenic sources, arsenic is the 20 th the most abundant elements in the <b>earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>crust</b> and is a component of morethan 245 minerals. These are mostly ores containing sulfide, along with copper, nickel, lead, cobalt, or other metals. Arsenic exists in nature in the oxidation states +V (arsenate), +III (arsenite), 0 (arsenic) and -III (arsine). Commonly inorganic arsenic appears {{in the aqueous environment}} in the states +V and +III as arsenous acid (As(III)), arsenic acid (As(V)), and their salts. It is usually found in the environment combined with the elements such as oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur. Arsenic combined with these elements is called inorganic arsenic. On the other hand if arsenic combined with carbon and hydrogen is called organic arsenic. Inorganic arsenic compounds can be methylated by bacteria, fungi, and yeasts to the organic compounds such as monomethylarsenic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and arsine. Arsenic compounds are used in wood preservation and insecticides, as an additive to lead and copper for hardening, glass manufacturing, in small quantities in semi-conductor manufacturing. Arsenic is carcinogenic and may cause lung cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer, renal cancer, and skin cancer. It is also harmful to the nervous system. Other health effects may include vessel damage, high blood pressure, anemia, stomach sickness, and diabetes. The toxicity of arsenic depends on its binding form. Organic arsenic compounds are less toxic than inorganic arsenic compounds. It has been estimated that {{tens of millions of people}} are at risk exposing to excessive levels of arsenic from both contaminated water and arsenic-bearing coal from natural sources. Humans are exposed to this toxic by breathing, eating, or drinking the substance, or by skin contact. The current World Health Organization recommended value for arsenic in drinking water is 0. 010 mg/Land in wastewater is 0, 5 mg/L. Arsenic cannot be destroyed in the environment. It can only change its form, or become attached to or separated from particles. Therefore it is one of the main problems considering underground and ground source waters in recent years, because of its toxicity and carcinogenic. On the other side, aluminium is the second-most used metal after steel, largely because of its use in a wide variety of products. It is estimated that aluminium composes about 8 % of the <b>earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>crust.</b> Aluminium is a light silvery-white metallic element and it is resistant to corrosion. it is very reactive but forms a tough layer of oxide when exposed to air, preventing further corrosion and it is ductile and easily malleable. It is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. Aluminium is used electrical equipments such as car, ship, aircraft construction; metallurgical and chemical processes; domestic and industrial construction; packaging and kitchen utensils. Aluminium is non-toxic (as the metal) nonmagnetic and non-sparking. It occurs naturally in many foods in very concentrations and is also present in many pharmaceuticals and drinking water. High levels in the body can be toxic. Production of aluminium from ore is dependent upon alumina, which is extracted from bauxite ore which contains 30 - 60 % alumina. The production of alumina consumes more than 90 % of the world s production of bauxite. The main minerals in bauxite are gibbsite (Al 203. 3 H 20), boehmite (Al 203. H 20), and diaspore. Bauxite ore refers to bauxite that contains sufficiently high levels of Al 203 and suitably low levels of Fe 203 and silica to be economically mineable. Red Mud is a waste left after alumina has been extracted from bauxite in Bayer process for refining bauxites into alumina via digestion with sodium hydroxide. This process can be separated into two parts; firstly the extraction of alumina from bauxite, and secondly the smelting of aluminum metal from alumina. Sodium hydroxide is used to dissolve the aluminum oxide. This produces a sodium-aluminium solutionfrom precipitated &# 12310;Al(OH) &# 12311;_ 3. Afterwards it is calcined to produce oxide, from which the metal is recovered. The remaining waste product of bayer process is called red mud due to the colour of the original bauxite ore and the iron oxide it contains. In addition to iron, it contains other particles include silica, unleached residual aluminium, and titanium oxide. For each tonne of alumina produced, the process can leave behind about two tonnes of red mud. However, This ratio is dependent on the type of bauxite used in the refining process. The red mud is a complex chemical soup, a watery slurry of fine rock particles and salts, containing toxic heavy metals. The red mud also has a high pH because of the sodium hydroxide solution used in the refining process. Therefore it is strong enough to kill plant and animal life, and to cause burns and damage to airways if it is breathed. Parallel to the increase in population and urbanization, the demand of aluminum is also increasing and as a consequence, storage and removing red mud becomes more and more important for the facilities produce aluminum. Therefore, cosidering the facts of both arsenic and red mud issues, in this study, the influence of red mud on removing arsenic from waters is investigated. The aim was, by using red mud as a low cost adsorbent, having a good efficiency of arsenic removal from waters and waste waters. Primarily, optimal pH for arsenic removal, stiring duration, and amount of red mud are determined. In the course of this study in a range from pH 2. 5 to pH 10 have been studied in many different values and the best in synthetic absorbable s concentration of arsenic is observed at pH 5. 5. Also it has been concluded that even 0, 5 gr/L red mud is enough effective for arsenic removal at pH 5, 5 with a concentration of 10 ppm arsenic. In other experiment, instead of synthetic arsenic, 38, 5 ppm arsenic contaminated water taken from Eti Mine Emet Boron facilityis used. The experiment performed in the original pH 9 and despite incresing the amount of red mud, good results couldn t be achieved which shows the importance of pH arrangement in the arsenic removal process. This study also investigates different arsenic concentrations, enough high yields is obtained up to 100 ppm. In order to increase the arsenic efficiency the heat, acid, and red mud are activated at concentrations as high as 100 ppm. While desired results could not be obtained by acid activation, with heat activation at 600 °C the yield increase is achieved with high concentrations. Pyrite is another adsorbant to remove arsenic. Although pyrite s removal effect together with red mud has been elaborated as well, it has been found that red mud alone is more effective to remove arsenic. In order to apply the data obtained by sentetic arsenic concentration to the waste water, some experiments has been conducted with natural pH 9 and 38, 5 ppm arsenic concentration obtained by Eti Maden Emet boron facility. As a result, it has been determined that at natural pH value, even 4 gr/L of red mud is not enough, but the yield quite rises at pH 5. It has been also worked with another waste sample from Eti Maden Emet boron facility which has a 81, 66 ppm arsenicconcentration. With this sample, it has been tried to see the effects of the amount of red mud in arsenic removal with a value of pH 5 in wastewater. As a result, with 4 gr/L red mud, it has been able to reduce the arsenic concentration to a level below 0, 5 ppm, which is the limit for permitted levels of arsenic in waste waters. For the application and the transportation with ease, red mud transformed to the red mud pellets by using starch. The adsorption experiments in a colunm system with two different size of these pellets show that with the fine pellets, better results are obtained. While the course sized pellet has a 42 % of arsenic removal efficiency in the samples taken after 30 minutes, the fine sized pellet has about 60 % of arsenic removal efficieny. On the other hand, these efficiencies are reduced with increasing sampling time. When the fine sized pellets are worked with the real arsenic contaminated water taken from Emet boron facility, about 80 % of arsenic removal efficiency is achieved. As a result, red mud which is the biggest waste problem of aluminum production either with the storage necessity or the disposal difficulties, is used for removing arsenic from the waters within the scope of waste utilization.

40|$|Carbon {{is present}} in various forms in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> upper mantle (carbonate- or diamond-bearing mantle xenoliths, {{carbonatite}} magmas, CO 2 emissions from volcanoes [...] .). Moreover, there is enough carbon in chondritic material to stabilize carbonates into the mantles of Mars or Venus {{as well as in}} the Earth. However, the interactions with iron have to be constrained, because Fe is commonly thought to buffer oxygen fugacity into planetary mantles. [1] and [2] show evidences of the stability of clinopyroxene Ca(Mg,Fe) Si 2 O 6 + magnesite (Mg,Fe) CO 3 in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle around 6 GPa (about 180 km). The stability of oxidized forms of carbon (like magnesite) depends on the oxygen fugacity of the system. In the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle, the maximum carbon content is 10000 ppm [3]. The fO 2 parameter varies vertically as a function of pressure, but also laterally because of geodynamic processes like subduction. Thus, carbonates, graphite, diamond, C-rich gases and melts are all stable forms of carbon in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle. [4] show that the fO 2 variations observed in SNC meteorites can be explained by polybaric graphite-CO-CO 2 equilibria in the Martian mantle. [5] inferred from thermodynamic calculations that the stable form of carbon in the source regions of the Martian basalts should be graphite (and/or diamond). After [6], a metasomatizing agent like a CO 2 -rich melt may infiltrate the mantle source of nakhlites. However, according to [7] and [8], the FeO wt% value in the Martian bulk mantle is more than twice that of the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle (KLB- 1 composition by [9]).

40|$|Waste {{production}} {{is not a}} modern concept. It {{has always been a}} byproduct of human beings use of the earth s natural resources for survival. The safe and reliable long-term disposal of solid waste residues is an important component of integrated waste management. Solid waste residues are waste components that are not recycled, that remain after processing at a material recovery facility, or that remain after the recovery of energy. Historically, solid waste was placed in depressions in the soil of the <b>earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>crust</b> through a process called landfilling. In South Africa, most waste produced by households and industries is disposed of on landfill sites. By law, all landfills and waste containment structures are required to have an engineered containment barrier installed that adheres to the minimum standards described in the waste classification and management regulations of the South African National Environmental Management: Waste Act (Act 59 of 2008). When waste materials in a landfill or any other waste body is exposed to the chemicals and heat generated over time, they produce harmful fluids in the form of leachate or landfill gas that migrate from the landfill towards the liner or capping, and include organic contaminants. These organic contaminants include a group commonly referred to as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that have been known to migrate to and pollute the underlying groundwater (Prosser & Janechek, 1995). The High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) Geomembrane is often believed to be the primary barrier to contaminant transport, but the clay component in the composite liner usually controls the rate of transport of VOCs since researchers like Edil (2003) have shown that VOCs diffuse through geomembranes at appreciable rates. Therefore, the effectiveness of modern landfill liner systems in minimising the migration of VOCs merits scrutiny. The aim {{of this study was to}} obtain reliable data on the reduction in diffusion of VOCs through the HDPE geomembranes (GM) component in the composite liner systems of landfills by extracting air through the leakage detection layer or drainage layer of the composite liner. The objective was to undertake tests in three phases: Phase 1 aimed to prove that the chosen VOCs diffuse from source to receptor through a GM layer and to compare this to the results obtained from the literature. Phase 2 aimed to prove that, even if the separation between the source and receptor consisted of two GMs separated by an air-filled pervious zone, diffusion of the VOCs would still occur from the source to the receptor volumes. Phase 3 aimed to prove that, by introducing airflow into the pervious zone between the two GMs, the concentration of VOCs in the receptor volume (due to diffusion through the GM) could be reduced significantly. The testing in this phase also aimed to determine if the rate of air removal would play a role in the diffusive process and the resultant VOC concentrations in the receptor. Laboratory tests were carried out at the South Campus of the University of Pretoria in South Africa. The tests undertaken were based on the methods used by Prof Kerry Rowe at the Geo-Engineering Centre at the Queens University in Kingston, Canada as demonstrated during a visit to their facility. To undertake these tests it would be required to calculate the Sorption (Sgf) and Diffusion (Dg) coefficients for the compound and GM in question. Sorption/Immersion, Diffusion and Weight Gain tests were done to determine the sorption coefficient for the GM and permeant in question. The Diffusion coefficient (Dg) was inferred using the variation in source and receptor concentrations with time (Fick s second law) at the given boundary conditions. This was done using POLLUTEv 7 ®, which solves the one-dimensional contaminant migration equation subject to boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the GM being modelled. The data entry into POLLUTEv 7 ® includes information such as thickness and density on the layers to be modelled as well as the boundary conditions to be used for modelling. Phase 1 testing had challenges and limitations but it met its objective of proving that the VOCs in question diffuse from the source, through the 2 mm GM, into the receptor that represents groundwater, at rates that were comparable to those found in literature. Phase 2 tests took longer to reach equilibrium since the sorption and diffusion process had to take place over two GMs and the 0. 8 cm air-filled pervious zone. The temperature under which phase 2 tests were undertaken was higher than that of phase 1 and, as indicated by literature, diffusion occurs faster at elevated temperatures. Undertaking the tests at different temperatures was not on purpose but rather a factor of laboratory conditions and setup. Data on the diffusion across two GMs separated by air, was not readily available to compare the difference that the increased temperature had on the system, but Phase 2 testing successfully met its aim of proving that the diffusion of BTEX and Chloroform takes place from source to receptor across a divide consisting of two 1 mm GMs separated by an air filled pervious zone. Phase 3 testing showed that, even though the optimal rate of airflow would require additional testing, introducing a flow of air through a pervious zone adjacent to the GM layer in a landfill liner would significantly reduce the concentrations of VOCs in the groundwater beneath landfills and waste containment facilities.

40|$|There are {{currently}} several hypotheses {{on the origin}} of volatile siderophile elements in the Earth. One hypothesis is that they were added during <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> accretion and core formation and mobilized into the metallic core [1], others claim multiple stage origin [2], while some hypothesize that volatiles were added after the core already formed [3]. Several volatile siderophile elements are depleted in <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> mantle relative to the chondrites, something which continues to puzzle many scientists. This depletion is likely due to a combination of volatility and core formation. The <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> core is composed of Fe and some lighter constituents, although the abundances of these lighter elements are unknown [4]. Si is one of these potential light elements [5] although few studies have analyzed the effect of Si on metal-silicate partitioning, in particular the volatile elements. As, In, Ge, and Sb are trace volatile siderophile elements which are depleted in the mantle but have yet to be extensively studied. The metal-silicate partition coefficients of these elements will be measured to determine the effect of Si. Partition coefficients depend on temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, and metal and silicate composition and can constrain the concentrations of volatile, siderophile elements found in the mantle. Reported here are the results from 13 experiments examining the partitioning of As, In, Ge, and Sb between metallic and silicate liquid. These experiments will examine the effect of temperature, and metal-composition (i. e., Si content) on these elements in or-der to gain a greater understanding of the core-mantle separation which occurred during the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> early stages.

40|$|A {{stunning}} red sunset or purple sunrise is {{an aesthetic}} treat with a scientific explanation: The colors are {{a direct result}} of the absorption or reflectance of solar radiation by atmospheric aerosols, minute particles (either solid or liquid) in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> atmosphere that occur both naturally and because of human activity. At the beginning or end of the day, the Sun s rays travel farther through the atmosphere to reach an observer s eyes and more green and yellow light is scattered, making the Sun appear red. Sunset and sunrise are especially colorful when the concentration of atmospheric particles is high. This ability of aerosols to absorb and reflect sunlight is not just pretty; it also determines the amount of radiation and heat that reaches the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> surface, and can profoundly affect climate. In the atmosphere, aerosols are also important as nuclei for the condensation of water droplets and ice crystals. Clouds with fewer aerosols cannot form as many water droplets (called cloud particles), and consequently, do not scatter light well. In this case, more sunlight reaches the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> surface. When aerosol levels in clouds are high, however, more nucleation points can form small liquid water droplets. These smaller cloud particles can reflect up to 90 percent of visible radiation to space, keeping the heat from ever reaching <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> surface. The tendency for these particles to absorb or reflect the Sun s energy - called extinction by astronomers - depends on a number of factors, including chemical composition and the humidity and temperature in the surrounding air; because cloud particles are so small, they are affected quickly by minute changes in the atmosphere. Because of this sensitivity, atmospheric scientists study cloud particles to anticipate patterns and shifts in climate. Until recently, NASA s study of atmospheric aerosols and cloud particles has been focused primarily on satellite images, which, while granting large-scale atmospheric analysis, limited scientists ability to acquire detailed information about individual particles. Now, experiments with specialized equipment can be flown on standard jets, making it possible for researchers to monitor and more accurately anticipate changes in <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> atmosphere and weather patterns...|$|R

40|$|As Earth's main {{magnetic}} field weakens, our magnetic shield against {{the onslaught of}} the solar wind thins. And the field strength needed to fend off battering by solar coronal mass ejections is decreasing, just when the delicate complexity of modem, vulnerable, electro-technological systems is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Recently, a working group of distinguished scientist from across the nation has asked NASA's Solid Earth and Natural Hazards program a key question: What are the dynamics of <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> {{magnetic field}} and its interactions with the Earth system? Paleomagnetic studies of crustal rocks magnetized in the geologic past reveal that polarity reversals have occurred many times during <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> history. Networked super-computer simulations of core field and flow, including effects of gravitational, pressure, rotational Coriolis, magnetic and viscous forces, suggest how this might happen in detail. And space-based measurements of the real, time-varying magnetic field help constrain estimates of the speed and direction of fluid iron flowing {{near the top of}} the core and enable tests of some hypotheses about such flow. Now scientists at NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center have developed and applied methods to test the hypotheses of narrow scale flow and of a dynamically weak magnetic field near the top of <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> core. Using two completely different methods, C. V. Voorhies has shown these hypotheses lead to specific theoretical forms for the "spectrum" of <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> main magnetic field and the spectrum of its rate of change.
