However, by adopting a certain angle away from the solar angle, this is prevented. The trumpet shape of these flowers thus acts as a parasol shading the gynoecium at times of maximum solar radiation, and not allowing the rays to impinge on the gynoecium.|$|E

5000|$|Some flowers exhibit <b>heliotropism,</b> {{changing}} {{orientation to}} follow the sun. Others grow toward {{the position of the}} sun at noon. As the flower faces the sun it provides a resting spot for a variety of insects, being slightly warmer than surrounding surfaces.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heliotropism,</b> {{a form of}} tropism, is the diurnal motion or {{seasonal}} {{motion of}} plant parts (flowers or leaves) {{in response to the}} direction of the sun. The habit of some plants to move {{in the direction of the}} sun was already known by the Ancient Greeks. They named one of those plants after that property Heliotropium, meaning sun turn. The Greeks assumed it to be a passive effect, presumably the loss of fluid on the illuminated side, that did not need further study. Aristotle's logic that plants are passive and immobile organisms prevailed. In the 19th century, however, botanists discovered that growth processes in the plant were involved, and conducted increasingly ingenious experiments. A. P. de Candolle called this phenomenon in any plant <b>heliotropism</b> (1832). It was renamed phototropism in 1892, because it is a response to light rather than to the sun, and because the phototropism of algae in lab studies at that time strongly depended on the brightness (positive phototropic for weak light, and negative phototropic for bright light, like sunlight). A botanist studying this subject in the lab, at the cellular and subcellular level, or using artificial light, is more likely to employ the more abstract word phototropism. The French scientist Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan was one of the first to study <b>heliotropism</b> when he experimented with the Mimosa pudica plant.|$|E

50|$|Heliotropic flowers {{track the}} sun's motion {{across the sky}} from east to west. During the night, the flowers may assume a random orientation, while at dawn they turn again toward the east where the sun rises. The motion is {{performed}} by motor cells in a flexible segment just below the flower, called a pulvinus. The motor cells are specialized in pumping potassium ions into nearby tissues, changing their turgor pressure. The segment flexes because the motor cells at the shadow side elongate due to a turgor rise. <b>Heliotropism</b> {{is a response to}} light from the sun.|$|E

50|$|Different plant {{canopies}} exhibit different LADs: For instance, {{grasses and}} willows have their leaves largely hanging vertically (such plants {{are said to}} have an erectophile LAD), while oaks tend to maintain their leaves more or less horizontally (these species are known as having a planophile LAD). In some tree species, leaves {{near the top of the}} canopy follow an erectophile LAD while those at the bottom of the canopy are more planophile. This may be interpreted as a strategy by that plant species to maximize exposure to light, an important constraint to growth and development. Yet other species (notably sunflower) are capable of reorienting their leaves throughout the day to optimize exposure to the Sun: this is known as <b>heliotropism.</b>|$|E

Adaptability is pervasive in nature, and efforts in biomimetics to convey nature's time-tested ideas to the context of buildings are rewarding. The way people sweat, shiver and adjust clothes has been used by many as a metaphor to conceive the building skin as a living membrane. Likewise, several CABS concepts imitate tropism: plants’ directional growth or rotation in the direction of certain environmental triggers.

50|$|Sunflowers {{are usually}} tall annual or {{perennial}} plants that grow to {{a height of}} 300 cm or more. They bear one or more wide, terminal capitula (flower heads), with bright yellow ray florets at the outside and yellow or maroon (also known as a brown/red) disc florets inside. Several ornamental cultivars of Helianthus annuus have red-colored ray florets; all of them stem from a single original mutant. During growth, sunflowers tilt during the day to face the sun, but stop once they begin blooming. This tracking of the sun in young sunflower heads is called <b>heliotropism.</b> By {{the time they are}} mature, sunflowers generally face east. The rough and hairy stem is branched in the upper part in wild plants but is usually unbranched in domesticated cultivars. The petiolate leaves are dentate and often sticky. The lower leaves are opposite, ovate or often heart-shaped.|$|E
50|$|The sign of leo is {{strongly}} associated with this card due to the lions adorning her throne, {{as well as the}} lion pendant clasping her cape. She is holding a sunflower, which may represent a fertile and joyous life, but may also further suggest a connection to Leo. In their bud stage, sunflowers face and track the sun in its motion across the sky, a behavior called <b>heliotropism.</b> The sun in astrology is considered to be the ruling planet of the sign of leo. The black cat at her feet shows that luck favors her, as black cat are viewed as bringers of good or bad luck. The nature of cats may also show that she has tamed her darker impulses yet understands and follows her own instincts, thus representing her self-aware and independent nature.

5000|$|This {{alignment}} {{results from}} <b>heliotropism</b> {{in an earlier}} development stage, the bud stage, before the appearance of flower heads (anthesis). The buds are heliotropic {{until the end of}} the bud stage, and finally face East. Their apparent heliotropic motion is a circadian rhythm, synchronized by the sun, which continues if the sun disappears on cloudy days or if plants are moved to constant light. If a sunflower plant in the bud stage is rotated 180°, the bud will be turning away from the sun for a few days, as resynchronization by the sun takes time. The heliotropic motion of the bud is caused by unequal growth speed of the flower stalk and only occurs before the flowers open. The motion of the 'nodding' buds is irreversible, but cumulative. When growth of the flower stalk stops and the flower is mature, the heliotropisms also stops and the flower faces east from that moment onward. This eastward orientation allows rapid warming in the morning and, as a result, an increase in pollinator visits. [...] Sunflowers do not have a pulvinus below their inflorescence. A pulvinus is a flexible segment in the leaf stalks (petiole) of some plant species and functions as a 'joint'. It effectuates leaf motion due to reversible changes in turgor pressure, which occurs without growth. The sensitive plant's closing leaves are a good example of reversible leaf movement via pulvinuli.|$|E

Differently treated flowers were used to measure gynoecia temperature along with the microclimate: intact flowers, flowers with corollas removed, flowers with the stile and stamens removed, shaded flowers, and flowers constrained to be facing away from the sun. The lowest gynoecium temperature was achieved when the flowers were not constrained and not greased.

40|$|Solar {{tracking}} in {{the common}} sunflower, Helianthus annuus, is a dramatic example of a diurnal rhythm in plants. During the day, the shoot apex continuously reorients, following the sun's relative position so that the developing heads track from east to west. At night, the reverse happens, and the heads return and face east in anticipation of dawn. This daily cycle dampens and eventually stops at anthesis, after which the sunflower head maintains an easterly orientation. Although shoot apical <b>heliotropism</b> {{has long been the}} subject of physiological studies in sunflower, the underlying developmental, cellular, and molecular mechanisms that drive the directional growth and curvature of the stem in response to extrinsic and perhaps intrinsic cues are not known. Furthermore, the ecological functions of solar tracking and the easterly orientation of mature heads {{have been the subject of}} significant but unresolved speculation. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge about this complex, dynamic trait.

40|$|Space {{structures}} nowadays {{are often}} designed to serve just one objective during their mission life, examples include truss structures {{that are used}} as support structures, solar sails for propulsion or antennas for communication. Each and {{every single one of}} these structures is optimized to serve just their distinct purpose and are more or less useless {{for the rest of the}} mission and therefore dead weight. By developing a smart structure that can change its shape and therefore adapt to different mission requirements in a single structure, the flexibility of the spacecraft can be increased by greatly decreasing the mass of the entire system. This paper will introduce such an adaptive structure called the Self-inflating Adaptive Membrane (SAM) concept which is being developed at the Advanced Space Concepts Laboratory of the University of Strathclyde. An idea presented in this paper is to adapt these basic changeable elements from nature’s <b>heliotropism.</b> <b>Heliotropism</b> describes a movement of a plant towards the sun during a day; the movement is initiated by turgor pressure change between adjacent cells. The shape change of the global structure can be significant by adding up these local changes induced by local elements, for example the cell’s length. To imitate the turgor pressure change between the motor cells in plants to space structures, piezoelectric micro pumps are added between two neighboring cells. A passive inflation technique is used for deploying the membrane at its destination in space. The trapped air in the spheres will inflate the spheres when subjected to vacuum, therefore no pump or secondary active deployment methods are needed. The paper will present the idea behind the adaption of nature’s <b>heliotropism</b> principle to space structures. The feasibility of the residual air inflation method is verified by LS-DYNA simulations and prototype bench tests under vacuum conditions. Additionally, manufacturing techniques and folding patterns are presented to optimize the actual bench test structure and to minimize the required storage volume. It is shown that through a bio-inspired concept, a high ratio of adaptability of the membrane can be obtained.

40|$|International audienceBackground and Aims: Light {{interception}} is {{a critical}} factor in the production of biomass. The study presented here describes a method used to take account of architectural changes over time in sunflower and to estimate absorbed light at the organ level. Methods: The amount of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by a plant is estimated on a daily or hourly basis through precise characterization of the light environment and three-dimensional virtual plants built using AMAP software. Several treatments are performed over four experiments and on two genotypes to test the model, quantify the contribution of different organs to light interception and evaluate the impact of <b>heliotropism.</b> Key Results: This approach is used to simulate the amount of light absorbed at organ and plant scales from crop emergence to maturity. Blades and capitula were the major contributors to light interception, whereas that by petioles and stem was negligible. Light regimen simulations showed that <b>heliotropism</b> decreased the cumulated light intercepted at the plant scale by close to 2 · 2 % over one day. Conclusions: The approach is useful in characterizing the light environment of organs and the whole plant, especially for studies on heterogeneous canopies or for quantifying genotypic or environmental impacts on plant architecture, where conventional approaches are ineffective. This model paves the way to analyses of genotype–environment interactions and could help establish new selection criteria based on architectural improvement, enhancing plant light interception...|$|E
40|$|The tonus of {{the muscles}} of {{heliotropic}} insects is due chiefly to the action of light; it is markedly decreased in the dark. Each eye controls the tonus of a different group of muscles {{on both sides of}} the body. Different areas of each eye likewise are related to the tonus of different muscle groups, and the relationship is entirely analogous to that of the otic labyrinth of vertebrates. Asymmetrical conditions of muscle tension are produced by any procedure which establishes an unequal photochemical reaction in the two eyes, by difference in illumination, by partial or complete blackening of one eye, or establishing unequal sensitiveness in the two eyes. The unbalanced condition of muscle tonus expresses itself in unusual postures of the resting insects, and in movements in forced paths—circus motions when one eye has been blackened. These reactions vary directly with the intensity of the illumination, as shown not only by the variation in diameters of the circles, but also by the reactions of the insects on vertical surfaces and on the turntable. The relation of the results of these experiments to the problem of heliotropic orientation is too obvious to require detailed discussion, which could only lead to a repetition of the description of the mechanism f <b>heliotropism</b> which Loeb has so clearly expounded.

40|$|Nowadays, space {{structures}} are often designed to serve {{only a single}} objective during their mission life, examples are solar sails for propulsion, antennas for communication or shields for protection. By enabling a structure to change its shape and therefore adapt to different mission stages in a single structure, {{the flexibility of the}} spacecraft can be increased by greatly decreasing the mass of the entire system. The possibility to obtain such a structure lies in a cellular approach in which every cell is programmable to change its basic properties. The shape change of the global structure can be significantly by adding up these local changes, for example the cells length. An idea presented in this paper is to adapt these basic changeable elements from nature’s <b>heliotropism.</b> <b>Heliotropism</b> is the growth or movement of an organism towards the direction of the sunlight. By changing the turgor pressure between two adjacent cells in the plant’s stem, called motor cells, the stem of the plant flexes. Due to the simplicity of the principle, the movement through pressure change seems perfect for the application on deployable space structures. The design of the adaptive membrane consists of an array of cells which are inflated by employing residual air inflation. Residual air inflation uses the expansion of trapped air inside the structure when subjected to vacuum conditions to inflate the structure. A high packing efficiency and deployment reliability can be achieved by using this passive deployment technique coupled with a multiple unit membrane design.

Principles, on which the modification is based, are: (i) application of well founded extended rotations in order to increase the proportion of tree groups above 90 - 100 years age in the stand, where upon the height increment and crown side spread by most of the main tree species in Bulgary drop to considerably lower level, and (ii) optimum systematic spatial positioning of openings in the stand canopy (and tree groups respectively) over the stand area, so that new gaps created by consecutive selection cuttings adjoin to a minimum number of middle aged (40 - 80 y. age) tree groups. Such clumps of vigorous trees with high growth rates, <b>heliotropism</b> and plasticity carry certain risks of spoiling the target regular-unevenaged stand structure. Factors of significance are discussed by determining the rotation age, size of gaps opened in the stand canopy, selection cutting cycle, a regularuneven- aged stand structure design and the minimum area that enables realisation of full selection system cycle. Definitions and determination of selection system elements in their mutual connections are presented in consecutive steps when designing a particular application of group selection system for exemplary pure stand of common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.).
