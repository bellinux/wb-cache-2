5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>that</b> the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E

Basically it is saying what {{meditation}} is all about. The goal of meditation is to <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> (<b>that</b> is, transcend) waking, sleeping and dreaming. So the song starts out by saying, [...] "Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream, it is not dying." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 12, 2006, the Islanders signed DiPietro to a 15-year, $67.5million ($million in [...] dollars) contract, {{which was}} {{believed}} to be the longest contract to date in the NHL and the second-longest in North American sports, behind a 25-year contract for National Basketball Association player Magic Johnson. DiPietro, Wang and Snow all spoke confidently and felt it was the best move for both sides, despite the mixed reactions it received {{from the rest of the}} hockey world. Specifically, Wang stated, [...] "This is not a big deal. You have to have a commitment to who you're working with." [...] As speculation began as to whether other teams would follow suit and give lengthy contracts to star players, Atlanta Thrashers' general manager Don Waddell felt that, [...] "It's highly unlikely that you will see teams <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>that.</b> This is a once-in-a-lifetime contract. Ownership must feel very strongly that he's their guy for the next 15 years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{were mixed}} {{on how the}} Lena and Bianca kiss was portrayed, on whether it was as {{realistic}} as it should be. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com stated, [...] "Not the most passionate kiss, but satisfying enough, given {{that most of the}} episode was devoted to showcasing the big event." [...] The kiss represented a change in American culture. Stephen Tropiano of PopMatters said, [...] "In perhaps what could be {{a step in the right}} direction, daytime television has at last included the first on-screen kiss between a same-sex couple." [...] Tropiano, however, criticized shows treating same-sex kisses as [...] "big events". He stated, [...] "Over the years, television has repeatedly made the same point by treating a kiss exchanged between two members of the same sex as something out-of-the-ordinary and unnatural. It's the network brass more than television series writers and producers who have reinforced society's negative attitudes toward public displays of affection between gay and lesbian couples by treating same-sex kissing as a taboo subject." [...] Tropiano wondered now that Lena and Bianca had kissed if they would kiss again or <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>that</b> in regards to physical intimacy; he felt that it was not likely until society, or at least, television, began to regard a same-sex kiss as just a kiss.|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} that {{project is to}} {{assemble}} descriptions {{of the range of}} conceptual approaches which are considered integrative and which are held by some international constituencies to provide a key for strategic response to the global problematique. Buzzwords like [...] "global", [...] "networking" [...] and [...] "systematic" [...] are often used as magical [...] "words-of-power". Nevertheless, in a society characterized by specialization, fragmentation, disparateness, or opposition, integrative approaches until now have proved inadequate or too difficult to implement. In order to <b>go</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>that</b> difficulty, it seems necessary to creatively introduce novelties, such as a science or art of disagreement that could clarify how to disagree intelligently rather than do so in a mindless manner requiring some form of violent or repressive reaction to eliminate the disagreement as soon as possible. There is a wide variety of initiatives pertaining to integrative knowledge and transdisciplinarity, and a page like Significance: previous, parallel or related initiatives presents several of them. With regard to interdisciplinary relationships between organizations, problems, strategies, values and human development, there is the Integrative Matrix of Human Preoccupations which has been developed by the editors and which allows to deal with all those elements in an exploratory fashion.|$|E
