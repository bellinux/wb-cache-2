John Chiorini, a 17-year-old Eagle Scout, {{was working on the}} waterfront. [...] "Béla came through camp with a patrol of six or seven boys and commandeered me to teach a class on camp craft. He said he was trying out some new ideas with this patrol," [...] Chiorini reported [...] "Béla listened intently as I presented and then he came up after and <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> tips on teaching. He was a mentor to me from that point on." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{shooting}} of the film, Leto quickly went on a liquid diet. He explained, [...] "I've been fasting ever since. I've been doing this very strange, like, lemon and cayenne pepper and water fast. I didn't eat any food for 10 days straight; I think I lost 20 pounds that first 10 days." [...] Losing the excess weight after Chapter 27 proved a challenge. [...] "It took about {{a year to get}} back to a place that felt semi-normal," [...] he said; [...] "I don't know if I'll ever be back to the place I was physically. I'd never do it again; it definitely <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> problems." ...|$|E

But judging by those closing months of the 1995 season, {{it would not have been}} too promising for me, I suspect, had he held on to the Wallaby post." ...|$|E

I retain the right to remake it, but the way it was actually written in the contract is a little bit cloudy.

2500|$|In {{the decades}} that followed, many comedy stars, {{including}} Milton Berle, Bob Hope, and Red Skelton, cited Healy {{as a mentor}} and significant influence on their careers. [...] "Back in 1925, Ted Healy took me aside and <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> wonderful advice," [...] Berle told Walter Winchell, in 1955. [...] "'Milton, always play to the public. Never mind playing to the theatrical crowd. Don't try to impress the trumpet player in the pit. Entertain the people and you'll get rich and famous.'

Most people go in the Oval Office, even people who go in there a lot, have a tendency in front of the President of the United States to always leave something on the table."

Anyone who asks me , that's no problem, it brings back bad memories, but you cop it sweet and anyone decent you respond by telling them what you think, and everyone's {{entitled}} to ask in that regard... The only person who <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> moral support, after I'd bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He ran up and said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'.

2500|$|His first book, Three Inquisitive People, was not {{published}} when completed, but came out later, in 1940. However, his next novel {{made quite a}} splash. Called The Forbidden Territory, it was an immediate success when issued by Hutchinson in 1933, being reprinted seven times in seven weeks. After finishing The Fabulous Valley, Wheatley {{decided to use the}} theme of black magic for his next book. He wrote: [...] "The fact that I had read extensively about ancient religions <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> useful background, but I required up-to-date information about occult circles in this country. My friend, Tom Driberg, who then lived in a mews flat just behind us in Queen's Gate, proved most helpful. He introduced me to Aleister Crowley, the Reverend Montague Summers and Rollo Ahmed." [...] The release the next year of his occult story, The Devil Rides Out—hailed by James Hilton as [...] "the best thing of its kind since Dracula"—cemented his reputation as [...] "The Prince of Thriller Writers." ...|$|E
2500|$|But a whole {{generation}} of journalists and activists were influenced greatly by Seldes. Long-time Washington Post columnist Colman McCarthy said, [...] "He was a reporter who didn't worry about being objective. He worried about what he would choose to write. I'm always amused when they call somebody 'one-sided'. Seldes offered one side – the side you weren't getting elsewhere". Nader said of Seldes, [...] "He was like a doctor. He reported about disease in the political economy, and the gross inequities of power, and the abuses and the exploitation. I {{always wanted to be a}} crusading lawyer, and he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> materials to contemplate crusading about." [...] Journalist Nat Hentoff said, [...] "He took what should be the most honorable term in journalism – muckraking – and made it work again. A lot of journalists of his generation and the generation or two that followed, did more, took risks, because [...] was the model. And the fact that he was there made them feel like whores if they didn't do more." ...|$|E

From today, it is only 18 days until the carnaval starts. How it torments me to think that there are still so many days to go; I wish it were tomorrow;... I want you to know... that the sound of the conga nourishes me, the sound of the frying pans gives me life and the sound of the bocú drives me crazy. [...] Several days prior to the beginning of rehearsals, I went to see a doctor; I felt overwhelmed, sad, pensive. He prescribed and <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> injections, and I felt absolutely no different, but as soon as I heard the sound of the first bocú, I was completely cured, I felt strong and ready for anything. And I advise those who are unhappy and listless to get an invigorating injection of bocú, conga and frying pans and you’ll be OK in 24 hours.” (Pérez II 1988:22-3) ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>some</b> money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E

After checking on her several times, Hill told the two house guests that he was going out to purchase medication for her. Hill took his son and the two women out for dinner that evening, but Joan was too sick to join them. Hill bought her a carton of orange juice on the way home, then went to visit a friend. Joan continued to be ill, vomiting several more times. On Monday, March 17, Settegast and Woolen came to say goodbye to Joan, as they were returning to Dallas. Joan told the women she felt dehydrated and asked for some water. [...] She told her friends she would be all right as they prepared to leave. Effie Green, the Hills' maid, was told that Mrs. Hill was sick in bed and was not to be disturbed for any reason.|$|E
