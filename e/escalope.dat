50|$|The term <b>escalope</b> {{originated}} in France. It {{first appeared in}} cookery terminology late in the 17th century as a dialectal expression in the northeast of rural France originally meaning a shelled nut or mollusk: veau à l'escalope (veal cooked {{in the style of}} an <b>escalope).</b> In those days, an <b>escalope</b> was undoubtedly always veal.|$|E

25|$|Since the 18th century Russian chefs {{have adopted}} many {{techniques}} of French haute cuisine and combined {{them with the}} local culinary tradition. The adoption was furthered by the French chefs, such as Marie-Antoine Carême and Urbain Dubois, who were hired by Russian gentry. In particular the use of quality meat cuts, such as various cutlets, steaks, <b>escalopes</b> and suprêmes became widespread in the 19th century, {{and a number of}} original dishes involving such cuts were developed in Russia at that time.|$|R

50|$|Veal {{has been}} an {{important}} ingredient in Italian, French cuisine and other mediterranian cuisine from ancient times. The veal is often in the form of cutlets, such as the Italian cotoletta or the famous Austrian dish Wiener Schnitzel. Some classic French veal dishes include fried <b>escalopes,</b> fried veal Grenadines (small, thick fillet steaks), stuffed paupiettes, roast joints, and blanquettes. Because veal is lower in fat than many meats, care must be taken in preparation to ensure that it does not become tough. Veal is often coated in preparation for frying or eaten with a sauce. Veal Parmigiana is a common Italian-American dish made with breaded veal cutlets.|$|R

Even the Englishman, Smit, who never says anything, opened his mouth and exclaimed; as for the marmitons, they were breathless, and I thought Achille, the youth of whom I spoke to you, my lord, and who appears to me to be born with the true feeling, would have been overcome with emotion. When it was finished, Leander retired to his room--I attended him--and covered his face with his hands. Would you believe it, my lord! Not a word; not even a message. All this morning Leander has waited in the last hope. Nothing, absolutely nothing! How can he compose when he is not appreciated? Had he been appreciated, he would to-day not only have repeated the <b>escalopes</b> à la Bellamont, but perhaps even invented what might have outdone it. It is unheard of, my lord. The late lord Monmouth would have sent for Leander the very evening, or have written to him a beautiful letter, which would have been preserved in his family; M. de Sidonia would have sent him a tankard from his table. These things in themselves are nothing; but they prove to a man of genius that he is understood.

50|$|An <b>escalope</b> (also spelled as escallope) is a {{piece of}} {{boneless}} meat that has been thinned out using a mallet, rolling pin or beaten with the handle of a knife, or merely butterflied.

50|$|A schnitzel is meat, usually thinned by {{pounding}} with a meat tenderizer, that is fried in {{some kind}} of oil or fat.

40|$|Objective: to {{describe}} the occasions when, the places where and people with whom respondents reported pork meat consumption. Design & Setting: Cross-sectional web based survey in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece and Poland, January 2008, with quota samples on gender (male, female), age categories (20 - 44 y and 45 - 70 y), and locality of residence (urban, rural with low pig production density and rural with high pig production density). Subjects: 2437 respondents (51 % women, 49 % men; mean age 41. 4 y SD 13. 1). Methods: Online computer based survey, including sociodemographic information, anthropometrics (weight, height), and further questions on frequency of pork consumption (30 common items, 17 country-specific items), the occasions (working day, any day, weekend, special occasions), the company (alone, with family, with friends, with others) and the place of actual consumption (at home, outside of home). Results are aggregated for the five European countries. Results: Tenderloin, mignonette, brochette together with pork shoulder ranked as the first choices for weekend and special occasions. The most out-of home consumed products are mixed gyros-pita meat, pork based brochette, pizza, small cuts, marinated meat, <b>escalope,</b> shoulder, tenderloin and mixed meat. The Greek country specific Sygglino, Tigania, and the Country-style sausage are amongst the main preferences for out of home consumption. At European level, most products are consumed at home and with the family. Meat products such as salami, ham, and similar products are amongst the first choices when eating alone. Semi-processed meat like brochettes, small cuts and marinated or ready to eat dishes as gyros-pitas and pizza are the main choice for eating {{in the company of}} friends. Conclusions: European respondents seem to make specific choices of food depending on to the occasions, the places and the company. This information highlights the potential orientation of consumers towards fresh meat for special occasions or weekends, and more processed and convenient products when alone or socializing. This information is also useful to address interventions aiming at the improvement of food related health in Europ...|$|E
40|$|Case description: A {{patient with}} a Barrett {{oesophageal}} carcinoma and a resection of the oesophagus with gastric pull-up developed swallowing disorders 6 years and 2 months after the operation. Within 1 year and 7 months two recurrences of the tumor at the anastomosis were found and treated with combined chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy respectively. 7 years and 9 months after the operation local tumor masses and destruction were present with no ability to orally drink or eat (full feeding by jejunal PEG tube) : quality of life was poor, as saliva and mucus were very viscous (pulling filaments) {{and could not be}} swallowed and had to be spat out throughout the day and night resulting in short periods of sleep (awaking from the necessity to spit out). In total the situation was interpreted more as a problem related to a feeling of choking (with food or fluid) {{in the sense of a}} functional dysphagia rather than as a swallowing disorder from a structural stenosis. At that time acetylcysteine (2 times 200 mg per day, given via the PEG tube) and irradiation with water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA), a special form of heat radiation, of the ventral part of the neck and the thorax were added to the therapy. Within 1 day with acetylcysteine saliva and mucus became less viscous. Within 2 days with wIRA (one day with 4 to 5 hours with irradiation with wIRA at home) salivation decreased markedly and quality of life clearly improved: For the first time the patient slept without interruption and without the need for sleep-inducing medication. After 5 days with wIRA the patient could eat his first soft dumpling although drinking of fluids was still not possible. After 2 ½ weeks with wIRA the patient could eat his first minced schnitzel (<b>escalope).</b> Following the commencement of wIRA (with typically approximately 90 – 150 minutes irradiation with wIRA per day) the patient had 8 months with good quality of life with only small amounts of liquid saliva and mucus and without the necessity to spit out. During this period the patient was able to sleep during the night. Discussion: The main physiological effects of water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) are: wIRA increases tissue temperature, tissue oxygen partial pressure and tissue perfusion markedly. The five main clinical effects of wIRA are: wIRA decreases pain, inflammation and exudation/hypersecretion, and promotes infection defense and regeneration, all in a cross-indication manner. Therefore there is a wide range of indications for wIRA. The effects of wIRA are based on both its thermal effects (relying on transfer of heat energy) and thermic effects (temperature-dependent effects, occurring together with temperature changes) as well as on non-thermal and temperature-independent effects like direct effects on cells, cell structures or cell substances. Conclusion: Besides in a variety of other indications for wIRA, in cases of swallowing disorders (functional dysphagia) and hypersalivation or hypersecretion of mucus the use of wIRA should be considered as part of the treatment regime for improving a patient’s quality of life...|$|E
