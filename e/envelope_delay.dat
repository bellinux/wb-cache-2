New techniques were used to measure behavioral thresholds and CEOAEs up to 16 kHz. A long cylindrical tube of 8 mm diameter, serving as a reflectionless termination, was used to calibrate audiometric stimuli and design a wideband CEOAE stimulus. A second click was presented 15 dB above a probe click level that varied over a 44 dB range, and a nonlinear residual procedure extracted a CEOAE from these click responses. In some subjects (age 14 â€“ 29 years) with normal hearing up to 8 kHz, CEOAE spectral energy and latency were measured up to 16 kHz. Audiometric thresholds were measured using an adaptive yes-no procedure. Comparison of CEOAE and behavioral thresholds suggested a clinical potential of using CEOAEs to screen for high-frequency hearing loss. CEOAE latencies determined from the peak of averaged, filtered temporal envelopes decreased to 1 ms with increasing frequency up to 16 kHz.

40|$|The Gubbio basin in Central Italy is a intermountain {{basin of}} extensional tectonic origin, typical of Central and Southern Apennines, {{characterized}} by moderate seismicity. The strongest recorded event within {{the area is}} a magnitude 5. 7 earthquake which occurred on 29 April 1984 along the Gubbio fault, bordering {{the eastern side of}} the basin. The main objective of this study is to analyze the features of earthquake ground motion as related to basin-edge effects, by performing physics-based numerical simulations of the 1984 earthquake through a high-performance spectral element code. The simulated ground motions are found in reasonable agreement with the recorded motions when using the kinematic source model developed by Ameri et al.

Pronounced differences were noted between records from the basin and adjacent sites at outcropping bedrock, owing to both the strong impedance contrast between soft alluvial sites and bedrock formations (lithostratigraphic amplification), as well as lateral discontinuities related to the 2 D/ 3 D geometry of the basin (generation of surface waves). Since the fault was located beneath the basin, 1 D amplification effects were found to be more relevant than those associated with the generation of surface waves from the basin edge.

40|$|In system theory, {{characterization}} {{and identification}} are fundamental problems. When the plant behavior is completely unknown, {{it may be}} characterized using certain model and then, its identification may be carried out with some artificial neural networks(ANN) like multilayer perceptron(MLP) or functional link artificial neural network(FLANN) using some learning rules such as back propagation (BP) algorithm. They offer flexibility, adaptability and versatility, so {{that a variety of}} approaches may be used to meet a specific goal, depending upon the circumstances and the requirements of the design specifications. The primary aim of the present thesis is to provide a framework for the systematic design of adaptation laws for nonlinear system identification and channel equalization. While constructing an artificial neural network the designer is often faced with the problem of choosing a network of the right size for the task. The advantages of using a smaller neural network are cheaper cost of computation and better generalization ability. However, a network which is too small may never solve the problem, while a larger network may even have the advantage of a faster learning rate. Thus it makes sense to start with a large network and then reduce its size. For this reason a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based pruning strategy is reported. GA is based upon the process of natural selection and does not require error gradient statistics. As a consequence, a GA is able to find a global error minimum. Transmission bandwidth {{is one of the most}} precious resources in digital communication systems. Communication channels are usually modeled as band-limited linear finite impulse response (FIR) filters with low pass frequency response. When the amplitude and the <b>envelope</b> <b>delay</b> response are not constant within the bandwidth of the filter, the channel distorts the transmitted signal causing intersymbol interference (ISI). The addition of noise during propagation also degrades the quality of the received signal. All the signal processing methods used at the receiver's end to compensate the introduced channel distortion and recover the transmitted symbols are referred as channel equalization techniques. When the nonlinearity associated with the system or the channel is more the number of branches in FLANN increases even some cases give poor performance. To decrease the number of branches and increase the performance a two stage FLANN called cascaded FLANN (CFLANN) is proposed. This thesis presents a comprehensive study covering artificial neural network (ANN) implementation for nonlinear system identification and channel equalization. Three ANN structures, MLP, FLANN, CFLANN and their conventional gradient-descent training methods are extensively studied. Simulation results demonstrate that FLANN and CFLANN methods are directly applicable for a large class of nonlinear control systems and communication problems...|$|E

The {{effect of this}} asynchrony on sensitivity to interaural time differences (ITDs) was assessed. DESIGN:: ITD sensitivity was measured in six bilateral cochlear implant listeners for single- and three-electrode stimuli. The three-electrode stimuli contained envelope modulations, either synchronous or asynchronous across electrodes, with delays of 1. 25 up to 5. 00 [*]ms. Each individual electrode carried the same ITD. Either neighboring electrodes were chosen or a separation of four electrodes to investigate the effect of electrode distance. RESULTS:: With synchronous envelopes, no difference in ITD sensitivity was found among single-electrode, adjacent three-electrode, and spaced three-electrode stimuli.

40|$|To {{localize}} {{sounds in}} space, humans heavily depend on minute interaural time differences (ITDs) generated by path-length differences {{to the two}} ears. Physiological studies of ITD sensitivity have mostly used deterministic, periodic sounds, in which either the waveform fine structure or a sinusoidal <b>envelope</b> is <b>delayed</b> interaurally. For natural broadband stimuli, however, auditory frequency selectivity causes individual channels {{to have their own}} envelopes; the temporal code in these channels is thus a mixture of fine structure and envelope.

In the inferior colliculus (IC) of the cat, a population of neurons was found in which envelope fluctuations dominate ITD sensitivity. This population extends over a surprisingly wide range of frequencies, including low frequencies for which fine-structure information is also available.

40|$|National audienceThe bounded {{geometry}} of the experimental setup {{used to measure the}} directivity and sensitivity of array elements may raise several difficulties. In order to obtain the frequency response of wideband elements, the most straightforward method would be to transmit short pulses, and then to derive the transfer functions by applying Fourier transforms to the received signals. Unfortunately this approach often leads to poor signal-to-noise ratios within each frequency band because the amplitude of the transmitted pulse is limited. The usual solution consists of measuring the frequency responses by means of successive harmonic pings. However, the duration of such signals is also limited because of the possible interference between the waves following the direct path and those occurring from reflection with the tank <b>envelope.</b> The <b>delays</b> between the times of arrival are as much shorter as the distance between the source and the array to be calibrated is large. On the other hand, this distance must be sufficient to have an acoustic field that is uniform in the receiving area, and also to limit the parallax effect. The balance between these competing parameters leads to configurations where the direct signal and the first specular echo are as close as possible before overlapping. In order to properly derive the transfer functions, it is therefore mandatory to be able to delineate precisely the boundaries of the signals received from the direct path. We present here a reliable method for tracking these signals...|$|R

To precisely define the strength of each scatterer, we present a method to define its birth and death locations along the measurement array.

This investigation is part of an extended ongoing research programme which is the first research programme regarding the vernacular architecture of Cyprus that includes in situ measurements of temperature, humidity and ventilation using data loggers and weather stations. The results indicate the bioclimatic design elements of Cyprus' vernacular architecture and more specifically the passive strategies for heating (solar gains, thermal mass, thermal inertia), cooling (sun-shading, ventilation) and optimization of environmental microclimatic conditions (planting, evaporation). The analysis shows a relatively stable indoor temperature regardless of the fluctuation of outdoor temperature due to the considerable thermal mass of the structure. The data also indicates that the internal temperature reaches a maximum value later in the day compared with the external environment. This is related to the thermal inertia of the building's <b>envelope</b> that <b>delays</b> the heat transfer from the external environment to the internal space.

Flow cytometric sorting is therefore a useful tool in aquatic sciences, as it provides material for post-sort analysis and culturing. Sorting subpopulations from natural communities, however, often requires handling morphologically diverse and complex particles with various abundances. Long particles, such as filament-forming cyanobacteria (> 100 -Î¼m long), prove very difficult to handle. These potentially toxic organisms are widespread in eutrophic systems and have important ecological consequences. Being able to sort filamentous cyanobacteria efficiently and as viable cells is therefore highly desirable when studying factors associated with their toxicity and occurrence. This unconventional sorting requires extensive user experience and special instrument setup. We have investigated the effect of hydrodynamic and electromechanical components of a flow cytometer, and sorting protocol on the quantitative sorting efficiency of these long particles using two filamentous cyanobacterial strains with average lengths of âˆ¼ 100 and âˆ¼ 300 Î¼m.
