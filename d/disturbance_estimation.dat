The newly proposed method exhibits the following two attractive features.

40|$|Rejection of {{periodic}} disturbances is {{an important}} issue in control theory and engineering applications. Conventional strategies like repetitive control and resonant control can deal adequately with this problem but they fail when the frequency of the disturbance varies with time. This paper proposes a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) resonant observer-based control for periodic signal rejection which is able to deal with the changes in frequency of the disturbance signal. The observer includes, in an embedded way, an internal model of the disturbance that is based on its harmonic decomposition. In this way, the frequency of the disturbance signal constitutes a parameter that can be adjusted according to the variations of the signal.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the dynamic effects of demand and supply {{disturbances}} on the Finnish economy. In addition, the study aims at finding out whether liberalization of capital movements affected the transmission of disturbances. The analysis is based on a vector autoregressive model for unemployment and the GNP from 1970. 1 to 1990. 4. The vector autoregressive representation is then transformed to a corresponding moving average representation and the dynamic effects of disturbances are analyzed by impulse response functions. The model restricts the number of disturbances to two, called demand and supply <b>disturbances.</b> <b>Estimation</b> shows that demand disturbances have temporary effects on GNP and unemployment, the effects of supply disturbances on GNP are permanent but their effects on unemployment are temporary. As capital mobility increases the effects of demand disturbances die out faster.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the problem of {{designing}} an adaptive observer for estimating unknown periodical disturbances. This is very practical problem because in the area of control of servomechanisms such disturbances are always encountered. When the disturbance cannot be directly measured or eliminated at the source it is necessary to perform a prediction. When a periodical disturbance is present the frequencies appear as unknown parameters {{and they have to be}} identified. In order to identify the unknown parameters, it is necessary to transform the composite system model, which contains the models of the controlled system and the disturbances, into observable canonical form. In addition, an inverse transformation is required to calculate the estimates of the present disturbances. In this report, firstly, a review of an adaptive observer for estimation of unknown periodical disturbances is presented. Later a calculation of the disturbance estimate is derived using the algebraic programming system REDUCE. The proposed method here allows to perform all the necessary transformations and to obtain the <b>disturbance</b> <b>estimation</b> without using the transformation matrix.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} general, {{scalable}} method to learn control-oriented thermal models of buildings that could enable wide-scale deployment of cost-effective predictive controls. An Unscented Kalman Filter augmented for parameter and <b>disturbance</b> <b>estimation</b> {{is shown to}} accurately learn and predict a building's thermal response. Recent studies of heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems have shown significant energy savings with advanced model predictive control (MPC). A scalable cost-effective method to readily acquire accurate, robust models of individual buildings' unique thermal envelopes has historically been elusive and hindered the widespread deployment of prediction-based control systems. Continuous commissioning and lifetime performance of these thermal models requires deployment of on-line data-driven system identification and parameter estimation routines.
