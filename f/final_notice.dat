The frigate Berenguela remained behind to guard against the possible escape of the merchant fleet. At 8.10 AM, the Numancia discharged two shots as <b>final</b> <b>notice</b> and to give opportunity for the people still in town to take cover. The bombardment itself started at 9 am and lasted for three hours without fire being returned, as Valparaíso was totally defenseless.|$|E

He first underwent five weeks of basic training at Nonsan military training camp and was later drafted into active duty. He had initially applied for a postponement {{because he was in}} the midst of shooting Grand Prix with actress Kim Tae-hee, and was cast to star in television drama Faith. He was also chosen to represent Korea as a goodwill ambassador at the 2010 Shanghai Expo. However, Military Manpower Administration declined and sent a <b>final</b> <b>notice</b> for enlistment, leading him to pull out of both projects. He served within the public relations department of the Ministry of National Defense.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the {{financial}} services industry has constantly been in the spotlight because of large-scale financial losses and complete failure. Some organisations include Barings Bank, UBS, Société Génerale and AIG, who all suffered massive losses due to incompetence and fraud. While previous research has focussed on market, credit and operational risk, {{there is still a}} lack of research for preventing operational risk. However, the correct ‘risk culture’ - a fairly new term – is crucial for managing and preventing operational risk. This has led to the term being {{one of the most prominent}} topics in the financial services industry today. This paper explores the top 15 <b>final</b> <b>notices</b> from each year, issued by the FCA for over £ 1, 000, 000 from 2012 – 2014 in order to find a common theme in the risk culture of financial institutions. In order to categorise the <b>final</b> <b>notices,</b> a framework by the Institute of Risk Management (2012) has been adopted. This framework will be applied to the NVivo software which will allow the <b>final</b> <b>notices</b> to be accurately analysed...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} paper I study {{the effects of}} operational risk events on the share prices of the financial services firms. Unlike other studies the information is delivered to the market through FSA's <b>Final</b> <b>Notices.</b> The loss amount however is also untraditional as I use the penalty set by the FSA as the loss amount. I analyse the abnormal returns of 23 companies from the US and the UK within the time period of 2002 - 2013. I found that there is a significant negative impact by the those operational risk events on the share prices within a window of - 5 and + 5 days around the event date. In addition the country of enlistment also had significant results as companies from the US had greater negative impact than those from the UK. The relative size of the penalty also proved to have significant impact as the firms with larger relative loss size had greater negative impact. In regression analysis the penalty also showed significant results as it was shown that the penalty seems to drive the severity of the impact. Overall the <b>Final</b> <b>Notices</b> issued by the FSA do indeed carry similar weight to the traditional information announcements even though when compared to the traditional research the negative reaction is not as lasting as the reaction of that research. However the size of the penalty proved {{to be a very good}} indicator of the severity of the operational risk event especially when there was no actual monetary loss...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{financial}} markets have been highlighted by large-scale financial failures due to incompetence and fraud, such as Barings, Daiwa, Allied Irish Banks, UBS, Société Génerale, and more recently JP Morgan. While previous research has focussed on market and credit risk, {{and even if the}} focus was on operational risk it concentrates on the market reaction to operational losses, the current research addresses the root of the problem. The current research explores the <b>final</b> <b>notices</b> issued by the FSA (now FCA and PRA) of over £ 1, 000, 000 from 2008 - 2013 in order to find a common theme in the operational risks of the financial institutions. In order to categorise the <b>final</b> <b>notices</b> a framework by McConnell (2008) has been adopted. With the help of this framework the risks are more accurately distinguished in either an incident, individual, institution, or industry area. The data analysis the frequently breached principles outlined by the FSA ‘principles for business’. The results from this allow the accurate categorisation of each case, and allow us to see where financial institution most often commit operational risks. The findings indicate {{that the vast majority of}} operational risks occur on an institutional level; however, the findings also show that no cases were attributed to solely the incident or industry area. Furthermore, two subcategories have been created in order to place the cases more accurately, these subcategories are a combination of the already existing areas; the individual and institution area, and the industry and institution area. This makes the tally for institutional area increase, and results in only 3 cases involving no institutional factors whatsoever. With these results suggestions to minimise the frequency and severity of operational risks are made in the form of adopting either a new regulatory body, which has already happened. The further suggestions include adopting a Dodd-Frank Act stress testing similar approach to risk management of financial institutions, or applying the Enterprise Wide Risk Management (EWRM) framework in order to stop risks in the earlier stages. However, it is important to consider the definition of risk, as it is not necessarily deemed a bad thing, especially for financial institutions who most take some risks in order to maintain competitive and profitable, the suggestions are therefore recommendations on determining what the good, and the bad risks are...|$|R

40|$|Financial Crisis of 2007 - 08 is an {{ultimate}} manifestation of how inefficient risk management in financial institutes {{can lead to}} global economic meltdown; it also highlights the need for effective control system and a healthy organizational culture. In recognition to this financial catastrophe, regulators had to stipulate higher capital reserves and buffers ratios, exclusively to cover up operational risks at financial institutes. The main aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze operational risks, especially that arise out of human factor using McConnell (2008) framework, which is a integration of four dimension namely incident, individual, institute and industry. Additional this research attempted to investigate any correlation that may exists between the four dimensions and tried to measure the extent to which this theoretical framework can be implemented in the real world. FCA <b>final</b> <b>notices</b> that are issued banks and insurance companies were used as the data source and qualitative content analysis was adopted as a research approach. Results of the analysis was supportive to McConnell framework and indicates that it can be put in industrial practice, but only as a basic framework because it was very generic.

40|$|The recent Global Financial Crisis was the {{ultimate}} manifestation for the recognition and appreciation of people risk, one of the dimensions constituting operational risk, highlighting the necessity of people risk management within the financial industry. In recognition {{of the magnitude of}} its impact, ‘people risk’ became a ’hot’ topic amongst the financial regulators, which resulted in the stipulation of assigning capital reserves, exclusively dedicated to its coverage. However, the nature of people risk is attached with the impediment of broadness and diversity, which leaves operational risk managers victims of uncertainty of its unidentified boundaries. With the purpose of analysing people risk, and capturing its scope, McConnell (2008) has developed a theoretical framework consisting of four ‘escalating’ dimensions, namely; incident, individual, institution and industry. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the extent to which this theoretical framework is applicable in practice, by conducting a qualitative content analysis using the Financial Services Advisory <b>Final</b> <b>Notices</b> imposed on banks and insurance firms as evidence. The investigation attempts to find whether there is a correlation between the theoretical framework and the ‘real’ evidence, in order to evaluate its validity. The analysis finds that, in fact, there is evidence assuring its validity, yet there is room for improvements for more accurate outcomes. The study recommends that the framework should expand the dimensions constituting the framework. Possible suggestions are to include additional dimensions in relation to system and process risk, and the ‘Three lines of defence’ model...|$|R
