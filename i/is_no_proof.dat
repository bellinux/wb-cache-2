5|$|After Kamo's {{release from}} prison, {{he worked in}} the Soviet customs office, by some {{accounts}} because he was too unstable to work for the secret police. He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling. Although there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> of foul play, some have theorized that Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet.|$|E
5|$|Another Dundee burghess {{family in}} the period {{produced}} prominent churchman, the family of Hervey de Dundee, Bishop of Caithness. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> that the two families were kindred, although in the early 1310s Thomas was recorded as assisting Hervey's brother Radulf de Dundee obtain a loan for his daughter's marriage portion.|$|E
5|$|William the Conqueror, {{the first}} Norman king of England, had {{a coat of}} arms with two lions. Richard the Lionheart used such a coat of arms with two lions on a red field (Loomis 1938, 47), from which the three lions of the coat of arms of England derive. However, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> that William's arms were not {{attributed}} to William after his death (Boutell, 18).|$|E

5|$|The hill {{stands at}} a {{strategic}} location overlooking {{the point where the}} River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett. Although there is some evidence of Roman visitation, the first fortification of the site was the construction of a Norman motte. It has been called King Alfred's Fort, however there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> of use by Alfred the Great. A medieval church was built on the hill in the 15th century. The current ruined church on top of the hill was built in 1793. The land and ruin were donated to the National Trust in 1946 as a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|With hostility towards reform growing, {{the poor}} results, and Kosygin's reformist stance, {{led to a}} popular {{backlash}} against him. Kosygin lost most of the privileges he had enjoyed before the reform, but Brezhnev {{was never able to}} remove him from the office of Chairman of the Council of Ministers, despite his weakened position. In the aftermath of his failed reform, Kosygin spent {{the rest of his life}} improving the economic administration through the modification of targets; he implemented various programmes to improve food security and ensure the future intensification of production. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> to back up the claim that the reform itself contributed to the high growth seen in the late-1960s, and that its cancellation had anything to do with the stagnating growth of the economy which began in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} extant manuscript, the Winchester Chronicle, {{was written}} by a single scribe up to the year 891. The scribe wrote the year number, DCCCXCII, in {{the margin of the}} next line; subsequent material {{was written by}} other scribes. This appears to place the composition of the chronicle at no later than 892; further evidence is provided by Bishop Asser's use of a version of the Chronicle in his work Life of King Alfred, known to have been composed in 893. It is known that the Winchester manuscript is at least two removes from the original Chronicle; as a result, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> that the Chronicle was compiled at Winchester. It is also difficult to fix the date of composition, but it is generally thought that the chronicles were composed during the reign of Alfred the Great (871–99), as Alfred deliberately tried to revive learning and culture during his reign, and encouraged the use of English as a written language. The Chronicle, as well as the distribution of copies to other centres of learning, may be a consequence of the changes Alfred introduced.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} stories of later Algerian involvement, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> since <b>no</b> Algerian prisoners <b>were</b> taken after Amgala.|$|R

5|$|Mickiewicz {{welcomed the}} Crimean War of 1853-1856, which {{he hoped would}} lead to a new European order {{including}} a restored independent Poland. His last composition, a Latin ode Ad Napolionem III Caesarem Augustum Ode in Bomersundum captum, honored Napoleon III and celebrated the British-French victory over Russia at the Battle of Bomarsund in the Åland Islands in August 1854. Polish émigrés associated with the Hôtel Lambert persuaded him to become active again in politics. Soon after the Crimean War broke out (October 1853), the French government entrusted him with a diplomatic mission. He left Paris on 11 September 1855, arriving in Constantinople, in the Ottoman Empire, on 22 September. There, working with Michał Czajkowski (Sadyk Pasha), he began organizing Polish forces to fight under Ottoman command against Russia. With his friend Armand Lévy he also set about organizing a Jewish legion. He returned ill from a trip to a military camp to his apartment on Yenişehir Street in the Pera (now Beyoğlu) district of Constantinople and died on 26 November 1855. Though Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński and others have speculated that political enemies might have poisoned Mickiewicz, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> of this, and he probably contracted cholera, which claimed other lives there at the time.|$|E
5|$|There {{are further}} {{multiple}} problems with Gorman's version of events. An apartment at 6 Cleveland Street {{could not have}} been raided in April 1888, since by that time Nos. 4–14 Cleveland Street had been demolished, and the house no longer existed. Annie and Alice were not supported by a wealthy patron, such as Albert Victor, but were paupers who occasionally lived in workhouses. Annie was not institutionalised for insanity but because of recurrent epilepsy. The Ripper victims were not known to be acquainted with each other or Annie Crook, who lived {{on the other side of}} Central London. Even if they had known her or her child, it is unlikely that their tale of royal illegitimacy would be believed, so any attempt by them to reveal the supposed scandal would merely have been dismissed. Gull retired from practice in 1887 after suffering a stroke, which left him temporarily partially paralysed and unable to speak. Gull did recover, but he suffered further attacks before his death in 1890. Furthermore, neither Lord Salisbury, nor Sir James Anderson, nor Sir William Gull were freemasons, and there is no documentary evidence linking Netley to the other suspects, nor did he drown in the Thames. He was actually killed in 1903 after falling under the wheels of his own van. The forensic evidence indicates that the bodies of the victims were not moved, and so were not dissected in a carriage and then moved to where they were discovered. Some of the streets where the victims were found were too narrow for a carriage. Sickert did not have a studio in Cleveland Street, and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> that he knew the Princess of Wales. Anderson was in Switzerland at the time of the double murder, and so was not one of the perpetrators.|$|E

25|$|According to {{some local}} historians, the {{throwing}} of confetti {{is a typical}} tradition from Basel that later spread {{to the rest of}} the world. While there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> for this theory, the amount of confetti used during Basler Fasnacht is huge in comparison to other carnivals.|$|E
25|$|A {{separate}} work, Procreatio, {{is attributed}} {{to him by the}} Latin commentaries on Aratus, Commentariorium in Aratum Reliquiae, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> of this connection. However, a direct citation (name and title) is rare in antiquity, and it may have referred to Book 1 of his History.|$|E

25|$|He {{had been}} a chronic heart patient and died in Lebanon in 1963 due to a cardiac arrest.

25|$|The corps's {{deterrence}} {{power has}} weakened however, {{together with the}} overall level of discipline in the IDF, although there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> of {{a link between the}} two. In 2007, military policemen (in all sectors) suffered 64 physical attacks – 53 on duty, and 11 off-duty. Jail instructors are generally assaulted off-duty, while the opposite goes for policemen in the law enforcement sector.|$|E
25|$|Others have {{suggested}} that the name derives from a Spanish pronunciation of the name of the Scottish buccaneer Peter Wallace, who established a settlement {{at the mouth of the}} Belize River in 1638. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> that Wallace settled in this area and some scholars have characterized this claim as a myth. Writers and historians {{have suggested}} several other possible etymologies, including postulated French and African origins.|$|E

25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> that Munck was {{the father}} of the crown prince. Erik Lönnroth has {{suggested}} that the anatomical problems mentioned in Munck's account, known only to a few initiated persons, were the primary factor in their delay in producing an heir. At the time, the rumors became more persistent, however, when the royal couple presented Munck with gifts: the King promoted him, and the Queen gave Munck a pension, a diamond ring, and a watch with her image.|$|E
25|$|The European Food Safety Authority {{concluded}} that chromium {{is not an}} essential nutrient, making this the only mineral for which the United States and the European Union disagree. The proposed mechanism for cellular uptake of CrIII via transferrin has been called into question.

A 2014 systematic review {{concluded that}} chromium supplementation {{had no effect on}} glycemic control, fasting plasma glucose levels, or body weight in people with or without diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Matilda was {{supported}} by her uncle King David of Scotland, {{and he did not}} accept Stephen's succession peacefully. Thus Eustace was placed in the front line of a new war, and when David invaded northern England Eustace's castle of Alnwick was among those captured by David in the first two months of the year (though it was returned in March). Stephen relieved Eustace of control of Bamburgh Castle when he returned from his punitive invasion of Lothian early in 1138. It has been claimed that Eustace must have gone over to David's side by the end of 1137, when David invaded northern England. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>proof</b> however that Eustace had switched allegiance at this point.|$|E
