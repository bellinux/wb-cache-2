The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of the Voyage of the Beagle as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the Andes near Mendoza. Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near Valparaiso, but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of symptoms, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life. Attempts to test Darwin's remains at Westminster Abbey by using modern PCR techniques were met with a refusal by the Abbey's curator.|$|E

25|$|Because {{they are}} insects, Grass Grub {{fall prey to}} almost all bird species present in the same areas, some {{examples}} of avian predators are; Larus marinus, <b>Great</b> <b>black</b> backed gull, especially when the areas inhabited by Grass Grub, undergo cultivation, Starlings Sturnus vulgaris and Black Birds Turdus merula seem to favour Grass Grub larvae in their third instar phase, {{as well as the}} adult beetle, and are often seen actively digging through the soil in areas with a high Grass Grub population. Another common predator of the Grass Grub is the Hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus whose intake of Grass Grub can be up to 40% of the total diet of an adult hedgehog. There are few invertebrate predators but they are not common in pastures.|$|E
25|$|Between 10,800 and 9500 BCE, the {{continental}} glaciers retreated {{north of the}} Great Lakes. Glacial lake outburst floods occurred during the melt outflow. Flooding disturbed archaeological layers of lithics and ceramics in the alluvium of the south branch of the Potomac at the Romney bridge replacement archaeological site. Early Lake Erie, which was Lake Michigan and Lake Erie combined, flowed west out from Little River (<b>Great</b> <b>Black</b> Swamp proglacial lake's drainage embayment) and the Wabash River, before changing direction to the east into Glacial Lake Iroquois. Earlier sediments built up event outbursts, near the Little River, more than once which altered the drainage direction and the remaining <b>Great</b> <b>Black</b> Swamp. 3000 years ago, Lake Michigan and Lake Erie assumed their present shapes. Lake Erie's water level was similar to Lake Nipioing phase of Lakes Michigan and Huron basins 5,000 years ago. By 3500 years ago, the level had lowered by four meters and by 2000 years ago the level had increased to possibly five meters above today's levels. The Hopewell culture arrived from the north in west central Ohio and Indiana at least 2000 years ago. Earlier trading peoples also from the north, a vanguard Armstrong variant, in southwest West Virginia mingled peacefully with Late Adena peoples. Cold-worked copper from the pits in Wisconsin Old Copper Complex region {{have been found in}} some Adena mounds. The Upper Ohio Valley was experiencing the Sub-Atlantic climatic phase (3000–1750 years ago) of warm and moist climatic conditions and stable stream levels upon the occurrence of the Hopewell culture. This climatic phase began after the much earlier appearance of indigenous Early Adena Culture (1735 BCE) in West Virginia.|$|E
25|$|He was vassal of the High-king of Beleriand, Thingol. Before {{the wars}} began {{he lived in}} Doriath. When Melian {{enclosed}} it with her magic Girdle of Melian to aid its defence he became uneasy and moved to Nan Elmoth outside the Girdle. One of the greatest Elven-smiths of Middle-earth, he forged Anglachel and Anguirel two <b>great,</b> <b>black,</b> magic swords. Made from a meteorite's metal, they can cut all earth-delved iron and have an entrapped sentience. His smithwork rivalled that of the greatest of the Elven-smiths, Fëanor and Celebrimbor, in both fame and fate. One sword, Anglachel, he gave to Thingol as tribute for living in Nan Elmoth and it was eventually used by Túrin to slay Glaurung the dragon. The other sword, Anguirel, he kept for himself. Eöl devised galvorn, a black metal of great strength and malleability, which he fashioned into armour that he wore when he went abroad. He was friend of the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost and, until {{the founding of the}} realms of the Noldor, all the traffic of goods between the Sindar and Dwarves passed through Nan Elmoth.|$|E
500|$|Aquino divided {{black magic}} into two forms, lesser <b>black</b> magic and <b>greater</b> <b>black</b> magic. He stated that lesser black magic entails [...] "impelling" [...] things {{that exist in}} the [...] "objective universe" [...] into doing a desired act by using [...] "obscure {{physical}} or behavioural laws" [...] and into this category he placed stage magic, psychodramas, politics, and propaganda. Conversely, he used the term <b>greater</b> <b>black</b> magic in reference to changes in the subjective universe of the magician, allowing them to realize their self in accordance with the principle of Xeper. Among Setians it is accepted that there may be changes in the objective universe as a result of <b>greater</b> <b>black</b> magic, however such effects are considered secondary to the impact that they have on the subjective universe.|$|R

500|$|The {{success of}} the Erie Canal {{inspired}} many other canal projects.

Detroit was [...] up the Detroit River from Lake Erie, and faced the difficult barrier of the <b>Great</b> <b>Black</b> Swamp to the south. Because of this, Detroit was less suited to new transportation projects such as canals, and later railroads, than was Toledo. From this perspective on the rapidly developing Midwest of the 1820s and 1830s, both states had much to gain by controlling the land in the Toledo Strip.|$|E
