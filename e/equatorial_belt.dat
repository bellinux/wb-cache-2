All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding {{the north and south}} polar regions, are indicated as SystemII and have been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 38min 25.4sec (810.76°/d). SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the Voyager flybys, it has been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d). Because it is close to SystemII, it has largely superseded it.|$|E

On Neptune, thin wispy clouds which could possibly be cirrus have been detected over the Great Dark Spot. As on Uranus, these are probably methane crystals.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 1890s, larger telescopes allowed {{astronomers to}} {{directly}} observe large scale {{features on the}} surfaces of the Galilean satellites including Io. In 1892, William Pickering measured Io's shape using a micrometer, and similar to his measurement of Ganymede, found it to have an elliptical outline aligned with the direction of its orbital motion. Other astronomers between 1850 and 1895 noted Io's elliptical shape. Edward Barnard observed Io while it transited {{across the face of}} Jupiter, finding the poles of Io to be dark compared to a brighter equatorial band. Initially, Barnard concluded that Io was in fact a binary of two dark bodies, but observations of additional transits against Jovian cloud bands of different brightness and the round shape of Io's shadow on the Jovian cloud tops caused him to change his interpretation. The egg-shape of Io reported by Pickering was the result of measuring only the bright equatorial band of Io, and mistaking the dark poles for background space. Later telescopic observations confirmed Io's distinct reddish-brown polar regions and yellow-white equatorial band. Observations of variations in the brightness of Io as it rotated, made by Joel Stebbins in the 1920s, showed that Io's day was the same length as its orbital period around Jupiter, thus proving that one side always faced Jupiter just as the Moon's near-side always faces the Earth. Stebbins also noted Io's dramatic orange coloration, which was unique among the Galilean satellites. Audouin Dollfus used observations of Io in the early 1960s at the Pic du Midi Observatory to create crude maps of the satellite that showed a patchwork of bright and dark spots across the Ionian surface, as well as a bright <b>equatorial</b> <b>belt</b> and dark polar regions.|$|E

With fluctuations in visibility, Cassini's spot was observed from 1665 to 1713; however, the 118-year observational gap makes the identity of the two spots inconclusive, and the older spot's shorter observational history and slower motion than the modern spot make their identity unlikely.|$|E

(2016, Icarus 274, 106 - 115). Baines et al. (2016, Icarus, submitted) showed that the GRS spectrum measured by the visual channels of the Cassini VIMS instrument in 2000 could be accurately fit by a cloud model in which the chromophore appeared as a physically thin layer of small particles immediately above the main cloud layer of the GRS. Here we show that the same chromophore and same layer location can also provide close matches to the short wave spectra of many other cloud features on Jupiter, suggesting this material may be a nearly universal chromophore that could explain the various degrees of red coloration on Jupiter. This is a robust conclusion, even for 12 % changes in VIMS calibration and large uncertainties in the refractive index of the main cloud layer due to uncertain fractions of NH 4 SH and NH 3 in its cloud particles. The chromophore layer can account for color variations among north and south <b>equatorial</b> <b>belts,</b> <b>equatorial</b> zone, and the Great Red Spot, by varying particle size from 0. 12 microns to 0. 29 microns and 1 -micron optical depth from 0. 06 to 0. 76. The total mass of the chromophore layer is much less variable, ranging from 18 to 30 micrograms/cm^ 2, except in the equatorial zone, where it is only 10 - 13 micrograms/cm^ 2. We also found a depression of the ammonia volume mixing ratio in the two belt regions, which averaged 0. 4 - 0. 5 X 10 ^{- 4 } immediately below the ammonia condensation level, while the other regions averaged twice that value.

The assumption he makes is inadmissible. He supposes that {{all parts of the}} nebulous spheroid when it filled Neptune's orbit, had the same angular velocities. But the process of nebular condensation as indicated above, implies that the remoter flocculi of nebulous matter, later in reaching the central mass, and forming its peripheral portions, will acquire, during their longer journeys towards it, greater velocities. An inspection of one of the spiral nebulæ, as 51st or 99th Messier, at once shows that the outlying portions when they reach the nucleus, will form an <b>equatorial</b> <b>belt</b> moving round the common centre more rapidly than the rest. Thus the central parts will have small angular velocities, while there will be increasing angular velocities of parts increasingly remote from the centre.

Mangrove, that horror of the African voyager, shines by its absence; and the soil is not mud, but humus based on gravels or on ruddy clays, stiff and retentive.

This tracking experiment was done at many different wavelengths including the 3 - 0 S(1) and S(0) hydrogen quadrupole lines {{as well as several}} broad band methane absorptions. The June 1983 hydrogen quadrupole data was reduced and equivalent widths were measured for approximately 25 east-west positions across the planet at 7 different latitudes for both wavelengths. The data for the South Tropical Zone (20 deg.

The value of the equivalent width is also quite sensitive to the height of the NH 3 cloud top and to the value used for the single scattering albedo. A combination of these parameters changing on a diurnal time scale could also explain these observations.

We use radiative transfer models to constrain the altitude region of both the solar and thermal components of Jupiter's 5 -meter spectrum. Results: For nearly all latitudes on Jupiter the thermal component is large enough to constrain the deep cloud structure even when upper clouds are present. We find that Hot Spots, belts, and high latitudes have broader line profiles than do zones. Radiative transfer models show that Hot Spots in the North and South <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Belts</b> (NEB, SEB) typically do not have opaque clouds at pressures greater than 2 bars. The South Tropical Zone (STZ) at 32 degrees South has an opaque cloud top between 4 and 5 bars. From thermochemical models this must be a water cloud. We measured the variation of the equivalent width of CH 3 D with latitude for comparison with Jupiter's belt-zone structure. We also constrained the vertical profile of H 2 O in an SEB Hot Spot and in the STZ. The Hot Spot is very dry for a probability less than 4. 5 bars and then follows the H 2 O profile observed by the Galileo Probe.
