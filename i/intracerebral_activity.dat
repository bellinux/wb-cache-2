40|$|Introduction. Pain is a multi-dimensional experience, {{including}} sensory, affective, {{and cognitive}} components. How these different dimensions integrate into a unified and coherent percept {{remains an open}} question. Gamma-band oscillations (GBOs, 30 - 100 Hz) could represent a possible mechanism to integrate low-level cortical processing of basic stimulus features with high-level cognitive processes. In the present study, we used direct intracerebral recordings performed in humans to investigate whether nociceptive stimulation elicits nociceptive-specific GBOs in the insula, a region considered {{to play a major}} role in pain perception. Methods. <b>Intracerebral</b> <b>activity</b> was recorded from a total of 60 insular sites in 5 patients with deep multicontact electrodes, implanted for the presurgical evaluation of focal epilepsy. Patients received stimulation from four sensory modalities: thermonociceptive, tactile, auditory, and visual. Participants were instructed to rate the intensity of each stimulus on a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10. Results. There was no significant difference in ratings of intensity across modalities. In 4 / 5 patients, nociceptive stimuli consistently elicited a clear enhancement of GBO power at insular contacts, peaking 245 ms ± 12 ms after stimulus onset (Fig. 1), but not at other intracerebral contacts. Vibrotactile, auditory, and visual stimuli did not elicit such high frequency responses at any of the recorded contacts. Conclusion. Nociceptive stimuli elicit consistent GBOs in the human insula. Because non-nociceptive stimuli do not elicit a similar response, these high frequency oscillations could reflect activity specific for nociception, possibly involved in the integration of stimulus-driven and top-down determinants of pain perception...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : Insular {{epilepsy}} is {{rare and}} difficult to diagnose. Surface electroencephalography is not modified by specific insular epileptiform activity (EA), and there are few clinical features pointing specifically to an insular ictal onset zone (IOZ). Functions attributed to the insula include autonomic regulation and somesthesic integration. Furthermore, the insula is thought {{to play a major}} role in the perception of pain, a multi-dimensional experience, including sensory, affective, and cognitive components. We recently found that nociceptive stimuli elicit consistent gamma-band oscillations (GBO) in the human insula (manuscript in preparation: Pain specific gamma-band oscillation in the human insula. Same authors). Because non-nociceptive stimuli do not elicit a similar response, these high frequency oscillations could reflect activity specific for nociception. Here we analysed how EA affects GBO within insular cortex. Methods : <b>Intracerebral</b> <b>activity</b> was recorded from a total of 8 insulae in 7 patients with deep multicontact electrodes, implanted for the presurgical evaluation of focal epilepsy. Other brain regions were also recorded, according to clinical hypotheses for IOZ. Patients received stimulation belonging to four different sensory modalities: thermonociceptive, tactile, auditory, and visual. Interictal EA was characterized as specific insular activity when present only within insular contacts. Insular IOZ was determined as an electroclinical onset specific to the insula, or simultaneous with other brain regions. Results: In 4 / 8 patients, nociceptive stimuli consistently elicited a clear enhancement of GBO power at insular contacts, peaking 245 ms ± 12 ms after stimulus onset, but not at other intracerebral contacts. Vibrotactile, auditory, and visual stimuli did not elicit such high frequency responses at any of the recorded contacts. Three out of 4 insulae with nociceptive-specific GBOs did not show any specific insular interictal EA (Table 1). Conversely, when specific insular interictal EA was present, only 1 / 5 insulae showed nociceptive-specific GBOs. Insular IOZ was found in 2 patients, one showing nociceptive-specific GBOs (Table 1). Conclusion: Nociceptive stimuli elicit consistent GBOs in some, but not all observed insulae. Preliminary results show that presence of specific interictal EA might contribute to the variability of this response. Further analysis is necessary to confirm our observations, and to explore possible clinical implications in clinical pain perception or in ictal semiology...|$|E
40|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} {{are characterized by}} an exaggerated fear response towards a non-harmful stimulus or situation. Exposure therapy is an effective treatment and consists of repeated non-reinforced exposures to the stimulus. Currently the index of beneficial learning is the decreased level of fear {{at the end of}} an exposure session. For patients this therapy is emotionally very demanding and dropout rates are high. In addition, many patients are prone to relapse in a context and time dependent manner. In rodents, the explicit model for exposure therapy is extinction learning. After initial pairing of a previous neutral stimulus (tone) with a negative outcome (shock), animals will show a directed fear reaction (conditioned response) during re-exposure. Multiple re-exposures of the animal to the stimulus without further reinforcement lead to a gradual decay of fear (extinction training). This fear decay is shown to be based on relearning processes. Over time the original memory trace of the tone predicting the shock is opposed and inhibited by the new association that the tone does not predict the shock any longer. The focus of this work was to dissect extinction learning at the behavioural and the molecular level in a mouse model of conditioned fear. We want to critically revise nomenclature and to provide mechanistic insights and possible transfers to clinical application and to increase the persistence of fear extinction. In the first set of experiments, we showed that fear deacy during exposure (within-session) to a permanent stimulus is mediated by the endocannabionid system, involving glutamatergic neurons but not stress hormone signalling. In the second set of experiments, we challenged the view that the fear level {{at the end of an}} exposure session (within-session extinction) is the indicator for the strenght of between-session extinction. By comparing different exposure approaches, we were able to show that the decline of fear during exposures did not predict formation of between-session extinction, nor was it a prerequisite. Multiple short and unpredictable exposures to the stimuli were most effective in producing between-session extinction, compared to a permanent exposure. Starting from our results obtained in the first set of experiments we further demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system is essential for within-session extinction but not for between-session extinction. The dissociation of within-session and between-session extinction allowed us to pin down the basolateral amygdala, the cingulate cortex and the dentate gyrus as possible centers of relearning by measuring c-Fos immunoreactivity in various brain areas. Even after successful completion of extinction training subjects are prone to relapse. Reconsolidation, elicited by re-exposure, was recently identified as a phase where the original fear memory becomes vulnerable again to selective modifications. Therefore in the third set of experiments, we tried to interfere with reconsolidation in order to achieve a long lasting decrease in conditioned fear. By inhibition of <b>intracerebral</b> <b>activity</b> of PKC, within- and between- session extinction were facilitated and moreover renewal and spontanous recovery, as a control for relapse, were abolished. We showed for the first time that reconsolidation can be manipulated without having any negative influences on memory consolidation during extinction training. By means of c-Fos immunohistochemistry we were able to identifiy the cin 7 gulate cortex as a candidate region to mediate reconsolidation processes. In summary this study demonstrates for the first time that endocannabinoid signalling at glutamatergic neurons in the forebrain is essential for within-session extinction but also independent of CRH signalling and corticosterone secretion. Second, within-session and between- session extinction can be dissociated at the behavioural, anatomical and molecular level. Third, by blocking reconsolidation, the conditioned fear memory trace can be degraded during extinction, thus resulting in a lasting decrease of fear. These findings challenge a number of facts, which have been taken for granted in current psychotherapy practice. We hope that this thesis will contribute to develop new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of phobias or trauma-related anxiety disorders...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that theta rhythms (3 - 8 Hz) are the {{fingerprint}} of hippocampus, and that neural activity accompanying encoding of words differs according to whether the items are later remembered or forgotten ["subsequent memory effect" (SME) ]. Here, we tested the hypothesis that temporal synchronization of theta rhythms among hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex is related to immediate memorization of repeated words. To address this issue, <b>intracerebral</b> electroencephalographic (EEG) <b>activity</b> was recorded in five subjects with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), under presurgical monitoring routine. During the recording of the <b>intracerebral</b> EEG <b>activity,</b> the subjects performed a computerized version of Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT), a popular test for the clinical evaluation of the immediate and delayed memory. They heard the same list of 15 common words for five times. Each time, immediately after listening the list, the subjects were required to repeat as many words as they could recall. Spectral coherence of the <b>intracerebral</b> EEG <b>activity</b> was computed in order to assess the temporal synchronization of the theta (about 3 - 8 Hz) rhythms among hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal-occipital neocortex. We found that theta coherence values between amygdala and hippocampus, and between hippocampus and occipital-temporal cortex, were higher in amplitude during successful than unsuccessful immediate recall. A control analysis showed that this was true also for a gamma band (40 - 45 Hz). Furthermore, these theta and gamma effects were not observed in an additional (control) subject with drug-resistant TLE and a wide lesion to hippocampus. In conclusion, a successful immediate recall to the RAVLT was associated to the enhancement of temporal synchronization of the theta (gamma) rhythms within a cerebral network including hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal-occipital neocortex...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Previous {{evidence}} in epileptic subjects {{has shown that}} theta (about 4 - 7 Hz) and gamma rhythms (about 40 - 45 Hz) of hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex were temporally synchronized during the listening of repeated words successfully remembered (Babiloni et al., 2009). Here we re-analyzed those electroencephalographic (EEG) data to test whether a parallel increase in amplitude of late positive event-related potentials takes place. Methods: <b>Intracerebral</b> electroencephalographic (EEG) <b>activity</b> had been recorded in five subjects with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, undergoing pre-surgical evaluation. During the recording of the <b>intracerebral</b> EEG <b>activity,</b> the subjects performed a computerized version of the Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT). They heard the same list of 15 common words for five times. Each time, immediately after the listening of the list, the subjects were required to repeat as many words as they could recall. Results: We found that late positive event-related potentials (ERPs) peaking at about 350 ms post-stimulus in amygdala, hippocampus, and occipital-temporal cortex had a higher amplitude during the listening of the repeated words that were subsequently recalled than for those that were not recalled. Conclusions: Late positive ERPs reflect a functional mechanism implemented in a human brain network spanning amygdala, hippocampus, and occipital-temporal cortex {{which is at the}} basis of the memorization processes of verbal materials. Significance: This ERP component is a promising neuromarker of successful memorization of repeated words in humans. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

40|$|In press, {{corrected}} proof. Available online 16 April 2008. International audienceThe multistable {{perception of}} speech {{refers to the}} perceptual changes experienced while listening to a speech form cycled in rapid and continuous repetition, the so-called Verbal Transformation Effect. Because distinct interpretations of the same repeated stimulus alternate spontaneously, this effect provides an invaluable tool to examine how speech percepts are formed in the listener's mind. In order to track the temporal dynamics of brain activity specifically linked to perceptual changes, <b>intracerebral</b> EEG <b>activity</b> was recorded from two implanted epileptic patients while performing a verbal transformation task. To this aim, {{they were asked to}} carefully listen to a speech sequence played repeatedly and to press a button whenever they perceived a change in the repeated utterance. For both patients, 300 - 800 ms prior to the reported perceptual transitions, high frequency activity in the gamma band range (> 40 Hz) was observed within the left inferior frontal and supramarginal gyri. An additional auditory decision task was used to {{rule out the possibility that}} the increased gamma band activity was due to the patients' motor responses. These results suggest that articulatory-based representations play a key part in the endogenously driven emergence of auditory speech percepts. The findings are interpreted in relation to theories assuming a link between perception and action in the human speech processing system...|$|R
40|$|Sleep is {{traditionally}} considered a global process involving the whole brain. However, {{recent studies have}} shown that sleep depth is not evenly distributed within the brain. Sleep disorders, such as sleepwalking, also suggest that EEC features of sleep and wakefulness might be simultaneously present in different cerebral regions. In order to probe the coexistence of dissociated (wake-like and sleep-like) electrophysiological behaviors within the sleeping brain, we analyzed <b>intracerebral</b> electroencephalographic <b>activity</b> drawn from sleep recordings of five patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy without sleep disturbances, who underwent pre-surgical intracerebral electroencephalographic investigation. We applied spectral and wavelet transform analysis techniques to electroencephalographic data recorded from scalp and intracerebral electrodes localized within the Motor cortex (Mc) and the dorso-lateral Prefrontal cortex (dIPFc). The Mc showed frequent Local Activations (lasting from 5 to more than 60 s) characterized by an abrupt interruption of the sleep electroencephalographic slow waves pattern and by the appearance of a wake-like electroencephalographic high frequency pattern (alpha and/or beta rhythm). Local activations in the Mc were paralleled by a deepening of sleep in other regions, as expressed by the concomitant increase of slow waves in the dIPFc and scalp electroencephalographic recordings. These results suggest that human sleep can be characterized by the coexistence of wake-like and sleep-like electroencephalographic patterns in different cortical areas, supporting the hypothesis that unusual phenomena, such as NREM parasomnias, could result from an imbalance of these two states.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{activation of the}} innate immune system in murine toxoplasmosis, T- and B-cell-deficient SCID mice and their co-isogenic immunocompetent C. B- 17 counterparts were orally infected with a low-virulent strain of Toxoplasma gondii (DX strain). SCID mice developed a fatal necrotizing toxoplasmosis, whereas CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells contributing to inflammatory infiltrates conferred resistance to immunocompetent mice. Significant amounts of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were detectable in SCID mice. The most likely source for this cytokine is activated natural killer (NK) cells. In comparison to immunocompetent mice IFN-gamma levels were reduced in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of SCID mice at days 7 and 14 of disease. Similar amounts of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) were detected in both strains of mice. In addition, immunohistochemistry showed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen expression on SCID and C. B- 17 microglial cells and macrophages demonstrating activation of these cells in both strains. However, the up-regulation of MHC class II antigen on microglia was less pronounced in SCID mice, presumably due to reduced levels of IFN-gamma. Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) levels in CSF and serum were elevated in both strains and correlated with systemic and <b>intracerebral</b> disease <b>activity.</b> In conclusion, our results demonstrate activation of macrophages and NK cells as the predominant defence mechanisms of the comprised SCID immune system during toxoplasma infection.

40|$|International audienceIn epileptic {{patients}} {{candidate to}} surgery, {{the interpretation of}} EEG signals recorded either within (depth EEG) or at the surface (scalp EEG) of the head is a crucial issue to determine epileptogenic brain regions and to define subsequent surgical strategy. This task remains difficult {{as there is no}} simple relationship between the spatiotemporal features of neuronal generators (convoluted cortical dipole layers) and the electric field potentials recorded by the electrodes. Indeed, this relationship depends on the complex interaction of several factors regarding involved cortical sources: location, area, geometry, and synchronization of neuronal activity. A computational model is proposed to address this issue. It relies on a neurophysiologically relevant model of EEG signals, which combines an accurate description of both the <b>intracerebral</b> sources of <b>activity</b> and the transfer function between dipole layers and recorded field potentials. The model is used, on the one hand, to quantitatively study the influence of source-related parameters on the properties of simulated signals, and on the other hand, to jointly analyze depth EEG and scalp EEG signals. In this article, the authors review some of the results obtained from the model with respect to the literature on the interpretation of EEG signals in the context of epilepsy...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{vestibular}} {{system is}} connected to spinal, cerebellar and cerebral motor control structures and can be selectively activated with external electrodes. The resulting sensation of disturbed balance can be avoided by using stochastic stimulation patterns. Adding noise to the nervous system sometimes improves function. Small clinical trials suggest that stochastic vestibular stimulation (SVS) may improve symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. We have investigated this claim and possible mechanisms using the 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) hemilesion model of Parkinson’s disease. Methodology/Principal Findings: Animals were tested in the accelerating rod test and the Montoya staircase test of skilled forelimb use. In 6 -OHDA hemilesioned animals, SVS improved rod performance by 56611 s. At group level L-DOPA treatment had no effect, but positive responders improved time on rod by 60619 s. Skilled forelimb use was not altered by SVS. To investigate how SVS may influence basal ganglia network <b>activity,</b> <b>intracerebral</b> microdialysis was employed in four regions of interest during and after SVS. In presence of the c-amino buturic acid (GABA) transporter inhibitor NNC 711, SVS induced an increase in GABA to 150615 % of baseline in the substantia nigra (SN) of unlesioned animals, but had no effect in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), the striatum or the ventromedial thalamus (VM). Dopamine release remained stable in all areas, as did GABA and amine concentrations in the SN of unstimulated controls. Following SVS, a sustained increase in GABA concentrations was observed in the ipsilesional, {{but not in the}} contralesional SN of 6 -OHDA hemilesioned rats. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn human partial epilepsies and in {{experimental}} models of chronic and/or acute epilepsy, {{the role of}} inhibition {{and the relationship between}} the inhibition and excitation and epileptogenesis has long been questioned. Besides experimental methods carried out either in vitro (human or animal tissue) or in vivo (animals), pathophysiologic mechanisms can be approached by direct recording of brain electrical activity in human epilepsy. Indeed, in some clinical presurgical investigation methods like stereoelectroencephalography, intracerebral electrodes are used in patients suffering from drug resistant epilepsy to directly record paroxysmal activities with excellent temporal resolution (in the order of 1 millisecond). The study of neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying such depth-EEG activities is crucial to progress in the understanding of the interictal to ictal transition. In this study, the authors relate electrophysiologic patterns typically observed during the transition from interictal to ictal activity in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) to mechanisms (at a neuronal population level) involved in seizure generation through a computational model of EEG <b>activity.</b> <b>Intracerebral</b> EEG signals recorded from hippocampus in five patients with MTLE during four periods (during interictal activity, just before seizure onset, during seizure onset, and during ictal activity) were used to identify the three main parameters of a model of hippocampus EEG activity (related to excitation, slow dendritic inhibition and fast somatic inhibition). The identification procedure used optimization algorithms to minimize a spectral distance between real and simulated signals. Results demonstrated that the model generates very realistic signals for automatically identified parameters. They also showed that the transition from interictal to ictal activity cannot be simply explained by an increase in excitation and a decrease in inhibition but rather by time-varying ensemble interactions between pyramidal cells and local interneurons projecting to either their dendritic or perisomatic region (with slow and fast GABAA kinetics). Particularly, during preonset activity, an increasing dendritic GABAergic inhibition compensates a gradually increasing excitation up to a brutal drop at seizure onset when faster oscillations (beta and low gamma band, 15 to 40 Hz) are observed. These faster oscillations are then explained by the model feedback loop between pyramidal cells and interneurons targeting their perisomatic region. These findings obtained from model identification in human temporal lobe epilepsy are in agreement with some results obtained experimentally, either on animal models of epilepsy or on the human epileptic tissue...|$|R

Matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9, Gelantinase B) {{has been shown}} to relate to stroke and the development of aneurysm and may increase risks of <b>intracerebral</b> hemorrhage. MMP <b>activities</b> are modulated by their endogenous inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). We analyzed the genetic variants of MMP- 9 and TIMP- 1 and SDICH susceptibility. Associations were tested by logistic regression or general linear models with adjusting for multiple covariables. Multiplicative terms between genes were applied to detect the interaction effects on SDICH. Permutation testing of 1, 000 replicates was performed for empirical estimates. In the group of ≥ 65 years old (y/o), we found associations of SDICH with rs 3787268 (Odds ratio [OR] = 0. 48, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 27 to 0. 86, P = 0. 01) and haplotype 1 (Hap 1) (OR = 0. 48, 95 % CI 0. 26 to 0. 86, P = 0. 014). For TIMP 1 gene, rs 4898 was associated with SDICH in the elder male group (OR = 0. 35, 95 % CI 0. 15 to 0. 81, P = 0. 015). In contrast, in the younger male group, there were associations of SDICH with rs 2250889 (OR = 0. 48, 95 % CI 0. 27 to 0. 84, P = 0. 01) and Hap 3 (OR = 0. 61, 95 % CI 0. 38 to 0. 97, P = 0. 04). We found significant genetic interaction between TIMP- 1 and MMP- 9 in SDICH susceptibility among younger male subjects (P = 0. 004). In subjects carrying rs 4898 minor allele, carriers with Hap 3 had lower SDICH risk than non-carriers (OR = 0. 19, 95 % CI 0. 07 to 0. 51, P = 0. 001). In addition, this study showed that when young males were exposed to alcohol, Hap 3 was a protective factor of SDICH (OR = 0. 06, 95 % CI 0. 01 to 0. 27, P = 0. 0002).
