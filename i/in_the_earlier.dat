5|$|Despite the disappointment, the Commonwealth {{was able}} to take {{advantage}} of the Russian weakness and through the territorial advances accomplished to reverse the eastern losses suffered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> decades.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> {{part of his}} life, Yeats was {{a member}} of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Due to the {{escalating}} tension of the political scene, Yeats distanced himself from the core political activism in the midst of the Easter Rising, even holding back his poetry inspired by the events until 1920.|$|E

5|$|A PC Engine port of Ninja Ryūkenden was {{produced}} in 1992, published by Hudson Soft and released only in Japan; it features more colorful and detailed graphics, along with difficulty and gameplay tweaks and a different soundtrack. This version also supports three different language settings with Japanese, English and Chinese as the available options. However, the English translation used in this version differs from the one used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> NES version. To switch between the three settings, the player must press the Select + I + II buttons simultaneously at the title screen, which will change the text under the logo to the appropriate characters.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, popular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> 20th century and still represented today, the medieval {{cultures in the}} area of modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who then would need to be regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} each 20 minute meal in {{the dining}} hall, the forks, spoons and knives were laid out on the table and {{carefully}} counted to ensure that nothing had been taken as a potential weapon. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> years as a prison, prisoners were forbidden from talking while eating, but this was later relaxed, provided that the prisoners communicated quietly.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater is {{mentioned}} {{both in the}} Domesday Book and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle dating from around 800, owing its origin as a trade centre to its position {{at the mouth of}} the chief river in Somerset. It was formerly part of the Hundred of North Petherton. In a legend of Alfred the Great, he burnt some cakes while hiding in the marshes of Athelney near Bridgwater, after the Danish invasion in 875, while in 878 the major engagement of the Battle of Cynwit may have been at nearby Cannington.|$|E
5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were made}} under Lord Tyrawley during his term as governor, but progress was hindered by his confrontational {{relationship with his}} senior engineer, William Skinner. Gibraltar's defences were stronger {{than they had been}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> siege but still had many deficiencies. The fortress seemed at first sight to be well-armed, with 339 cannon in 1744, but this number concealed the fact that they consisted of at least eight different calibres, some made of brass and some of iron – which meant greatly differing levels of reliability – and they required many different types of spares and ammunition, adding to the garrison's logistical problems.|$|E

5|$|Radial {{cleavage}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> {{divisions of}} <b>the</b> egg {{appears to be}} the original condition for <b>the</b> ancestral bilaterians, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> Ecdysozoa and possibly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> Eutrochozoa, a major sub-group of the Lophotrochozoa. Hence radial cleavage does not imply that brachiopods are affiliated with deuterostomes.|$|R

5|$|HMS Zealous {{was given}} a {{straight}} stem and a rounded stern, but her hull was otherwise unmodified from her original form; it had been found that lengthening the hull, as was done <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> , led to longitudinal weakness. Her conversion to a central battery ironclad therefore cost {{less than that of}} any of her contemporaries, though this was offset with a shorter battery and therefore a less effective broadside. She also carried less armour than the earlier class, and was nearly a knot slower; however, as she was built to serve in distant waters, and not expected to face opposing ships of significant force, these shortcomings were thought acceptable.|$|E
5|$|In The Lord of the Rings Tolkien {{pretends to}} be merely the {{translator}} of Bilbo and Frodo's memoirs, collectively known as the Red Book of Westmarch.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> {{stages of}} the disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are quite similar to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, Justinian became {{ever more}} {{inclined}} towards the Monophysite doctrine, especially in the form of Aphthartodocetism, but he died before being able to issue any legislation. The empress Theodora sympathized with the Monophysites and {{is said to have been}} a constant source of pro-Monophysite intrigues at the court in Constantinople <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> years. In the course of his reign, Justinian, who had a genuine interest in matters of theology, authored a small number of theological treatises.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{conditions}} of the 1982 competition was that the new wing had to include commercial offices as well as public gallery space. However, in 1985 it became possible to devote the extension entirely to the Gallery's uses, due to a donation of almost £50 million from Lord Sainsbury and his brothers Simon and Sir Tim Sainsbury. A closed competition was held, and the schemes produced were noticeably more restrained than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> competition.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into threeparts. In the first 20-minute period, cars finishing 16th or lower were eliminated. The second qualifying period lasted for 15minutes, {{at the end of}} which the fastest ten cars went into the final period, to determine their grid positions for the race. Cars failing to make the final period were allowed to be refuelled before the race but those competing in it were not, and so carried more fuel than they had done <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> qualifying sessions.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{equipment}} of a 4th-century foot soldier was {{essentially the same}} as in the 2nd century: metal armour cuirass, metal helmet, shield and sword. Some evolution took place during the 3rd century. Trends included the adoption of warmer clothing; the disappearance of distinctive legionary armour and weapons; the adoption by the infantry of equipment used by the cavalry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> period; and the greater use of heavily armoured cavalry called cataphracts.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral's {{architecture}} {{presents a}} harmonious whole which is entirely Gothic and {{mostly in the}} Early English style of the late 12th and early 13th centuries.

5|$|The pair {{interview}} {{the cast and}} crew as suspects, discovering that many would benefit from either of the deaths—producer Kenny Neiderman had been having an affair with Danbury; Rowdy Beeman replaced Carroll as director; Ruby Dahl and Ramona Tangent, whose roles in the film will expand without Danbury; and Mark Bianco, a method actor relishing the opportunity to meet Black, whose role he plays. Also questioned is Hugo Winston, the man whose partner was murdered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> case and who is campaigning against what he sees as a disrespectful production.|$|E
