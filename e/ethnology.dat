5|$|The {{scholarly}} {{study of}} music in the United States includes work relating music to social class, racial, ethnic and religious identity, gender and sexuality, as well as studies of music history, musicology, and other topics. The academic study of American music {{can be traced back}} to the late 19th century, when researchers like Alice Fletcher and Francis La Flesche studied the music of the Omaha peoples, working for the Bureau of American <b>Ethnology</b> and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and <b>Ethnology.</b> In the 1890s and into the early 20th century, musicological recordings were made among indigenous, Hispanic, African-American and Anglo-American peoples of the United States. Many worked for the Library of Congress, first under the leadership of Oscar Sonneck, chief of the Library's Music Divisions. These researchers included Robert W. Gordon, founder of the Archive of American Folk Song, and John and Alan Lomax; Alan Lomax was the most prominent of several folk song collectors who helped to inspire the 20th century roots revival of American folk culture.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to continental Europe, Forster turned toward academia. He traveled to Paris {{to seek out}} a discussion with the American revolutionary Benjamin Franklin in 1777. He taught natural history at the Collegium Carolinum in the Ottoneum, Kassel (1778–84), and later at the Academy of Vilna (Vilnius University) (1784–87). In 1788, he became head librarian at the University of Mainz. Most of his scientific work during this time consisted of essays on botany and <b>ethnology,</b> but he also prefaced and translated many books about travel and exploration, including a German translation of Cook's diaries.|$|E

5|$|Supervised by his father, Georg Forster first {{undertook}} {{studies of}} the zoology and botanics of the southern seas, mostly by drawing animals and plants.

40|$|Foreword: {{anthropology}} of Mediterranean societies and national <b>ethnologies</b> To begin with, {{in dealing with}} the {{anthropology of}} Mediterranean societies we are referring to researches carried out mainly by scholars from Anglo-Saxon, French and to some extent Dutch academia associated with specific anthropological schools that some critics hold to be hegemonic (Llobera, 1986 : p. 30 f; Bromberger, Durand, 2001 : p. 737 ff.). Accordingly, our presentation will not include most of the so-called national <b>ethnologies</b> of Mediterranean countries, such as tradizioni popolari, studi demologici or studi folklorici in Italy and laographia in Greece. This partial omission is due essentially to the reason that, contrary to the anthropology of Mediterranean societies, these disciplines lack a comparative project and their researches are focused solely on their own national societies without taking into consideration other countries. The discovery of Mediterranean societies as an anthropological subject In comparison with other more distant and hard to reach geographical areas, anthropologists discovered Mediterranean societies as a subject of study, especially societies of continental Europe, fairly recently. This is not fortuitous, but can neither b...|$|R

5|$|Already in the 1880s, Muller had {{dabbled in}} {{ethnography}} and writing. On {{the basis of}} materials gathered on his journey to East Africa and South Africa in 1882/’83, he had held public lectures throughout the Netherlands and Belgium. He also published articles on his trip in Dutch magazines and newspapers, and collated these publications into a book titled Zuid-Afrika. It made him somewhat of a celebrity, {{and an expert on}} South Africa and East Africa. During his journey Muller had also collected a large number of ethnographic objects and artefacts, on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892, together with Joh. F.

5|$|Born in Somerset to {{a wealthy}} family, Lethbridge was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, {{during the course}} of which he {{attended}} an expedition to Jan Mayen island, becoming part of the first group to successfully climb the Beerenberg. After a failed second expedition to the Arctic Circle, he became involved in archaeology. In his capacity as Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and <b>Ethnology,</b> Lethbridge carried out excavations at various sites around Britain. His claims regarding the existence of Iron Age hill figures on Wandlebury Hill in Cambridgeshire caused significant controversy within the archaeological community, with most archaeologists believing that Lethbridge had erroneously misidentified a natural feature. Lethbridge's methodology and theories were widely deemed unorthodox, and in turn he became increasingly critical of the archaeological profession.|$|E

Murray also continued to publish works on Egyptology for a general audience, such as Egyptian Sculpture (1930) and Egyptian Temples (1931), which received largely positive reviews.

5|$|Some {{interest}} in Forster's life and revolutionary actions was revived {{in the context}} of the liberal sentiments leading up to the 1848 revolution. But he was largely forgotten in the Germany of Wilhelm II and more so in the Third Reich, where {{interest in}} Forster was limited to his stance on Poland from his private letters. Interest in Forster resumed in the 1960s in East Germany, where he was interpreted as a champion of class struggle. The GDR research station in Antarctica that was opened on October 25, 1987, was named after him. In West Germany, the search for democratic traditions in German history also lead to a more diversified picture of him in the 1970s. The Alexander von Humboldt foundation named a scholarship program for foreign scholars from developing countries after him. His reputation as one of the first and most outstanding German ethnologists is indisputable, and his works are seen as crucial in the development of <b>ethnology</b> in Germany into a separate branch of science.|$|E

40|$|Laboratory studies, {{especially}} those by Latour and Woolgar (1979 / 1986) and Knorr Cetina (1981) {{proved to be}} an invaluable source of inspiration for students of organizing. Laboratories, however, are mostly reminiscent of simple factories, an organization form that is no longer central in today’s world of work organizations. Two aspects of factory-like organizing are problematized in this paper: the dominance of chronological time and the existence of centers of calculation. Complementing these with kairotic time and dispersed calculation will bring the two kinds of studies even closer. Such a rapprochement will allow for adjusting the methodological approaches in studies of organization in a way similar to that dominant in SST (studies of science and technology) research.
