5|$|On 2 August 1990, the Iraqi Army invaded and {{occupied}} the neighboring state of Kuwait. The invasion, which followed the inconclusive <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War</b> and {{three decades of}} political conflict with Kuwait, offered Saddam Hussein the opportunity to distract political dissent at home and add Kuwait's oil resources to Iraq's own, a boon {{in a time of}} declining petroleum prices.|$|E
5|$|The DRFLA was {{undermined}} by its {{links with the}} Iraqi government after it emerged that Iraq had sponsored the training and equipping of the hostage-takers. The <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War</b> started {{five months after the}} end of the siege and continued for eight years. The campaign for autonomy of Khūzestān was largely forgotten in the wake of the hostilities, as was the DRFLA.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsidy system}} has been {{inherited}} from the <b>Iran-Iraq</b> <b>war</b> era but was never abolished. Iran {{is one of the}} largest gasoline consumers in the world, ranking second behind the United States in consumption per car. The government subsidy reform has been years in the making for various reasons. Iran's Supreme Leader has backed the government's latest subsidy reform plan.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the Iran–Contra affair {{became a}} problem for the {{administration}} stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during the <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War</b> to fund the Contra rebels fighting against the government in Nicaragua, which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress. The affair became a political scandal in the United States during the 1980s. The International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States, ruled that the United States had violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways.|$|E
5|$|KC-33A – A {{proposed}} 747 {{was also}} adapted as an aerial refueling tanker and was bid against the DC-10-30 during the 1970s Advanced Cargo Transport Aircraft (ACTA) program {{that produced the}} KC-10A Extender. Before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iran bought four 747-100 aircraft with air-refueling boom conversions to support its fleet of F-4 Phantoms. There is a report of using a KC-33A in H-3 airstrike during <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War.</b> It is unknown whether these aircraft remain usable as tankers. Since then, other proposals have emerged for conversion of later 747-400 aircraft for this role.|$|E
5|$|The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force Phantoms saw heavy {{action in}} the <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War</b> in the 1980s and are kept {{operational}} by overhaul and servicing from Iran's aerospace industry. Notable operations of Iranian F-4s during the war included Operation Scorch Sword, an attack by two F-4s against the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor site near Baghdad on 30 September 1980, and the attack on H3, a 4 April 1981 strike by eight Iranian F-4s against the H-3 complex of air bases in the far west of Iraq, which resulted in many Iraqi aircraft being destroyed or damaged for no Iranian losses.|$|E
5|$|The hostage-takers {{and their}} cause were largely {{forgotten}} after the <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War</b> broke {{out later that}} year and the hostage crisis in Tehran continued until January 1981. Nonetheless, the operation brought the SAS to the public eye {{for the first time}} and bolstered the reputation of Thatcher. The SAS was quickly overwhelmed by the number of applications it received from people inspired by the operation and experienced greater demand for its expertise from foreign governments. The building, having suffered major damage from a fire that broke out during the assault, was not reopened as the Iranian embassy until 1993.|$|E
5|$|The wartime {{authorities}} in both Britain and America produced {{a wide variety}} of documentary films. Their purposes included military training, advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security. Since these films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly, commercially produced films often combined information, support for the war effort, and a degree of propaganda. Newsreels, ostensibly simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and were often dramatised. More recently, in the <b>Iran-Iraq</b> <b>War,</b> Morteza Avini's Ravayat-e Fath (Chronicles of Victory) television series combined front-line footage with commentary.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to his}} August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{was pushing}} OPEC to end {{overproduction}} and to send oil prices higher, {{in order to help}} OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War.</b> But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions. The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied.|$|E
5|$|The F-4 Phantom II {{remained}} in {{use by the}} U.S. in the reconnaissance and Wild Weasel (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) roles in the 1991 Gulf War, finally leaving service in 1996. It was also the only aircraft used by both U.S. flight demonstration teams: the USAF Thunderbirds (F-4E) and the US Navy Blue Angels (F-4J). The F-4 was also operated by {{the armed forces of}} 11 other nations. Israeli Phantoms saw extensive combat in several Arab–Israeli conflicts, while Iran used its large fleet of Phantoms acquired before the fall of the Shah in the <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War.</b> Phantoms remain in frontline service with four countries. Phantom production ran from 1958 to 1981, with a total of 5,195 built, making it the most produced American supersonic military aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Su-25 {{also saw}} combat during the <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War</b> of 1980–88. The first Su-25s were {{commissioned}} by the Iraqi Air Force in 1987 and performed approximately 900 combat sorties {{towards the end of}} the war, carrying out the bulk of Iraqi air attack missions. During the most intense combat of the war, Iraqi Su-25s performed up to fifteen sorties per day, each. In one recorded incident, an Iraqi Su-25 was shot down by an Iranian, Hawk surface-to-air missile, but the pilot managed to eject. This was the only confirmed, successful Iranian attack against an Iraqi Su-25. After the war, Saddam Hussein decorated all of the Iraqi Air Force's Su-25 pilots with the country's highest military decoration.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{conflicts}} {{have sometimes}} {{made it impossible}} for the Commission to care for cemeteries in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether. Zehrensdorf Indian Cemetery in Germany was unkempt after the end of World War II and until the German reunification because it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005. The Six-Day War and War of Attrition resulted in the destruction of Port Tewfik Memorial and Aden Memorial, and the death of a Commission gardener at Suez War Memorial Cemetery. During the Lebanese Civil War two cemeteries in Beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt. The maintenance of war graves and memorials in Iraq has remained difficult since <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War</b> in the 1980s, with regular maintenance being impractical since after the Gulf War.|$|E
5|$|After Operation Credible Sport {{ended the}} Army {{leadership}} decided the unit {{was needed for}} future contingency operations. Thusly, on October 16, 1981 Task Force 158 became the 160th Aviation Battalion, with Brown a founding member. The choice of the unit's name was accepted by the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry as a logical progression of the 101st's 158th and 159th Battalions. The 160th Aviation Battalion was later renamed the 160th Special Operations Aviation Group in 1986; {{it was not until}} 1990 when it would take on its current name, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. In October 1983, Brown participated in the invasion of Grenada, during which his unit became the first aviation unit to use night vision goggles in combat. In the late 1980s, Brown led all U.S. forces assigned to Operation Prime Chance, which provided escort security for American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers during the <b>Iran-Iraq</b> <b>War.</b> During Operation Prime Chance Brown's unit became the first aviation unit to engage in combat using night vision devices when they engaged an Iranian-flagged ship, Iran Ajr, that was seen deploying mines in the Persian Gulf.|$|E

25|$|In June 1987, President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya severed all {{diplomatic}} relations with Iran in protest of the nation's supposed refusal to negotiate {{an end to the}} <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War.</b>|$|E
25|$|Saddam was {{captured}} by U.S. forces on 13 December 2003. He remained in custody by United States forces at Camp Cropper in Baghdad, along with eleven senior Ba'athist officials. Particular attention was paid during the trial to activities in violent campaigns against the Kurds in the north during the <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War,</b> against the Shiites {{in the south in}} 1991 and 1999 to put down revolts, and in Dujail after a failed assassination attempt on 8 July 1982, during the <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War.</b> Saddam asserted in his defense that he had been unlawfully overthrown, and was still the president of Iraq.|$|E

25|$|During the <b>Iran-Iraq</b> <b>war,</b> Ilam {{province}} suffered {{heavily and}} Iraq's intense bombings left no economic infrastructure for the province. Ilam thus {{remains one of}} Iran's more undeveloped provinces. Ilam's unemployment rate was 19.9% in 2003.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War</b> of 1980 to 1988, Iraq {{employed}} {{quantities of}} chemical weapons against Iranian ground forces. Although {{the most commonly used}} agents were mustard gas and sarin, tabun and cyclosarin were also used.|$|E
25|$|In 1987 – {{during the}} <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War</b> – Bashir succeeded in {{realising}} a long-cherished project: For {{the first time}} the Babylon International Festival of dance, music, and theatre, which Bashir was leading for several years, took place.|$|E
25|$|Iraqi Muslims mainly came to {{the country}} as a {{refugees}} after the <b>Iran-Iraq</b> <b>War,</b> failed 1991 uprisings in Iraq, and then post-2003. They predominately settled in the western suburbs of Sydney, such as Fairfield and Auburn.|$|E
25|$|The Persian Gulf was a {{battlefield}} of the 1980–1988 <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War,</b> {{in which each}} side attacked the other's oil tankers. It is the namesake of the 1991 Gulf War, the largely air- and land-based conflict that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.|$|E
25|$|Operation Praying Mantis was {{an attack}} on 18 April 1988, by U.S. forces within Iranian {{territorial}} waters {{in retaliation for the}} Iranian mining of the Persian Gulf during the <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>war</b> and the subsequent damage to an American warship.|$|E
25|$|One year later, in {{the early}} hours of 21 August 2013, two opposition-controlled areas in the suburbs around Damascus, Syria were struck by rockets {{containing}} the chemical agent sarin. The attack was the deadliest use of chemical weapons since the <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Royal Jordanian Land Force has {{obtained}} 80 Scorpions and 100 Spartans. Some of the Scorpions {{are reported to}} have been captured by Iraq during the <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>war</b> and handed on to Jordan. The Spartans were obtained when Belgium disposed of their CVR(T) fleet.|$|E
25|$|During {{the final}} years of <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War,</b> Rafsanjani was the de facto {{commander-in-chief}} of the Iranian military. Rafsanjani was elected chairman of the Iranian parliament in 1980 and served until 1989. He {{played an important role in}} the choice of Ali Khamenei as Supreme Leader.|$|E
25|$|Khamenei {{was one of}} Iran's leaders {{during the}} <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War</b> in the 1980s, and {{developed}} close ties with the now-powerful Revolutionary Guards which he controls, and whose commanders are elected and dismissed by him. The Revolutionary Guards {{have been used to}} suppress opposition to Khamenei.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>Iran–Iraq</b> <b>War</b> two New Zealand frigates {{joined the}} Royal Navy in {{monitoring}} merchant shipping in the Persian Gulf.
