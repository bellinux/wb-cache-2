40|$|This {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare the cost, resource mobility and profitability of diversified model retail farm supply firms using: (1) Six enterprises of grain handling, custom-mix feed, petroleum, liquid fertilizer, anhydrous ammonia fertilizer and liquefied petroleum (LP) gas; (2) Different capacity levels (three <b>for</b> five <b>enterprises</b> and two <b>for</b> liquid fertilizer) creating three firms of sizes A, B, and C with A being the smallest and C being the largest; and (3) Three utilization percentages (50, 75, and 100) <b>for</b> each <b>enterprise</b> capacity. The methodology employs budgeting revenues, costs, enterprise capacities, and expected sales <b>for</b> each <b>enterprise.</b> <b>Using</b> the <b>computer,</b> the normative linear programming model maximizes a firm’s profit by optimum resource allocation among a firm’s enterprises. The <b>computer</b> is also <b>used</b> for partial budgeting to assist with cost allocation after solving for an optimal solution. Several conclusions came out of this study. One such conclusion was the idea that the capital pooling effect for any multi-firm utilization is not as a great as labor pooling. Dollars are less “lumpy” than laborers, and thus less possible to become redundant. In this model when the capital pool has an effect upon the multi-firm, it is very slight compared to dollar profit or the effects of labor pooling. Advisor: P. W. Lytl...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Cloud {{computing}} {{provides a}} promising paradigm for the deployment and utilization of online resources including {{hardware and software}} services by Internet users. In such an e-infrastructure environment, the scheduling of user-defined tasks is always considered as a complicated {{part of the overall}} system modelling. Specifically, in the case of inter-clouds and inter-enterprises scheduling optimization is fundamentally important for achieving the best possible capacity in terms of resource utilization. Thus, existing approaches that consider system dynamics, interoperability and heterogeneity issues become important aspects for providing advanced scheduling decisions. In this work, we survey some highly dynamic meta-schedulers that are suitable <b>for</b> <b>enterprises</b> <b>using</b> grids and/or clouds. Our intention is to elicit the characteristics and produce a model encompassing the architectural requirements that will enable high meta-scheduling performance in inter-cooperative e-infrastructures...|$|R

Unfortunately, while network bandwidth is scarce and expensive {{in the developing}} world, current WAN accelerators are designed <b>for</b> <b>enterprise</b> <b>use,</b> and are a poor fit in these environments. We present Wanax, a WAN accelerator designed for developing-world deployments. It uses a novel multiresolution chunking (MRC) scheme that provides high compression rates and high disk performance {{for a variety of}} content, while using much less memory than existing approaches. Wanax exploits the design of MRC to perform intelligent load shedding to maximize throughput when running on resource-limited shared platforms. Finally, Wanax exploits the mesh network environments being deployed in the developing world, instead of just the star topologies common in enterprise branch offices. ...|$|R
