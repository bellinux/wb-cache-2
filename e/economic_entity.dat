5|$|Mountbatten {{used his}} {{influence}} with the princes {{to push them}} towards accession. He declared that the British Government would not grant dominion status {{to any of the}} princely states, nor would it accept them into the British Commonwealth, which meant that the states would sever all connections with the British crown unless they joined either India or Pakistan. He pointed out that the Indian subcontinent was one <b>economic</b> <b>entity,</b> and that the states would suffer most if the link were broken. He also pointed to the difficulties that princes would face maintaining order in the face of threats such as the rise of communal violence and communist movements.|$|E

25|$|This {{political}} development {{had a number}} of important economic consequences. First of all, it led to an economic rupture with the Habsburg Empire, seen as a loose <b>economic</b> <b>entity.</b> By the time the Revolt erupted the disadvantages of being part of this empire (heavy taxation to finance the military adventures of the Habsburg rulers) began to outweigh the advantages of belonging to its trade network. One of these advantages had been enjoying the services of the Antwerp entrepôt.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} and {{rapid growth of}} Victoria and Queensland mark the real beginning of New South Wales as a political and <b>economic</b> <b>entity</b> distinct from the other Australian colonies. Rivalry between New South Wales and Victoria was intense throughout {{the second half of}} the 19th century, and the two colonies developed in radically different directions. Once the easy gold ran out by about 1860, Victoria absorbed the surplus labour force from the gold fields in manufacturing, protected by high tariff walls. Victoria became the Australian stronghold of protectionism, liberalism and radicalism. New South Wales, which was less radically affected demographically by the gold rushes, remained more conservative, still dominated politically by the squatter class and its allies in the Sydney business community. New South Wales, as a trading and exporting colony, remained wedded to free trade.|$|E

Hong Kong's tertiary sector dominated economy is characterised by competitive simple taxation and supported by its independent judiciary system.

40|$|With rapid {{development}} of globalization, numerous global problems appear, and global governance thus emerges. For a long time, the elite club G 8 Group {{which consists of}} developed countries monopolizes and leads global governance, while vast developing countries are {{at the edge of}} global governance stage. However, due to increasingly complex and severe global problems, defects of G 8 mechanism, low execution efficiency and legality problem, governance ability of G 8 declines continuously. As emerging <b>economic</b> <b>entities</b> rise, G 20 gradually replaces G 8 and becomes a main mode of global governance.

In addition, participation in global governance by emerging <b>economic</b> <b>entities</b> intensively reflects interests and appeals of developing countries.

500|$|During the First Bulgarian Empire the {{fortress}} {{was part of}} a system of fortifications providing for the defense of Pliska and Preslav, capital cities, and the religious centre of Madara. It then functioned as a minor fort during the 10th–12th centuries, as compared to the glory, economic prosperity and military might it had during the 4th–6th centuries. In the 13th century it again prospered as a political and <b>economic</b> <b>entity</b> of the reborn Bulgarian Empire. When the Byzantines temporarily took control of Preslav in 1278 during the Uprising of Ivaylo Shumen also acquired importance as an administrative and military centre. The fortress continued to thrive in the 14th century until the Ottoman Turks captured it in 1388 during a campaign of their first vizier Çandarlı Ali Pasha.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the 12th National Congress, the 13th National Congress in 1987 {{reduced the}} CCDI's power. Reformist general {{secretary}} Zhao Ziyang {{wanted to end}} CCDI meddling in China's legal system and reduce its scope to party-discipline issues. Forty-nine CCDI discipline-inspection groups in central ministries and party organisations were abolished at the congress (75 percent of all inspection groups), and the CCDI's chief lost his seat on the Politburo Standing Committee. In {{the aftermath of the}} Tiananmen Square demonstrations Zhao Ziyang's reforms were rescinded, and the former CCDI inspection groups were reestablished. Commission power was increased, and the CCDI issued the [...] "five forbiddens"; party members could not [...] "(1) operate a business, (2) work in an <b>economic</b> <b>entity,</b> (3) trade in stocks, (4) accept gifts, or (5) use public funds for lavish entertainment." [...] The 14th National Congress, in 1992, strengthened CCDI and local CDI investigative powers. According to the amended party constitution, local CDIs could initiate preliminary investigations against members of the local party committee at the CDI's level before a formal investigation began. If a full investigation was warranted, the local CDI had to obtain approval from its higher-level CDI and the corresponding party committee. In 1995 its powers were increased further, with each CDI given the responsibility to vet officials before their appointment to a post. The shuanggui system (see below) was established in 1994 by order of the CCDI; it was first officially mentioned in Article 28 of the Regulation on Dealing with Cases of Party Discipline Violations, which came into effect on 1 May 1994.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1918, Slonim {{had lost}} his Bessarabian constituency, as the region united with Romania. The writer became a strong critic of that merger, {{claiming}} that the Romanian identity in both Romania and Bessarabia had been recently fabricated by intellectuals, lacking popular support among the Moldavian peasants (see Moldovenism). Slonim also claimed that the union process had been triggered by the German Empire in late 1917, as an anti-Bolshevik move, and supported by Russians who had discarded [...] "personal and national dignity." [...] Building on such arguments, Slonim depicted the Russian Empire as a functional and organic <b>economic</b> <b>entity,</b> suggesting that Bessarabia had {{more in common with}} Ukraine than with Romania.|$|E
