In this study, we sought to estimate the prevalence of Coxiella burnetii antibodies among veterinarians and to identify risk factors for exposure. Methods. We tested serum samples from 508 veterinarians who attended the 143 rd American Veterinary Medical Association Annual Convention in 2006. Samples were screened using a Q fever IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples with positive or equivocal results of ELISA were confirmed using phase I and phase II IgG <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>assays,</b> and end point IgG titers were determined for samples with positive results.

Veterinarians have a high level of exposure to C. burnetii, the causative organism of Q fever, especially those veterinarians who treat livestock. In this study, risk of C. burnetii seropositivity was also inde-pendently associated with contact with ponds.

Five candidates of novel T. gondii oocyst wall proteins (TgOWPs) were identified and named TgOWP 8 through TgOWP 12. Recombinant protein of TgOWP 8 was expressed in E. coli using glutathione S-transferase as fusion protein.

40|$|International audienceIn Taiwan, {{the first}} human case of cat-scratch disease (CSD) was {{diagnosed}} by a serologic test in 1998. Since then, no {{studies have been conducted}} to understand the epidemiology of the infection in Taiwan. Therefore, this study is the first epidemiologic survey of CSD in cats and humans in this country. Using veterinary-associated individuals as the study population, it was identified that 1. 7 % of them were seropositive for B. henselae, and residence was the only factor associated with seropositivity. Bartonella species were successfully isolated from 25 (19. 1 %) of the 131 cats tested. Only B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae were obtained from bacteremic cats. Furthermore, 9. 2 % of 131 cats were dually-infected with genotypes I and II of B. henselae. It is the highest prevalence of co-infection that has ever been reported worldwide. In cats, the seroprevalence was 23. 7 % by indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> with B. henselae Houston- 1 (type I) as the antigen.

40|$|Accurate {{localization}} {{of proteins}} within the substructure of cells and cellular organelles enables {{better understanding of}} structure–function relationships, including elucidation of protein–protein interactions. We describe {{the use of a}} near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM) to simultaneously map and detect colocalized proteins within a cell, with superresolution. The system we elected to study was that of human red blood cells invaded by the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. During intraerythrocytic growth, the parasite expresses proteins that are transported to the erythrocyte cell membrane. Association of parasite proteins with host skeletal proteins leads to modification of the erythrocyte membrane. We report on colocalization studies of parasite proteins with an erythrocyte skeletal protein. Host and parasite proteins were selectively labeled in indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>assays.</b> Simultaneous dual-color excitation and detection with NSOM provided fluorescence maps together with topography of the cell membrane with subwavelength (100 nm) resolution. Colocalization studies with laser scanning confocal microscopy provided lower resolution (310 nm) fluorescence maps of cross sections through the cell. Because the two excitation colors shared the exact same near-field aperture, the two fluorescence images were acquired in perfect, pixel-by-pixel registry, free from chromatic aberrations, which contaminate laser scanning confocal microscopy measurements. Colocalization studies of the protein pairs of mature parasite-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (MESA) (parasite) /protein 4. 1 (host) and P. falciparum histidine rich protein (PfHRP 1) (parasite) /protein 4. 1 (host) showed good real-space correlation for the MESA/protein 4. 1 pair, but relatively poor correlation for the PfHRP 1 /protein 4. 1 pair. These data imply that NSOM provides high resolution information on in situ interactions between proteins in biological membranes. This method of detecting colocalization of proteins in cellular structures may have general applicability in many areas of current biological research...|$|R

The {{complete}} and truncated nucleocapsid proteins (NP) of HTN and SEO were expressed by a recombinant baculovirus system. Antigenic characterization of the NP using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) indicated that the binding sites for the serotype-specific MAbs were located between amino acids (aa) 155 and 429. A Western blot assay indicated that the serotype-specific epitopes were conformation dependent. An indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> (IFA) <b>assay</b> with the truncated NP (aa 155 to 429) was able to distinguish convalescent-phase sera from HTN and SEO patients.

Here, the association between the infestation by R. sanguineus and C. felis felis and the occurrence of anti-Leishmania antibodies was evaluated in an observational case–control study of dogs living in a Brazilian endemic area for canine visceral leishmaniasis. Blood samples were taken once every three months for one year from 96 initially seronegative domestic dogs, and submitted to indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>assay.</b> All dogs were evaluated {{for the presence of}} ticks and fleas, and the results were expressed qualitatively as infested or non-infested, irrespective of the intensity of infestation.

The odds of infection was significantly greater (OR= 3. 54, CI 95 %= 1. 10 – 12. 53) for dogs infested by C. felis felis compared to their non-infested counterparts. In contrast, the odds of infection showed no significance difference between non-infested and R. sanguineus-infested groups of dogs (OR= 0. 31, CI 95 %= 0. 03 – 1. 52).

Diagnosis of PCP is difficult due to non-specific symptoms and signs, use of prophy-lactic drugs in the treatment of HIV-infected patients and simultaneous infection with mul-tiple organisms (such as cytomegalovirus) in an immunocompromized host. Diagnosis of PCP, therefore, requires microscopical exami-nation in order to identify Pneumocystis in clini-cal ly relevant sources such as sputum, bronchoalveolar fluid, or lung tissue (Cushion and Beck, 2001). A variety of stains have been used to identify P. jirovecii in respiratory tract secretions, including Giemsa or Giemsa-like rapid stains (eg, Diff-Quik®), Gomori meth-enamine silver stain, toluidine blue O stain, and fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody (Kroe et al, 1997). <b>Immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> (IFA) has been the most widely used immunologic technique for P. jirovecii diagnosis (Cregan et al, 1990); it is more sensitive than histologi...|$|E

Two suggestive episodes of Bartonella henselae-caused cat-scratch disease are reported, and {{discussed in the}} light of the most recent literature evidence. The first case occurred in a 60 -year-old man, thus suggesting that it is important to maintain an elevated level of suspicion for this disease in adults as well. Both episodes were characterized by a very prolonged and complicated disease course (with the involvement of three lymph node sets in the first case), a need for lymph-node drainage, and apparently negligible activity of many antimicrobial courses, with a very slow local cure. While specific culture and molecular biology techniques proved negative (probably due to late availability of appropriate clinical specimens), indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> was positive since the first weeks of disease, and elevated levels were also fond many months after disease onset. When clinicians face patients with prominent swelling of lymph nodes draining from the upper limbs, cat-scratch disease may be suspected on the grounds of epidemiological and clinical features, with a limited systemic involvement contrasting with a prominent local disease. The significance of specific antibody temporal kinetics in the subacute disease course is still unknown. Although biomolecular assays are now available, the time elapsed from disease onset to clinical diagnosis usually hampers diagnosis, while the roles of surgical debridement and of the unpredictable activity of antimicrobial chemotherapy warrant careful investigation...|$|E

Several genetic variants of A. phagocytophilum exist. In the present study, we investigate whether superinfection occurs in the acute and persistent phase of the infection. Methods Five-month-old lambs of the Norwegian Dala breed were experimentally infected with two 16 S rRNA gene variants of A. phagocytophilum, i. e. A. phagocytophilum variant 1 (GenBank accession number M 73220) and variant 2 (GenBank acc. no. AF 336220). Eighteen lambs were used, two lambs in each group. Eight groups were experimentally inoculated with either variant 1 or 2 on day 0. Six of these groups were then challenged with the other variant on either days 7, 42 or 84, respectively. One group was left uninfected. The occurrence of A. phagocytophilum in blood samples was determined using semi-nested PCR analysis and gene sequencing. Specific antibodies were measured by an indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> (IFA).

The C-terminal fragment of MSP 1 was expressed as a baculovirus recombinant protein, BVp 42. Rabbits were immunized with BVp 42, and antibodies were tested for reactivity to MSP 1 s of the homologous and heterologous allelic forms, represented by the FUP, FVO, FC 27, and Honduras parasite isolates, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>assay.</b> Despite the fact that allelic sequences accounted for approximately 50 % of the BVp 42 molecule, anti-BVp 42 antibodies cross-reacted extensively with parasites carrying heterologous MSP 1 alleles. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition assays confirmed that {{an overwhelming majority of}} the anti-BVp 42 antibodies were cross-reactive, suggesting that determinants within conserved block 17 are dominant B-cell epitopes in the anti-BVp 42 response. Moreover, the BVp 42 polypeptide could inhibit (> 90 %) the cross-reactivity of anti-MSP 1 antibodies in animals immunized with the complete native MSP 1 protein. Anti-BVp 42 antibodies were equally effective in inhibiting the in vitro growth of parasites carrying homologous or heterologous MSP 1 alleles. Serotyping by monoclonal antibodies indicated that the immunological and biological cross-reactivities were not caused by identical variant-specific amino acid substitutions within conserved block 17.

In the test, the serum IgM antibodies were captured by anti-human IgM antibodies coated onto a microtiter plate. The captured IgM antibodies were revealed through sequential addition of biotinylated Bor 56 antigen and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin to the plate. The IgM capture ELISA was compared with the <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> (IFA) by testing 176 serum samples from patients with diagnosed cases of rickettsial disease and patients with other acute febrile diseases.

Determinations of IgG antibodies against both latent and lytic HHV- 8 antigens were performed by indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assay.</b> <b>Antibodies</b> were detected only for lytic antigen {{of the virus}} in 12. 5 % of children with a seroprevalence significatively higher (19. 6 %) in young children (age 1 - 6). No correlation was observed between HHV 8 seropositivity and serological markers for hepatitis A, B and C viruses and Human Immunodeficiency virus. In conclusion, {{our findings suggest that}} HHV 8 infection is widespread in some populations from the East Europe, and that person to person contacts among children could be considered the predominant mode of HHV 8 transmission in younger age...|$|R
40|$|A 50 -year-old male patient {{previously}} {{diagnosed with}} acute myelomonocytic (M 4) leukemia in July 2009 underwent allogeneic {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (allo-HSCT). During the pre-transplant period complete blood count (CBC), liver and renal function tests, coagulation tests, and other parameters were normal. On {{the first day of}} transplantation teicoplanin (400 mg d– 1 for the first 3 d, and then 400 mg d- 1) and caspofungin (first dose was 1 × 70 mg d– 1, followed by 1 × 50 mg d– 1) were started intravenously due to white plaques and oropharyngeal candidiasis in the patient’s mouth and perianal erythema. On the 14 th d of transplantation watery diarrhea occurred, along with abdominal discomfort, nausea, and fatigue. Stool examination was negative for findings of bleeding. Investigation of Microsporidia confirmed a rare pathogen Encephalitozoon intestinalis in the patient’s stool sample via species-specific <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> (IFA) <b>assay</b> and albendazole treatment was started at a dose of 2 × 400 mg d– 1. On the 5 th d of albendazole treatment (d 18 of treatment) liver function test (LFT) results began to deteriorate. As LFT results continued to deteriorate, albendazole was withdrawn on the 7 th d of treatment. Biopsy was performed on the 22 nd d of transplantation and histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of toxic hepatitis. LFT results began to decrease after withdrawal of albendazole treatment. On the 13 th d of albendazole treatment all LFT values returned to normal. The presented allo-HSCT case had a rare pathogenic agent (E. intestinalis) that caused diarrhea, as well as hepatotoxicity due to albendazole treatment. This is the first reported case of E. intestinalis diagnosed via IFA in Turkey. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the molecular {{nature of human}} sperm autoantigens, {{attempts were made to}} raise monoclonal antibodies against these antigens by hybridoma techniques. After successive immunizations with the particulate fractions of human sperm extract in BALB/c mice, the spleen cells were fused with P 3 -X 63 -Ag 8 myeloma cells. Several clones and their subclones were obtained and shown by microplate radioimmunoassay to produce antibodies against human sperm antigens. When SDS gel/protein blot radioimmunobinding was used for further molecular analysis, three independently derived clones were shown to produce antibodies, all of which cross-reacted with the same two human sperm antigens with a molecular weight of about 10 000. Using an indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assay,</b> <b>antibodies</b> produced by these clones were shown to react with antigens localized on the acrosomal regions of human spermatozoa. Monoclonal antibodies produced by other clones, however, showed no cross-reactivity with any of the blotted proteins from SDS gels of human spermatozoa.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundScrub typhus is an {{important}} febrile disease in Southeast Asia and is caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. Fluoroquinolones {{have proved to be}} effective for scrub typhus in an animal model. However, it is unclear whether they are also effective clinically. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the hospital-based medical records of patients diagnosed to have scrub typhus by an indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> or PCR at a large referral hospital in Taiwan for a 6 -year period (2001 – 2007). To determine the efficacy of levofloxacin for the treatment of scrub typhus, we divided the patients into a levofloxacin-treated group and a tetracycline antibiotics-treated group. ResultsOut of 132 patients with scrub typhus, 71 initially received levofloxacin and 61 initially received tetracycline antibiotics. There was no statistically significant difference in the effective rate between the two groups (91. 5 % and 95. 1 % cured, respectively; p= 0. 648). The time to defervescence in the levofloxacin-treated group was longer than in the other group (49 ± 41. 1 and 24 ± 19. 6 hours, respectively; p= 0. 001). In the patients with higher APACHE II scores, higher mortality was found in the levofloxacin-treated group (44. 4 % and 0 %; p= 0. 033). ConclusionsLevofloxacin is effective in patients with scrub typhus, but has a longer time to defervescence compared with tetracycline antibiotics. When levofloxacin is used for severe scrub typhus, higher mortality may be attributed to the longer time to defervescence...|$|E

A total of 625 serum samples of dogs (289 from Paulista, 168 from Amaraji and 168 from Garanhuns) were tested by an <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> {{for the detection of}} anti-N. caninum antibodies. A total of 177 (28. 3 %; IC 95 %, 24. 9 – 32. 1) samples were positive. The seropositivity rates found in Paulista, Amaraji and Garanhuns were 26 % (IC 95 %, 21 – 31. 4), 26. 2 % (IC 95 %, 19. 7 – 33. 5) and 34. 5 % (IC 95 %, 27. 4 – 42. 2), respectively. Of the 177 serum samples positive to anti-N. caninum antibodies, 170 were additionally tested for the presence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies and out of these 57. 6 % (IC 95 %, 49. 8 – 65. 2) were positive. The results indicate that dogs from Amaraji, Paulista and Garanhuns are exposed to both N. caninum and T. gondii infections. The presence of dogs infected by N. caninum in Pernambuco represents a potential risk factor for the occurrence of outbreaks of abortion in cattle and small ruminants in this state. This study is the largest serological survey on the presence of anti-N. caninum antibodies in dogs carried out in Brazil and reports {{for the first time the}} exposure to N. caninum and T. gondii in dogs from Pernambuco...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background and Objective: Human visceral {{leishmaniasis}} is endemic in Natal, northeast of Brazil, where the domestic dog {{is an important}} parasite reservoir in the infectious cycle of Leishmania spp. In this study, was evaluated the antileishmanial IgG antibody and epidemiological factors related to canine {{visceral leishmaniasis}} (CVL). Methods: Sera samples obtained by venipuncture of 1, 426 dogs living in areas of human visceral leishmaniasis occurrence were tested for detection of IgG anti-leishmania antibodies with <b>Immunofluorescence</b> <b>Antibody</b> <b>Assay</b> (IFA) and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Chi-square (x 2) and Odds Ratio (OR) were calculated. Differences were considered statistically significant at p 0. 05. Results: The overall seroprevalence was 10. 30 % (147 / 1, 426); prevalence increased when the samples {{were found to be}} positive at least for one technique ([417 / 1, 426] 29. 3 %). The high percentage of seroprevalence was observed in Nova República (15. 35 %), Nova Natal I (12. 7 %) and Lagoa Azul (11. 4 %) neighborhoods. In the Planalto, Soledade and Brasil Novo, the infection rates ranged from 7. 5 at 8. 06 %. (p= 0. 00051). There was neither statistically significant difference between leishmanial infection nor clinical signs of disease (p= 0. 84; OR= 1. 0 [0. 41; 2. 3]), sex (p= 0. 78, OR= 0. 94 [0. 66; 1. 28]); and breed (p= 0. 92; OR= 1. 0 [0. 65; 1. 54]) were observed. Conclusion: The results suggest that CVL is widely distributed in Natal, may be increasingly urbanizing and will sprea...|$|E
40|$|Anticomplement Immunofluorescence {{was used}} for {{antibody}} titration against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in 43 patients with peripheral facial palsy. Nine of 31 patients (29 %) with Bell's palsy and eight of 12 patients (75 %) with Ramsey-Hunt syndrome had anticomplement <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> titres of {{greater than or equal}} to 1 / 10. On the other hand, none of 14 patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and 51 healthy adults showed anticomplement <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> titres of {{greater than or equal to}} 1 / 10. The anticomplement <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> titre in two patients with Ramsey-Hunt syndrome increased later and decreased sooner than the indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> titre, becoming undetectable at 66 and 104 days, respectively, after onset of the disease. There was no cross reaction between anti-VZV and anti-HSV antibodies in the patients who showed a positive antibody rise for VZV. As the acute stage of VZV infection is obscure in the patients with peripheral facial palsy without herpes the screening of anticomplement <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>antibody</b> to VZV at titres greater than or equal to 1 / 10 may be useful for the diagnosis of VZV infection in patients with peripheral facial palsy...|$|R
40|$|Background: A novel {{pattern in}} the {{indirect}} <b>immunofluorescence</b> antinuclear <b>antibody</b> <b>assay</b> on HEp- 2 cells (IIF-HEp- 2) characterized by cytoplasmic rods and rings (RR) was reported in HCV patients, but stringent disease specificity studies and longitudinal analysis are lacking. We investigated the clinical significance of anti-RR in an HCV cohort with up to a 12 -month treatment follow up. Methodology/Results: 597 patients (342 HCV, 55 HCV/HIV, 200 non-HCV) were screened and titered for anti-RR. Serial samples were available from 78 of 176 treated and 27 of 166 untreated patients. Anti-RR was detected in 14. 1 % of 342 HCV patients, 9. 1 % of 55 HCV/HIV, 3. 4 % of 29 Hepatitis B, and none of 171 non-HCV (p 47 % tested positive for anti-RR. the anti-RR titer generally increased with sustained treatment and remained high in 53 % of patients. After treatment, anti-RR titer was negative in 41 %. Non-responders to HCV therapy were 77 % in anti-RR-positive versus 64 % in anti-RR-negative patients. Response to treatment {{was not associated with}} anti-RR titer or the dynamics of anti-RR reactivity during and after treatment. Conclusions: the exquisite association of anti-RR reactivity with combined interferon-a/ribavirin therapy in HCV patients represents a unique model for drug-induced autoantibody generation in humans as demonstrated by the fact that a significant fraction of patients who have anti-RR during therapy becomes anti-RR-negative after completion of therapy.
