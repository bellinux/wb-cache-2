5|$|Originally, {{the club}} favoured the name Melbourne Mavericks with a gunslinger logo holding {{a fistful of}} dollars. The club {{officials}} were all set to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> until News Limited's Lachlan Murdoch told them to go with something else because the Mavericks sounded too American. Trams and Flying Foxes were also some ideas that came up. However co-CEOs Chris Johns and John Ribot decided {{to go with the}} themes lightning, power and storm. The club then became known as the Melbourne Storm.|$|E
5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Strand had hosted many grand houses by the River Thames and {{the area}} began to be built up. By the end the 18th, {{it had become a}} notorious rookery - an overcrowded slum. The area had been {{unaffected}} by the Great Fire of London and survived with narrow streets, unsuited to the new traffic. A scheme was instituted to build a new road, Kingsway between Holborn and Strand, culminating in a grand crescent, Aldwych. After many false starts, the scheme was begun in 1901 by the London County Council. To <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> a link was built to the tube station at Holborn, and in 1905 the theatre was acquired by Act of Parliament and demolished to enable Aldwych underground station to be constructed on the site. The many actors who were attached to the theatre protested against its deconstruction. The station is now closed but is said to be haunted be an angry actress who still scares people today.|$|E

500|$|New Media {{consultants}} and scientists Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman aided {{in the production}} of the episode. They had worked on the series throughout the first season, with their role ranging from directly writing episodes to advising the others on scientific concepts. Whitman later explained that they [...] "come to us with questions: Is this possible? Where can we <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>this?</b> Then we go and read the very technical articles, or talk with scientists, and then translate that into the storytelling medium of our show." [...] For [...] "The Road Not Taken", he and Chiappetta were asked to again [...] "find a new and gruesome way to blow people up," [...] this time by rooting it in the concept of pyrokinesis. Chiappetta explained, [...] "They wanted to have someone spontaneously combust and burn up. So this is where we sort of leaned back into our mythology." ...|$|E
500|$|Hardy himself {{admitted}} {{to his family}} that he was [...] "scared to death" [...] when he first arrived overseas, but believed that the soldiers were fed something to make them brave, which he referred to as [...] "brave pills". After a short time in the military, he claimed {{that he was not}} afraid of anything that he experienced from then on. Even in the heat of battle, Hardy professed that he would get [...] "wound up" [...] at times, but never frightened. He recalled many strange experiences with food and drink, such as getting used to drinking green water from canteens and eating hardtacks, which he found to be surprisingly filling. To <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> there was often little more than small tins of ham or chicken and occasionally coffee to drink and pudding or pie for dessert. Hardy also witnessed many of his friends get killed in action, and relied on his faith in God to get him through the toughest times.|$|E
500|$|The band's {{music is}} {{characterized}} by a metal sound, and the screamed vocals of frontman Josh Scogin. Journalists have frequently referred to the music as [...] "chaotic"; Allmusic writer Alex Henderson described it as a [...] "dense, clobbering sledgehammer", while Brian Shultz of Alternative Press called it [...] "manically pounding, distortion-soaked exercises of catharsis". The Chariot has often been labeled a metalcore band. However, the music generally defies genre standards like melodic/abrasive dynamics and harmonizing vocals; it wouldn't leave room for the [...] "nonstop firestorm of exploding drums, heaving guitars, and visceral shrieking," [...] as Allmusic writer Corey Apar put it. The band utilizes time changes and start-stop shifts, and typically write very short songs. Some journalists believe the music is challenging and an acquired taste. In interviews, Josh Scogin has described the band as “heavy punk rock”, doing away with genres and subgenres, and has also debunked many of these labels. “Sometimes people refer to us as mathcore, which I think is a very incorrect statement, because I feel like that’s a very pre-calculated, ‘this is weird because this time signature doesn’t <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> time…’. It’s very planned out. We’re not that smart.” ...|$|E

500|$|When Ehrich first {{stepped into}} the role, he stated: [...] "There [...] so many places where they can <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> role. I have just gotten back into Genoa City. It’s such a {{vulnerable}} age, so really there [...] so many different paths I can go down. And there’s so much that can happen. I’m very, very curious to see where they go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who just became D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong." [...] Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become [...] "creepy" [...] during his angst and acting out.|$|E

2500|$|A {{non-traditional}} view is {{that the}} betrothal was effected simply by purchasing the girl from her father (or guardian). The price paid for her (bride price) is known by the Hebrew term mohar (מוהר). The girl's consent is not explicitly required by any statement in the Bible, neither is there explicit permission to ignore it. Yet, as the servant of Abraham was seeking a Bride for Isaac, and discovered Rebekah living in Haran, {{it should be noted that}} her father Bethuel, and her brother Laban, said, [...] "Let us call the young woman and ask her." [...] And they called Rebekah and said to her, [...] "Will you <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> man?" [...] She said, [...] "I will go."(Genesis 24:57, 58) It was customary in biblical times for the bride to be given part of the mohar. Gradually it lost its original meaning, and the custom arose of giving the mohar entirely to the bride, rather than to her father.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Maltby began {{compiling}} {{a series of}} older songs and new song ideas to form an evening of musical short stories, which he labeled the [...] "Urban File". [...] In particular, {{he wanted to make}} use of one of his favorite songs, [...] "The Bear, The Tiger, The Hamster, and The Mole", which had been cut from Maltby and Shire's 1983 musical Baby. [...] Maltby assembled other cut songs from earlier musicals such as The River, Love Match and The Sap of Life to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> particular song. The [...] "Urban File" [...] also contained lyric fragments, musical ideas, song fragments, rhythmic ideas, philosophical observations, and biographical details of friends and acquaintances as potential material for songs. [...] During this time, Maltby was occupied with Song and Dance, and Shire was busy composing film scores, so that the [...] "Urban File" [...] was not a primary project at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Jordan Thomas, BioShock 2s {{creative}} director, {{said that}} the first concern with a sequel to BioShock was [...] "where do you <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>this?</b> How do you bring people back to an experience and terrify them and shock {{them in a way}} that they’re not expecting, but also fulfill the many expectations they’re projecting onto it?" [...] Early on, Thomas decided that it couldn't be a BioShock game without the city of Rapture, and that there were many unseen locations and untold stories that could remained with the setting. The developers wanted to bring some of the mystery back to the location of Rapture, and maintain a balance of surprising old players while introducing the setting to newcomers. Thomas and environmental artist Hogarth De La Plante agreed that the setting of Rapture was fertile ground for new ideas, and that as they were both veterans of the original game, they were excited to add never-before-seen parts of the city and push the artistic style they had developed. [...] "Any idea was out on the table at that point, and I think nobody has played BioShock more than the developers that made it, so I feel like in one respect we are a pretty good litmus test for whether it’s still an interesting place or not," [...] La Plante recalled. [...] "And if that doesn’t bore us and we’re the people that played it for thousands upon thousands of hours, then I think we have a pretty good perspective on how interesting that location really is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from her}} Communist Party membership, her Irish {{heritage}} {{is the other}} sensitive aspect of Murdoch's political life that seems to attract interest. [...] Part of the interest revolves around the fact that, although Irish by both birth and traced descent on both sides, Murdoch does not display the full set of political opinions that are sometimes assumed to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> origin: [...] "No one ever agrees about who is entitled to lay claim to Irishness. [...] Iris's Belfast cousins today call themselves British, not Irish... with both parents brought up in Ireland, and an ancestry within Ireland both North and South going back three centuries, Iris has as valid a claim to call herself Irish as most North Americans have to call themselves American". [...] Conradi notes A.N. Wilson's record that Murdoch regretted the sympathetic portrayal of the Irish nationalist cause she had given earlier in The Red and the Green, and a competing defence of the book at Caen in 1978. The novel while broad of sympathy is hardly an unambiguous celebration of the 1916 rising, dwelling upon bloodshed, unintended consequences and the evils of romanticism, besides celebrating selfless individuals on both sides. Later, of Ian Paisley, Iris Murdoch stated [...] " [...] sincerely condemns violence and {{did not intend to}} incite the Protestant terrorists. That he is emotional and angry is not surprising, after 12–15 years of murderous IRA activity. All this business is deep in my soul, I'm afraid." [...] In private correspondence with her close friend and fellow philosopher Philippa Foot, she remarked in 1978 that she felt [...] "unsentimental about Ireland to the point of hatred" [...] and, of a Franco-Irish conference she had attended in Caen in 1982, said that [...] "the sounds of all those Irish voices made me feel privately sick".|$|E
