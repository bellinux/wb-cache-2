The {{architect}} was Mr. Savage of Walbrook. {80} The burial-ground in which it stands had been consecrated on the 21st November, 1812; and an Act of Parliament, 59 George III., cap. 35, 1819, authorised the appropriation of part of that ground for the site of building a church. In the burial-ground repose the remains of Dr. John M’Leod, the companion and friend of the gallant Sir Murray Maxwell, {{and the author of}} ‘A Narrative of a Voyage in H.M.S. Alceste to the Yellow Sea, and of her Shipwreck in the Straits of Gaspar,’ published in 1817. On his return to England, the services of Dr. M’Leod were rewarded by his appointment to the Royal Sovereign yacht, which he did not long enjoy, as he died in lodgings in the King’s Road, Chelsea, on the 9th November, 1820, at the age of thirty-eight.|$|E

These components were previously classified into five different sets (<b>drop</b> <b>capitals,</b> stripes, figures, annotations and text matter) each one characterised by particular geometric features. Based on that assumption several novel algorithms appealing to morphological operators are proposed. The evaluation of the methodology is performed on pages of XVI century books...|$|R

50|$|From the {{earliest}} days of machine printing, punctuation and <b>Drop</b> <b>Capitals</b> were indented slightly into the margin, {{as can be seen in}} the pages of the Gutenberg Bible in the British Library. Word-processing software lacks this attention to detail that could be achieved when manually setting type page by page, but professional page layout software like InDesign and Serif PagePlus can now achieve this with a fine level of adjustment over which letters to indent into the margin and by how much.|$|R
50|$|The {{manuscript}} is {{also known}} as the Beato of Valladolid. It consists of 230 folios conserved in good condition -- another fourteen are missing -- measuring 35.5 x 24.5 cm and containing 87 miniatures and numerous <b>drop</b> <b>capitals.</b> The bright colors come from azurite, malachite and cinnabar pigments mixed with egg, honey or glue, and varnished with a coat of wax. The figures de of people are limited to lines and their expressivity comes from their large almond-shaped eyes. In the margins of many pages are numerous annotations certainly added by the author during his work, and others made later over the centuries.|$|R

40|$|A <b>capital</b> <b>drop</b> {{is a type}} of {{osteophyte}} at the inferomedial {{portion of}} the femoral head commonly observed in hip osteoarthritis (OA), secondary to developmental dysplasia. <b>Capital</b> <b>drop</b> itself is typically asymptomatic; however, symptoms can appear secondary to impinge against the acetabulum or to irritation of the surrounding tissues, such as nerves, vessels, and tendons. We present here a case of unilateral leg edema in a patient with hip OA, caused by a huge bone mass occurring at the inferomedial portion of the femoral head that compressed the femoral vessels. We diagnosed this bone mass as a <b>capital</b> <b>drop</b> secondary to hip OA after confirming that the mass occurred at least after the age of 63 years based on a previous X-ray. We performed early resection and total hip arthroplasty since the patient’s hip pain was due to both advanced hip OA and compression of the femoral vessels; moreover, we aimed to prevent venous thrombosis secondary to vascular compression considering the advanced age and the potent risk of thrombosis in the patient. A large <b>capital</b> <b>drop</b> should be considered as a cause of vascular compression in cases of unilateral leg edema in OA patients...|$|R

30|$|The usual {{argument}} in the literature is that the OLS estimate {{of the impact of}} capital growth on business lending growth is biased upward because lending and capital tend both to contract during recessions. One would also expect an upward bias of OLS estimates in the cross-section because banks lending to weaker firms (i.e., those that are affected most by downturns in the business cycle) experience larger <b>drops</b> in <b>capital.</b> However, in Table 4 the OLS estimate is below the TSLS one.|$|R

Thus, male labor reallocates to the expanding sectors, where the <b>capital</b> labor ratio <b>drops.</b> Consequently, by the assumption on complementarities, the gender wage gap widens and female labor shares fall.

40|$|What are the {{positive}} and normative implications of eliminating bankruptcy protection for indebted individuals? Without bankruptcy protection, creditors can collect on defaulted debt to the extent permitted by wage garnishment laws. The elimination lowers the default premium on unsecured debt and permits low-net-worth individuals suffering bad earnings shocks to smooth consumption by borrowing. There is a large increase in consumer debt financed essentially by super-wealthy individuals, a modest <b>drop</b> in <b>capital</b> per worker, and a higher frequency of consumer default. Average welfare rises by 1 percent of consumption in perpetuity, with about 90 percent of households favoring the change. Default (Finance); Bankruptcy; Consumer credit...|$|R

30|$|The {{impact of}} the {{recession}} on state tax revenues operates through two different channels. The first is through the national {{impact of the}} sharp decline in stock market valuations, and the attendant collapse in realized capital gains. State tax bases are affected by this component in proportion to their pre-recession reliance on capital gains income, {{which in turn is}} associated with the degree of income concentration. In a small number of states, progressive tax structures amplified the fiscal impact of large <b>drops</b> in <b>capital</b> gains income. However, our regression results suggest that in a larger group of states, tax structures served to dampen the revenue impact of the change in capital gains.|$|R

A {{possible explanation for the}} discrepancy between the results is that we hold constant anticipated <b>capital</b> <b>drops</b> by controlling for the change in non-performing loans.|$|R
50|$|Lockheed had {{established}} a strong position in commercial airliner production with its piston-engine Constellation series. Further development brought turboprop engines to the Constellation airframe with the Lockheed L-1249 Super Constellation. In 1951, Lockheed was approached by Capital Airlines {{to develop a new}} turboprop airliner which was designated the YC-130, however there was no interest from any other carriers, so the design was <b>dropped.</b> Subsequently, <b>Capital</b> Airlines went on to order 60 British Vickers Viscounts. In 1954, as a result of American Airlines' interest in developing a twin engine aircraft, the idea resurfaced and the company offered a twin-engine design now designated the CL-303. This newer design was a high-wing type and would allow for 60 to 70 passengers. This design was also shelved for lack of interest from other carriers.|$|R

All line and page breaks from the original have been preserved, as have spelling, punctuation, capitalization, <b>drop</b> <b>capitals,</b> page numbers, and signature identification numbers. Ultimately, the Northwestern-Newberry edition will establish and make available the authoritative texts of these poems and prose pieces.

A facsimile of the 1924 Constable (Standard) edition in PDF format and the texts of both editions in ASCII format are also attached as supplemental “Related Files. ” The Constable edition is of particular interest because it incorporates notes and alterations that Melville indicated in his and other copies of the first edition. John Marr and Other Sailors includes the following poems and prose pieces: Inscription Epistolary John Marr Bridegroom Dick Tom Deadlight Jack Roy The Haglets The Æolian Harp To the Master of the “Meteor” Far off-Shore The Man-of-War Hawk The Figure-Head The Good Craft “Snow-Bird” Old Counsel The Tuft of Kelp The Maldive Shark To Ned Crossing the Tropics The Berg The Enviable Isles Pebbles I-VII An ASCII format edition of John Marr and Other Poems by Herman Melville; with An Introductory Note by Henry Chapin, published by Princeton University Press (Princeton, NJ, 1922) is available online at Project Gutenberg, EBook # 12841 3 ̆c [URL] 3 ̆e.
