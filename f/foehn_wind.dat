5|$|During the storm's passage, {{there were}} 61daily {{rainfall}} records broken by Nabi's precipitation across Japan. The rains from Nabi caused significant slope failures and large accumulations of driftwood. The amount of sediment {{displaced by the}} rains was estimated at 4,456m3/km2, over four times the yearly average. A total of 630m3 (2,066ft3) of driftwood was recorded. However, the rainfall also helped to end water restrictions in Kagawa and Tokushima prefectures. In addition to the heavy rainfall, Nabi produced gusty winds on the Japan mainland, peaking at 115km/h (72mph) in Muroto. A station on Tobishima in the Sea of Japan recorded a gust of 119km/h (74mph). The typhoon spawned a F1 tornado in Miyazaki, which damaged several buildings. In Wajima, Ishikawa, Nabi produced a <b>Foehn</b> <b>wind,</b> causing temperatures to rise quickly.|$|E
5|$|During 4January, Rewa {{moved back}} into the South Pacific basin and {{continued}} eastward as a weakening category 3severe tropical cyclone, with the FMS estimating the 10-minute sustained windspeeds at 150km/h (90mph). During the next day, its eye became obscured after the mountains of New Caledonia affected Rewa's circulation by creating a hot and dry <b>Foehn</b> <b>wind.</b> The FMS reported that the system had weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become a tropical storm. The system subsequently made landfall {{in the vicinity of}} Saint Vincent Bay on New Caledonia's south-western coast, before it emerged near Thio from the east coast during 6 January. By 7January, Rewa's circulation had become exposed under the influence of upper level north-westerlies; as a result both the FMS and JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened into a depression. Over the next 3 days, the residual low-level circulation was steered towards the northwest and Papua New Guinea in a southeasterly trade wind flow generated by a powerful area of high pressure located between New Zealand and Kermadec Islands. During 10 January, Rewa's remnants moved out of the South Pacific basin and {{back into the}} Australian region while starting to re-intensify into a tropical cyclone, as a mid to upper level trough over eastern Australia increased in size.|$|E

25|$|Zürich has, {{depending}} on the definition used, an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb), with four distinct seasons. Decisive for the climate of Zürich are both the winds from westerly directions, which often result in precipitation and, on the other hand, the Bise (east or north-east wind), which is usually associated with high-pressure situations, but cooler weather phases with temperatures lower than the average. The <b>Foehn</b> <b>wind,</b> which {{plays an important role}} in the northern alpine valleys also has some impact on Zürich.|$|E
25|$|The Rs.I was {{completed}} by October 1915 and rolled out at Seemos for trials. On 23 October, during a taxi test, the port propeller and/or gearbox parted company with the aircraft, causing damage to the gearbox mountings and the upper wing. The opportunity was taken to move the outboard engines into nacelles identical to that of centre engine, and mount them between the wings on an independent structure with catwalks to enable engineers to attend to engines in flight. This gave much better clearance from spray for the propellers, which was probably {{the cause of the}} port gearbox/propeller failure. Taxiing trials recommenced, but with little success. On 21 December 1915 a <b>Foehn</b> <b>wind</b> blew up during trials. Unable to beach the giant flying boat, attempts were made to ride out the storm on the lake, but the moorings gave and the Rs.I was dashed to pieces on the lakeside rocks.|$|E

50|$|Anecdotally, {{residents}} {{in areas of}} frequent <b>foehn</b> <b>winds</b> report a variety of illnesses ranging from migraines to psychosis. The first clinical review of these effects was published by the Austrian physician Anton Czermak in the 19th century. A study by the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München found that suicide and accidents increased by 10 percent during <b>foehn</b> <b>winds</b> in Central Europe. The causation of Föhnkrankheit (English: Foehn-sickness) is yet unproven. Labeling for preparations of aspirin combined with caffeine, codeine and the like will sometimes include Föhnkrankheit amongst the indications. Evidence for effects from Chinook winds remain anecdotal.|$|R
25|$|In {{the winter}} half year, {{the air on}} the Swiss Plateau can stay still, with little {{exchange}} to rest of the atmosphere, building a lake of cold air on the plateau and often a ceiling of high fog. The clouds look like an ocean of fog when seen from above, (usually around 800m) and hence is called the 'nebelmeer'. This weather is called inversion because the temperature below the fog {{is lower than the}} temperature above. Sometimes, it lasts for days or even for weeks, during which the neighbouring regions of the Alps and the Jura can have the brightest sunshine. Typical for the high fog is the bise, a cold wind from northeast. Since it is channelled by the Swiss Plateau narrowing in southwest, it reaches its major strength in the lake Geneva region where wind speeds of 60km/h with top speeds of more than 100km/h are usual in typical bise weather. The regions near the Alps of the central and eastern plateau sometimes have temperature rises due to the warm <b>foehn</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) was {{the fastest}} warming region on earth during the 20 th century. The {{eastern side of}} the Peninsula is {{typically}} 5 - 10 K colder than at equivalent latitudes on the western side. Despite this cooler climate, a number of ice shelves have collapsed in the last two decades. In 1995 Larsen A collapsed, shortly followed by Larsen B in 2002. Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS), the largest remaining ice shelf, is now showing evidence of potential destabilisation, including melt ponding and rift acceleration. The `hydrofracture mechanism’ suggests that percolation of melt water into crevasses allows them to deepen and extend to the ice shelf base, which leads to destabilisation. Advection of warm, dry air onto the ice shelf from <b>foehn</b> <b>winds</b> is partly responsible for the melt water. Investigating <b>foehn</b> <b>winds</b> over LCIS was one aim of the Orographic Flow and Climate of the Antarctic Peninsula (OFCAP) project. The aim of this research is to investigate the spatial distribution and frequency of the <b>foehn</b> <b>winds,</b> and assess their impact on the LCIS. To investigate this, near-surface observational data at six locations is combined with archived regional model output at 5 km horizontal-resolution from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS). A novel semi-automatic algorithm has been developed to detect <b>foehn</b> <b>winds</b> from near-surface observations. A relatively new algorithm has been adapted for use over the AP, to detect foehn conditions from the AMPS output. Foehn characteristics over the ice shelf have been identified to create a mini-climatology of the location and occurrence of <b>foehn</b> <b>winds</b> from 2009 to 2012. Foehn conditions have been observed as far south as 68 S for the first time. Foehn events are most frequent in spring, when over 50...|$|R

As such, the temperature may rise as much as [...] in a few hours, with humidity approaching 0% during a Zonda wind event. In contrast, cold waves are also common, owing to the Andes channeling cold air from the south, allowing cold fronts to come frequently during the winter months, causing cool to cold temperatures with temperatures that can fall below freezing. Temperatures can dip below [...] at the higher altitudes.|$|E

Twenty-five separate wetlands totaling [...] {{have been identified in}} the watershed. Temperatures average between , although the Brookings effect (or Chetco effect; similar to a <b>foehn</b> <b>wind)</b> often brings localized hot weather to the Brookings area. The increase in temperature is caused by the geography of the region; cool air funnels down the Chetco River valley from the Siskiyou and Coast ranges, gradually heating up before eventually reaching Brookings as a warm wind.
