In 1993, REL publicly revealed its spaceplane proposal, which it named Skylon after the Skylon structure that had inspired Alan Bond at the Festival of Britain exhibition. Skylon was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL, the new concept again utilised dual-mode propulsion system, using engines that could combust hydrogen with the external air during atmospheric flight; but again SABRE was a clean sheet redesign based on lessons learned during development of HOTOL's RB545 engine Early on, Skylon was promoted by the company to the ESA for its Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme (FESTIP) initiative, as well as seeking out both government or commercial investment in order to finance the vehicle's development.

Though the social {{sciences}} have addressed the effects of existing structural patterns on the formation of new ties, less {{attention has been given}} to ties in directed networks. Drawing from the microblogging service Twitter, we conducted a web-based experiment in which subjects were asked to rate their interest in <b>forming</b> <b>ties</b> to other people, blind to existing network connections between them. We show that two structural characteristics, transitivity and mutuality, are significant predictors of the desire to <b>form</b> new <b>ties.</b> Our findings shed light on tie formation, especially in online networks...|$|R

Armstrong thought that FM {{had the potential to}} replace AM stations within 5 years, which he promoted as a boost for the radio manufacturing industry, then suffering from the effects of the Great Depression, since making existing AM radio transmitters and receivers obsolete would necessitate that stations buy replacement transmitters and listeners purchase FM-capable receivers. In 1936 he published a landmark paper in the Proceedings of the IRE that documented the superior capabilities of using wide-band FM. (This paper would be reprinted in the August 1984 issue of Proceedings of the IEEE.) A year later, a paper by Murray G. Crosby (inventor of Crosby system for FM Stereo) in the same journal provided further analysis of the wide-band FM characteristics, and introduced the concept of [...] "threshold", demonstrating that there is a superior signal to noise ratio when the signal is stronger than a certain level.|$|E
