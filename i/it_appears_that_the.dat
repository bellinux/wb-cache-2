5|$|This {{being the}} case, however, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genetic {{variability}} of cultivated N. rajah plants is very small, as all commercially available tissue-cultured plants {{are thought to}} belong to just four clones originating from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London, England.|$|E
5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, {{the anatomy}} of the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} that its habits were largely terrestrial. Like the extinct Mauritian duck and the Mascarene coot, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion. Both populations {{were said to be}} easy to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E

50|$|Another {{method is}} to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> voter has spoiled his or her ballot, thus {{rendering}} it invalid. Typically this would be done by adding another mark to <b>the</b> paper, making <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> voter has voted for more candidates than entitled, for instance.

5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Council of Chelsea {{approved}} Lichfield's elevation to an archdiocese, Hygeberht, who was present, {{remained a}} bishop at its conclusion; {{he signed the}} council's report still as a bishop. There {{is no indication that}} he played any significant part in the council nor in the actions that led to him becoming an archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{reports that}} 6,000 Germans perished on the {{battlefield}} and in the pursuit on land. (Libanius gives a figure of 8,000). Thousands more drowned {{as they tried to}} get across the river. It is thus likely that {{about a third of the}} German force lost their lives. However, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority escaped, including the eight reges alongside Chnodomar. The Romans lost just 243 men, including four tribuni (regimental commanders) of which two were commanders of cataphracti.|$|E
5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{decision}} of {{the court of appeals}} was rested, in addition to other grounds, upon a distinct and independent ground, not involving any federal question, and sufficient in itself to maintain the judgment, the writ of error falls within the wellsettled rule on that subject, and cannot be maintained.|$|E

5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{need for}} neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly {{over the period}} between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed {{at least in part}} to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{as part of}} the Tawani Foundation 2008 Antarctic International Expedition (see below), Dale Andersen and Ian Hawes {{discovered}} conical stromatolites {{growing in}} Lake Untersee, the largest living ones known to date. Small microbial pinnacles are also present, and <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> large conical stromatolites and the small pinnacles are made by different microbial communities. These communities provide an important analog to some of the oldest fossil stromatolites found to date.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{victory of}} Michael III over the Rus' {{was invented by}} the Byzantine historians in the mid-9th century or later and became {{generally}} accepted in the Slavic chronicles influenced by them. However, {{the memory of the}} successful campaign was transmitted orally among the Kievans and may have dictated Nestor's account of Oleg's 907 campaign, which is not recorded in Byzantine sources at all.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Thomas was still at the papal court when the cathedral chapter of the diocese of Ross were carrying out their elections for the successor of Robert de Fyvie. Two separate elections {{took place in the}} period between 17 November 1292 and 18 November 1295, and <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chapter elected both the cathedral precentor, Adam de Darlington, as well as Thomas de Dundee, who then held a canonry in the diocese.|$|E
5|$|Results of an mtDNA {{analysis}} of 55 jungle cats from various biogeographic zones in India indicate a high genetic variation and {{a relatively low}} differentiation between populations. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> central Indian F. c. kutas population separates the Thar F. c. prateri populations from the rest and also the south Indian F. c. kelaarti populations from the north Indian F. c. affinis ones. The central Indian populations are genetically closer to the southern than to the northern populations.|$|E
5|$|Robert's {{theology}} {{is expressed in}} his three surviving works, the Quaestiones de divina pagina, Quaestiones de epistolis Pauli, and the unfinished Sententiae. The dating of the works is problematic, but <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first two works were composed between 1145 and 1157. The Sententiae was revised twice, probably during the 1150s and the 1160s. His works, especially the Sententiae, cover the entire subject of theology and are strictly orthodox in Christian doctrine.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan was}} concerted between Eastern Emperor Leo, Western Emperor Anthemius, and General Marcellinus, who enjoyed {{independence}} in Illyricum. Basiliscus {{was ordered to}} sail directly to Carthage, while Marcellinus attacked and took Sardinia, and a third army, commanded by Heraclius of Edessa, landed on the Libyan coast east of Carthage, making rapid progress. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> combined forces met in Sicily, whence the three fleets moved at different periods.|$|E
5|$|According to the Hittite inscriptions, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ahhiya were a {{powerful}} empire, {{at the same}} scale as contemporary Egypt, Assyria and the Hittite Empire. Moreover, {{based on the fact}} that Attarsiya launched a military campaign in Anatolia and fielded one hundred chariots, in addition to infantry, Dutch researcher Jorrit Kelder suggested that Ahhiya must have had the military capacity of at least three times the size of the Mycenaean kingdom of Pylos, based on the information recorded on the Linear B tablets unearthed from the specific palace. Based on this view, the Achaeans under Attarsiya may have formed some kind of alliance which included several Mycenaean kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of the {{original}} Clock Tower, central protagonist Jennifer Simpson was adopted by Helen Maxwell, an assistant professor of criminal psychology in Oslo, Norway. She begins undergoing treatment at a university research building in order {{to learn more about the}} Scissorman murder case at Barrows Castle and help her cope with her trauma. Over a year has passed, and now a series of brutal murders have made headline news. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Scissorman has returned. Having heard the details of Jennifer's original encounters with the Scissorman, Helen begins searching for information that could put an end to the seemingly immortal killer. The scenarios that follow, including the player characters and settings, are vastly different depending on player actions throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a piece of the wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, however, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{ships were}} well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} {{were surprised to}} note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.|$|E
5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly {{the same as that}} of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E
