2500|$|The {{original}} {{decision of}} disallowing the doosra bowling action was hailed widely as justifiable {{on account of}} being scientifically based. Hence, a team of Australian scientists [...] representing the University of South Australia conducted an independent research, in line with modern Artificial Intelligence and biomechanics in order to solve the controversial issue arise from doosra. The University of South Australia's study, founded by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama, and contributed by Prof. Ozdemir Gol, Prof. J. Mazumdar, Prof. Tony Worsley and Prof. Lakmi Jain has analyzed the previous studies with close scrutiny since the techniques in their fields of expertise are employed {{in the course of}} assessment as the basis for decision-making. The findings based on this scientific study are overwhelming and Dave Richardson, General Manager ICC stated that the ICC is currently reviewing the Law on throwing and the ICC regulations and the study done by Prof. Mahinda Pathegama with UniSA scientists [...] is a valuable source of information in this regard. The team of Australian scientists including Sri Lankan-born Australian scientist, Prof. Mahinda Pathegama reporting their findings, in line with the Muralitharan test to ICC, has analyzed in-depth various issues, such as Pitfalls in <b>image</b> <b>interpretation</b> when using 2D images for 3D modeling associates compared to the modern techniques in Artificial Intelligence and biomechanics, and Biomechanics assessment for doosra bowling action, etc. Pathegama at al. (2004) further reports on the Disagreement of expression on measurement accuracy in the Murali Report, with the analysis of the Motion tracking system used for the Murali Report, and discussing Cognitive aspects, Evidence of errors in Anthropometric assessment and movement tracking, Lateral inhibition in response tracking, Psycho-physiological aspect on post-assessments, Angular measurement errors, Skin marker induced errors, Geometrics-and physics-based 3D modeling and the Approach to on-field assessment, etc.|$|E

50|$|Principles of <b>image</b> <b>interpretation</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} empirically for more than 150 years. The most basic of these principles are the elements of <b>image</b> <b>interpretation.</b> They are: location, size, shape, shadow, tone/color, texture, pattern, height/depth and site/situation/association. These are routinely used when interpreting an aerial photo or analyzing a photo-like image. A well-trained image interpreter uses many of these elements during their analysis without really thinking about them. However, a beginner may {{not only have to}} force themselves to consciously evaluate an unknown object with respect to these elements, but also analyze its significance in relation to the other objects or phenomena in the photo or image.|$|E

50|$|There {{are some}} {{shortcomings}} or difficulties {{when working with}} an MFM, such as: the recorded image depends {{on the type of}} the tip and magnetic coating, due to tip-sample interactions. Magnetic field of the tip and sample can change each other's magnetization, M, which can result in nonlinear interactions. This hinders <b>image</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Relatively short lateral scanning range (order of hundreds micrometers). Scanning (lift) height affects the image. Housing of the MFM system is important to shield electromagnetic noise (Faraday cage), acoustic noise (anti-vibration tables), air flow (air isolation), and static charge on the sample.|$|E

In many cases the tumors/lesions are directly imaged with respect to size and shape. <b>Image</b> <b>interpretation</b> for mammograms is mature and can be effective. However, there are concerns that the higher density of breast tissue in patients younger than 40/45 years of age degrades the diagnostic information obtained in this technique. Some {{studies have shown that}} mammography is less effective before the age 50. It is also difficult to see precancerous lesions with mammography, which have not emerged into localized density changes imaged by the low-dose of radiation.|$|E
