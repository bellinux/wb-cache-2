Two black Americans were also among the enlisted men in the crew. During Monitors service, commanders and several officers were replaced because of injuries or for other reasons.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} south through rural Virginia in October 1780, Kościuszko {{proceeded to}} North Carolina {{to report to}} his former commander General Gates. However, following Gates's disastrous defeat at Camden on August 16, 1780, the Continental Congress <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> Washington's choice, Major General Nathanael Greene, to replace the disgraced Gates as commander of the Southern Department. When Greene formally assumed command on December 3, 1780, he retained Kościuszko as his chief engineer. By then, he had been praised by both Gates and Greene.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Logan, {{many other}} artists were {{popular with the}} book-makers, {{including}} You're A Star winner Lucia Evans, host of the Eurovision Song Contest 1997 Ronan Keating, as well as winner of the 1992 contest Linda Martin. However, RTÉ announced in November 2006 that they <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> Irish traditional group Dervish to sing for Ireland at the contest. Dervish consists of Cathy Jordan (vocals and bodhrán), Bob The 2nd, (reck the head) Brian McDonagh (mandola), Tom Morrow (fiddle), Michael Homes (bouzouki), Shane Mitchell (accordion) and Liam Kelly (flute and whistle).|$|E
5|$|Bakshi <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> {{a number}} of songs from his own record {{collection}} for the film's soundtrack, which were not used in the film due to {{the high costs of}} licensing the songs. The film was initially scored by singer Dan Hicks, who became involved with the production of the film in 1974. Because of the delay of the film's release, Hicks' label released the material from these sessions under the title It Happened One Bite. When the film was released in 1982, it had been rescored by John Madara.|$|E
5|$|Before long, it {{was noted}} that there were {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although his account most probably is built around the facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled with the belief that the Communist Party <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the championship, each {{participating}} nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of fifteen skaters and two goaltenders and a maximum of twenty skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. A country that <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> fewer than the maximum allowed must have chosen the remaining players prior to {{the start of}} the tournament. After {{the start of the}} tournament, each team was allowed to select an additional two players to their roster, for a maximum of 25 players. Once players were registered to the team, they could not be removed from the roster.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the Sino-Indian War in 1962, India had assembled one of the largest air forces in Asia, and the Hunter was the nation's primary and most capable interceptor. During the conflict, the Hunter demonstrated its superiority over China's Russian-sourced MiGs and gave India a strategic advantage in the air. India's aerial superiority deterred Chinese Ilyushin Il-4 bombers from attacking targets within India. In 1962, India <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> to procure its first supersonic-capable fighter, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21; large numbers of Russian-built fighters had increasingly supplemented the aging Hunters in the interceptor role by 1970.|$|E
5|$|In its {{advertisement}} in The Economist, Steorn challenged {{scientists to}} form an independent jury to test their technology and publish the results. Within 36 hours of the advertisement being published, 420 scientists contacted Steorn and, on 1 December 2006, Steorn announced it <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> a jury. It was headed by Ian MacDonald, emeritus professor of electrical engineering at the University of Alberta, and the process began in February 2007.|$|E

5|$|On March 26, 2001, Heisley {{announced}} that he <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> Memphis. Memphis and Louisville were the most promising cities, with Heisley selecting Memphis because it offered a better deal and because of poor local executive leadership in Louisville. The choice {{would still have to}} be studied by a five-member NBA group before permission was granted from the league. The team's final game at GM Place was a 95–100 loss against the Houston Rockets on April 14; the team's final game as a Vancouver-based franchise was a road 95–81 win against the Golden State Warriors on April 18.|$|E
5|$|On May 4, 1925, Rossi sent {{a letter}} to Mint Director Robert J. Grant. Rossi noted that there had been some delay in the {{preparation}} of the design for the new half dollar, and that California Senator Samuel M. Shortridge had urged Rossi's committee to move forward without delay. Rossi enclosed sketches by California sculptor Joseph (Jo) Mora, with the promise that a finished design, and a model, would follow. Citizens' Committee members <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> Mora unanimously, feeling he was the one artist who could capture the spirit of what was being commemorated.|$|E
5|$|The Quebec Nordiques, who won 26 games {{combined}} in the 1989–90 and 1990–91 seasons, held the first overall selection {{in the draft}} {{for the third consecutive}} year.

However, Lindros stated before the draft that he would hold out and refuse to play for Quebec. He wanted to play in an English-speaking area that would present him with more endorsement opportunities.|$|E

5|$|The {{change in}} tactics {{appeared}} to be effective, as October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats about their chances the following month. Democratic party leaders <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> English as Hancock's running mate because of his popularity in Indiana. With their state-level defeat there, some talked of dropping English from the ticket, but he convinced them that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November.|$|E
5|$|When Berkman {{was brought}} to the {{courtroom}} on September19, the jury had already been empaneled. The district attorney <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> the jury without allowing Berkman to examine prospective jurors, and the judge had no objection to the unusual procedure. Berkman was charged with six counts: felonious assault with the intent to kill Frick; felonious assault with the intent to kill Lawrence Leishman, who had been in Frick's office {{at the time of the}} attack; feloniously entering the offices of the Carnegie Steel Company on three occasions; and unlawfully carrying concealed weapons. Berkman pleaded not guilty to all charges.|$|E
5|$|During {{the design}} process, the A318 {{encountered}} several problems. The {{first one was}} the decline in demand for new aircraft following the September 11 attacks. Another was the new Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines, which burned more fuel than expected; by the time CFM International (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 customers had already backed out, including Air China and British Airways. America West Airlines, which <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> the Pratt & Whitney engines, amended its A318 orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. Trans World Airlines cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by American Airlines, which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a regional jet alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have kept {{it in the same}} class as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type's market potential.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s and 1990s, Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) {{produced}} 232 Block 30/40/50 F-16s on a production line in Ankara under license for the Turkish Air Force. TAI also produced 46 Block 40s for Egypt {{in the mid-1990s}} and 30 Block 50 from 2010. Korean Aerospace Industries opened a production line for the KF-16 program, producing 140 Block 52s from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s (decade). If India <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> the F-16IN for its Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft procurement, a sixth F-16 production line would be built in India. In May 2013, Lockheed Martin stated there were currently enough orders to keep producing the F-16 until 2017.|$|E
5|$|Following {{extensive}} {{discussions on}} the fighting ability of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, the Political Bureau approved the General Staff’s plan, which <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> the Central Highlands as the main battlefield for the upcoming offensive. The Central Highlands campaign was codenamed ‘Campaign 275’ and {{the goal was to}} capture the city of Ban Me Thuot. To achieve that objective, North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến Dũng placed great emphasis on the principles of massed force, secrecy, and surprise to draw South Vietnamese forces away from the main objective. For the element of surprise to be successful, North Vietnamese forces needed to launch strong diversionary attacks on Pleiku and Kon Tum, thereby leaving Ban Me Thuot completely exposed. Once the element of surprise had been achieved, the North Vietnamese would mass their forces on Ban Me Thuot, and prevent South Vietnamese reinforcements from retaking the city.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the third}} prototype, several design {{improvements}} were developed and incorporated into further aircraft. Because of excessive smoke emissions by the RD-93 engine, the air intakes were widened. Reported control problems found in testing resulted in alterations to the wing leading edge root extensions (LERX). The vertical tail fin was enlarged to house an expanded electronic warfare equipment bay in the tip. The redesigned aircraft had a slightly increased {{maximum take-off weight}} and incorporated an increased quantity of Chinese-sourced avionics; however PAF <b>had</b> <b>selected</b> Western avionics for their aircraft, postponing PAF deliveries from late 2005 until 2007. Pakistan evaluated British, French, and Italian avionics suites, the winner of which {{was expected to be}} finalised in 2006. PT-04, the fourth prototype and the first to incorporate the design changes, was rolled out in April 2006 and made its first flight on 28 April 2006.|$|E
