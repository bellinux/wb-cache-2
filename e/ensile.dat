40|$|Two {{case studies}} of water {{pollution}} by business are analyzed, focusing {{on the problem of}} who is responsible for preventing future unethical environmental and non-environmental business activities. Water pollution is unethical because it adversely affects the legitimate rights and goals of other water users. Because the consequences of unethical business actions cannot be fully determined, prevention is the key to changing unethical practices. The educated society realizes its primary responsibility for defining the role and behavior of its business institution. Business will only change unethical practices in response to reasonable societal demands. As a dominant and financially powerful institution of modern society, business is the ideal agent to generate change within its ranks because business leaders are in the position to know of any unethical practices which may be occurring within the organization. This position <b>ensiles</b> prevention.

40|$|The {{strain of}} Lactobacillus plantarum is {{intended}} to improve the ensiling process at proposed doses ranging from 1  x  108 to 1  x  109 CFU/kg fresh material. This speciesis considered by EFSA to be suitable for the {{qualified presumption of safety}} approach to safety assessment. As the identity of the strain has been established and as no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected, the use of the strain in the production of silage is presumed safe for livestock species, for consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. The active agent is not an eye or skin irritant or a skin sensitiser. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent and the high dusting potential of the product tested, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat this additive as a respiratory sensitiser. A total of 20 laboratory-scale ensiling studies were conducted with L. plantarum applied at 1 x 109 or 1 x 108 CFU/kg forage. In all the studies, forage containing the additive was compared with untreated control materials, and the duration of the studies was at least 90 days. L. plantarum has the potential to improve the production of silage by increasing lactic acid content and the preservation of dry matter, by reducing the pH and protein degradation. This was demonstrated in a range of easy and moderately difficult to <b>ensile</b> forage materials at a minimum concentration of 1 x 108 CFU/kg fresh material and also in difficult to <b>ensile</b> forage materials when added at a concentration of 1 x 109 CFU/kg fresh material...|$|E

The alignment of SiC whiskers along the extrusion direction in SiCw- 2124 AI composites was improved and the aspect ratio of SiC whiskers was decreased with increasing extrusion ratio from 10 : 1 to 25 : 1. The SiCw- 2124 AI composite xhibited the highest <b>ensile</b> strength at the extrusion ratio of 15 : 1. The aspect ratio of whiskers {{and the relative}} density of composite increased with increasing extrusion temperature from 470 °C to 530 °C.

The highest <b>ensile</b> strength of SiCw- 2124 A 1 composite at the extrusion ratio of 15 : 1 is explained by the largest effective aspect ratio due to the balance of the alignment and aspect ratio of SiC whiskers.

It is expected that generating energy in small units situated close to energy consumers may bring about substantial benefits. It is assumed that in a scattered energy generation system, energy will be produced from local fuels, such as broadly understood biomass as a primary component for production of gaseous and liquid biofuels to power low-power energy generators. An adequate amount of biomass must be secured to ensure that biogas can be produced all year round. The easiest way to store highly efficient biomass is to <b>ensile</b> maize and rye as well as grass. The amounts of biogas obtained from these two types of silage are comparable. Using rye as a renewable energy source for production of either bioethanol or biogas is economically viable for at least two reasons: rye grows on poor class soils and rye cultivation technology can be reduced to just nitrogen fertilization.

For ensiling, whole-crop aruana grass (75 d of growth) was chopped (275 g kg- 1 dry matter - DM) and ensiled alone or associated with gliricidia (270 g kg- 1 DM; 150 d of growth). For gliricidia, we used only the leaves and stalks to <b>ensile.</b> The evaluated treatments were different ratios of aruana grass to gliricidia (100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75, and 0 : 100), with four replicates (mini-silos). The silage composed only of gliricidia exhibited a lower pH than the other silages. Dry matter recovery was not affected by the treatments, although effluent losses were affected. The replacement of aruana grass by gliricidia 50 % at ensiling resulted in a higher lactic acid bacteria count. The aruana grass silages displayed lower protein contents and a higher neutral detergent fiber content than the gliricidia silages after 40 d of fermentation. Consequently, the silage consisting of 100 % gliricidia showed higher in vitro DM digestibility, presenting an increase of 8. 13 % after 40 d of fermentation compared with 100 % of aruana grass silage. After silo opening, the gliricidia silage was very stable (> 72 h).

As the identity of the strains has been established and as no resistance to antibiotics of human and veterinary clinical significance was detected, the use of the strains in the production of silage is presumed safe for livestock species, consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. In the absence of evidence, these additives should be regarded as skin and eye irritants and potential skin sensitisers. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agents, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat these additives as respiratory sensitisers.

There were four replicates per treatment and the silos were stored for 132 days. DIFF silage made without additive was poorly fermented. All additives increased the extent and improved the direction of DIFF silage fermentation, and reduced in-silo losses. However, MIX did not reduce butyric acid concentration and increased the extent of aerobic deterioration. LAB had a smaller effect on fermentation and in-silo losses than FA. With EASI silages, all additives restricted the extent of fermentation and improved fermentation quality, with the latter effect being smaller than for DIFF silages. LAB promoted a particularly homolactic fermentation but subsequently increased aerobic deterioration. In both DIFF and EASI silages additive treatment improved in vitro digestibility. It is concluded that only ATF 1, ATF 2 and MIX were as effective as FA at improving silage preservation and reducing in-silo losses with both DIFF and EASI herbages. However, ATF 1 and ATF 2 were superior in reducing the apparent extent of proteolysis and MIX was slightly less effective at reducing the activity of saccharolytic Clostridia. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Enterococcus faecium is a {{technological}} additive intended {{to improve the}} ensiling process at a proposed dose of 1 x 108 CFU/kg fresh material. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics. It is not expected {{that the use of}} E. faecium at the dose proposed would substantially increase the exposure to this species of animals given silage as part of their rations Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers that use of this strain in the preparation of silage is safe for the target animals. Since the strain does not belong to the hospital-associated clade and does not express resistance to the antibiotics tested, use of this strain in animal nutrition is not expected to raise concerns for consumers of animal products. The material safety data sheet proposed indicates that preparations containing the strain may cause irritation upon contact with skin and eyes. The dustiness of the preparation tested indicated a potential for users to be exposed via inhalation. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent, the additive should be considered to have {{the potential to be a}} skin/respiratory sensitiser and treated accordingly. The use of the strain under the conditions proposed is considered safe for the environment. Studies with laboratory-scale silos are described made using three samples of mixed forage of differing water-soluble carbohydrate content and representing material easy, moderately difficult and difficult to <b>ensile.</b> In each case, replicate silos containing treated forage were compared to identical silos containing the same but untreated forage. Because of the very limited responses to treatment in two of the three forage samples tested, the FEEDAP Panel is unable to conclude on the benefit of using the strain of E. faecium as a silage additive for all forage species...|$|E
40|$|Grass {{samples were}} {{harvested}} during the 1993 growing season after a precut on April 27, 1993 and were stored frozen or left to <b>ensile</b> in 30 -L buckets. Effects on chemical composition and fermentation kinetics of the maturation {{of the grass}} and of ensiling were investigated. Chemical composition and fermentation kinetics were determined using the gas production technique, in vitro techniques, and the nylon bag technique. Two silage samples were also investigated in vivo. Maturation caused a decrease in crude protein content and organic matter degradability {{and an increase in}} neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and lignin contents. Degradation rates were highest for the youngest samples and decreased as grass and silage matured. This result could be observed from the first derivative of the cumulative gas production curves (i. e., the rate of gas production) and from the gas production parameters. The rate of degradation of the nonsoluble fraction of the young samples, determined using the gas production technique, was relatively higher in rumen fluid from a cow fed silage from grass cut at a young stage. More mature samples were degraded relatively faster in rumen fluid from a cow fed mature grass silage, suggesting a specific adaptation of the rumen microorganisms to the grass properties. There was a good relationship among the second phase of gas production (i. e., fermentation of the nonsoluble fraction), maturity of the grass and grass silage samples, degradability determined with the Tilley and Terry technique, and degradability determined after 46 h of incubation in rumen fluid. Results obtained with both of the different in vitro techniques and the nylon bag technique were confirmed by the in vivo experiments involving the two silage samples...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{cavities}} {{die casting}} (Permanent die casting) in vertical arrangement and horizontal arrangement moulds {{are widely used}} in industry. However, manufacturers assume that each product produced in either arrangement {{would have the same}} quality. Manufacturers do not have enough information about the properties of each product, i. e. strength, internal defect and the microstructure. Furthermore, in actuality the quality of each product might be affected. It is the problem that we found within the market now (pinholes, cracks, misruns and etc.), that is the reason investigation and comparison of the multi product in vertical and horizontal arrangement is needed. This investigation is needed to choose which arrangement is preferred to maintain the quality of the product. The methodology used are vickers microhardness test, izod test, <b>ensile</b> test, density and porosity test and optical microscope inspection for all produced sample. Results of this research show that castings produced at vertical arrangement mould have higher mechanical and properties than castings produced in horizontal arrangement mould. Vertical arrangement castings obtained higher density exceeds % 1. 6117 than horizontal arrangement castings that ranges between (1. 156 and 4. 8707 percent). However, vertical arrangement castings obtained higher porosity exceeds % 13. 3885 than horizontal arrangement castings that ranges between (0. 0809 and 7. 4629 percent). The hardness values for vertical castings ranges between (115 HV and 78. 9 HV), while ranges between (110 HV and 79. 1 HV) for horizontal castings. Castings in vertical arrangement hardness are % 7. 5442 higher than hardness for castings in horizontal arrangement. Impact strength values of vertical arrangement casting impact values that ranges between(6 J and 19 J) positions are % 118. 4615 higher than casting at horizontal arrangement casting positions that range between (2 J and 11 J).

40|$|A novel {{strategy}} {{to increase the}} metabolisable energy (ME) yield of pastures has been {{the development of a}} genetic engineering technology which increases the leaf lipid content and biomass production of perennial ryegrass (PRG). Outdoor plot/feeding trials of genetically engineered crops are prohibited under the current New Zealand (NZ) regulatory framework. However, this high lipid PRG may become available to farmers and eventually be used to make silage, which could fulfill an important role as a high ME, inexpensive, supplementary feed for livestock. Ensiling preserves a crop’s nutrients at a high moisture content and at a low pH, by microbial fermentation of plant sugars into lactic acid under anaerobic conditions. In a preliminary investigation into the ensiling biochemistry of this high lipid PRG, glasshouse-grown materials were wilted and inoculated, and then ensiled on a miniature scale. A series of method development ensiling experiments revealed that non-transgenic PRG grown in glasshouse conditions during the NZ spring/summer was very difficult to <b>ensile</b> naturally, due to its low water soluble sugar to buffering capacity ratio. In order to generate well-preserved silage in the main experiment, glucose was added (post-harvest) to a non-transgenic PRG genotype (WT) and two transgenic PRG genotypes containing ‘medium’ and ‘high’ leaf lipid levels (ML and HL). The HL plants produced 51 % more dry biomass than WT during the regrowth period. Pre-ensiled HL had 31 % higher fatty acid content, 70 % higher nitrate content and a 17 % lower water soluble sugar to crude protein ratio than WT. ML was intermediate. The glasshouse growth environment resulted in an atypical overall PRG nutritional composition. WT, ML and HL underwent a similar fermentation, and nutrients were well-preserved. The nutritional differences in the ensiled material largely reflected those in their fresh counterparts, although a longer wilt caused greater overall digestible nutrient losses in HL. In an in vitro rumen incubation experiment the fatty acids in HL silage exhibited less complete biohydrogenation than in fresh and ensiled WT. Experiments using a range of high lipid PRG lines grown in a range of environments will be needed to validate these results...|$|E

The {{effect of}} harvest date and {{inoculation}} on the yield, fermentation characteristics and feeding value of kale silage. ? Grass and Forage Science, 56, (2), 151 - 161. Sponsorship: UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Milk Development Council. Using new harvesting and ensiling technologies, {{it is now}} possible to <b>ensile</b> kale (Brassica oleracea) successfully. However, there is little information available regarding the optimum time for harvest. The aim of this 2 -year study was to compare the yield, fermentation characteristics and feeding value of kale harvested at different stages of growth, and ensiled with and without a bacterial inoculant. During Year 1 the crop was harvested after 15, 18 and 20 weeks of growth. The yield at each harvest was similar, but as the crop matured the crude protein (CP) concentration and buffering capacity decreased significantly, and there was a marked increase in the water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) concentration. During Year 2 the crop was harvested at 14 and 17 weeks of growth. Again, the stage of maturity did not affect yield and, on this occasion, the chemical composition of the crop was unaffected by harvest date. However, the WSC and CP concentrations of the crop were lower in Year 2 than in Year 1, possibly as a result of differences in fertilizer regime. Each of the silages produced in Year 2 was offered to six Suffolk cross wether lambs, aged 10 months, to measure voluntary intake, in vivo digestibility and nitrogen retention. Neither harvesting date nor the use of an inoculant affected voluntary intake or nitrogen retention by the lambs. However, in vivo digestibility was higher in the kale silage harvested after 14 weeks of growth and when an inoculant was applied. The results obtained suggest that harvesting kale after 14 weeks of growth can produce highly digestible silage with a high CP concentration. Although delaying harvest until 18 weeks of growth will probably result in a decrease in the CP concentration of the crop, it should also lead to an increase in the WSC concentration of the crop, ensuring a more reliable fermentation.

40|$|Feed and {{fodder for}} {{livestock}} Cue: Making hay {{is a vital}} activity for many smallscale livestock farmers. Hay is cut grass or legumes which have been dried and stored, {{so that they can}} be used as feed when other sources of food or pasture are not available. The grass is harvested at times when it is abundant, and then stored. The drying process is very important when making hay, because it needs to keep for a long time. If the hay is not completely dry, then moisture will attract fungus and bacteria, and the hay will become poisonous. In this interview, Excello Zidana speaks to Baxter Zimba of the Department of Animal Health and Livestock Development in Malawi. He asks Mr Zimba?s advice on how to make hay, and how to make sure that it is dry enough to be safe for use as livestock fodder. He beings by explaining that there are no rules to the art of making hay, but there is the need to ?strike a balance?. IN:	?We have to realise that? OUT:	?which they can supplement. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 28 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Baxter Zimba speaking to Excello Zidana in Malawi. Do you know how to ?strike the balance?? What is the best time for making hay in your area? The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Zimba	We have to realise that when the grass is too small and nutritive value is also in small quantities but when it is also too old, then the nutritive value also goes down. So we have to strike a balance. The balance is if the type of forage we are talking about or grass is almost getting ripe, that is the time when we can cut it down and preserve it. Zidana	So we should be saying that the feed that has high nutritive value is good for maximising animal products like milk. How should drying of feeds be done to achieve this? Zimba	The moisture content in the feed is reduced to a point where it is not being attacked by microbes for fear that it can get rotten. You can cut it down into small pieces, you can add some additives to make sure that the fermentation goes faster and it gets preserved. Zidana	And obviously when this process is taking place temperatures, I am talking of ideal temperatures, need to be considered. But now if you look at the prices for the temperature meters are expensive, how can smallscale farmers test the temperatures when they are doing this process? Zimba	People from experience, from the very old days, they know when it is hot, they know when it is cold, and so on. They know that if you <b>ensile</b> the green material and there is no air that goes in there the temperatures will go high. And when you are conserving silage the type of temperature that will be found there will not be a normal ambient temperature it will be above the room temperature. There is a saying that make hay while? while the sun is shining. Why that is being said is because hay making can only be successful when it is sun shining and the weather is dry and that when they have cut the grass and they have to dry it, make sure that no water or rains fall on it, they should remove it immediately to tripods. We call them tripods, these are very simple structures which they can use to dry off there. So that even when it rains during the night or the following day they will still get on the hang and then they will still get dry because the idea is to reduce the moisture content in that product so that the microbes are not able to decompose it. Zidana	The forage that is cut and left in the moist conditions go mouldy and mouldy forages are unpalatable and even dangerous to livestock due to mycotoxin poisoning. Is there any technique for deciding the best time and even the season when harvesting can be done to prevent this? Zimba	If it is now getting mature you are forced, you have to preserve at that time so that you strike a balance on the amount of fodder and the amount of nutrients available in the product. Zidana	Now let?s come to storage, when can storage be done and what is the ideal moisture content to consider when storing the dried feed and fodder? Zimba	Where we talk of green materials conserved like silage and so on you have to use the pits, these are simple dug-up structures and then after you have ensiled it you have removed the air, you have removed some microbes that means you are sure enough that the material is going to be conserved. So you <b>ensile</b> it, in other words you make sure you seal it completely, you cut off the air because the air sometimes you have problems of bacteria which spoil our material like silage. Zidana	As a technical man, now can you provide any advice to the livestock farmers and even those who have taken up preservation or conservation of feed as business on how they can make feeds that has high nutritive value? Zimba	We are supposed to advise our farmers to make sure that they supplement, they also have to conserve either types of feed materials. In other words, during the rainy season or even during the dry season, they have to pile up some other types of ingredients, like for instance maize bran, the rice bran and so on, which they can supplement.
