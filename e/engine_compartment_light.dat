25|$|Cars are {{typically}} fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, {{which are used}} to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on {{the ceiling of the}} car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The GAZ-21 trim lines ("standard" [...] and [...] "improved") were dropped, all GAZ-24 Volgas {{had similar}} trim. No {{specific}} options or extras were listed, but standard equipment included self-adjusting power drum brakes with front/rear split brake system, three-wave radio with power antenna, interior safety padding, central armrests (both front and rear), alternator, three-speed windshield wiper and foot-operated windshield washer, heater with defroster, rear window defogger, electric clock, and trunk and <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> <b>lights.</b> Early cars had [...] "ribbon" [...] speedometers, with gauges that {{filled up with}} red, in a thermometer fashion. The interior was available in three colours - red, brown or light gray. Interior colour selection was often {{in contrast to the}} color of the exterior. Official cars were almost always black outside and red inside. The dashboard was made of aluminium and painted in exterior colour, the upper part covered with safety padding and black vinyl.|$|R

5000|$|BTR-60 {{modernization}} {{designed by}} Saymar. Following operations {{are carried out}} {{as a part of}} this modernization: Removing of all of the vehicle's systems and parts. Adding a bolted on superstructure with two hatches in its front, going {{all the way from the}} front hatches to the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> which is necessary to adapt the vehicle to the new systems and parts (The <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> now externally resembles the one Russian MWS however it doesn't have a service hatch in the back and is angled near the top, also it too has rear lights mounted on both sides of the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> although the <b>lights</b> themselves are different.). Sand blasting and repainting the hull. Resembling the vehicle with new and improved systems and parts as well as installing a new split transfer box that includes a limited split differential and a monitoring system allowing driving in rough terrain and improving the cross-country capabilities. Replacing the two GAZ-40P petrol engines with a single Caterpillar diesel engine developing 300 hp. Fitting a number of new parts for the new engine including a clutch system, split gear case, axillary engine systems, cooling systems, air inlet system, exhaust system. Converting and adapting a new fuel system for the diesel engine and integrating new and bigger fuel tanks to increase the maximum operational range. Installing a new and advanced electrical system including an advance control panel as well as replacement of all internal and external lighting. Increasing the driver's field of view by installing a rear view camera with an LCD screen. Improving the man-machine interface. The vehicle is armed with a pintle-mounted M2 heavy machine gun in the front and a second machine gun of a smaller caliber mounted on a [...] "ring" [...] in the rear. The rear machine gun is controlled from the inside, uses the [...] "ring" [...] to move and can rotate a full 360Â°. The vehicle also has two whip antennas in the front part of the superstructure. The modernization can also be applied to the BTR-70.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} testing of a Nitrogen Foam fire suppression system. The purpose {{of the system is}} to contain or extinguish fires that originate in the <b>engine</b> <b>compartments</b> of automobiles after front-end collisions. The Nitrogen foam creates an inert environment within the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> that is sustainable for a period of at least 10 minutes. Thus, the system is capable of extinguishing fires that have already started at the time of system activation and prevent fires from starting after the foam has been deployed. Testing shows that at an expansion ratio of 220 the Nitrogen foam will fill all of the voids within an <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> without freely flowing down and out of the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment.</b> Full-scale burn tests show that the system is capable of containing and extinguishing fires that originate within the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> at the location of the battery...|$|R

50|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> {{space was}} {{designed}} to be watertight so that the Panther could ford water obstacles; however, this made the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> underventilated and prone to overheating. The fuel connectors in the early models were not insulated, leading to the leakage of fuel fumes into the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment,</b> which caused <b>engine</b> fires in the early Panthers. Additional ventilation was added to draw off these gases, which only partly solved the problem of engine fires. Other measures taken to reduce this problem included improving the coolant circulation inside the motor and adding a reinforced membrane spring to the fuel pump. Despite the risks of fire, the fighting compartment was relatively safe due to a solid firewall that separated it from the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the current}} {{sustainable}} development context, car manufacturers {{have to keep}} doing efforts to reduce the aerodynamic drag of automotive vehicle, and consequently their CO 2 and greenhouse gas emissions. The cooling airflow through the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> of vehicles contributes from 5 % to 10 % to the total aerodynamic drag. By means of a simplified car geometry, equipped with an <b>engine</b> <b>compartment,</b> flow in the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> is analysed by three complementary approaches: an experimental approach, a numerical approach and an analytical approach. The experimental approach is mainly used to measure drag values and to explain the drag variations induced by modifications of the outlet location. The purpose of the numerical simulations is to evaluate the flow rates through the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> and particularly through the heat exchangers. Finally, the analytical approach establishes a model to connect the aerodynamic drag with the cooling flow rate. Configurations favourable to low cooling drag values and high cooling flow rates are identified. They correspond to vehicles with an <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> outlet located at the rear end...|$|R

40|$|The {{location}} of the air intake of a bus creates challenges from a soiling perspective. The proximity to the rear wheels pulls up dirt from the road. Compared to a commercial truck, with the fan placement {{in the front of}} the vehicle the air intake of a bus canât rely on ram air pressure to get the sufficient cooling air mass flow. The fan must always operate on high effect when the bus is driving and thus pulls in dirt. An understanding of the flow of the dirt in the engine is necessary for a possibility to prevent it from soiling the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment.</b> As physical evaluation of the dirt flow is very complicated a numerical method has been developed in the present work. The computational fluid dynamics software STAR-CCM+ was used to simulate the airflow and the particles released in front, under and from the rear wheels on the same side as the air intake of the bus. Steady Lagrangian particle tracking was used to simulate the particle movement. The method developed can be used to get a basic understanding of where the dirt particles enter the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment.</b> The method is demonstrated for the flow around a fully detailed Volvo bus which includes cooling package and <b>engine</b> <b>compartment.</b> The demonstration shows that the method can be used to analyse particle tracks, the size of particles enters the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment,</b> the impact of different grilles on the particle intake, the difference in the particle intake depending on the amount of air entering the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment,</b> the effect of the bus speed and the difference when changing the geometry around the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> on the number of particles entering the bus <b>engine</b> <b>compartment...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{revision}} of the vehicle, the Series 2, was introduced in 1970, with changes including a replacement of the single-piece wrap-around <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> door with a 3 piece version with a lift up rear section and swing out sides. In 1974, the Series 3 was introduced, with the main changes being to the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment,</b> to keep in line with new noise legislation. The most visible change was to move the ventilation grills from alongside the engine to higher up, just below the top deck windows, connected to the <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> by trunking, plus {{the removal of the}} grilles from the rear <b>engine</b> <b>compartment</b> door. The short, lowheight version became the standard vehicle for the National Bus Company. The VRT remained in production until 1981, by which time 4,531 had been built. The Leyland Olympian, the successor to the VR, shared many similarities to the Series 3 VR, although with updates such as air suspension.|$|R
