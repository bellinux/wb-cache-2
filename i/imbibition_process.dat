Despite a marked difference in rock properties such as permeability and porosity, we find similar trends in saturation profiles and weight gain versus time functions. Imbibition in diatomote is relatively rapid when initial water saturation is low due to large capillary forces.

40|$|Micro-fluidic {{devices have}} been {{designed}} and used to investigate immiscible fluid-fluid displacement processes. Due to their optically transparent nature, such devices allow direct visualisation of pore scale events using light microscopy. In this thesis, we focus on imaging multiphase flow phenomena at the pore scale within specifically designed micro-models using optical and Raman microscopy. The flow channel designs have been selected to investigate fundamental questions relating to fluid displacement mechanisms. The Lucas-Washburn equation predicts that the distance a meniscus travels within a smooth cylindrical capillary {{is proportional to the}} square root of time. However, it is poorly understood how surface roughness of the capillary influences the rate of imbibition. This is of great importance for flow in real porous media. Therefore, the displacement dynamics within a series of single capillaries of increasing surface roughness was investigated. It was found that as the roughness increased, the rate of penetration decreased. The rate of decrease with increasing roughness was observed to be different from recent computer simulation studies. Using specifically designed single-junction micro-models, the role of pore geometry on fluid displacement during drainage and <b>imbibition</b> <b>processes</b> is investigated via quasi-static and spontaneous experiments under ambient conditions. The experimental results are directly compared to theory and Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM) simulations. The experimental critical pore filling pressures observed for the quasi-static experiments agree well to those predicted by the Young-Laplace equation and follow the expected filling sequence. However, the experimental spontaneous imbibition results were found to be different from those predicted by the Young-Laplace equation: instead of entering the narrowest available downstream throat, the wetting phase enters an adjacent throat first. Thus, pore geometry plays a vital role as it becomes the main deciding factor in the displacement sequence. This observation may have serious implications for the prediction of displacement processes at the Darcy scale: current Pore Network Models (PNMs) adopt the Young-Laplace displacement sequence for spontaneous <b>imbibition</b> <b>processes</b> and may therefore need to be revised. To further consider these observations, more complex models consisting of multiple connected junctions, are being investigated. Finally, experiments have been conducted to investigate Raman spectroscopy to understand surfactant enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes within micro-models. This may prove particularly useful for EOR as micro-emulsion formation is difficult to discern optically. The work presented demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy is an effective technique in visualising pore scale fluid flow processes and distributions. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} years, {{the study of}} {{multiphase}} flow has gained in interest, as it is involved in many field situations, such as unsaturated water flow in the subsurface, {{remediation of contaminated sites}} and water-oil displacement during oil recovery.

Until today, an empirical relationship be-tween capillary pressure and saturation, obtained by means of laboratory experiments carried out on soil samples, is used to describe capillary pressure. However, this rela-tionship assumes equilibrium in the distribution of the phases in the porous medium. This assumption is valid in cases where saturation varies slowly, however it may not be appropriate for application in faster processes. In such cases, dynamic effects may have an influence on the system. Different theories have been proposed for the inclusion of dynamic effects in the modeling of multiphase flow.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} both drainage {{and spontaneous}} <b>imbibition</b> <b>processes</b> at the pore scale {{using a combination}} of micro- fluidic experiments and lattice-Boltzmann (LB) flow calculations. First, we have fabricated a range of specifically designed etched micro-models to investigate the role of pore shape and throat width on fluid displacement. These designs include junctions with both equal and unequal channel widths in order to achieve a range of capillary entry pressures. All models were etched into Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and chemically treated to create a hydrophobic surface. The displacement process is captured via a high-speed video microscope under ambient conditions. The experimental results were then directly compared with LB simulations. For the drainage experiments, we observe that the fluid displacement in the junction follows the Young-Laplace Law. For the case of spontaneous imbibition, however, the models with unequal channel widths display different displacement behaviour. Our experimental observations are confirmed in detail by Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulations, lending credibility to our observations. Instead of following Young-Laplace filling rules, we observe that the throat in closest proximity fills up first. This has potentially important consequences for calculation of residual saturation of CO 2 at the core scale, which is determined by spontaneous imbibition of brine following CO 2 injection...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a relative permeability-saturation (kr-S) constitutive model that incorporates the critical phenomena necessary for simulating {{the rates of}} nonwetting fluid infiltration, redistribution, and immobilization in a saturated porous medium. To develop a model validation data set, the migration of a dense, nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) pool within a one-dimensional, 1 m tall, saturated sandpack was monitored under alternating drainage and imbibition conditions. A light transmission/image analysis system, able to distinguish between connected-phase and residual nonwetting phase (NWP) in the apparatus, measured the elevation {{of the top of}} the connected-phase DNAPL pool as a function of time. Light transmission calibration curves, correlating fluid saturation to transmitted color at the macroscopic scale, were found to exhibit a functional dependence on saturation history that must be taken into account. Applying the calibration curves to captured images of the experiment provided a continuous sequence of fluid saturation profiles. Numerical simulations of the bench-scale experiment, using model parameters measured independently at the macroscopic scale, predict within measurement uncertainty the observed timescales of DNAPL migration and immobilization. Additional simulations reveal that model validation for <b>imbibition</b> <b>processes</b> depends on properly accounting for NWP kr-S hysteresis, including imbibition function curvature and the abrupt extinction of NWP relative permeability...|$|R

This allows for close observation of the drainage and <b>imbibition</b> <b>processes,</b> assessment of equilibrium states, and studying the effects of fluid phase disconnection and reconnection on the resulting capillary pressures and interfacial curvatures.

Curvature measurements show a strong dependence on whether an interface is formed by connected or disconnected fluid and the time allowed for equilibration.

40|$|Dimensionless {{time is a}} {{universal}} parameter {{that may be used}} to predict real field behavior from scaled laboratory experiments in relation to <b>imbibition</b> <b>processes</b> in porous media. Researchers work to nondimensionalize the time has been through the use of parameters that are inherited to the properties of the moving fluids and the porous matrix, which may be applicable to spontaneous imbibition. However, in forced imbibition, the dynamics of the process depends, in addition, on injection velocity. Therefore, we propose the use of scaling velocity {{in the form of a}} combination of two velocities, the first of which (the characteristic velocity) is defined by the fluid and the porous medium parameters and the second is the injection velocity, which is a characteristic of the process. A power-law formula is suggested for the scaling velocity such that it may be used as a parameter to nondimensionalize time. This may reduce the complexities in characterizing two-phase imbibition through porous media and works well in both the cases of spontaneous and forced imbibition. The proposed scaling-law is tested against some oil recovery experimental data from the literature. In addition, the governing partial differential equations are nondimensionalized so that the governing dimensionless groups are manifested.
