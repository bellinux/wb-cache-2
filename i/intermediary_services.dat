40|$|The {{majority}} of SME’s tends to outsource administrative tasks, including their direct {{relationships with the}} (electronic) government. Commercial <b>intermediary</b> <b>service</b> providers therefore have {{to be part of}} governmental multi channel e-service delivery strategies. This research paper explores the origin, added value and future position of these intermediary organisations with respect to the delivery of e-government services to businesses. Results indicate that (re-) intermediation is more likely to occur within this context than disintermediation is. SME’s {{do not want to be}} captured within a non-profitable electronic hierarchical relationship with a governmental organisation. The empirical study on the impact of the legal obligation of the use of e-tax services illustrates that SME’s instead prefer the ‘save haven’ of a commercial relationship with an <b>intermediary</b> <b>service</b> provider. Thus creating and fuelling a new market of <b>intermediary</b> e-government <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} {{is to make a}} review of the current state of law {{regarding}} to liability of <b>intermediary</b> online <b>service</b> providers of illegal information they transmit or store. The review is made in European context based on EU law by positivistic approach. More specifically, the scope of the thesis is the recent interpretations of the provisions of section 4 of the eCommerce Directive. Narrow interpretation of the special liability regime provided for by the eCommerce Directive has been avoided by the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). Definitions provided for by Articles 12 — 14 of the directive should be flexible in order to be applicable in dynamic technological environment and promote technological advance. In order to avoid unjust burdens to businesses of online service providers, the general monitoring ban, provided for by Article 15 of the eCommerce Directive and confirmed by the ECJ, should be considered absolute. Specific monitoring measures are not covered by the ban and therefore they may be imposed on service provider in accordance with principle of proportionality in specific cases. Balancing interests at stake is essential before imposing any injunction on an <b>intermediary</b> <b>service</b> provider’s business. Revision of the provisions concerning the <b>intermediary</b> <b>service</b> providers’ special liability regime is needed since only very few providers of modern online services based on user-generated content may benefit from the regime...|$|R

40|$|The e-marketplaces, which play an {{important}} role in facilitating transactions and aggregating information in electronic commerce, show positive inter-group externalities where one group’s benefit from receiving a service depends on the number of the <b>intermediary</b> <b>services</b> consumed by the other group, and negative intra-group externalities where the surplus is destroyed because members within the group compete with each other. In this paper, with a different approach from the emerging two-sided markets theory and the traditional microeconomic theory, we analyze a monopolistic e-marketplace owned by a third-party firm by substituting the size of consumers with the number of <b>intermediary</b> <b>services.</b> Moreover, we pay close attention to solving the following problems: 1) When these inter- and intra-group externalities exist, are both the demand curves and the pricing strategies of <b>intermediary</b> <b>services</b> different from those of traditional goods? 2) How to price <b>intermediary</b> <b>services</b> to maximize profit in the e-marketplaces? 3) How do these network externalities affect the management strategy of platforms?

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the legislation, doctrinal {{opinions}} and relevant case law regarding the liability of <b>intermediary</b> <b>service</b> providers in Romania and to contribute to the current stage of knowledge in this matter. The objectives pursued by the author are: identification of the peculiarities of the transposition of the E-Commerce Directive into Romanian legislation; identification of problems that could arise from law’s interpretation; issuing of the de lege ferenda proposals. According to Romanian Law, the rule is the liability of the <b>intermediary</b> <b>service</b> provider. The liability limitations apply to certain clearly delimited activities carried out by service providers, precisely defined by art. 12 - 15 from Law no. 362 / 2002, as: mere conduit, caching, hosting, search engines and hyperlinks. Romanian Law does not offer the possibility to impose on service provider an obligation to monitor the information they transmit or store or an obligation to actively seek out facts and circumstances, even if it could be only for specific, clearly defined individual case. The notice and take down procedures for illegal content is not a legal obligation according to Romanian Law. The Romanian Law is mandatory only for service providers established in Romania...|$|R
