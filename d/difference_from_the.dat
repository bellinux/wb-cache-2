5|$|A major <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> US Navy tables is {{that the}} {{repetitive}} group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues, unlike the USN table which represent only the 120-minute compartment. The Huggins repetitive group indicates {{a percentage of the}} M0 for the most saturated tissue, and this is intended to make the tables more applicable to multilevel diving procedures.|$|E

5|$|The only {{region that}} has a {{significant}} <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rest of Wales is the Gower peninsula, whose lack of land transport links left it isolated.

Dishes such as whitepot and ingredients such as pumpkin, rare elsewhere in Wales, became commonplace in Gower.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson {{at the expense of}} Doug Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, with Loxton taking 0/12. Loxton came in at 2/327 and made 12, before sweeping a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face and breaking his nose. He retired hurt and took no further part in the match. Australia declared at 8/469 and the hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E

5|$|Destruction Derby 2 is {{the sequel}} to Destruction Derby. Like the original, players race on one of seven {{circuits}} {{in a range of}} modes. The modes are: Wrecking Racing, in which, the goal is to earn points by destroying or spinning the other competitors during the race; Stock Car, a typical race during which cars can still be damaged or destroyed, and Destruction Derby, based around the crash arenas instead of race tracks, in which the goal is to inflict as much damage as possible. A new feature called the pit stop was added to the race tracks, where cars can be repaired. Another major <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original game is track obstacles such as jumps and crossovers.|$|E
5|$|Early federal {{plans for}} a {{nationwide}} system of interregional highways {{did not include a}} route along or near the present turnpike, instead connecting Oklahoma City and Kansas City via southeastern Kansas and U.S. Route 69. By the mid-1940s, this route had shifted to roughly the present Interstate 35 alignment, serving Wichita. The only major <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> present route was between Wichita and Emporia, where the highway ran north to Newton before turning northeast along U.S. Route 50.|$|E
5|$|Serial {{production}} of the T1000 started in 1964 by Strømmens Værksted, NEBB and AEG. Until 1978, 162 cars were delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, designated T1 through T4, with minor changes to specifications. During the late 1970s, the western suburban lines which {{were part of the}} tramway needed new rolling stock. Oslo Sporveier was at the time considering connecting the metro with these lines, and between 1978 and 1981, 33 new T1300 cars were built. The only <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> T1000 was that they had a pantograph that allowed them to operate on the tramways. They also retained the necessary technical appliances to run on the metro. The new T1300 were designated T5 and T6. From 1985 to 1989, 16 T4s were rebuilt to T1300 and designated T7 and T8.|$|E

5|$|The Federal Peronism {{organized}} primary {{elections for}} the 2011 presidential elections between Duhalde and governor Alberto Rodríguez Saá, which would be held before the mandatory primary elections. Governors Felipe Solá and Mario Das Neves withdrew their candidacies. Duhalde withdrew his candidacy {{near the end of}} the primary elections. As the sole candidate, Rodríguez Saá ran for Federal Peronism, which allied with other provincial parties into the Federal Commitment coalition. Duhalde ran for president as well, on the Unión Popular ticket. He received nearly 6% of the vote in the main elections, a large <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> number of votes cast for the main candidates, and Hilda Duhalde was not reelected as senator. In 2017 he announced that he intends to run for president of the PJ.|$|E
5|$|The {{impacts of}} the various options were {{estimated}} as the differences between a carbon tax and a reference ‘business as usual’ scenario assuming New Zealand had not signed the Kyoto Protocol. The variables changed in the model runs were the NZ carbon price ($0, $10, $25 or $100), the world carbon price, the duration (short term to 2012, long term to 2025), the level of free allocation and whether the Government assumed all Kyoto liabilities. The results of each model run was reported as the percent <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 'no-Kyoto' ‘business as usual’ scenario in 2012 or 2025.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E

During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but on this occasion Bradman insisted that only six current English Test players be allowed to participate. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Test team being the inclusion of Ian Johnson {{at the expense of}} Doug Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Hassett came in at No. 10 and made an unbeaten seven as Australia declared at 8/469. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. It was the tourists’ last first-class match for the tour and when it became obvious that they would not lose, Bradman let Hassett bowl four overs for twelve runs without taking a wicket. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Hassett missed both of the matches; Australia won both by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI starting on 8 September, its last first-class match for the tour. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit and had defeated Australia, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team; the only <b>difference</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Test team was Johnson's inclusion {{at the expense of}} Ring. His bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Morris and Barnes put on an opening stand of 102 before Morris was out for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and they put on 225 runs for the second wicket. Bradman top-scored with 153 as Australia declared at 8/469 late on the final day. Upon reaching 153, he threw away his wicket with a lofted cover drive, having decided to attempt sixes to give Alec Bedser his wicket. He was already running towards the pavilion before the catch was taken, ending his last first-class innings in England. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. When it became obvious that Australia would not lose, Bradman bowled his only over of the tour, conceding two runs.|$|E
