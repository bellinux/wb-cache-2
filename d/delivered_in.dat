The first 10 units were built by Duewag, while the last 30 {{were built in}} Norway by Strømmen. They were {{numbered}} 101 through 140. The two series vary slightly in specifications. The trams were ordered in 1979 after the 1977 decision to not close the tramway, after the SM53 were finished <b>delivered</b> <b>in</b> 1958. The SL79 mainly serves on lines 11, 12 and 19.

40|$|ACL (facteur d'impact) International audienceDelivery of very preterm {{babies in}} {{maternity}} units with on-site {{neonatal intensive care}} (level III units) is associated with lower mortality and morbidity. This analysis explores risk factors for not <b>delivering</b> <b>in</b> a level III unit, using data from a population-based study of very preterm births in Paris and surrounding districts in 2003. The sample for analysis included resident women with a fetus alive {{at the onset of}} labour between 24 and 31 weeks of gestation (n = 641). Characteristics of women <b>delivering</b> <b>in</b> and those not in level III units were compared using logistic regression. Further analysis was carried out for the subgroup of women not already scheduled to <b>deliver</b> <b>in</b> a level III unit. Twenty-nine per cent of women did not <b>deliver</b> <b>in</b> level III units; in the subgroup scheduled to <b>deliver</b> <b>in</b> level I or II units, 43 % were not transferred. Women were less likely to <b>deliver</b> <b>in</b> a level III unit if they had a singleton pregnancy, a gestation of < 26 weeks or at 31 weeks, experienced antenatal haemorrhaging, lived in socially deprived neighbourhoods or at a greater distance from the nearest level III. Women scheduled to <b>deliver</b> <b>in</b> a maternity unit with a special care nursery were also less likely to <b>deliver</b> <b>in</b> a level III unit. In contrast, preterm rupture of membranes and fetal growth restriction increased the likelihood of a level III delivery. These results underline the importance of controlling for clinical characteristics when analysing perinatal outcome by place of delivery and show how socioe-conomic factors, known to impact on the risk of having a preterm birth, can also affect access to appropriate care...|$|R

Four percent deliver with a nurse’s aide, 12% with family members, 5% with a traditional birth attendant, and 4% with no assistance. Approximately 4% deliver by cesarean section.|$|R

In addition, six trailers were built from Hannoversche Waggonfabrik (HaWA) The delivery of new rolling stock required a new depot building at Holtet, two new electric arc transformers and a ticket price increase. The HaWa trailers were <b>delivered</b> <b>in</b> 1925. However, the two-axled trailers did not give as smooth a ride, and in 1927 the company ordered bogie trailers from Atelier Métallurgique de Nivelles, which were put into service in 1928 and 1929.|$|E
