At {{the level of the}} sensory-phonetic processing modules, auditory and somatosensory information is stored in short-term memory and the external sensory signal (ES, Fig. 5, which are activated via the sensory feedback loop) can be compared with the already trained sensory signals (TS, Fig. 5, which are activated via the phonetic map). Auditory and somatosensory error signals can be generated if external and intended (trained) sensory signals are noticeably different (cf. DIVA model).|$|E

30|$|In reality, when a <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> terminates the input, that <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> {{would not}} likely {{come at the}} moment when the target fires. A delay in the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> amplifies our point: During the delay time, input is “wasted”, and the more {{synchronous}} the input stream, the more input is wasted.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effects of a tactile <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> in a {{computer}} mouse on reduction of hovering behaviour and consequently on changes in muscle load, productivity, comfort and user friendliness, a comparative, experimental study with repeated measures was conducted. Fifteen subjects performed five trials with different mouse actions and a standardised task, once with a mouse with the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> and once with a mouse without the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal.</b> Holding the hand just above the mouse caused higher muscle loading than clicking and scrolling. Holding the hand on the mouse caused higher muscle loading than resting the hand on the desk. The <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> effectively decreased hovering behaviour. It also led to a more dynamic activation pattern of the extensor muscles of the forearm. The overall opinion of the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> for future use was rated as somewhat variable. No effects on discomfort or productivity were found. The use of a mouse with a tactile vibrating <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> seems promising for preventing arm complaints, although {{more research is needed to}} establish the clinical relevance...|$|R
40|$|PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To improve {{distortion}} compensation {{accuracy of}} a power amplifier. SOLUTION: An LMS algorithm using a <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> that is an output signal {{of a power}} amplifier 1 input via an attenuator 17 and pseudorandom data calculates a delay of an input signal to the power amplifier 1 and a delay of the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal.</b> Specifically, the delays of the input <b>signal</b> and <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> are calculated such that the delay of the input signal is only an integer delay. An input signal to the power amplifier 1 is adjusted {{on the basis of}} the calculated delay, and a delay of a <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> is adjusted by an analog delay stage 41. Since the delay of the input signal is only an integer delay, a more accurate adjustment of the delay of the input signal matches the input <b>signal</b> with the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> with higher accuracy to improve DPD mode distortion compensation accuracy...|$|R

50|$|A Networked Control System (NCS) is {{a control}} system wherein the control loops are closed through a {{communication}} network.

5000|$|Control {{engineering}} - {{the study}} of mathematical modeling of the dynamic behavior of systems and designing them, usually using <b>feedback</b> <b>signals,</b> so that their dynamic behavior is desirable (stable, without large excursions, with minimum error).

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that voluntary action can attract subsequent, delayed feedback events toward the action, and adaptation to the sensorimotor delay can even reverse motor-sensory temporal order judgments. However, whether and how sensorimotor delay affects duration reproduction is still unclear. To investigate this, we injected an onset- or offset-delay to the sensory <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> from a duration reproduction task. We compared duration reproductions within (visual, auditory) modality and across audiovisual modalities with <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> onset- and offset-delay manipulations. We found that the reproduced duration was lengthened in both visual and auditory <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> onset-delay conditions. The lengthening effect was evident immediately, on the first trial with the onset-delay. However, when the onset of the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> was prior to the action, the lengthening effect was diminished. In contrast, a shortening effect was found with <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> offset-delay, though the effect was weaker and manifested only in the auditory offset-delay condition. These findings indicate that participants tend to mix the onset of action and the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> more when the feedback is delayed, and they heavily rely on motor-stop signals for the duration reproduction. Furthermore, auditory duration was overestimated compared to visual duration in crossmodal feedback conditions, and the overestimation of auditory duration (or the underestimation of visual duration) was independent of the delay manipulation...|$|R
40|$|Using {{numerical}} simulations, {{we design}} {{and analyze the}} performance of gain-clamped discrete fiber Raman amplifiers. In particular, we investigate a configuration which generates a <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> {{through the use of}} fiber Bragg gratings. We examine the impact of the feedback wavelength on the gain-clamping properties. From the simulation results, we conclude that in order to achieve uniform gain-clamping across the DWDM band of interest, the optical pumps must be depleted evenly by the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal.</b> The effect of the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> on the amplifier may be mostly predicted based on the Raman gain coefficients corresponding to the frequency separation between the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> and the pumps. A 58 nm wide uniformly gain-clamped Raman amplifier having over 20 dB gain and a critical power of - 3 dBm is developed. We also verify gain-clamping for this configuration experimentally...|$|R

50|$|Bombesin is a 14-amino acid peptide {{originally}} {{isolated from}} {{the skin of the}} European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina). It has two known homologs in mammals called neuromedin B and gastrin-releasing peptide. It stimulates gastrin release from G cells. It activates three different G-protein-coupled receptors known as BBR1, -2, and -3. It also activates these receptors in the brain. Together with cholecystokinin, it is the second major source of negative <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> that stop eating behaviour.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, nothing by {{mouth was}} {{considered}} to be mandatory in all cases, but gentle feeding by enteral feeding tube may help to restore motility by triggering the gut's normal <b>feedback</b> <b>signals,</b> so this is the recommended management initially. When the patient has severe, persistent signs that motility is completely disrupted, nasogastric suction and parenteral nutrition may be required until passage is restored. In such cases, continuing aggressive enteral feeding causes a risk of perforating the gut.|$|E

The <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> from the sensor array helps to determine {{the location of the}} failed circuit on the chip of an integrated circuit (IC) when external electromagnetic interference (EMI) is applied to the IC. The array structure, the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> and the corresponding circuit of the sensor cell is developed. The design is implemented with a FPGA. The functionality of the design is checked through measuring the generated <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> of the FPGA. The <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> suffers instability problems due to the on-chip process variation. A set of equations are developed to describe the performance limitation that current IC technology put on the sensor array. The trade-off between the timing and the spatial resolutions of the array is analyzed. The conclusion of the paper shows the necessary conditions to make the measurement method practical. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{integration}} of the sensory <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> and central motor commands at several levels of {{the central nervous system}} plays a critical role in controlling movement. Research on cat's spinal cord has shown that at the spinal cord level sensory afferents and descending motor pathways converge onto common spinal interneurons. Human studies since the 1970s have documented how this {{integration of}} motor commands and sensory <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> is used to control muscle activity during movement. [...] During locomotion, the sum of convergent inputs from the central pattern generator (CPG), sensory feedback, descending commands and other intrinsic properties turned on by different neuromodulators give rise to the activity of the interneurons. [...] Further, this interneuronal activity was either recorded directly or inferred from the modulation of response in their postsynaptic targets, most often motoneurons. The most efficient way to gate sensory signals in reflex pathways is to control the firing level of interneurons. For example, during locomotion, the interneuronal activity is modulated via excitation or inhibition depending on the reflex pathways. Thus, different patterns of interneuronal activity will determine which pathways are open, blocked, or modulated.|$|E
50|$|Conical scan and {{monopulse}} antennas {{are susceptible}} to interference from weather phenomenon and stationary objects. The resulting interference can produce <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> that move the antenna beam away from the aircraft.

50|$|Each process {{activated}} by the proteins {{of the cell}} cycle engine involve a cascade of many reactions. The longest subsystem cascade is DNA replication. In Caulobacter cells, replication of the chromosome involves about 2 million DNA synthesis reactions for each arm of the chromosome over 40 to 80 min depending on conditions. While the average time for each individual synthesis reaction can be estimated from the observed average total time to replicate the chromosome, the actual reaction time for each reaction varies widely around the average rate. This leads to a significant and inevitable cell-to-cell variation time to complete replication of the chromosome. There is similar random variation in the rates of progression {{of all the other}} subsystem reaction cascades. The net effect is that the time to complete the cell cycle varies widely over the cells in a population even when they all are growing in identical environmental conditions. Cell cycle regulation includes <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> that pace progression of the cell cycle engine to match progress of events at the regulatory subsystem level in each particular cell. This control system organization, with a controller (the cell cycle engine) driving a complex system, with modulation by <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> from the controlled system creates a closed loop control system.|$|E
