[...] "The nearest parallel to the K Foundation donation would be The Beatles' grandiose plans for Apple Corps", they said.

By actually offering £40,000 to the artist who produces the duffest piece of work, they've simultaneously sent up {{the whole thing and}} proved their integrity the hard way." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Rolling Stone, Greil Marcus wrote in 1969 that Morrison's lyrics were thoughtful and deeply intellectual, [...] "in {{terms of the}} myths and metaphors that exist within the world of rock and roll". He believed both the music and lyrics captured the spirit of Bob Dylan's 1967 album John Wesley Harding, while calling Astral Weeks a [...] "unique and timeless" [...] record. Rolling Stone later named it the album of the year. Melody Maker also called {{it one of the}} year's best records, featuring Morrison's [...] "small harsh voice" [...] backed by an attractive musical combo that [...] "verges on genius" [...] during [...] "Madame George". When his third album Moondance was released in 1970, Warner Bros. ran full-page advertisements remarking on the unavailability of Astral Weeks in record stores, calling it a [...] "damn shame" [...] that it [...] "ended up as what you might call a critically acclaimed but obscure album ... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> and can't find it, yell at the store's record buyer.

On music review aggregator Metacritic the album holds {{a score of}} sixty-one out of hundred (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") based on 24 critical reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor of AllMusic, described the album as [...] "state-of-the-art dance-pop, a testament to skills of the producers and perhaps even Britney being somehow cognizant enough to realize she should hire the best, even if she's not at her best." [...] Dennis Lim of Blender deemed it as [...] "her most consistent , a seamlessly entertaining collection of bright, brash electropop." [...] Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly commented that while the album is not poetry, [...] "there is something delightfully escapist about Blackout, a perfectly serviceable dance album abundant {{in the kind of}} bouncy electro elements that buttressed her hottest hits." [...] A reviewer for NME said that the heavily treated vocals make Spears sound robotic, adding that [...] "it could really do with a few more human touches." [...] Pitchfork's Tom Ewing called [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] the centerpiece of the album, and added that [...] "like most of Blackout, is superb modern pop, which could probably only have been released by this star at this moment. Britney as walking catastrophe makes for great car-crash copy and her record can fit into that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to." [...] Ewing also compared the relationship between Spears and Blackout with American television series Twin Peaks, saying that what made the show [...] "so great wasn't the central good-girl-gone-bad story, it was the strangeness that story liberated. And Britney's off-disc life is both distraction from and enabler for this extraordinary album". Mike Schiller of PopMatters said that [...] "Right down to its utterly garish cover, Blackout is utterly disposable and ultimately forgettable." [...] Melissa Maerz from Rolling Stone explained that Blackout [...] "is {{the first time in her}} career that she's voiced any real thoughts about her life" [...] and that [...] "she's gonna crank the best pop booty jams until a social worker cuts off her supply of hits." [...] Rob Sheffield of the same magazine described Blackout as [...] "one of the most influential albums in modern pop".|$|E

On October 12, Hood demanded the surrender of the Union brigade stationed at Resaca and left Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee's corps there to invest the city. The 700 Union men under Col. Clark R. Weaver refused Hood's ultimatum to surrender, which warned that no prisoners would be taken. Weaver replied [...] "In my opinion I can hold this post. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it,</b> come and take it." [...] Hood declined to attack the Union position because he believed that it would be too costly, instead bypassing the city, moving north, and continuing the destruction of the railroad.|$|E

[...] The day after the 1903 game, Minnesota's custodian Oscar Munson brought an earthenware jug to L. J. Cooke, head of the Minnesota athletics department, and declared in a thick Scandinavian accent: [...] "Yost left his yug." [...] Accounts differ as {{to the history of}} the jug and how Munson came to be in possession of it. [...] Cooke and Munson painted the jug and wrote on it, [...] "Michigan Jug – Captured by Oscar, October 31, 1903" [...] along with the score [...] "Michigan 6, Minnesota 6".
