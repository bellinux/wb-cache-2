It was broadly similar to a Value Added Tax, though its specifics were crafted to serve various Soviet economic-planning goals. It was the main overt or <b>explicit</b> <b>tax</b> during much of the Soviet period, providing 104 billion rubles of the total Soviet state incoming revenue of 180 billion rubles in 1940, for example.

This increase has mainly been attributed to active government policy, and not simply to the growing economy. To have brought this about with only one <b>explicit</b> <b>tax</b> rise has led to accusations of Brown imposing stealth taxes. A commonly reported example resulted in 1997 from a technical change in the way corporation tax is collected, the indirect effect of which was for the dividends on equity investments held within pensions to be taxed, thus lowering pension returns and allegedly contributing to the demise of some pension funds. The Treasury contend that this tax change was crucial to long-term economic growth: the existing corporation tax system created biased incentives for corporations to pay out profits as dividends to shareholders (including pension funds, who could then reclaim the tax paid) rather than to reinvest them into company growth (which would result in corporation tax being paid). The old system of corporation tax was widely viewed by economists as a constraint on British economic growth.|$|E

40|$|The tax {{harmonization}} is {{a complex}} issue {{in the process of}} European integration. The tax harmonization is a process of convergence of the tax system based on mutual set of rules and, in general, it means existence of identical or similar tax rates for the tax payers in European Union, i. e.

In case there are identical tax rates, then we are talking about a, so called, total <b>explicit</b> <b>tax</b> harmonization, whereas, if there are similar tax rates, we are talking about partial <b>explicit</b> <b>tax</b> harmonization, which refers to determination of the highest and the lowest tax rates. Thus, countries can determine the tax rates of certain taxes. The total harmonization, besides tax rates harmonization, means structural harmonization or harmonization of the tax structure. The harmonization of direct taxes mainly relies on the following main objectives: avoiding tax evasion and elimination of double taxation. The harmonization of regulations and directives in the field of indirect taxes is necessary in terms of establishing a single market, or removal of barriers to the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} problem of {{effective}} taxation {{at the lower end}} of the income scale in Germany. For the recipients of social income maintenance [...] currently about 1. 8 million nationals [...] effective taxation consists not only of the explicit taxation through the tax code but also of the implicit taxation through the withdrawal of benefits. The paper calculates effective tax rates for recipients of social assistance; it is shown that for labor incomes in the lower income range explicit and implicit taxation add up to a marginal burden of just under 75 percent on average. The 1996 tax reform alleviates the <b>explicit</b> <b>tax</b> burden on low incomes, but it does not alleviate the total marginal burden on labor earnings of welfare recipients. It increases net incomes, but since the withdrawal of benefits increases with net incomes, too, the overall burden remains practically unchanged.

Constraints and possible steps for reform are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Environmentally-motivated {{taxes on}} energy {{products}} can effectively induce households and firms {{to take into}} account the environmental externalities of energy transformation and use.

This paper analyses the macroeconomic relationship between taxes on energy products and income inequality. It also investigates whether this relationship is different in cases where explicit mechanisms to shift tax burden from labour and income to environmentally harmful activities have been established. In contrast to earlier empirical studies which analyse the distributional effects of energy taxes on the uses of household income, this paper focuses on their macroeconomic relationship with income sources. Using a panel of 34 OECD countries from 1995 to 2011, the paper shows that in the absence of <b>explicit</b> <b>tax</b> revenue recycling mechanisms there is a positive, although modest, relationship between the share of revenues from energy taxes in GDP and the Gini coefficient, which is the adopted measure of income inequality.

40|$|In {{developing}} countries, most {{financial assets}} in formal markets are deposits at financial institutions. This potentially important tax base could be taxed {{at a low}} administrative cost. When revenues of financial taxes are significant, implicit <b>taxes</b> dwarf <b>explicit</b> <b>taxes.</b> The author focuses on the implicit taxation of financial assets through seigniorage, reserve requirements, lending targets, and interest ceilings combined with inflation. The last instrument has often been overlooked, but it has generated {{more than a third}} of implicit revenues in some cases by lowering the cost of government borrowing. Tax revenues are difficult to measure because of regulations that prevent the use of market prices for computation and distort the meaning of some definitions. For some countries, the standard method of seigniorage grossly underestimates the revenue from financial taxation. The author discusses various sources of distortion but ignores potential impacts on the level of saving and the growth rate. Although taxes on financial assets have a low administrative cost, the excess burden that stems from the misallocation of resources is probably a much higher fraction of revenues than that of other taxes.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} {{on the existence of}} implicit taxes in the corporate sector. With this finding, it provides support for the offsetting nature of explicit versus implicit taxes. Governments continuously provide tax preferences (tax incentives) to firms to induce these firms to alter their investment, production and financing decisions to reallocate resources towards outcomes that the government prefers. Tax preferences lead to lower <b>explicit</b> <b>tax</b> rates for firms that make use of these preferences. However (see Scholes and Wolfson (1992) and Wilkie (1992)), economic theory suggests that in equilibrium all firms must earn the same after-tax return (e. g. ROE). Hence high (low) implicit taxes (tax preference induced adjustments of pre-tax returns) can be expected for firms with low (high) explicit taxes. This paper uses financial statements of 123 listed firms for six years (1991 - 1996) to provide empirical {{evidence on the}} existence of implicit taxes in the corporate sector in the Netherlands. The paper finds that the inverse relation between implicit and explicit taxes exists, but is not a strong as expected, suggesting market frictions that prevent the equalisation of after-tax returns. ...|$|E

40|$|Does Social Security {{redistribute}} across cohorts? Or is it {{a program}} for purchasing the jobs' of the elderly?

Since implicit and <b>explicit</b> <b>tax</b> rates on elderly labor income are so high, and so closely (and positively) related with the amount of Social Security spending, and because substitution effects of the program can be as large as its wealth effects, I conclude that Social Security's induced retirement motive is much more important for explaining differences among European countries than is the intergenerational redistribution motive. Furthermore, when policy at least in part designed to induce retirement, its generational incidence can be very different than the incidence of a pyramid scheme, even for those countries where the induced retirement motive is not the dominant one. The possibility of induced retirement also makes it difficult for perpetual intergenerational redistribution to be supported as a subgame perfect political equilibrium. ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} and empirical research has argued that incentives stemming from social security systems influence the worker’s decisions about retirement, investment in human capital and even family formation. The experience of Chile, which radically changed its national system in 1981, offers an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Chile shifted from a defined benefit system to an actuarially fair defined contribution plan, exempted pensioners from the pension payroll tax and tightened early retirement restrictions. Using probit analysis and simulations {{of the behavior of}} 50 cohorts followed through 47 household surveys, we estimate the impact of the 1981 pension reform on the probability of dropping out of the labor force for older workers. We also try to disentangle the effects of each reform component. We find large effects: Labor force participation rose dramatically among male cohorts that approached retirement age after 1981 in Chile, in contrast to the decline observed before and the decline taking place in other countries at the same time.

By analysing both tax related disclosures in company annual reports and corporate social responsibility reports the authors examine how managers of companies who {{have been subject to}} specific criticism of their alleged tax avoidance respond to such criticism. Using a legitimacy theory framework to identify four disclosure themes: <b>explicit</b> <b>tax</b> philosophy, implicit tax philosophy, tax conduct and tax contribution, companies? reports for the 11 year period 2004 ? 2005 to 2014 ? 2015 have been analysed.

The uncertainty is apparent in variation over time both within companies and between companies and is reflected in the incidence of disclosures, their content, and in some cases the absence of a disclosure. This uncertainty is most probably part of a wider reluctance to respond directly to the criticism or to enter into debate and reflects societal ambiguity as regards the legitimacy of tax avoidance.

40|$|As {{underlined}} by Gruber and Wise [1998], in many OCDE countries, {{social security}} provisions, especially defined pension plans, impose strong constraints on retirement decisions, which incite individuals to retire early. Combined with ageing, the early retirement seems to plague the financial viability of security systems. In response, governments such as France, Italy and Sweden have established pension reforms {{in order to}} encourage agents to work longer. Major recent studies on retirement often argue that additional pensions should be paid to individuals who work longer. Pension health then increases with continued work and compensates the worker for the lower life expectancy in case he postpones retirement. While there may be good reasons for such strategy, the economic consequences of this reform are not well understood. In this respect, this papers aims to better understand the effects of alternative pensions reforms on individuals?retirement decision and financial equilibrium of PAYG system. Our analysis yields strong argument in favor of a policy aimed at eliminating the <b>explicit</b> <b>tax</b> on continued work: decreasing the contribution rate for the elder workers can not only encourages individuals to delay retirement but also helps finance the expected deficit of PAYG system. Furthermore, this paper reveals that implementing incentives schemes should be accompanied by measures to increase job opportunities, including the elimination of measures and practices that impose strong limits on activity of older worker.

Earlier research by Dyreng et al. (2010) provides evidence of the magnitude of top executives’ effect on their firm’s ETR, without investigating the consequences of such behaviour. Although tax avoidance might contribute to after-tax firm performance, it is possible that costs associated with executive-induced tax planning outweigh the benefits of the reduction in <b>explicit</b> <b>taxes.</b> After classifying executives in terms of their influence on their company’s GAAP ETR and CASH ETR, we investigate in which firm environment these executives operate and study their influences on firm performance. We observe that the presence of a CASH ETR-decreasing executive has a negative impact on pre-tax performance, indicating that there are significant trade-off costs related to reducing cash taxes. However, no effect on after-tax performance is found. The presence of a GAAP ETR-increasing executive has a positive impact on pre-tax performance, which partially persists in after-tax performance.

40|$|Tax sparing {{occurs when}} {{a country with a}} {{worldwide}} tax system grants its citizens foreign tax credits for the taxes that they would have paid on income earned abroad, but that escapes taxation by virtue of foreign tax incentives. The supporters of tax sparing argue that it is a form of foreign aid, an obligation owed to developing countries, and a legitimate means of improving the competitiveness of resident investors. Tax sparing, however, has long been opposed by the United States {{on the grounds that it}} is an expensive and problematic concession to developing countries, inconsistent with basic and fundamental tax principles, and an inappropriate mechanism for improving the competitiveness of resident investors. The U. S. position appears to be carrying the day as tax sparing has been on the wane. In contrast with the emerging consensus, I offer a new argument for tax sparing. Drawing on the literature on implicit taxes, I argue that tax incentives produce implicit taxes. From the perspective of the investor, implicit taxes are as real as traditional <b>explicit</b> <b>taxes.</b> Thus, tax sparing is best viewed as extending the foreign tax credit to include implicit taxes. Accordingly, I argue that tax sparing is consistent with the notion of a single level of taxation and the foreign tax credit. I also argue that tax sparing is necessary to prevent domestic investors from being disadvantaged by foreign tax incentives. In addition, I show that such arguments support a greatly expanded form of tax sparing. Finally, I demonstrate that the tax sparing credit, as currently calculated, will usually exceed the implicit tax paid and propose an alternative method of calculating the credit that will place investors residing in countries with worldwide tax systems on par with other investors...|$|R
3000|$|Factors that {{influence}} both the illegal {{as well as}} the legal side of tax avoidance, include the design of the firm’s incentive system and the firm’s corporate governance structure. For instance, in a situation where the manager is able to both avoid taxes and divert earnings, Desai and Dharmapala (2006) discuss the link between incentive compensation, corporate governance and the reduction of <b>explicit</b> <b>taxes.</b> The model predicts a reduction in tax avoidance as a response to higher incentive compensation if diversion and tax sheltering have sufficiently large complementary effects with respect to their costs. Additionally, managers of firms with strong corporate governance should exhibit more tax avoidance in reaction to increased incentive compensation due to the limited possibility to divert earnings. Similarly, Ewert and Niemann (2014) find that raising the manager’s incentive rate can increase corporate tax avoidance activities. They use a multi-task LEN model in which the manager exerts productive effort and effort in tax avoidance activities both aimed at increasing the corporation’s uncertain after-tax cash flow. If the principal cannot compensate the manager for productive effort and tax avoidance activities separately, a higher pay-performance sensitivity leads to an increase in effort for both tasks. This result can be translated into the following empirical prediction regarding the relationship between after-tax pay-performance sensitivity and corporate tax avoidance: [...]...|$|R
