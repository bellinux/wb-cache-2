40|$|Air {{bearings}} {{have been}} widely used in ultra-precision positioning stages due to the property of nearly zero friction or wear. Small vibration of the bearing reduces the overall moving and positioning precision of the stage and hampers its applications in fabrication facilities requiring nanometer moving and positioning precision. In order to improve system precision, knowledge of the dynamic characteristics of air bearings is the first and crucial step. However, it is still a challenge to set up an accurate dynamic model for air bearings due to the system complexity. In this article, a novel method for the dynamic modeling of air bearing is proposed, which takes into account the dynamics in both the moving direction and the supporting direction. An ultra-precision positioning dual stage is investigated using the proposed dynamic modeling method. This stage has two sets of air bearings and can be used in integrated circuit <b>fabrication</b> <b>equipments.</b> Moreover, dynamic behaviors of the ultra-precision positioning dual stage are studied and compared with experimental results to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Aluminum Nitride (AlN) {{ceramics}} {{are used}} as wafer heating plates and wafer holding electrostatic chucks in semiconductor <b>fabrication</b> <b>equipments.</b> For tailoring the electrical resistivity {{to satisfy the requirements}} of each component, several kinds of approaches were investigated for hot-pressed AlN ceramics. Three techniques to control the electrical resistivity of AlN ceramics were adopted: (1) AlN intragranular control, (2) intergranular phase control and (3) incorporation of electrically conductive second phase particles. In this paper, we introduce examples of each technique. The first one is addition of a small amount of Y 2 O 3. The resistivity varied from 1015 Ωcm to 1010 Ωcm with the Y 2 O 3 amount. The second one is addition of Sm 2 O 3. The resistivity also varied from 1015 Ωcm to 1010 Ωcm with the Sm 2 O 3 amount. The third one is incorporation of in-situ synthesized Boron Carbonitride (B-C-N). Networking of B-C-N platelets drastically decreased the resistivity to the range less than 102 Ωcm. By these techniques, it was possible to control the resistivity of AlN ceramics in a wide range {{with a small amount of}} additives...|$|R

50|$|There is {{considerable}} {{resistance to the}} 450 mm transition despite the possible productivity improvement, because of concern about insufficient return on investment. Higher cost semiconductor <b>fabrication</b> <b>equipment</b> for larger wafers increases the cost of 450 mm fabs (semiconductor fabrication facilities or factories). Lithographer Chris Mack claimed in 2012 that the overall price per die for 450 mm wafers would be reduced by only 10-20% compared to 300 mm wafers, because over 50% of total wafer processing costs are lithography-related. Converting to larger 450 mm wafers would reduce price per die only for process operations such as etch where cost is related to wafer count, not wafer area. Cost for processes such as lithography is proportional to wafer area, and larger wafers would not reduce the lithography contribution to die cost. Nikon plans to deliver 450-mm lithography equipment in 2015, with volume production in 2017. In November 2013 ASML paused development of 450-mm lithography equipment, citing uncertain timing of chipmaker demand.|$|E
