5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more of the action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Court-show viewers don't {{seem to want}} moral conundrums or {{technical}} wrinkles. They love Sheindlin's show because she offers them a fantasy of how they'd like the justice system to operate—swiftly, and without procedural mishaps or uppity lawyers. They <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong authority figure. There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and there certainly are no lengthy appeals.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{all the things that}} they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E

5|$|The {{sold out}} Test was played on Saturday 25 November at Lansdowne Road. The 12,000 that turned up did not <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Gallaher though, {{as he was}} injured. Simon Mynott was also {{selected}} {{to play on the}} wing despite having never played there before, and there being three three-quarters available. For a 30-minute period in the first half the Irish forwards dominated, however the deadlock was broken close to half time when Bob Deans scored a try under the posts; Wallace converted the try giving the All Blacks a 5–0 half-time lead. Early in the second half Deans scored another try; again converted by Wallace. Smith lost the ball over the line before Alex McDonald scored the All Blacks third and final try. Wallace successfully converted to give the All Blacks a 15–0 victory.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1947, the Kings County {{council in}} New York City of the Army and Navy Union {{under the command}} of General Samuel Hoch made {{available}} an escort party for the families who were having their soldier dead brought home from World War II. The organization participants gathered at the Flatbush Post of the American Legion on Nostrand Ave at 9 AM to get their instructions from Hoch. He also coordinated the Brooklyn Naval Yard Garrison of the organization later, that participated in the Freedom Train Brooklyn display at the Vanderveer Park freight yards of the Long Island Rail Road. There were thousands that saw the one-day Brooklyn event that displayed Americana and original nineteenth-century historical documents in the rail cars. Many were not able to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the displays that day and planned on viewing the next day when the train would stop a few miles away at Jamaica, Queens, New York.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the strip}} began October 15, 1905 with Morpheus, ruler of Slumberland, {{making his first}} attempt to bring Little Nemo to his realm, Nemo did not get into Slumberland until March 4, 1906 and, due to Flip's interfering, did not <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Princess until July 8. His dream quest is always {{interrupted}} by either him falling out of bed, or his parents forcibly waking him up.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Mayor Ken Whillans gained {{approval}} and funding {{for construction of}} a new city hall in Brampton's downtown. The facility was designed by local architects and constructed by Inzola Construction. Whillians did not <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the opening of the new hall because of his death in August of that same year. With the return of city government to downtown Brampton, politicians and businesses allied to revitalize the core.|$|E

25|$|Henrik Horn was {{appointed}} commander-in-chief of the Swedish navy in March 1677, becoming {{the third consecutive}} navy chief (after Gustaf Otto Stenbock and Lorentz Creutz) without any naval experience. The Danish fleet, on the other hand, was well-staffed with capable, experienced officers, which placed the Swedes at a marked disadvantage from the outset. Horn was quickly informed that Dutch reinforcements under Tromp were heading for the Baltic, and on 21 April he was received orders from King Charles to join {{the main body of}} the Swedish fleet with a minor squadron anchored off Gothenburg under the command of Erik Sjöblad. The main fleet did not <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> until early June, but Sjöblad nevertheless sailed as early as 20 May to join Horn. Sjöblad tried to sail through the Great Belt, but was becalmed for on the 23rd and did not pass Langeland until the 29th.|$|E
25|$|Later that night, the fairies take Aurora back to {{the castle}} and leave her alone in a room to wait for her {{birthday}} celebrations where she will finally <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her parents. Maleficent then appears and magically lures Aurora away from the fairies and tricks the princess into touching an enchanted spinning wheel. Aurora pricks her finger, completing the curse. The good fairies place Aurora on a bed in the highest tower and place a powerful spell on {{all the people in}} the kingdom, causing them to fall asleep until the spell on their princess is broken. While doing so, they overhear a conversation between King Stefan and King Hubert. From King Hubert's conversation with King Stefan, the fairies realize that Prince Phillip is the man with whom Aurora has fallen in love. They rush to find him, but he is kidnapped by Maleficent who is waiting for him at the cottage in the woods. She shows Phillip the peasant girl he fell in love with is the now-sleeping princess. She tells him she plans to keep him locked away until he's an old man on the verge of death, then release him to meet his love, who will not have aged a single day.|$|E

500|$|Daily Radar {{found the}} story lacking, while GameSpot's Shane Mooney defended it thus: [...] "people moan about {{a lack of}} a {{compelling}} story in action titles, which makes about as much sense as complaining {{about the lack of}} a nailgun in a football sim [...] People couldn't care less if the story was written by Steinbeck or Stymy the Hack, as long as they <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> THX-rattling fireballs and bad guys bleeding from every orifice." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Lawrence {{expressed}} {{that he hoped}} that Aniston's guest appearance would mark {{a turning point in}} viewership opinions, and felt that the show had distanced itself from its original concept. [...] "I want as many people as I can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what the show kind of became last year," [...] Lawrence articulated. [...] "It went from a typical TV show trying to find itself to something that I’m really proud of and like and think is really funny." ...|$|E

500|$|Alluding to the {{normally}} [...] "no-nonsense" [...] personality {{of his character}} Phillip Broyles, actor Lance Reddick noted that for once [...] "you <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] smile and have fun. Not for very long, but you see it. You get to meet his ex-wife (Karen Holness) and find out why his marriage ended. You understand more about his relationship to his work and his job and the Fringe Division–how he feels about it and why he does what he does." ...|$|E

Or we’ve fallen in love while escaping the malfunctioning homicidal robots, but whose side are we spending Christmas with? It isn’t often that you <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how people move on from these huge events, but “Marionette” gives us just that.
