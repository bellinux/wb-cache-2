40|$|Abstract Background A {{large volume}} of data <b>and</b> {{information}} about <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> <b>gene</b> products has been stored in various molecular biology databases. A major challenge for knowledge discovery using these databases is to identify related <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> <b>gene</b> products in disparate databases. The development of Gene Ontology (GO) as a common vocabulary for annotation allows integrated queries across multiple databases and identification of semantically related <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> <b>gene</b> products (i. e., <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> <b>gene</b> products that have similar GO annotations). Meanwhile, dozens of tools {{have been developed for}} browsing, mining or editing GO terms, their hierarchical relationships, or their "associated" <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> <b>gene</b> products (i. e., <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> <b>gene</b> products annotated with GO terms). Tools that allow users to directly search and inspect relations among all GO terms <b>and</b> their associated <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> <b>gene</b> products from multiple databases are needed. Results We present a standalone package called DynGO, which provides several advanced functionalities in addition to the standard browsing capability of the official GO browsing tool (AmiGO). DynGO allows users to conduct batch retrieval of GO annotations for a list of <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> <b>gene</b> products, <b>and</b> semantic retrieval of <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> <b>gene</b> products sharing similar GO annotations. The result are shown in an association tree organized according to GO hierarchies and supported with many dynamic display options such as sorting tree nodes or changing orientation of the tree. For GO curators and frequent GO users, DynGO provides fast and convenient access to GO annotation data. DynGO is generally applicable to any data set where the records are annotated with GO terms, as illustrated by two examples. Conclusion We have presented a standalone package DynGO that provides functionalities to search and browse GO and its association databases as well as several additional functions such as batch retrieval and semantic retrieval.

5|$|Following {{the rise}} of {{classical}} genetics, many biologists—including {{a new wave of}} physical scientists in biology—pursued the question of the <b>gene</b> <b>and</b> its physical nature. Warren Weaver—head of the science division of the Rockefeller Foundation—issued grants to promote research that applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term molecular biology for this approach in 1938; many of the significant biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.|$|E

Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting <b>gene</b> <b>and</b> the lioness passes on a growth {{inhibiting}} gene, tigons are often relatively small, only weighing up to 150kg (350lb), which is about 10–20% smaller than lions. Like ligers, they have physical and behavioural traits from both parental species, and males are sterile. Females are sometimes fertile and have occasionally given birth to litigons when mated to a lion.|$|E

5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the <b>gene</b> <b>and</b> its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|Genes are {{the primary}} units of {{inheritance}} in all organisms. A gene is a unit of heredity and corresponds to a region of DNA that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into proteins. Cells transcribe a DNA gene into an RNA version of the <b>gene,</b> <b>and</b> a ribosome then translates the RNA into a sequence of amino acids known as a protein. The translation code from RNA codon to amino acid {{is the same for}} most organisms. For example, a sequence of DNA that codes for insulin in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants.|$|E

5|$|The Outlaw Star manga {{series and}} {{animated}} television series are paced differently. The anime episodes often involve <b>Gene</b> <b>and</b> his comrades taking on various jobs or missions to fund their ship's massive maintenance costs. Throughout their travels, the crew often encounters Ronald MacDougall and Harry MacDougall, {{a pair of}} bounty hunters {{responsible for the death}} of Gene's father. Ronald acts as a rival to Gene, while Harry wishes to form a bond with Melfina, a bio-android like himself, who instead develops strong feelings for Gene. The crew also contends with others that learn of the Outlaw Star's connection to the Galactic Leyline. They are Nguyen Khan, a scientist wishing to gain omniscience through the Leyline; and Lord Hazanko, the leader of the ruthless assassin organization the Anten Seven that seek the Leyline to gain ultimate power. The series climaxes when all parties meet on the physical plane of the Leyline. In the end, Ron MacDougall retreats, saved by a computer copy of his brother Harry (who is killed trying to protect Melfina from Hazanko), Khan is integrated into the Leyline as data, Gene reveals to Melfina that he is in love with her and frees her from the Leyline by making it their shared wish to be together forever, and Hazanko is eventually defeated by the Outlaw Star crewmembers. Once the conflict comes to a close, <b>Gene</b> <b>and</b> his friends return to Sentinel III and go their separate ways, but ultimately reunite to continue their adventures together.|$|E
5|$|The major {{effect of}} the apolipoprotein A5 <b>gene</b> (<b>and</b> its variants) is on plasma {{triglyceride}} levels. Minor alleles (C1131 and Trp19) are primarily associated with the elevation of plasma triglyceride levels. The most extensive information available has been drawn from Caucasian populations, particularly {{in relation to the}} rs662799 SNP. Here, one minor allele is associated with an approximate 0,25mmol/L increase of plasma TG levels. A similar effect is associated with the Trp19 allele, even though it has not been confirmed by a huge number of studies. Original studies have further described that the strongest effect of APOA5 polymorphisms on plasma TG levels is observed among Hispanics, with only minor effects detected among Africans. Among Asians, the effect on plasma TG levels is similar that found among Caucasians. Generally, studies have suggested significant interethnic differences and in some cases sex-dependent associations as well.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis is an {{in silico}} {{analysis}} of data available from genome-wide scans. Through analysis of QTL, <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> polymorphisms that regulate BMD, we identified 82 BMD QTL, 191 BMD-associated (BMDA) <b>genes,</b> <b>and</b> 83 <b>genes</b> containing known BMD-associated polymorphisms (BMDAP). The catalogue of all BMDA/BMDAP <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> relevant literatures are provided. In total, there are substantially more BMDA/BMDAP genes in regions of the genome where QTL have been identified than in non-QTL regions. Among 191 BMDA <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> 83 BMDAP <b>genes,</b> 133 <b>and</b> 58 are localized in QTL regions, respectively. The difference was still noticeable for the chromosome distribution of these <b>genes</b> between QTL <b>and</b> non-QTL regions. These results have allowed us to generate an integrative profile of QTL, genes, polymorphisms that determine BMD. These data could facilitate more rapid and comprehensive identification of causal genes underlying the determination of BMD in mouse and provide new insights into how BMD is regulated in humans...|$|R

5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA <b>gene</b> <b>and</b> its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E
