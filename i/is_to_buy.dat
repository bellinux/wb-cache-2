In addition, his conglomerate structure allows Slim to purchase numerous stakes that it is made nearly recession proof if one or more sectors of the economy do not do well. Slim also doesn't address the finer details of the business but instead focuses on business fundamentals where his strategy is buy an asset at an undervalued price for its underlying cash flow and eventually sell his stake for greater profit when the asset gains value, or simply hang to the business for its cash flow.|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's William Abner scored it 75 out of 100, {{writing that}} the game [...] "isn't a {{complete}} product. It's close. And parts of it are just as fun, if not more so, than the earlier games, but {{a laundry list of}} bugs, hardware glitches, and severe multiplayer issues keep the game from reaching its potential." [...] He praised the single-player campaign and the storyline. However, he cited numerous bugs, including no support for Windows 95, despite the box claiming otherwise, and compatibility issues with Windows XP. He was also critical of the absence of Vengeance, despite the box stating it was included, and the fact that multiplayer mode had only five maps and no TCP/IP support. He concluded [...] "If you need your new Myth fix and can't wait for a patch, then the best option <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the game from a store that accepts returns in case the game doesn't like your particular system setup. If you can play it, focus your efforts on the campaign - it's fun, {{and for the most part}} works as advertised. Hopefully, by the time you are finished with Connacht's tale, a patch to fix the many multiplayer issues will be ready." ...|$|E
