40|$|In {{this issue}} there is {{continued}} the {{catalogue of the}} papers of Archdeacon John Hamilton (1800 - 62) which was begun in volume xiiii (1988). In the file presented here the documents cover the period from 1814 to 1830 and are mainly {{in the form of}} letters sent to John Hamilton as student and young curate. Mary Purcell who catalogued the Hamilton papers gave a brief biography of this remarkable priest in volume xxxvi (1981). Born in 1800, John Hamilton was the eldest of seven children. His father died in 1816 and in the following year John went to the Irish College, Paris. His progress there was so rapid that he taught his fellow-students in his final years. It was a time of disturbance and upheaval in the college. Fr. Paul Long, appointed rector by the Irish bishops, was ousted more than once and continually harassed by Richard Ferris, who had held high office in the college prior to the Revolution and who, through his powerful friends in high places, effectively controlled the Bureau set up to supervise the Irish, English and Scots colleges, united under Napoleon. When study became impossible Hamilton and his friends, Morgan O'Brien of Cloyne and Myles Gaffney of <b>Dublin,</b> <b>transferred</b> to St. Sulpice. Ordained in 1824, Hamilton came home and was appointed curate in St. Mary's, the present Pro-Cathedral in Dublin. He was later administrator there from 1831 to 1853 and paid off the debt on the Pro-Cathedral. He also built St. Lawrence O'Toole's church and the schools at Seville Place and William Street. He ran an orphanage, a home for widows, a home for blind boys and a Catholic Library Bookshop. He revived the invaluable Catholic Directory the Society for the Propagation of the Faith into Ireland. As secretary to Archbishop Daniel Murray, he looked after the administration of the diocese during the archbishop's frequent illnesses and absences. Consequently the later papers of Archdeacon Hamilton are complementary to those of Archbishop Murray. Dublin Diocesan Archives: Hamilton Papers_...|$|R

50|$|In February 1918, due to {{the heavy}} losses that had been sustained, the 8th/9th and 10th Dublins were disbanded and its men were {{transferred}} to the 1st and 2nd Dublins. On 21 March the Regiment was on the defensive during the Battle of St. Quentin when the Germans began an immense bombardment {{as part of their}} last-gasp major offensive known as Operation Michael against British and Empire forces in the Picardy area. The 1st and 2nd Dublins suffered heavily from the intense bombardment (which included poison gas) and when the Germans attacked shortly afterwards, the Germans broke through the shattered remnants. The Germans made significant gains but their offensive gradually lost momentum and the Germans were pushed back by April. During that month, on the 14 April, the 1st and 2nd Dublins had to briefly amalgamate {{due to the}} losses it had sustained during the German offensive, forming the 1st/2nd Dublins. The 1st Battalion was reconstituted a few days later with drafts from the 2nd Battalion, which was reduced to cadre strength. On 26 April the 1st Dublins left the 16th (Irish) and rejoined the 86th Brigade, 29th Division. In June the 2nd <b>Dublins</b> <b>transferred</b> to the 31st Division and was reconstituted. It was transferred to the Lines of Communication (LoC) before moving to 50th Division in July. In August the Allies launched their counter-offensive against the Germans and eventually reached the Hindenburg Line. The Allies launched their offensive against the Line in September, and the 1st, 2nd, and 7th Dublins, took part in the battles of the St Quentin Canal, Cambrai and Beaurevoir, and the Hindenburg Line was successfully breached by the Allies. The Dublins took part in the last offensives of the war, taking part in, among others, the Fourth Battle of Ypres, Battle of Courtrai and the Battle of the Selle during September and October. The 1st Dublins lost their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Athelstan Moore, on 14 October. The Regiment's last major battle was in the Battle of the Sambre on 4 November. The war ended on the Western Front with the Armistice on 11 November 1918.|$|R
40|$|This report {{highlights}} the inherent limitations and injustices of the <b>Dublin</b> system, which <b>transfers</b> asylum seekers between EU Member States, and outlines alternative proposals for a fairer {{and more efficient}} system. ECRE strongly believes that the Dublin Regulation does not promote harmonisation of EU asylum systems, seriously impedes integration, and sows dissension among Member States. Instead of pretending {{it can be made}} to work, the Stockholm Programme should repeal the Dublin Regulation and devise an efficient responsibility-sharing regime that improves solidarity among Member States, and promotes the integration of people who seek, and deserve, international protection...|$|R
40|$|Many {{asylum seekers}} {{entering}} the European Union (EU) cross {{more than one}} Member State border before lodging their asylum claims. In response, the EU adopted Dublin II to designate the point of first entry, rather than the point of application, as the State responsible for examining the claim. Unfortunately, this allocation of examination responsibilities overburdens States on the frontline of entry, such as Greece, and has exacerbated the systemic deficiencies in these states’ asylum systems. The Court of Justice of the European Union’s decision in the Joined Cases C- 411 / 10 2 ̆ 6 C- 493 / 10 helped clarify that a receiving state cannot transfer asylum seekers to the responsible state {{if they would be}} subjected to inhumane treatment there. Although this decision halted <b>Dublin</b> II <b>transfers</b> to states where fundamental rights risked being violated, the EU continues to struggle with an unbalanced distribution of asylum claims. Until the principle of solidarity is put into practice and more claims are shifted to lesser-burdened states, the EU will not meet its goal of creating a fair and effective Common European Asylum Policy...|$|R
5000|$|In October 1917, {{during his}} second year at Belvedere, aged 15, he joined the IRA.

Seamus Kavanagh. His first job as a member of the IRA was delivering mobilisation orders around the city. Along with other volunteers, Barry trained in a number of locations in Dublin, including the building at 44 Parnell Square, the present day headquarters of Sinn Féin, now named Kevin Barry Hall. The IRA held Field exercises during this period which were conducted in north county Dublin and in areas such as Finglas.|$|R
5000|$|The name Macreddin is {{believed}} {{to come from the}} Irish Magh Chrídáin [...] "plain of Cridan". In 1875, John O'Hanlon identified him as a Celtic Christian saint [...] "Criotan, Credan, Credanus, or Cridanus", son of Iladon, who was also venerated at nearby Aghavannagh, and in Cornwall. Price says he was more likely a local chieftain at the time Saint Kevin proselytized the area. Macreddin was granted to the monastery of St Saviour, Glendalough in the 12th century. When the Diocese of Glendalough was merged with the Archdiocese of <b>Dublin,</b> Macreddin was <b>transferred</b> to the Priory of All Hallows in Dublin.

25|$|The most {{innovative}} work of Friel's late period is Performances (2003). A graduate researching {{the impact of}} Leoš Janáček's platonic love for Kamila Stosslova on his work playfully and passionately argues with the composer, who appears to host her at his artistic retreat more than 70 years after his death; all the while, the Alba String Quartet's players intrude on the dialogue, warm up, then perform the first two movements of Janáček's Second String Quartet in a tableau that ends the play. The Home Place (2005), focusing on the aging Christopher Gore and the last of Friel's plays set in Ballybeg, was also his final full-scale work. Although Friel had written plays about the Catholic gentry, {{this is his first}} play directly considering the Protestant experience. In this work, he considers the first hints of the waning of Ascendancy authority during the summer of 1878, the year before Charles Stuart Parnell became president of the Land League and initiated the Land Wars. After a sold-out season at the Gate Theatre in <b>Dublin,</b> it <b>transferred</b> to London's West End on 25 May 2005, making its American premiere at the Guthrie Theater in September 2007.|$|R

50|$|Renoir did not exhibit The Umbrellas {{straight}} away - {{he may have}} thought the combination of styles would be too challenging for the public - and he eventually sold the painting to the French art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel in 1892. He sold it to Sir Hugh Lane, {{who died in the}} sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915 and left this and other paintings to the Tate Gallery in London in his will. It came into the possession of the gallery in 1917 (although an unsigned codicil suggested that Lane had changed his mind before his death, and would have preferred the paintings to be displayed in <b>Dublin).</b> It was <b>transferred</b> to the National Gallery in 1935, but an agreement was reached in 1959 to alternate its display (with seven other paintings from the Lane Bequest) between London and Dublin.

25|$|The 1970s was {{a decade}} of change, which began with the decimalisation of the {{currency}} which came into effect on 15 February 1971, when the decimal coinage was released into circulation (although 5p, 10p, and 50p coins were released a few years earlier, as they had exact equivalents in old currency units). Decimalisation would have provided an ideal opportunity to break the link with Sterling, but {{there was not much}} demand for this at that time. In 1972 however, the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates broke down, and {{in the wake of the}} 1973 oil crisis inflation in Britain increased dramatically, and economic theory would suggest that a smaller economy whose currency is pegged to a larger one will suffer the larger economy's inflation rate. At the same time moves to create a money market in <b>Dublin</b> and the <b>transfer</b> in 1968 of the commercial banks' sterling assets to the Central Bank made it possible to contemplate a break in the link. In the mid to late 1970s, opinion within the bank was moving toward breaking the link with sterling and devaluing the Irish currency in order to limit inflationary effects from abroad.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{experiment}} of customized mapping and metadata transfer from DSpace/SOAR to OCLC to improve ETD work flow at Wichita State University Libraries. SOAR (Shocker Open Access Repository) is a DSpace based digital library platform to preserve intellectual output of university faculty and researchers. It includes the University theses and dissertations that are cataloged in SOAR and OCLC. Until early 2008, catalogers have been creating two records (Dublin Core and MARC) {{for the same}} title manually. The goal of the experiment is to automate the process of generating MARC records from Dublin Core metadata in SOAR and importing them to OCLC and Voyager. This presentation will discuss how we harvest theses data from SOAR using MarcEdit developed by Terry Reese at Oregan State University Libraries, how we customize Library of Congress’s XSLT mapping to <b>transfer</b> <b>Dublin</b> Core metadata to MarcXML metadata and how we export MARC data to OCLC. The customization includes selective data transformation, metadata element positioning, field relationship definition, field indicator correction and validation and partial data extraction. This customized mapping and data transformation can eliminate the need of double entry in SOAR and OCLC, meet our local needs and significantly improve our ETD work flow...|$|R
