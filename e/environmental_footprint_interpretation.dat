40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} are {{to conduct a}} {{comprehensive}} investigation into the theoretical and methodological aspects of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and into the disciplinary relationship with the latest science in defining planetary boundaries for human activities. Main conclusions are as follows: (1) <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> are measures of anthropogenic pressure or impact on the planet's environment irrespective of their precise units and dimensions; (2) <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> are classified into the inventory-oriented footprints and impact-oriented footprints, which offer two competing paradigms for footprint indicators; (3) integrating the impact-oriented footprints provides policy makers with a unified approach to assessing overall environmental impacts and has a broader scope of applicability than life cycle assessment; (4) life cycle assessment cannot {{be interpreted as a}} versatile tool for accounting for all possible <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints,</b> although the footprint community has indeed learned and borrowed much from it; (5) latest science in planetary boundaries is found to complement <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> in assessing <b>environmental</b> sustainability that is a critical prerequisite for the economic and social pillars of sustainable development; and (6) the sustainability gap between the converted footprint and boundary metrics plays a central role in understanding the national performance on individual and collective environmental issues...|$|R

40|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> {{of animal}} food {{production}} is considered several-fold {{greater than that of}} crops cultivation. Therefore, the choice between animal and vegetarian diets may have a relevant environmental impact. In such comparisons however, an often neglected issue is the nutritional value of foods.

40|$|While {{in recent}} years both <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and {{planetary}} boundaries have gained tremendous popularity throughout the ecological and environmental sciences, their relationship remains largely unexplored. By investigating the roots and developments of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and planetary boundaries, this paper challenges {{the isolation of the}} two research fields and provides novel insights into the complementary use of them. Our analysis demonstrates that knowledge of planetary boundaries improves the policy relevance of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> by providing a set of consensus-based estimates of the regenerative and absorptive capacity at the global scale and, in reverse, that the planetary boundaries framework benefits from well-grounded footprint models which allow for more accurate and reliable estimates of human pressure on the planet's environment. A framework for integration of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and planetary boundaries is thus proposed. The so-called footprint-boundary environmental sustainability assessment framework lays the foundation for evolving environmental impact assessment to environmental sustainability assessment aimed at measuring the sustainability gap between current magnitudes of human activities and associated capacity thresholds. As a first attempt to take advantage of <b>environmental</b> <b>footprints</b> and planetary boundaries in a complementary way, there remain many gaps in our knowledge. We have therefore formulated a research agenda for further scientific discussions, mainly including the development of measurable boundaries in relation to footprints at multiple scales and their trade-offs, and the harmonization of the footprint and boundary metrics in terms of environmental coverage and methodological choices. All these points raised, in our view, will {{play an important role in}} setting practical and tangible policy targets for adaptation and mitigation of worldwide environmental unsustainability...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I have {{assessed}} the impact free competition {{has on the}} productivity, costs and <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> of the chemical tanker freight market. My impression is, after an extensive dialogue with participants of this market, {{that there is a}} general belief that a consolidation between operators in the market, would allow for a more sensible allocation of cargo, and therefore a more productive use of vessels, as well as a reduced <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint.</b> By comparing the current market situation under free competition with a simulated regulated market under a central planner, using the same input data in the two scenarios, I was able to complete a comparative study examining productivity measures (utilization of vessels and port congestion), changes in cost, and changes in CO 2 emissions. Thus, I could ascribe the observed differences to the incorporation of market regulation, as this was the single factor differentiating the two. The simulation of a central planner and the following observations were that utilization of vessels increased, and port congestion, voyage costs and overall <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> decreased under market regulation. In other words, free competition did in fact, based on this assessment, contribute to neither optimal use of vessels nor the lowest possible <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint.</b> However, when that is said, I also shortly evaluated who the beneficiaries of market regulation would be, and examined crucial challenges of implementing a central planner. Though the challenges are many and certainly cause for further research, the most predominant and vital challenge is that of setting the correct freight rate in a non-competitive setting. Assuming that it is possible in an efficient manner to achieve a correct price under market regulation, both ship operator and customers would reap benefits, as free competition in this case, does not cause for the optimal use of vessels and the lowest <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint...</b>|$|R
40|$|The US egg {{industry}} has evolved considerably over recent decades by incorporating {{new technologies and}} production practices. To date, {{there has been no}} comprehensive assessment of the resource demand and environmental effects of these changes. This study quantifies the <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> of egg production supply chains in the United States for 2010 compared with 1960 using life cycle assessment. The analysis considers changes in both foreground (e. g., hen production performance) and background (e. g., efficiencies of energy provision, fertilizer production, production of feed inputs, and transport modes) system variables. The results revealed that feed efficiency, feed composition, and manure management are the 3 primary factors that determine the environmental impacts of US egg production. Further research and improvements in these areas will aid in continual reduction of the <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> of the US egg industry over time. Per kilogram of eggs produced, the <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> for 2010 is 65 % lower in acidifying emissions, 71 % lower in eutrophying emissions, 71 % lower in greenhouse gas emissions, and 31 % lower in cumulative energy demand compared with 1960. Table egg production was 30 % higher in 2010; however, the total <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> was 54 % lower in acidifying emissions, 63 % lower in eutrophying emissions, 63 % lower in greenhouse gas emissions, and 13 % lower in cumulative energy demand compared with 1960. Reductions in the <b>environmental</b> <b>footprint</b> over the 50 -yr interval considered {{can be attributed to the}} following: 27 to 30 % due to improved efficiencies of background systems, which outweighed the declining energy return on energy invested for primary energy sources; 30 to 44 % due to changes in feed composition; and 28 to 43 % due to improved bird performance...|$|R
