2500|$|The word [...] "benzene" [...] derives {{historically}} from [...] "gum benzoin" [...] (benzoin resin), an aromatic resin {{known to}} European pharmacists and perfumers since the 15th {{century as a}} product of southeast Asia. An acidic material was derived from benzoin by sublimation, and named [...] "flowers of benzoin", or benzoic acid. The hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid thus acquired the name benzin, benzol, or benzene. Michael Faraday first isolated and identified benzene in 1825 from the oily residue derived from the production of <b>illuminating</b> <b>gas,</b> giving it the name bicarburet of hydrogen.H6, although he doesn't realize it because he (like most chemists at that time) used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12). In 1833, Eilhard Mitscherlich produced it by distilling benzoic acid (from gum benzoin) and lime. He gave the compound the name benzin. In 1836, the French chemist Auguste Laurent named the substance [...] "phène"; this word has become the root of the English word [...] "phenol", which is hydroxylated benzene, and [...] "phenyl", the radical formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom (free radical H•) from benzene.|$|E

60|$|What, in a way, most profoundly {{impressed}} Martin, was {{the correlation}} of knowledge--of all knowledge. He had been curious to know things, and whatever he acquired he had filed away in separate memory compartments in his brain. Thus, {{on the subject of}} sailing he had an immense store. On the subject of woman he had a fairly large store. But these two subjects had been unrelated. Between the two memory compartments there had been no connection. That, in the fabric of knowledge, there should be any connection whatever between a woman with hysterics and a schooner carrying a weather-helm or heaving to in a gale, would have struck him as ridiculous and impossible. But Herbert Spencer had shown him not only that it was not ridiculous, but that it was impossible for there to be no connection. All things were related to all other things from the farthermost star in the wastes of space to the myriads of atoms in the grain of sand under one's foot. This new concept was a perpetual amazement to Martin, and he found himself engaged continually in tracing the relationship between all things under the sun {{and on the other side}} of the sun. He drew up lists of the most incongruous things and was unhappy until he succeeded in establishing kinship between them all--kinship between love, poetry, earthquake, fire, rattlesnakes, rainbows, precious gems, monstrosities, sunsets, the roaring of lions, <b>illuminating</b> <b>gas,</b> cannibalism, beauty, murder, lovers, fulcrums, and tobacco. Thus, he unified the universe and held it up and looked at it, or wandered through its byways and alleys and jungles, not as a terrified traveller in the thick of mysteries seeking an unknown goal, but observing and charting and becoming familiar with all there was to know. And the more he knew, the more passionately he admired the universe, and life, and his own life in the midst of it all.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} X-ray {{illumination}} of an accretion disk. We relax the simplifying assumption of constant gas density used in most previous studies; instead we determine the density from hydrostatic balance. It is {{found that the}} thermal ionization instability prevents the <b>illuminated</b> <b>gas</b> from attaining temperatures at which the gas is unstable. In particular, the uppermost layers of the X-ray <b>illuminated</b> <b>gas</b> {{are found to be}} almost completely ionized and at the local Compton temperature (∼ 10 ^ 7 - 10 ^ 8 K); at larger depths, the gas temperature drops abruptly to form a thin layer with T∼ 10 ^ 6 K, while at yet larger depths it decreases sharply to the disk effective temperature. We find that most of the Fe Kα line emission and absorption edge are produced in the coolest, deepest layers, while the Fe atoms in the hottest, uppermost layers are generally almost fully ionized, hence making a negligible contribution to reprocessing features in ∼ 6. 4 - 10 keV energy range. We provide a summary of how X-ray reprocessing features depend on parameters of the problem. The results of our self-consistent calculations are both quantitatively and qualitatively different from those obtained using the constant density assumption. Therefore, we conclude that X-ray reflection calculations should always utilize hydrostatic balance in order to provide a reliable theoretical interpretation of observed X-ray spectra of AGN and GBHCs.

40|$|Iron Kα {{emission}} from photoionized and optically thick {{material is}} {{observed in a}} variety of astrophysical environments including X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei, and possibly gamma-ray bursts. This paper presents calculations showing how the equivalent width (EW) of the Fe K line depends on the iron abundance of the <b>illuminated</b> <b>gas</b> and its ionization state [...] two variables subject to significant cosmic scatter. Reflection spectra from a constant density slab which is illuminated with a power-law spectrum with photon-index Γ are computed using the code of Ross & Fabian. When the Fe K EW is measured from the reflection spectra alone, we find that it can reach values greater than 6 keV if the Fe abundance is about 10 times solar and the <b>illuminated</b> <b>gas</b> is neutral. EWs of about 1 keV are obtained when the gas is ionized. In contrast, when the EW is measured from the incident+reflected spectrum, the largest EWs are 800 keV and are found when the gas is ionized. When Γ is increased, the Fe K line generally weakens, but significant emission can persist to larger ionization parameters. The iron abundance has its greatest impact on the EW when it is less than 5 times solar. When the abundance is further increased, the line strengthens only marginally. Therefore, we conclude that Fe K lines with EWs much greater than 800 eV are unlikely to be produced by gas with a supersolar Fe abundance. These results should be useful in interpreting Fe K emission whenever it arises from optically thick fluorescence. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures, accepted by MNRAS Letter...|$|R

40|$|Models are {{presented}} for the ionization and temperature structure of X-ray <b>illuminated</b> <b>gas</b> clouds {{under the assumption}} that the clouds' pressure is fixed. Models are considered which have a variety of different combinations of X-ray source spectrum and cloud pressure, characteristic of galactic X-ray sources and interstellar gas. It is shown that optically thick constant pressure clouds obey scaling laws for their ionized column densities which are analogous to the scaling behavior of constant density models. The results of constant pressure models are contrasted with constant density model results, and it is shown that the constant pressure assumption leads to enhanced thermal instability effects and also causes important differences in the line spectra emergent from X-ray illuminated clouds.
