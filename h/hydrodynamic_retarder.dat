5000|$|Starting in 2004 two further sub {{designs were}} made: G 2000-4 BB with a MTU engine which {{increase}} {{the power to}} 2700 kW. This variant also included a <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder</b> (a type of braking system) {{as part of the}} Voith supplied transmission package.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder</b> {{was also}} {{introduced}} {{as a third}} stage which complemented the torque-converter and fluid coupling. Together, all these engineering improvements had a common goal: To continually increase the transmission's performance rating without compromising its installation complexity or proven reliability.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, a new twin {{converter}} transmission, the L 620 reU2, {{was developed}} for high-performance, main-line locomotives. The new L 620 reU2 was equipped with both a start-up converter, having a diameter of 525 mm, {{as well as a}} travel-phase converter, having a diameter of 434 mm. The design of the new L 620 re U2 was based on its successful predecessor, the L 520 rzU2 which had a power rating of 1,400 kW. This new transmission however was rated significantly higher at 2,700 kW and therefore virtually all of its components had to be enlarged as well as reinforced. In the standard version of the transmission, two gears were mounted on the secondary shaft rather than using the idler wheel found in the older L 520 rzU2. As a result, the drive shaft's output speed could be adjusted to suit the locomotive's power requirements. The drive shaft's main bearing was also enlarged to 550 mm. In general, this new high-performance transmission clearly illustrated the enormous capability of hydrodynamic couplings. With a weight-to-power ratio of only 2.06 kg/kW, the new L 620 reU2 set a record for locomotive transmissions. By comparison, the similar L 520 rzU2 transmission had a far higher weight-to-power ratio of 2.4 kg/kW. In addition, a newly designed <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder,</b> the KB 385, was available as an optional component. At Vossloh, the locomotive manufacturer based in Kiel, these transmissions were installed in both its G1700 and G2000 main-line locomotives. Finally, the latest development is the LS 640 reU2 transmission which will be used {{for the first time in}} the Voith Maxima locomotive having 3,600 kW. The LS 640 reU2 is a so-called split turbo-transmission which uses two drive shafts from the L 620 reU2 to power both bogies of a six axle diesel locomotive.|$|E

50|$|Turbo-transmissions are hydrodynamic, {{multi-stage}} drive assemblies whose {{performance is}} based on the Föttinger principle of fluid dynamics. Torque-converters, fluid couplings and optional <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarders</b> are the key components in these assemblies, which are ideally suited for powered rail vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|In 1969, {{the smaller}} T 211 turbo-transmission was {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to hydro-mechanical bus transmissions, being designed for diesel railcars in the low power range of [...] Similar to the first turbo-transmission, the T 211 used a linked converter-coupling combination but it also had a high-speed gear for greater efficiency. Additionally, a reversing gear assembly was added and an optional <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder</b> could be installed if required. The converter had a hydrodynamic circuit diameter of 346 mm, while the fluid coupling had a slightly smaller diameter of 305 mm. And due to its high-speed gear, the main shaft could run significantly higher at 4,170 rpm. As a result, the T 211 r had reserve power, which was reflected by its reinforced mechanical components (gears, bearings and shafts) as well as the transmission controls. At the same time however, the diameters of the converter, coupling and retarder remained unchanged. The overall flow rate within the hydrodynamic circuits was increased to accommodate the higher power rating of [...] At , the main shaft ran at just under 5,000 rpm which resulted in rotational speeds for the (empty) converter of 74 m/s when the vehicle reached its maximum speed. To ensure adequate cooling of the converter during high-speed operations, a stronger hydrodynamic fluid pump was installed, which supplied 3.5 l/s of oil through the heat exchanger during the travel phase and 9.0 l/s when in the braking phase, with the retarder rotor also serving as an additional circulating pump. When viewed from the outside this T 211 r transmission differed from its predecessor, the T 211 re.3 with , only slightly through the addition of a built-in electronic control unit and an enlarged air filter.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to {{the working}} {{characteristics}} of the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder,</b> the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder</b> D 300 is chosen in this research. Based on three-dimensional flow theory, the internal temperature fields of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder</b> with different liquid-filled ratios of 100 %, 75 %, 50 %, 25 % are numerically simulated. The standard k-ε model is chosen as turbulent model for calculation. The SIMPLEC algorithm is chosen as velocity-pressure coupling algorithm and the second order upwind scheme is used as discrete method. The mixture multiphase model {{is used to calculate}} the unsteady gas-liquid two-phase flow in the condition of partial charging. Through simulating and analyzing, it provides an important theoretical basis for the heat exchange of the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder</b> at different gears...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a concept of}} electric power generating system that uses a wind turbine to generate kinetic energy which converts heat through a <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder.</b> The heat so generated is utilized to drive an organic Rankine cycle that converts thermal energy into electricity power for continuous and undisrupted supply during the year. A <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder</b> converts kinetic energy into heat through hot fluid by directing {{the flow of the}} fluid into the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder</b> in a manner that resists rotation of blades of the wind turbine. The hot fluid circulating in the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder</b> is a thermal heat source for vapor regeneration of organic heat exchange fluid mixture(s) used in the Rankine cycle. The expansion of the organic heat exchange fluid gets converted into rotation of the generator rotor...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder</b> {{is a kind}} of assist braking device, {{which can}} {{transfer}} the vehicle kinetic energy into the heat energy of working medium. There are complicated three-dimensional viscous incompressible turbulent flows in <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>retarder,</b> so {{that it is difficult to}} represent the parameters changing phenomenon and investigate the interactional law. In order to develop a kind of reliable theoretical model for internal flow field, in this study, the dynamics models of interacting torques between impellers and working fluid were constructed based on braking energy transfer principle by using Euler theory to describe the flow state in view of time scale. The model can truly represent the dynamic braking process...|$|E
