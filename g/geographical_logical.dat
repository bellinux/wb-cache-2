40|$|The {{trigger and}} data {{acquisition}} (TDAQ) {{system of the}} ATLAS experiment at CERN comprises approximately 2500 servers interconnected by three separate Ethernet networks, totaling 250 switches. Due to its real-time nature, there are additional requirements in comparison to conventional networks in terms of speed and performance. A comprehensive monitoring framework has been developed for expert use. However, non experts may experience difficulties in using it and interpreting data. Moreover, specific performance issues, such as single component saturation or unbalanced workload, need to be spotted with ease, in real-time, and understood {{in the context of}} the full system view. We addressed these issues by developing an innovative visualization system where the users benefit from the advantages of 3 D graphics to visualize the large monitoring parameter space associated with our system. This has been done by developing a hierarchical model of the complete system onto which we overlaid <b>geographical,</b> <b>logical</b> and real-time monitoring information. This article briefly describes the network monitoring framework and introduces the system’s visualization challenges and previous limitations. The functionality, design and implementation of the 3 D visualization system are then described in detail, with a focus on the model design, user interaction, navigation mechanisms and methods used to achieve scalability when rendering and updating many objects in real-time...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to analyze {{a model for the}} {{management}} and development of categories of environmental data, using some decision support systems such as the Geographic Information Systems (GIS), applied to the fuzzy analysis. As a "case study", the research was focused on the analysis of noise data and on the geographical context of the Province of Cagliari. During the research project, all the geographical themes and the socio-economic and noise data, once stored, processed and structured, were put into many databases, related to each other by <b>logical,</b> <b>geographical</b> and topological links and rules. All the databases, dialoguing among themselves and with the GIS, create the Noise Decision Support System: a model that improves the analysis effectiveness, increasing the number of the verifiable alternatives and providing assistance to the “acoustics landscape planning”.

40|$|The {{negative}} effects of disturbances on the long-term persistence of populations may be more severe in marginal populations, i. e. those occurring at the boundaries of <b>geographical</b> and eco- <b>logical</b> distribution ranges. Human trampling is {{an important source of}} anthropogenic disturbance for intertidal assemblages. Effects of human trampling on intertidal rocky shore assemblages dominated by Ascophyllum nodosum (L.) Le Jol. at its southern distributional limit in Europe were tested exper- imentally. Four different intensities of trampling disturbances were applied to experimental areas, over a period of 5 mo. Percentage cover of A. nodosum and associated organisms was quantified dur- ing the disturbance period and for a recovery period of 1 yr. The 2 highest trampling intensities dras- tically reduced the cover of A. nodosum. Trampling also negatively affected Fucus vesiculosus and understorey species, while indirectly allowing colonisation by ephemeral green algae. One year after the end of disturbance, A. nodosum assemblages in the highest disturbance intensity areas were still significantly different from assemblages in the control and lowest disturbance intensity areas. These results were mainly driven by a switch in the dominant canopy species, from A. nodosum to F. vesicu- losus. Results obtained in this study show that disturbance by human trampling negatively affects A. nodosum assemblages and that the effects are dependent on trampling intensity. These findings highlight the risk of local extinction imposed on these populations by anthropogenic disturbance, and the consequent need for protection measures for such sensitive populations...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years the {{attention}} of the scientific community has been focused on the analysis of the Internet Topology, in order to understand how the interconnections between Internet nodes works. We already know that the core of the actual Internet is a multi-tier hierarchy of IP transit providers. We also know that many reasearch project exist with the only purpose of investigating the Internet Topology. One of these project, called The Portolan Project, developed in the IT departement of the University of Pisa, is currently active and is giving a great contribution on the discovery of Internet Topology due to his bottom-up approach to the problem and the use of a mobile crowdsourcing system through Android smartphones. Another interesting field comed out in this last years is the IP Geolocation, i. e. the <b>geographical</b> localization of <b>Logical</b> IP addresses on the Internet. The motivations that focus the interest around this topic are various: the pop up of new location-aware applications like smartphones apps, web site contents and advertisement or the importance of finding the sources of malwares and viruses, or even spammers, or else academic studies on the way people use the Internet and more. There are various projects dedicated to the IP Geolocation, since it is not an easy task: there is no direct relationship between the IP address of a host and its geographic location. These projects, of academic or commercial nature, {{try to find a way}} to reach a great accuracy in the IP geolocation in order to give a full working service to the users. The contribution of this thesis is to develop an IP geolocation approach using the tools provided by the Portolan Project and the Spotter project, and to apply it in order to make the Internet Topology Analysis more complete. The experiments carried out in this thesis work will give in the future the possibility to develop a tool to geolocate IP addresses on the Internet in the Portolan Android App available to all the users...|$|R
40|$|Lately, {{distributed}} computing (DC) {{has emerged in}} several application scenarios such as grid computing, high-performance and reconfigurable computing, wireless sensor networks, battle management systems, peer-to-peer networks, and donation grids. When DC is performed in these scenarios, the {{distributed computing}} system (DCS) supporting the applications not only exhibits heterogeneous computing resources and a significant communication latency, but also becomes highly dynamic due to the communication network {{as well as the}} computing servers are affected by a wide class of anomalies that change the topology of the system in a random fashion. These anomalies exhibit spatial and/or temporal correlation when they result, for instance, from wide-area power or network outages These correlated failures may not only inflict a large amount of damage to the system, but they may also induce further failures in other servers {{as a result of the}} lack of reliable communication between the components of the DCS. In order to provide a robust DC environment in the presence of component failures, it is key to develop a general framework for accurately modeling the complex dynamics of a DCS. In this dissertation a novel approach has been undertaken for modeling a general class of DCSs and for analytically characterizing the performance and reliability of parallel applications executed on such systems. A general probabilistic model has been constructed by assuming that the random times governing the dynamics of the DCS follow arbitrary probability distributions with heterogeneous parameters. Auxiliary age variables have been introduced in the modeling of a DCS and a hybrid continuous and discrete state-space model the system has been constructed. This hybrid model has enabled the development of an age-dependent stochastic regeneration theory, which, in turn, has been employed to analytically characterize the average execution time, the quality-of-service and the reliability in serving an application. These are three metrics of performance and reliability of practical interest in DC. Analytical approximations as well as mathematical lower and upper bounds for these metrics have also been derived in an attempt to reduce the amount of computational resources demanded by the exact characterizations. In order to systematically assess the reliability of DCSs in the presence of correlated component failures, a novel probabilistic model for spatially correlated failures has been developed. The model, based on graph theory and Markov random fields, captures both <b>geographical</b> and <b>logical</b> correlations induced by the arbitrary topology of the communication network of a DCS. The modeling framework, in conjunction with a general class of dynamic task reallocation (DTR) control policies, has been used to optimize the performance and reliability of applications in the presence of independent as well as spatially correlated anomalies. Theoretical predictions, Monte- Carlo simulations as well as experimental results have shown that optimizing these metrics can significantly impact the performance of a DCS. Moreover, the general setting developed here has shed insights on: (i) the effect of different stochastic mod- els on the accuracy of the performance and reliability metrics, (ii) the dependence of the DTR policies on system parameters such as failure rates and task-processing rates, (iii) the severe impact of correlated failures on the reliability of DCSs, (iv) the dependence of the DTR policies on degree of correlation in the failures, and (v) the fundamental trade-off between minimizing the execution time of an application and maximizing its reliability.

40|$|This thesis reviews {{a series}} of river basin {{ecosystem}} restoration/enhancement projects carried out {{under the direction of}} three individual southern Ontario conservation authorities in their respective river basins. The three authorities are the Grand River Conservation Authority, the Maitland Valley Conservation Authority, and the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority. A review from the published literature dealing with river basins, ecosystems, and environmental management supports the analysis of restoration projects. The criterion by which the literature articles were selected was that they have relevance to the type of environmental issues that are common to the river basins in the study areas. Comparisons made between the three conservation authorities’ restoration efforts are based on the investigation and assessment of a sample of four published restoration projects on file at each of the authorities’ head offices. A five component conceptual framework was used to analyze each of the twelve projects. The accumulated assessment data formed the basis for comparison. There are some observations and conclusions to be drawn from this thesis. The evolution of the conservation authorities’ approach to ecosystem restoration has occurred in response to the development of new knowledge, changes in public attitudes, changes in government policies, and changes in available operating resources. Although all conservation authorities operate within a similar mandate, they exercise enough individual autonomy to address their individual basin’s specific issues. The conservation authorities have demonstrated their resilience in response to current deep governmental financial constraints by recruiting volunteers, e. g. for the development of their sub-watershed and watershed plans. Nearly all of their sub-watershed plans are administered through public stewardship organizations. They have successfully solicited funds from organizations that allot financial grants for environmental causes, e. g. for the Grand River forestry plan. Ecosystem restoration is one of several conservation authority responsibilities. It represents a major advance in their operational evolution from their core mandate of soil and water conservation, stream flow control, and water quality, through applying the ecosystem approach at the sub-watershed level, and toward basin-wide management plans, e. g. GRCA’s Grand River forestry plan, and MVCA’s Maitland Watershed Partnerships project. No doubt, the river basin {{has been shown to be}} the <b>logical</b> <b>geographical</b> area in southern Ontario on which to base conservation management strategies. Individual conservation authorities have accumulated over fifty years experience in successful management of environmental issues at the river basin level, through which they have gained a body of knowledge about their individual river basin that must surpass that held by any other organization. Such experience should qualify them for taking on an expanded role in crucial ecosystem restoration issues like those associated with groundwater, wetlands, waste management, public stewardship, and the development of ecosystem management strategies...|$|R
