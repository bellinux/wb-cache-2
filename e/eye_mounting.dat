40|$|Macrophages are master {{regulators}} of inflammation, fibrosis and wound-healing {{throughout the}} body. However, little work {{to date has}} examined {{their role in the}} inflammatory and fibrotic diseases of the <b>eye.</b> <b>Mounting</b> evidence for macrophage participation in the failure of intraocular implants (called posterior capsule opacification or PCO), and the well-established role of dysfunctional macrophage behaviour during diabetes motivated this investigation. A novel in vitro model of macrophages and lens epithelial cells in co-culture was developed and first used to investigate the macrophage response to common intraocular lens materials, and the possible effect of this response on lens epithelial cells. We observed significant inflammatory macrophage activation and reduced macrophage adhesion by hydrophilic implant surfaces compared to hydrophobic ones. However, the macrophage response to both materials induced the same degree of inflammation in lens epithelial cells. In agreement with previous studies, we conclude that macrophage adhesion and activation are inversely related, and that net inflammatory effect {{is a function of the}} degree of macrophage activation and the number of activated cells. The in vitro model was next used to explore the development of diabetic cataract. During hyperglycemic conditions a significant disruption of macrophage protein expression and delayed macrophage cell-death were observed, which may explain adverse inflammation in diabetes. Lens epithelial cell phenotype remained unchanged, though results from our in vitro model also suggest that lens epithelial cell death as a result of hyperglycemia occurs through a mechanism other than apoptosis, in agreement with the literature. We therefore provide additional evidence to the hypothesis that diabetic cataracts are a product of accumulated oxidative stress during hyperglycemia. Our findings provide a new method of inquiry into macrophage biocompatibility testing of intraocular materials, specifically through quantification of macrophage cell-surface markers and lens epithelial cell cytoskeletal elements...|$|E

25|$|For brine shrimp, many functions, {{including}} swimming, digestion {{and reproduction}} are not controlled through the brain; instead, local nervous system ganglia may control some regulation or synchronisation of these functions.

They have two widely separated compound <b>eyes</b> <b>mounted</b> on flexible stalks. These compound eyes are the main optical sense organ in adult brine shrimps.

In these pages we present REM (Rapid <b>Eye</b> <b>Mount),</b> a fully robotized fast slewing telescope equipped with a high throughput NIR (Z, J, H, K) camera dedicated to detecting the prompt IR afterglow. REM can discover objects at extremely high redshift and trigger large telescopes to observe them. The REM telescope will simultaneously feed ROSS (REM Optical Slitless Spectrograph) via a dichroic. ROSS will intensively monitor the prompt optical continuum of GRB afterglows.

40|$|A {{growing trend}} in {{humanoid}} robotics tend at reducing {{the size of}} humanoids in order to lower their building costs. While growing small has its advantages, it also has drawbacks. In particular, providing miniature humanoids with the same sensorimotor capabilities as their grown-up peers is a challenge, {{both in terms of}} mechanics, electronics and control. The Robota project creates humanoids, whose size should match that of a commercial doll, {{so that they can be}} used as part of experiments with autistic children. Because these experiments measure the child’s ability to socially interact with others, it is fundamental to provide the robot with sensory capabilities, such as speech and vision, that are at the basis of these interactions. This paper presents the creation of a miniature pair of mobile <b>eyes,</b> <b>mounted</b> with miniature cameras to provide Robota with binocular and mobile vision. The system allows the robot to blink, to direct its gaze toward or away from its user and to track the user’s face. ...|$|R
40|$|At the present, {{there is}} a growing trend in {{computer}} vision to consider the visual system {{in the context of the}} behaviour of robot interacting with dynamic environment. The Active Vision approach observed that constraints derived from camera motion can replace other assumptions that had previously been employed to solve mathematically ill-posed problems. To be able to effectively use multi degree of freedom (MDOF) camera systems we need to know how variations in the camera's control parameters are going to cause changes in the produced images. For this we need to have good mathematical models describing the relationships between the control parameters and the parameters of the resulting images, i. e., we need to calibrate the system. In this paper, we present methods and algorithms for camera calibration of an head-eye system develloped at the ISR Γ Coimbra.

40|$|The flat-spectrum radio quasar 3 C 454. 3 is {{well known}} to be a highly active and {{variable}} source with outbursts occurring across the whole electromagnetic spectrum over the last decades. In spring 2005, 3 C 454. 3 has been reported to exhibit a strong optical outburst which subsequently triggered multi-frequency observations of the source covering the radio up to gamma-ray bands. Here, we present first results of our near-IR/optical (V, R, I, H band) photometry performed between May 11 and August 5, 2005 with the Rapid <b>Eye</b> <b>Mount</b> (REM) at La Silla in Chile and the Automatic Imaging Telescope (AIT) of the Perugia University Observatory. 3 C 454. 3 was observed during an exceptional and historical high state with a subsequent decrease in brightness over our 86 days observing period.

A 30 gauge needle {{attached}} to a 5 ml syringe filled with sterile air is passed from the limbus (edge of the cornea) into the mid stroma (middle of the corneal layers) with the bevel of the needle facing upwards. Once the needle is stable in the stroma, controlled air injection is performed. Numerous tiny air bubbles are seen cleaving the stroma and finally they coalesce to form one large bubble or Big bubble (BB) (Fig 2A). Once the type 1 BB is formed in the centre, it is gradually enlarged to maximum size which is about 8 mm. Following this, the bubble is pierced with a trephine or knife (Fig 2B) and the graft is dissected meticulously. It is then stained with a dye (trypan blue) and delineated well (Fig 2C, D). The dissected PDEK graft is then placed in a storage medium till the recipient (patient) is ready for transplantation.|$|R

5000|$|The {{theory has}} been {{advanced}} that the hammer-like shape of the head may have evolved (at least in part) to enhance the animal's vision. [...] The positioning of the <b>eyes,</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the sides of}} the shark's distinctive hammer head, gives the shark good 360° vision in the vertical plane, meaning they can see above and below them at all times. The shape of the head was previously thought to help the shark find food, aiding in close-quarters maneuverability and allowing sharp turning movement without losing stability. However, it has been found that the unusual structure of its vertebrae was instrumental in making the turns correctly, more often than the shape of its head, though it would also shift and provide lift. From what is known about the winghead shark, the shape of the hammer-head apparently has to do with an evolved sensory function. Like all sharks, hammerheads have electroreceptory sensory pores called ampullae of Lorenzini. By distributing the receptors over a wider area, like a larger radio antenna, hammerheads can sweep for prey more effectively.|$|R
