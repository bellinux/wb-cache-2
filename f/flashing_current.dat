No consensus exists regarding the cause of these impressive but life-threatening features, sometimes called “flash” rip currents. In a new model, <b>flash</b> rip <b>currents</b> self-organize because of feedbacks resulting from a newly hypothesized interaction between waves and currents. Robust predictions arise from this numerical model: <b>Flash</b> rip <b>currents</b> become less prevalent with increasing beach slope and increasing variations in incident-wave heights.

40|$|The FLASH {{multiprocessor}} efficiently integrates {{support for}} cache-coherent shared memory and high-performance message passing, while minimizing both {{hardware and software}} overhead. Each node in FLASH contains a microprocessor, {{a portion of the}} machine’s global memory, a port to the interconnection network, an I/O interface, and a custom node controller called MAGIC. The MAGIC chip handles all communication both within the node and among nodes, using hardwired data paths for efficient data movement and a programmable processor optimized for executing protocol operations. The use of the protocol processor makes FLASH very flexible — it can support a variety of different communication mechanisms — and simplifies the design and implementation. This paper presents the architecture of FLASH and MAGIC, and discusses the base cache-coherence and message-passing protocols. Latency and occupancy numbers, which are derived from our system-level simulator and our Verilog code, are given for several common protocol operations. The paper also describes our software strategy and <b>FLASH’s</b> <b>current</b> status. ...|$|R

The results are based on data provided by the Brazilian Lightning Detection Network (BrasilDat) from 1999 to 2006, and only <b>flashes</b> with peak <b>currents</b> > 75 kA recorded during the months of December, January, February, and March (the approximate summer season in the Southern Hemisphere) were considered in order to compare with similar data obtained by Lyons et al.

The LPCCG flashes represent about 3 % of all flashes recorded during this period. All LPCCG distributions were obtained for both negative and positive flashes. The flash density distributions for negative and positive LPCCG flashes are different and furthermore differ from the flash density distributions for all negative and positive cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes. This suggests that the flash density distribution of CG <b>flashes</b> is peak <b>current</b> dependent. While the negative LPCCG flash density distribution has no significant dependence on any specific geographical or meteorological feature, the positive LPCCG flash density distribution and the distribution of the percentage of positive LPCCG flashes are closely related to the occurrence of mesoscale convective systems. The peak current and diurnal distributions of LPCCG flashes were found to be similar to those obtained in the contiguous United States...|$|R

40|$|International audienceArc flash is a {{constant}} hazard when discussing industrial safety, however, {{little is known about}} the arc <b>flash.</b> <b>Current</b> safety standards require the use of the NFPA 70 E equation to establish safety limits for arc flash hazards. However, when compared to an empirically derived model, these safety limits are much too low to account for all working conditions. A comparison of these two methods will lead to the conclusion that arc flash safety distances must be increased. 1. Introduction. In industrial electrical safety, arc flash hazards can be some of the most disastrous and deadly accidents in the work place. An arc flash can reach temperatures of over 35000 degC and cause an explosion with a blast force of 2000 psi and an audible report of over 140 decibels. At a current of just 0. 5 Amps, an electrical shock, such as the shock generated from an arc flash, will stop the heart of an adult. [1]. <b>Current</b> arc <b>flash</b> safety codes require that the worker be at a distance that, if an arc flash were to occur, would only result in 2 nd degree burns. The current accepted standard for arc flash energy calculations is given by the NFPA 70 E equation, which was derived experimentally. However, an empirical approach to determining arc energy will be derived in this paper and the results compared and examined...|$|R

40|$|Nonvolatility, {{the ability}} to retain data in a memory cell for years when unpowered, is crucial for many {{instrument}} applications. Most nonvolatile memory devices are Flash memory chips, so-called because of {{the ability to}} write them individually while erasing them in chunks. This type of device is ubiquitous in today’s cell phones, digital cameras, media cards, etc. But Flash memory suffers from several shortcomings that limit its market potential. Primarily, writing data to a Flash memory is too slow for Flash to rival its DRAM cousins. Secondly, Flash memories can only be reprogrammed a limited number of times, typically on the order of a million. While this may be enough for certain applications, programming limitations make Flash memory ill-suited for general computing or intense data manipulation applications. Perhaps most importantly, the nonvolatile memory industry recognizes that <b>current</b> <b>flash</b> memory technology will soon face a crisis: {{along with the rest of}} computer technology, flash chips must shrink to remain profitable, but the physics of the barrier oxide used in <b>current</b> <b>flash</b> technology prevents memory cells from being shrunk much further [1]...|$|R

This study aims to obtain the characteristics of plasma generation and discharge from plasma generated. The method used in this experiment uses a plasma reactor with a dot-zone configuration given DC voltage (HV DC). Syringes are treated as point electrodes and aluminum plates as field electrodes mounted perpendicularly.

The National Lightning Detection Network detected more than 800 000 cloud-to-ground lightning flashes from 119 storm systems which affected Texas during April-June 1993. This study attempted to characterize these flashes over the entire three-month period, then classify the storms according to their lightning characteristics, relative to their type, geographical location, and maximum echo height. Examination of the flashes over the entire period found that the highest ground flash densities within the study region (26. 50 - 34. 5 " N, 102 '- 930 W) were in southeastern Texas. The flashes lowering negative charge to ground had a mean multiplicity of 2. 91 strokes and median first-return stroke peak current of 32. 1 kiloamperes (kA). Six percent of the flashes were positive; the positive flashes exhibited a mean multiplicity of 1. 43 and a median peak current of 36. 6 kA. Relating the data to storm type revealed that frontal storm lightning was 2 - 3 times more positive than observed in airmass storms. Negative lightning in airmass storms had slightly higher mean multiplicities and peak currents than in frontal storms, while frontal storms had higher positive flash multiplicities and peak current values. Analysis by storm location showed that inland storm lightning flashes were more than twice as positive as those in coastal storms, but coastal storms had lower multiplicities and higher peak currents (both polarities) than observed in inland storms. Comparison of lightning characteristics to maximum echo height found a positive correlation between flash rates and echo heights, a negative correlation between percent positive rates and echo heights, a positive correlation between negative flash multiplicities and echo heights, and a negative correlation between positive <b>Flash</b> peak <b>currents</b> and echo heights. Negative <b>flash</b> peak <b>currents</b> remained relatively constant with increasing echo heights...|$|R
