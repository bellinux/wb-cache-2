5|$|Feed-in tariffs are {{designated}} prices {{which must be}} paid by utility companies for each kilowatt hour of renewable electricity produced by qualifying generators and <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grid. These tariffs normally represent a premium on wholesale electricity prices and offer a guaranteed revenue stream to help the power producer finance the project.|$|E

5|$|NIF's laser uses {{a system}} of large flashtubes (like those in a {{photography}} flashlamp) to optically pump {{a large number of}} glass plates. Once the plates are flashed and have settled into a population inversion, a small signal from a separate laser is <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> optical lines, stimulating the emission in the plates. The plates then dump their stored energy into the growing beam, amplifying it billions of times.|$|E
5|$|The flight {{instruments}} in the B.1 were traditional and included G4B compasses; Mk.4 artificial horizons; and zero reader flight display instruments. The B.1 had a Smiths Mk10 autopilot. In the B.2, these features were incorporated into the Smiths Military Flight System (MFS), the pilots' components being: two beam compasses; two director-horizons; and a Mk.10A or Mk.10B autopilot. From 1966, B.2s were fitted with the ARI 5959 Terrain-following radar (TFR), built by General Dynamics, its commands being <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> director-horizons.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are either}} used to {{synthesize}} proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea {{and carbon dioxide}} {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase. The amino group is <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton {{in the form of a}} keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate. The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis (discussed below).|$|E

5|$|As 1943 {{gave way}} to 1944, many {{problems}} remained. Tests began on the machinery at K-25 in April 1944 without a barrier. Attention turned to a new process developed by Kellex. Finally, in July 1944, Kellex barriers began to be installed in K-25. K-25 commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of the}} product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment. Uranium partially enriched in K-25 was <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> calutrons at Y-12 to complete the enrichment process.|$|E
5|$|In animals, {{amino acids}} are {{obtained}} through {{the consumption of}} foods containing protein. Ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, or <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> citric acid cycle. This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body's own proteins {{to be used to}} support life, particularly those found in muscle.|$|E
5|$|In the air, {{there were}} also two {{competing}} designs, originating from groups of different backgrounds and needs. The Army Signal Corps, representing military aviators, preferred a solution based on a stream of audio navigation signals, constantly <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pilots' ears via a headset. Civilian pilots on the other hand, who were mostly airmail pilots flying cross-country to deliver the mail, felt the audio signals would be annoying and difficult to use over long flights, and preferred a visual solution, with an indicator in the instrument panel.|$|E

5|$|Marlborough {{now had to}} {{turn his}} {{attention}} from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, {{in and around the}} walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went to the attack. The Allied progress was slow and hard, and like the defenders, they suffered many casualties.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{planned to}} have the K-25 plant in full {{production}} by June or July 1945. Having taken two years to get the prototype stages working, the British experts regarded this as incredibly optimistic, and felt that, barring a miracle, it {{would be unlikely to}} reach that point before the end of 1946. This opinion offended their American counterparts and dampened the enthusiasm for cooperation, and the British mission returned to the United Kingdom in January 1944. Armed with the British Mission's report, Chadwick and Oliphant were able to persuade Groves to reduce K-25's enrichment target; the output of K-25 would be enriched to weapons grade by being <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> electromagnetic plant. Despite the British Mission's pessimistic forecasts, K-25 was producing enriched uranium in June 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Irish overprinted stamps came, as {{supplied}} from the printers in London, with a watermark of the Royal Cypher of George V. The first Irish watermark was a stylised {{design of the}} two overlapping letters 's' and 'e' making an 'se' watermark representing {{the name of the}} country Saorstát Éireann. This watermark was discontinued around 1940 when the country's name changed to Éire (Ireland); it was replaced with e watermark paper to represent Éire. Stamps of the period may have the watermark in any of several states of inversion and rotation attributable to the way the paper was <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> printing machines.|$|E

5|$|A Company was not {{significantly}} delayed by the German patrols it encountered later, although the presence of cheering Dutch crowds delayed the whole battalion as it passed through Oosterbeek. As they approached the railway bridge, C Company detached to capture it, but German engineers blew the bridge just as the British were starting to cross it. A Company now encountered enemy armoured cars, but successfully skirted them by manoeuvering through the back gardens of the houses {{on either side of}} the road At 8pm, as darkness fell, Grayburn's platoon led A Company into Arnhem centre and under the main ramp of Arnhem road bridge. Tatham-Warter deployed his platoons around the ramp; 2 Platoon covered both sides of the northernmost extreme of the ramp where it <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> town centre.|$|E
5|$|Although American {{units were}} usually able to {{replenish}} their numbers quickly, the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without {{having so much}} as driven a car before; some tank commanders were forced to teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on quantity over quality, ensured {{that the majority of}} fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was not unusual for half of a unit's replacements to become casualties within {{the first few days of}} combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fighting; for instance, a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E

25|$|A {{negative}} {{power factor}} (0 to −1) {{can result from}} returning power to the source, {{such as in the}} case of a building fitted with solar panels when surplus power is <b>fed</b> back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> supply.|$|R
50|$|Water {{quality is}} further {{reduced by the}} use of {{combined}} sewer overflow systems, in which storm water and raw sewage share pipes. Thus, in times of high water, raw sewage is <b>fed</b> directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|R
5|$|Fats are catabolised by {{hydrolysis}} to free {{fatty acids}} and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Steroids are also broken down by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate, which can all {{be used by the}} cell for energy. M. tuberculosis can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway(s) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of M. tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|From the 1994–95 to 2013–14 seasons the Regional League, {{along with}} the Midland Football Combination, served {{as one of the}} two {{official}} feeders to the Midland Football Alliance. The highest-placed team which met the Alliance's entry requirements was promoted to the Alliance, and one or more teams were relegated into the Regional League from the Alliance depending on the number of clubs remaining in each league. (These requirements were inherited by the second Midland League; see last paragraph.) Prior to the 2006–07 season, the league was defined as a step 7 league within the National League System, even though it <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Alliance, which was graded as step 5. In 2006 the Regional League was re-graded by the Football Association as a step 6 league. Teams in the top two divisions are eligible {{to take part in the}} FA Cup and FA Vase as long as their grounds meet the required standards.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Urey {{brought in}} Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University {{to look at}} the problem of a usable barrier. Libby made {{progress}} on understanding the chemistry of uranium hexafluoride, leading to ideas on how to prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied fluorocarbons, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in the gaseous diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that gaseous diffusion enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably infeasible, and that the gaseous diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be <b>fed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.|$|E
