5|$|Flanders {{referred}} to the Marshall Plan as an important application of moral law to public policy.

5|$|To <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> the Huns, Theodosius {{had to pay}} an {{enormous}} annual tribute to Attila. His successor, Marcian, refused to continue to pay the tribute, but Attila had already diverted {{his attention to the}} West. After Attila's death in 453, the Hunnic Empire collapsed, and many of the remaining Huns were often hired as mercenaries by Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts {{also carried}} lighter weapons. Many early dreadnoughts carried a {{secondary}} armament of very light guns designed to <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> enemy torpedo boats. The calibre {{and weight of}} secondary armament tended to increase, as the range of torpedoes and the staying power of the destroyers expected to carry them also increased. From the end of World War I onwards, battleships had to be equipped with many light guns as anti-aircraft armament.|$|E

5|$|In the Belmont, Paynter led {{for most}} of the race until the final furlong when Smith came off the rail, {{allowing}} winner Union Rags to slip through and win by a neck. Paynter had already fended off two challengers during the race, and Smith had switched his whip from his right hand to his left in an attempt to <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> a late challenge from Atigun; Smith considered his decision to be an error that cost him the race.|$|E
5|$|In the primary, Tydings faced {{a strong}} {{challenge}} from Congressman Paul Sarbanes, who {{had entered the}} race several months earlier. This head start gave Sarbanes a considerable organizational and monetary advantage, and he had already secured influential endorsements. To <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> Sarbanes, Tydings hoped his name recognition and charisma on television would compensate for Sarbanes' other advantages. He also worked to relabel himself as more fiscally conservative than Sarbanes, since both candidates were seen as liberal.|$|E

5|$|A large 2010 {{survey of}} healthy and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} {{elevated levels of}} pesticides in wax and pollen, but the amounts of pesticides were similar in both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> pathogens. These observations {{have led to the}} hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression.|$|E
5|$|Although Timoshenko's forces {{successfully}} regrouped on 21 May, {{he ordered}} a withdrawal of Army Group Kotenko {{by the end of}} 22 May, while he prepared an attack for 23 May, to be orchestrated by the 9th and 57th Armies. Although the Red Army desperately attempted to <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> advancing Wehrmacht and launched local counterattacks to relieve several surrounded units, they generally failed. By the end of May 24, Soviet forces opposite Kharkov had been surrounded by German formations, which had been able to transfer several more divisions to the front, increasing the pressure on the Soviet flanks and finally forcing them to collapse.|$|E
5|$|Because adult great spotted kiwis {{are large}} and powerful, {{they are able to}} <b>fend</b> <b>off</b> most predators that attack them, such as stoats, ferrets, weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, all of which are {{invasive}} species in New Zealand. However, dogs are able to kill even adults. Stoats, ferrets, possums, cats and dogs will feed on the eggs and chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. Before the arrival of mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.|$|E

5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} complicated the divestiture.
