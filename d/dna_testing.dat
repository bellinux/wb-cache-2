40|$|This master thesis was {{performed}} at the personal genomics company DNA-Guide Europa AB. The goal was to create <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> for drug response and to update the already existing <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> for autosomal ancestry. The <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> for drug response: The objective {{of this part of}} the master thesis was to create individual <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> for response to each drug within different groups of medicines. The tests were meant to interest private customers. DNA-Guide uses a microarray technique for the DNA-analysis and this delimited the choice of SNPs. Inserts, deletions, repeats and copies of a whole gene can be difficult to implement on the microarray chip. The SNPs and studies used as a base for the tests had to fulfil several criteria. The studies must be large enough to prove that the association between the genotype and the response to the drug is valid among Europeans, since it’s the clientele of the company. The found association must also be strong enough to be of interest for a <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> at DNA-Guide. If the SNPs could be implemented on the microarray chip a customer report was created about the possible results. The report had the same structure and design as those for the existing <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> at DNA-Guide. The work resulted in <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> and reports for medicines within the seven groups of medicines; anticoagulants, medicine against high cholesterol, blood pressure lowering medicine, asthma inhalers, antidepressants, birth-control pills and antiretroviral drugs. The <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> for autosomal ancestry: The purpose of the update was to enhance to customers understanding of their results and the construction of the test. The update resulted in a description of how the used algorithm processes the results (from the DNA analysis) and a guide to interpret the results of the test. Conclusions: Both the <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> for drug response and the updated <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> for autosomal ancestry can add value for the customers at DNA-Guide. The <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> for drug response can offer an explanation to why a medicine does not have an effect or reveal if the customer has higher risk of adverse effects. Even though recommendations for dosage or treatment could not be provided in almost all of the created <b>DNA</b> <b>tests,</b> being aware of the higher risk can be the first step to avoid adverse effects. The update of the <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> report for autosomal ancestry resulted in a better description of the algorithm and limitations of the test, which can enhance the customers’ understanding of their results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract There are {{currently}} about 80 different <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> available for mutations {{that are associated}} with inherited disease in the domestic dog, and as the tools available with which to dissect the canine genome become increasingly sophisticated, this number can be expected to rise dramatically over the next few years. With unrelenting media pressure focused firmly on the health of the purebred domestic dog, veterinarians and dog breeders are turning increasingly to <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> to ensure the health of their dogs. It is ultimately the responsibility of the scientists who identify disease-associated genetic variants to make sensible choices about which discoveries are appropriate to develop into commercially available <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> for the lay dog breeder, who needs to balance the need to improve the genetic health of their breed with the need to maintain genetic diversity. This review discusses some of the factors that should be considered along the route from mutation discovery to <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> and some representative examples of <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> currently available...|$|R

5|$|Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually {{consisting}} {{of one to}} four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, {{the next level of}} resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.|$|E
5|$|Discovery of the Kiger Mustang was {{the result}} of a BLM Mustang roundup in the Beatys Butte area in Harney County in 1977. During the roundup, it was noticed that among the horses {{collected}} from the area, there was a group with similar color and markings. <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> by the University of Kentucky showed close relation to the Spanish horses brought to the Americas in the 17th century. These distinct horses were separated from the other horses and the BLM placed two groups in separate areas of Steens Mountain to preserve the breed. Seven horses were placed in the Riddle Mountain Herd Management Area (HMA) and twenty in the Kiger HMA.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which {{is a type of}} abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to have extremely low energy and be unable to exercise. The gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.|$|E
25|$|The <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> {{is used to}} {{determine}} which potential father {{is the father of}} the child, or if potential family members need confirmation that they are definitely biologically related, such as brothers and sisters.

50|$|Three {{principal}} {{types of}} genealogical <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> are available, with each {{looking at a}} different part of the genome and useful for different types of genealogical research: Autosomal, Mitochondrial, and Y.

50|$|Lyons {{has helped}} develop <b>DNA</b> <b>tests</b> for {{polycystic kidney disease}} (PKD), an {{inherited}} condition that shortens the life of cats by causing them to suffer kidney cysts. Previous tests for this condition involved ultrasound and were not very accurate, unlike the <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> devised by Lyons. Approximately one third of all Persian cats carried the PKD gene at one time, but because of ultrasound testing and the newer, more accurate <b>DNA</b> <b>tests,</b> these PKD-carrier cats are gradually being identified and removed from the feline gene pool by spaying and neutering.|$|R
5|$|In 2000, an Argentine Army {{expedition}} found additional wreckage—including a propeller and wheels (one {{of which}} had an intact and inflated tyre)—and noted that the wreckage was well localised, a fact which pointed to a head-on impact with the ground, and which also ruled out a mid-air explosion. Human remains were also recovered, including three torsos, a foot in an ankle boot and a manicured hand. By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims had been identified through <b>DNA</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, remote {{cameras in}} the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest {{captured}} photographs of OR-7 along with a female wolf who might have mated with him. A month later, biologists from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the ODFW returned to southwest Oregon, photographed two wolf pups, and took fecal samples for <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> to determine {{the relationship of the}} pups to OR-7. By September, tests run at the University of Idaho confirmed that OR-7's mate is a wolf, that the two pups are their offspring, and that the mate is related to the wolves in the Minam and Snake River packs of northeastern Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Olga's murder {{following}} the Russian Revolution of 1917 resulted in her canonization as a passion bearer by the Russian Orthodox Church. In later years, when {{dozens of people}} made claims to be surviving members of the imperial family, a woman named Marga Boodts claimed to be Grand Duchess Olga, but her claim was not taken seriously. Olga was murdered along with her family at Yekaterinburg. Her remains were identified through <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> and were buried during a funeral ceremony in 1998 at Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg {{along with those of}} her parents and two of her sisters.|$|E

5|$|Persistent {{rumors of}} her {{possible}} escape circulated after her death, {{fueled by the}} fact that the location of her burial was unknown during the decades of Communist rule. The mass grave near Yekaterinburg which held the remains of the Tsar, his wife, and three of their daughters was revealed in 1991, and the bodies of Alexei Nikolaevich and the remaining daughter—either Anastasia or her older sister Maria—were discovered in 2007. Her possible survival has been conclusively disproved. Forensic analysis and <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> confirmed that the remains are those of the imperial family, showing that all four grand duchesses were killed in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Symptomatic {{carriers}} of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a {{lower than normal}} blood clotting factor {{that can lead to}} heavy bleeding. <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> on the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from Hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Therefore, had Anastasia lived to have children of her own, they may have been afflicted by the disease as well. Alexei's hemophilia was chronic and incurable; his frequent attacks caused permanent disability.|$|E
5|$|The breed is {{considered}} to be critically endangered by both the Livestock Conservancy and the Equus Survival Trust, and there are only around 275 Marsh Tackies in existence today. In 2006 and 2007, the two organizations worked together to complete <b>DNA</b> <b>testing</b> on the breed with the goals of mapping the Marsh Tacky's place among the horse breeds of the world and beginning a stud book. In 2007, an association was begun with the objective of preserving and promoting the Marsh Tacky; and in 2010 a closed stud book was created.|$|E
