5|$|With {{six minutes}} remaining, the Knicks began {{intentionally}} fouling any Warrior except Chamberlain, keeping {{the ball out}} of the center's hands. New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much of the shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score. Effectively, they played the opposite of what a normal club would do if they faced a deficit, willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back. Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from the sideline across the floor directly to Chamberlain, who would use his size and strength to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a jump shot at 4:15. Philadelphia began quickly fouling New York with around four minutes left, reciprocating the intentional foul strategy. Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point pulled out his entire starting five, save Chamberlain, and replaced them with bench players. The intention was to foul the Knicks, <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball. Thus each team spent the last minutes fouling each other. The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls, and the Knicks with 32, and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls.|$|E
5|$|The {{teams were}} as evenly matched {{in the third}} quarter as they had been in the first, with Vanderbilt gaining only two first downs. Soon after the start of the fourth quarter Neely intercepted a pass, weaving for a 25-yeard return to Georgia's 40-yard line. Two long pass {{attempts}} failed, and Thomas Ryan lined up to punt. Rupert Smith sneaked in behind Ryan, rushing to recover the 25-yard onside kick from scrimmage. Smith jumped up to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> from a horde of Bulldogs after they let it bounce, and raced for a 15-yard touchdown. After he added an extra point, the game ended in a 7–7 tie.|$|E
5|$|Towers {{scored the}} first Welsh try, which was {{converted}} by Jim Webb. The Natives {{replied with a}} spirited run by Ellison, but he failed {{to break through the}} Welsh defence. The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half-way line, which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd. Webb, playing in out of position at full-back, missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark. The Natives continued to push, with Elliot coming within five-yards of the try line, and when Ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25-yard line before he could touch down. In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander Bland dribbled the ball into the Natives' 25; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls, who managed to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> across the try line, allowing Jim Hannan to score. Warbrick for the Natives and Stadden for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries, but there were no further scores in the game.|$|E

5|$|While at Celtic, Hooper {{struck up}} an {{excellent}} partnership with fellow striker Anthony Stokes. They scored over 40 goals {{between them in}} their first season together and {{were considered to be}} Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, Georgios Samaras was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes. In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role. This made it very hard for defenders to mark them.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{then headed}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes {{returned}} from injury, so Hassett {{returned to his}} customary position in the middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley’s men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon. With the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{in the middle of}} the bat and it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two hands to the ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.|$|E
5|$|Some uses {{of heavy}} metals, {{including}} in sport, mechanical engineering, military ordnance, and nuclear science, {{take advantage of}} their relatively high densities. In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, tungsten, brass, or copper inserts in fairway clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it easier to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into the air; and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics. In fly fishing, sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with tungsten powder, so that they sink at the required rate. In track and field sport, steel balls used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules. Tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. Tungsten hammers were so dense that they penetrated too deeply into the turf.|$|E

25|$|Skee ball is {{a common}} game found in arcades {{and one of the}} first {{redemption}} games.

25|$|A cutter is a fast {{ball that}} is spinning, that is, a {{delivery}} that is rotating around the opposite axis to the seam instead {{of keeping the}} seam straight.

25|$|BYU {{would start}} {{the second half}} with the ball but once again the Wisconsin defense would force a three–and–out. After a nice punt return by Kenzel Doe, the Badgers would start the drive at the Cougars 23-yard line. The BYU defense would hold the Badgers to a 26-yard field goal and giving Wisconsin a 20–3 lead. The Cougars would answer right back quick 6–play drive capped by a 34-yard {{touchdown}} pass to WR Cody Hoffman from QB Taysom Hill. A couple of stalled drive by both teams but Wisconsin would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at their own 8-yard line after a 73-yard punt by BYU and were moving the ball into BYU territory as their quarter came to an end. The Badgers would score just over a minute into the fourth quarter on a 14-yard touchdown run by James White giving the Badgers a 27–10 lead. The next four drive (two by each team) would all result in punts. BYU would score after a 9–play 57 yard drive capped by a 5-yard touchdown pass to Cody Hoffman from Taysom Hill. BYU then forced the Badgers to punt and the Cougars would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> back with 2:12 {{left in the game}} and down by 10 points.
