5|$|Shortly {{before her}} {{scheduled}} Missouri trial date, Kinne's Missouri counsel {{filed a motion}} to change the venue of any eventual fourth trial {{in the death of}} James Kinne, claiming that news coverage of Kinne's cases had so prejudiced residents of Jackson County against her that it would be impossible <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a fair trial there.|$|E
5|$|A sexual {{harassment}} lawsuit was filed against Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{in the previous}} episode, and she must take a {{sexual harassment}} training as a result. In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one of her neighbors, Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She understands how Liz feels because she was just like Liz and tells her there are better ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets {{so caught up in}} their lifestyle that she forgets to watch her show, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting to come back to work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane). She goes back to hanging out with Emily and her friends, but soon discovers that they are a Girl Fight Club, which disappoints Liz. In order <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out, Liz needs to fight them.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 Emily Blunt gave a more {{sympathetic}} portrayal of Catherine in the ITV television drama Henry VIII, {{which focused on}} Catherine's sexual escapades. This production, once again, explained her adultery by her relatives' desire <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> pregnant. It shows Catherine crying and screaming with fear at her execution, although contemporary accounts suggest she died in a more dignified manner.|$|E
500|$|For most of Bullock's shots, she {{was placed}} inside a giant, {{mechanical}} rig. Getting into the rig took {{a significant amount}} of time, so Bullock chose to stay in it for up to 10 hours a day, communicating with others through a headset. Costume Designer Jany Temime said the spacesuits were fictitious – [...] "no space suit opens up at the front – but we had to do that in order <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out. So I had to redesign it and readapt all the functions of the suit for front opening." ...|$|E
500|$|The backless {{evening gown}} that Sévérine is wearing {{when she first}} meets Bond was created from black satin and {{decorated}} {{with a total of}} 60,000 Swarovski crystals. The crystals were applied to tulle in a tattoo design that was directly inspired by prints from Swarovski's Paris atelier; they appear on the [...] "arms, neckline, back and sides" [...] of the garment. The dress took six months to complete. Temime designed it based on Rita Hayworth's black dress from the 1946 film Gilda. Designer Stephen Webster created the jewelry for the outfit by looking to modern Gothic style for inspiration. Marlohe said that she had an influence on the final design of the dress. It took a long time <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into it with help from the film's crew; she was sewn into one part of it. Despite this, she said she felt comfortable in it. Six different versions of the body of the dress were created to accommodate the filming schedule; Marlohe changed twice a day during the production, and had to be sewn back into the dress each time.|$|E

500|$|One {{scene that}} {{was cut from}} the film {{occurred}} during Ripley's final escape from the Nostromo: she encounters Dallas and Brett who have been partially cocooned by the Alien. O'Bannon had intended the scene to indicate that Brett was becoming an alien egg while Dallas was held nearby to be implanted by the resulting facehugger. Production Designer Michael Seymour later suggested that Dallas had [...] "become sort of food for the alien creature", while Ivor Powell suggested that [...] "Dallas {{is found in the}} ship as an egg, still alive." [...] Scott remarked that [...] "they're morphing, metamorphosing, they are changing into...being consumed, I guess, by whatever the Alien's organism is...into an egg." [...] The scene was cut partly because it did not look realistic enough, but also because it slowed the pace of the escape sequence. Tom Skerritt remarked that [...] "The picture had to have that pace. Her trying {{to get the hell out}} of there, we're all rooting <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of there, and for her to slow up and have a conversation with Dallas was not appropriate." [...] The footage was included with other deleted scenes as a special feature on the Laserdisc release of Alien, and a shortened version of it was re-inserted into the 2003 Director's Cut which was re-released in theaters and on DVD.|$|E
2500|$|Besides Konuma, Tani {{worked for}} many of the other most {{prominent}} Roman porno directors while at Nikkatsu. [...] "Violent pink" [...] director Yasuharu Hasebe commented, [...] "I regret that I only worked with her once... a very short scene at a greenhouse in Rape! The segment was only long enough <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> assaulted by the rapist." [...] Tani starred in director Kōyū Ohara's Nikkatsu Roman pornos, [...] (1977), Rope Hell (1978) and Fairy in a Cage (1977) which had Tani playing the role of a wealthy business woman who is tortured by the sadistic head of the inquisition branch of the Japanese military during World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{her arrival}} in Hollywood, Sale quickly {{discovered}} {{it was easier}} <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> character roles as older women. Even though {{she was still in}} her twenties, Sale would be cast as old women in many of the films she appeared in. Her career began at the very tail end of the silent film era, with her first film being in 1927's Legionnaires In Paris. [...] Her early career included roles in such classic films as Moby Dick (1930), starring John Barrymore, 1933's Oliver Twist, and Madame Du Barry (1934). During this period she met actor and studio executive Sam Wren, and the two were married in 1935. The following year she would give birth to fraternal twins, Virginia and Christopher.|$|E

2500|$|... "The second {{key to this}} song's Enormous Chart Success," [...] Pallett continues, [...] "has to do {{with the}} {{weighting}} of the melody lines." [...] Perry begins singing each verse on the beat ("you think I'm pretty ...") but then falls off it {{before the end of the}} first line ("... makeup on"), syncopating the melody, creating additional tension. [...] "Her lines dovetail elegantly into each other. This contributes to the feeling of suspension that I mentioned above. As listeners, we're waiting <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the point." [...] Pallett says she does indeed do this in the pre-chorus, when she accentuates the imperatives ("Let's go all the way tonight ...") by returning to the beat. Pallett than calls it [...] "genius" [...] that the chorus itself inverts the weighting of the verses, as the line [...] "You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream" [...] goes from off beat to on and then back again, in a single line.|$|E
2500|$|Ariel started [...] {{to raise}} her anchor at 5 am on the 29th and with the paddle steamer Island Queen towing alongside, headed down-river for the sea. The river pilot left and the tug was sent ahead to tow. The fast flowing River Min then {{presented}} problems for the under-powered tug as they met eddies and Ariel had to anchor {{to regain control of}} the situation. By this time it was low tide. With a mean draft of 18ft 5.5 ins., there was not enough water <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over the bar. [...] Captain Keay's frustration was increased by Fiery Cross, with a more powerful tug and drawing significantly less, towing past her and getting out to sea. Then the weather closed in: poor visibility preventing safe departure on the next tide. On the morning of the 30th Ariel finally got to sea, but with Taeping and Serica only a few minutes behind and Fiery Cross 14 hours ahead. In a final delay, Ariel could not leave her pilot on Island Queen, as the tug's boat capsized on launching (the boat crew eventually being rescued) - so a pilot boat had to be summoned.|$|E
2500|$|Davies {{had planned}} for the {{character}} to return in the fourth series finale since the episodes were first conceived and had asked Coduri to keep four weeks free for filming. In January 2008, whilst still writing the scripts, Davies became afraid {{that there was not}} space for the character. Her appearance was set to be reduced to a single scene at 'Bad Wolf Bay' at the end of [...] "Journey's End". He also was concerned that because the character has a young son it would not have made dramatic sense for her [...] "to enter a bloody battlezone." [...] Eventually, he decided to pair the character with Mickey and Sarah Jane and reasoned that seeking her daughter provided enough motivation <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved in the conflict. Returning to the series in 2008 for [...] "Journey's End", Coduri initially felt it was “weird” to be playing Jackie again. She describes Jackie as being “braver” in this episode but [...] frightened of [...] "losing Rose full stop." [...] When asked in 2011 whether she would return to the series, Coduri stated that she would return if asked but felt it was not likely because she had already [...] "been back to say goodbye at least twice" [...] and believes that the story has been wrapped up.|$|E

5|$|On 16 September, the day Lae fell, MacArthur {{ordered that}} Finschhafen be {{captured}} {{as soon as}} possible. The following day he held a conference at Port Moresby. He and Blamey selected the second contingency, a landing by a brigade of the 9th Division. Brigadier Victor Windeyer's 20th Infantry Brigade was chosen as it was still relatively fresh, and had experience with amphibious operations from the landing at Lae. The 6th Division's movement to New Guinea was postponed. Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey, {{the commander of the}} VII Amphibious Force, had originally counted on four weeks break between the fall of Lae and the Finschhafen operation. On 9 September, he had told Herring that it would require a minimum of ten days. Under pressure from MacArthur, Barbey cut that to three days. This was too soon <b>for</b> <b>Herring</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the troops together, and 21 September was selected as the target date. Herring briefed Windeyer on the operation on 18 September. Windeyer felt that the schedule was still too tight, and it was postponed one more day to 22 September.|$|R
