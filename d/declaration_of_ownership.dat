50|$|The {{declaration}} of the Lillooet Tribe was made in 1911 in Spences Bridge and is the nation's <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> over lands that had been seized by non-native settlers at Seton Portage at onset of the 20th century, and is considered a general statement of principle regarding ownership of all traditional territories of the St'at'imcets-speaking peoples. The Declaration of the Lillooet Tribe is the Lillooet Tribe's first formal declaration {{to the world of}} the tribes status as a Country, in International terms, as they understood them at that time. The Declaration is mentioned as the foundation document of all the various organizations of the Lillooet Tribe in place today, such as the St'at'imc Chiefs Council, Lillooet Tribal Council and the In-SHUCK-ch Nation. The Declaration brings the tribe together at the grassroots level as a Country.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{formation}} of the McCallum + Tarry partnership, McCallum produced several major solo works. Among the most notable is The Manhole Cover Project, a community-based public art project commissioned by the Wadsworth Atheneum and the Childhood Injury Prevention Center of Hartford, Connecticut. The artwork explored the unique role of the gun and gun violence in the history of Hartford, a city that is both the site for the original manufacturing plants of the Colt family and also experiences some of the highest rates of gun-related deaths in the United States. The project consists of 228 manhole covers cast from the melted metal of 11,194 guns confiscated by the Hartford police force from January 1, 1992 to July 31, 1996. McCallum emblazoned each manhole cover with the words “MADE FROM 172 LBS OF YOUR CONFISCATED GUNS” and the common epitaph “VINCIT QUI PATITUR,” which roughly translated can mean either “he who perseveres is victorious” or “he who suffers conquers.” The juxtaposition of the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> with the Latin phrase, which was also the Colt family motto, ironically contrasts Hartford’s collective responsibility for its gun violence with its history of gun manufacturing. The complete project, which included recordings of local student testimony, was curated by James Rondeau and installed at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.|$|E

Building on the surprising finding that legislative <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> state <b>ownership</b> have not resulted in greater regulatory control or other substantial restrictions on private use, this Article highlights a dimension of property rights design that has yet to receive concerted scholarly attention: the relative ease of future transitions— transitions both in ownership and in control mechanisms.

40|$|This thesis explores Romantic authors’ {{representations}} {{of books and}} bookishness. It argues that bibliocentric writing from {{the early nineteenth century}} addressed anxieties associated with the profession of authorship in a rapidly changing landscape of publication, print culture, and technology. However, the contested and heterogeneous nature of Romantic cultural production meant that the book was inevitably an unstable object through which to construct authorial identity. Examining the work of Thomas Frognall Dibdin, Leigh Hunt, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Lamb, Thomas De Quincey, Walter Scott and James Hogg, I chart the representation of bibliophilia across a range of genres, literary coteries, and social backgrounds. These writers, though in some respects disparate, can all be termed ‘bookish authors’: scholarly (or antiquarian), male, and, above all, concerned with the cultural significance of the book-as-object. Their writing is preoccupied with the ways in which books are owned by readers, writers, and publishers, and how their own <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> textual <b>ownership</b> – signatures, inscriptions, designations, attributions – function both publically and privately. Their work reveals the extent to which books were key determinants in the expression and realisation of the Romantic period self...|$|R

40|$|This article {{questions}} the common assumptions in legal theory regarding Derrida’s well-known <b>Declarations</b> <b>of</b> Independence. Through a close reading of this text, well-known ground {{such as the}} relation between speech and writing, the notion of representation, speech act theory, the signature, and the proper name is covered. The contribution that this analysis makes in the present context lies in the additional ‘step’ that it takes. The article seeks to give {{an explanation of the}} laws at work in Derrida’s thinking in the above respects and to explain more specifically how they find expression in <b>Declarations</b> <b>of</b> Independence. The article in this regard also investigates the importance and role of the ‘notions’ of death, loss of meaning, loss <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> and loss <b>of</b> sovereignty in Derrida’s thinking. The contention is that if we take account of Derrida’s reading in <b>Declarations</b> <b>of</b> Independence, it is possible to view constitutions in a very different way, more specifically their ‘origins’, with inevitable implications for constitutional interpretation...|$|R

40|$|Ownership type systems {{structure}} the heap and enforce {{restrictions on the}} behavior of a program. Benefits <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> type systems include simplified program verification, absence of race conditions and deadlocks, and enforcement of architectural styles. Dependent classes are a generalization of virtual class systems that allows one class to depend on multiple objects. Dependency is expressed by explicit <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the depended-upon objects as class parameters. This allows one to declare dependencies independently of the nesting of classes, which increases the expressive power and reduces the coupling between classes. In this paper, we describe how ownership type systems can be expressed on top of dependent classes.
