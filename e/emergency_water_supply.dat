50|$|Belgian {{authorities}} {{were worried about}} water shortages {{as a result of}} both the hot weather and lack of rain. The water authorities in the eastern town of Bullange warned that several water sources have dried up. The Belgian interior ministry said that three other communes in the southeast of the country have also appealed for <b>emergency</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies.</b>|$|R
2500|$|From the Fairfax Stone, the North Branch Potomac River flows [...] to the {{man-made}} Jennings Randolph Lake, an impoundment {{designed for}} flood control and <b>emergency</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply.</b> Below the dam, the North Branch cuts a serpentine {{path through the}} eastern Allegheny Mountains. First, it flows northeast by the communities of Bloomington, Luke, and Westernport in Maryland and then on by Keyser, West Virginia to Cumberland, Maryland. At Cumberland, the river turns southeast. [...] downstream from its source, the North Branch is joined by the South Branch between Green Spring and South Branch Depot, West Virginia from whence it flows past Hancock, Maryland and turns southeast once more on its way toward Washington, D.C., and the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
5000|$|In 1903 Sullivan {{proposed}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> {{system for the}} fire department to use water from one or more reservoirs to be constructed on the city's high peaks. Construction began in 1909, three years following the quaked.

50|$|The SDWA also {{contains}} provisions that require <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> to develop <b>emergency</b> plans, <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> operators to be licensed, and watersheds to be protected. The Act {{does not cover}} private wells.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} elements of water security is early and accurate contamination detection. The EPA has issued advisory material and guidelines for contamination warning systems to be implemented in <b>water</b> utilities and <b>supplies.</b> The security challenges that utilities frequently revolve around fast detection, accuracy, and the ability to take fast action when there is a water problem. If contamination is detected early enough, it can be prevented from reaching consumers, and <b>emergency</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> can be put into effect.|$|R
25|$|By the 1890s, mining {{development}} {{had increased}} {{to the point}} that there was a severe water shortage and the mines and the people fought for <b>water.</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> were shipped by rail from the Darling River. In 1891, the Stephens Creek Reservoir was completed by a private company. The cost of water was high but not excessive and people were willing to pay because the environment was arid. Another reservoir was built at Umberumberka, however variable rainfall meant supplemental supplies by rail and rationing was still needed.|$|R

40|$|When {{preparing}} for a disaster, {{it is important to}} provide for an adequate <b>supply</b> of <b>water</b> for drinking and cook-ing. In natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, or earthquakes, the municipal <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> is likely to be disrupted. Ice storms and other emergencies can cause a loss of electrical power, leaving well pumps unable to function. Planning for <b>Emergency</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Supplies</b> Each person in a household needs about 2 quarts of liq-uid per day for drinking and cooking. This can come from water for drinking as well as other liquids, such as juices or soft drinks. Additional clean water is needed for brushing teeth, bathing, washing utensils and dishes, and flushing toilets.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, a small pond was {{expanded}} to a 160 acre lake {{to serve as}} an <b>emergency</b> backup <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> for the station. The lake has always received its water from the Folsom South Canal and has no relationship with the power plant's daily <b>water</b> <b>supply.</b> Surrounding the lake is 400 acre of recreational area originally operated by the County of Sacramento for day-use activities.|$|R
25|$|Tokelau {{has very}} scarce water {{resources}} {{and because there}} are no fresh water surfaces on any of the atolls, it is solely dependent on rainwater as its source of fresh water. In recent years, climate change has resulted in much lower rain levels with drought periods lasting for much longer. This has made Tokelau along with many other islands in the Pacific struggle to conserve and store water for individual use. In the past, countries such as New Zealand and the United States have had to send <b>emergency</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> to Tokelau because it {{was on the verge of}} running out entirely. Sanitation facilities are also said to be poorly designed and wasting precious <b>supplies</b> of fresh <b>water</b> through the flushing system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{river is}} dammed in Richfield Township {{to form the}} Holloway Reservoir, which was formed in 1953 and fully {{completed}} 1955. The reservoir was constructed, originally, as a <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> for Flint, and to move the river through the city more quickly to dilute sewage. [...] By 1967, though, the city got its drinking water from Lake Huron through a pipeline from Detroit, and only used the reservoir as an <b>emergency</b> back-up <b>water</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Auxiliary Fire Service (AFS) in the Republic of Ireland is {{a branch}} of the {{national}} civil defence organisation.

Suddenly thrust into a man’s world as a teenager, she together with her mother and 5-year-old brother, faced the complexities of running a rural property - compounded by wartime rationing and a raging drought. Battling these elements, she learned many farm skills including killing and cutting up their own meat with Pat even learning to drive a Caterpillar type tractor to build a dam for part of their <b>emergency</b> <b>water</b> <b>supplies.</b> One of her heartbreaking jobs was the mercy killing of stock at death’s door from the results of the drought.|$|R
50|$|The area {{surrounding}} {{the park was}} operated by Sacramento County. In the early 1970s, the pond was expanded into a lake to act as backup <b>emergency</b> cooling <b>water</b> <b>supply.</b> In 1992, Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) took over responsibility for operating the park.
