5|$|Lem {{is one of}} {{the most}} highly {{acclaimed}} science <b>fiction</b> <b>writers,</b> hailed by critics as equal to such classic authors as H. G. Wells and Olaf Stapledon. In 1976, Theodore Sturgeon wrote that Lem was the most widely read science fiction writer in the world.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the book}} was popular and commercially successful, going through 20 editions. It {{was the basis for}} the graphic novel and film From Hell, as well as other dramatisations, and has {{influenced}} crime <b>fiction</b> <b>writers,</b> such as Patricia Cornwell and Anne Perry.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the civil war in 1983, a number of poets and <b>fiction</b> <b>writers</b> became active, {{focusing}} on subjects such as death, destruction, and rape. Such writings have no parallels in any previous Tamil literature. The war produced displaced Tamil writers around the globe who recorded their longing for their lost homes and the need for integration with mainstream communities in Europe and North America.|$|E

50|$|Edna Mayne Hull (May 1, 1905, - January 20, 1975) was {{a science}} <b>fiction</b> <b>writer</b> who {{published}} {{under the name}} E. Mayne Hull. She was the first wife of A. E. van Vogt, also a science <b>fiction</b> <b>writer.</b>|$|R
5|$|Several famous {{individuals}} {{became involved}} with Dianetics. Aldous Huxley received auditing from Hubbard himself; the poet Jean Toomer and the science <b>fiction</b> <b>writers</b> Theodore Sturgeon and A. E. van Vogt became trained Dianetics auditors. Van Vogt temporarily abandoned writing and became {{the head of the}} newly established Los Angeles branch of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation. Other branches were established in New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Honolulu.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch {{graphic artist}} M. C. Escher {{illustrated}} a rolling creature {{of his own}} invention in a 1951 lithograph. Rolling creatures are also featured in works written by comic author Carl Barks, science <b>fiction</b> <b>writers</b> Fredric Brown, George R. R. Martin, and Joan Slonczewski, and in the Sonic the Hedgehog video game series, which first appeared in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures {{featured}} in works by fantasy and science <b>fiction</b> <b>writers</b> including Clifford D. Simak, Piers Anthony, David Brin, K. A. Applegate, Philip Pullman, and Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen. Some of these works address the developmental and biomechanical constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from arthritic axles, and Pullman's Mulefa are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they coevolved.|$|E
50|$|Arrowhead is {{the name}} that science <b>fiction</b> <b>writer</b> James Blish and his wife, {{literary}} agent and science <b>fiction</b> <b>writer</b> Virginia Kidd, gave to their home in Milford, Pennsylvania.

5|$|Myst co-creators and {{brothers}} Rand and Robyn Miller often created fictional worlds and stories as young children. Their vision was refined by {{the works of}} fantasy and science <b>fiction</b> <b>writers</b> such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert A. Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov; Star Wars offered them a glimpse at an exciting, fully realized fictional world. Younger brother Robyn began working on a children's novel called Dunnyhut; though he never completed the work, elements from the story influenced aspects of Mysts story.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} major neo-noir films—the term often applied to films that {{consciously}} refer back to the classic noir tradition—was the French Tirez sur le pianiste (1960), directed by François Truffaut from a novel {{by one of the}} gloomiest of American noir <b>fiction</b> <b>writers,</b> David Goodis. Noir crime films and melodramas have been produced in many countries in the post-classic area. Some of these are quintessentially self-aware neo-noirs—for example, Il Conformista (1969; Italy), Der Amerikanische Freund (1977; Germany), The Element of Crime (1984; Denmark), As Tears Go By (1988; Hong Kong), and El Aura (2005; Argentina). Others simply share narrative elements and a version of the hardboiled sensibility associated with classic noir, such as The Castle of Sand (1974; Japan), Insomnia (1997; Norway), Croupier (1998; UK), Blind Shaft (2003; China), and The Square (2008; Australia).|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{greatest}} {{achievement was}} making India {{accessible to the}} outside world through his literature. He is {{regarded as one of the}} three leading English language Indian <b>fiction</b> <b>writers,</b> along with Raja Rao and Mulk Raj Anand. He gave his readers something to look forward to with Malgudi and its residents and is considered to be one of the best novelists India has ever produced. He brought small-town India to his audience in a manner that was both believable and experiential. Malgudi was not just a fictional town in India, but one teeming with characters, each with their own idiosyncrasies and attitudes, making the situation as familiar to the reader as if it were their own backyard. In 2014, Google commemorated Narayan's 108th birthday by featuring a doodle showing him behind a copy of Malgudi Days.|$|E

5|$|The impenetrable Venusian {{cloud cover}} gave science <b>fiction</b> <b>writers</b> free rein to {{speculate}} on conditions at its surface; {{all the more so}} when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different, and brought this particular genre to an end. As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, so science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.|$|E
5|$|Lem {{was awarded}} an honorary {{membership}} in the Science <b>Fiction</b> <b>Writers</b> of America (SFWA) in 1973. SFWA Honorary membership is given {{to people who do}} not meet the publishing criteria for joining the regular membership, but who would be welcomed as members had their work appeared in the qualifying English-language publications. Lem, however, never had a high opinion of American science fiction, describing it as ill-thought-out, poorly written, and interested more in making money than in ideas or new literary forms. After his eventual American publication, when he became eligible for regular membership, his honorary membership was rescinded, an action that some of the SFWA members apparently intended as a rebuke, and it seems that Lem interpreted it as such. Lem was invited to stay on with the organization with a regular membership, but declined. After many members (including Ursula K. Le Guin) protested against Lem's treatment by the SFWA, a member offered to pay his dues. Lem never accepted the offer.|$|E
5|$|Parsons' newfound {{credentials}} and financial security {{gave him the}} opportunity to travel more widely throughout the U.S. as an ambassador for Aerojet, meeting with other rocket enthusiasts. In New York he met with Karl Germer, the head of the O.T.O. in North America and in Washington, D.C. he met Poet Laureate Joseph Auslander, donating some of Crowley's poetry books to the Library of Congress. He also became a regular at the Mañana Literary Society, which met in Laurel Canyon at the home of Parsons' friend Robert A. Heinlein and included science <b>fiction</b> <b>writers</b> including Cleve Cartmill, Jack Williamson, and Anthony Boucher. Among Parsons' favorite works of fiction was Williamson's Darker Than You Think, a novelette published in the fantasy magazine Unknown in 1940, which inspired his later occult workings. Boucher used Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in his murder mystery Rocket to the Morgue (1942).|$|E

5|$|Stories for {{the show}} were often co-written by Burns, who also became a {{producer}} in the show's fourth season. Other writers include three acclaimed crime <b>fiction</b> <b>writers</b> from outside of Baltimore: George Pelecanos from Washington, Richard Price from the Bronx and Dennis Lehane from Boston. Reviewers drew comparisons between Price's works (particularly Clockers) and The Wire even before he joined. In addition to writing, Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season. Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because {{of the opportunity to}} work with Simon. Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes' scripts, as well as the series guidebook The Wire: Truth Be Told. Alvarez is a colleague of Simon's from The Baltimore Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area. Another city native and independent filmmaker, Joy Lusco, also wrote {{for the show}} in each of its first three seasons. Baltimore Sun writer and political journalist William F. Zorzi joined the writing staff in the third season and brought a wealth of experience to the show's examination of Baltimore politics.|$|E
5|$|Cohen had {{acquired}} reprint {{rights to the}} magazines' back issues, although Wrzos did get Cohen to agree to print one new story every issue. Cohen was also producing reprint magazines such as Great Science Fiction and Science Fiction Classics, but no payment was made to authors {{for any of these}} reprints. This brought Cohen into conflict with the Science <b>Fiction</b> <b>Writers</b> of America (SFWA), a professional writers' organization formed in 1965. Soon SFWA called for a boycott of Ultimate's magazines until Cohen agreed to make payments. Cohen agreed to pay a flat fee for all stories, and then in August 1967 this was changed to a graduated rate, depending on the length of the story. Harry Harrison had acted as an intermediary in Cohen's negotiations with SFWA, and when Wrzos left in 1967, Cohen asked Harrison to take over. SF Impulse, which Harrison had been editing, had folded in February 1967, so Harrison was available. He secured Cohen's agreement that the policy of printing almost nothing but reprinted stories would be phased out {{by the end of the}} year, and took over as editor with the September 1967 issue.|$|E
5|$|Amazing was published, {{with some}} interruptions, for almost eighty years, {{going through a}} half-dozen owners and many editors as it {{struggled}} to be profitable. Gernsback was forced into bankruptcy and {{lost control of the}} magazine in 1929, and by 1938 it was purchased by Ziff-Davis, who hired Raymond A. Palmer as editor. Palmer made the magazine successful though it was not regarded as a quality magazine within the science fiction community. In the late 1940s Amazing presented as fact stories about the Shaver Mystery, a lurid mythos that explained accidents and disaster as the work of robots named deros, which led to dramatically increased circulation but widespread ridicule. Amazing switched to a digest size format in 1953, shortly {{before the end of the}} pulp-magazine era. It was sold to Sol Cohen's Universal Publishing Company in 1965, which filled it with reprinted stories but did not pay a reprint fee to the authors, creating a conflict with the newly formed Science <b>Fiction</b> <b>Writers</b> of America. Ted White took over as editor in 1969, eliminated the reprints and made the magazine respected again: Amazing was nominated for the prestigious Hugo award three times during his tenure in the 1970s. Several other owners attempted to create a modern incarnation of the magazine in the following decades, but publication was suspended after the March 2005 issue. A new incarnation appeared in July 2012 as an online magazine.|$|E
