5|$|After Sorga Ka Toedjoe, Tan's Film {{produced}} a further four films, {{a much lower}} number than its competitors such as The Teng Chun's Java <b>Industrial</b> <b>Film</b> and its subsidiaries. Three of these productions starred Roekiah and Djoemala in the leading roles, and featured Kartolo. Landouw, according to JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue), did not make another film. Tan's was ultimately shut down in 1942, following the Japanese occupation of the Indies.|$|E
5|$|Fatima was {{a massive}} {{commercial}} hit, earning 200,000gulden on a 7,000gulden budget. Following the film's success, Tan's continued to cast Roekiah with Rd Mochtar. They became the colony's first on-screen celebrity couple and were termed the Indies' Charles Farrell–Janet Gaynor. The popularity of Roekiah–Rd Mochtar as a screen couple led other studios to follow with their own romantic pairings. The Teng Chun's Java <b>Industrial</b> <b>Film,</b> for instance, paired Mohamad Mochtar and Hadidjah in Alang-Alang (Grass, 1939).|$|E
5|$|SPFC hired Andjar Asmara, {{a former}} {{journalist}} and stagewriter {{who had been}} active with The Teng Chun's Java <b>Industrial</b> <b>Film</b> before the Japanese occupation, to direct Djaoeh Dimata; he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name. However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar {{was more of an}} acting and dialogue coach; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A. Denninghoff-Stelling, held more creative power over the final product. Max Tera served as assistant cinematographer on this black-and-white film.|$|E
5000|$|Technicolor for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Films</b> (1949) is a {{sponsored}} {{film about}} how Technicolor {{can be used}} in <b>industrial</b> <b>films.</b> The film features footage of various objects in Technicolor, showing how it {{can be used in}} filmmaking. One scene shows a bunch of everyday goods, first being shown in black-and-white, then in Technicolor.|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} written and {{directed}} by Tan Tjoei Hock for Action Film, a subsidiary of producer The Teng Chun's Java <b>Industrial</b> <b>Film</b> (JIF). Tan, who had made his directorial debut in 1940, based Srigala Item on the stories surrounding Johnston McCulley's fictional bandit Zorro; as with the American bandit, the Black Wolf used a whip and wore all black. The black-and-white film was shot by The Teng Chun's brother Teng Gan, with Hajopan Bajo Angin as artistic designer.|$|E
5|$|Following Panggilan Darah, Oriental– {{which had}} been losing money steadily– {{released}} its contract for the ANIF studio, which {{was taken over by}} the Dutch-run Multi Film. Despite hopes that they would continue producing narrative films, perhaps with less modern equipment, the company was dissolved. Oriental's actors and crew members migrated to different studios. Suska was signed to Java <b>Industrial</b> <b>Film</b> and directed a single film for them, Ratna Moetoe Manikam. Dhalia went to Populair's Film and acted in one production, Moestika dari Djemar (The Jewel of Djemar; 1942), before the Japanese occupation in March 1942 closed that studio. Soerip, meanwhile, joined Njoo and Young at Majestic Film, acting in two productions before that studio was closed.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Ouw Peh Tjoa allowed The Teng Chun to import new {{equipment}} for his studio (renamed Java <b>Industrial</b> <b>Film),</b> {{which he used}} in his future productions. The film was followed in 1936 by a sequel, Anaknja Siloeman Oeler Poeti (Child of the White Snake). The Teng Chun continued releasing films based on Chinese legends until 1937, a year after Albert Balink's Pareh changed domestic perceptions of profitable film storylines. The's later films adapted stories closer to the native populace of the Indies and focussing on events that could happen in day-to-day life. Through 1940 and 1941 Java Industrial Films was the most productive studio in the Indies, until it was shut down during the Japanese occupation which began in March 1942.|$|E

5|$|Unable {{to recoup}} its expenses, Oriental later merged into the Dutch-owned Multi Film and ceased {{producing}} works of fiction. Suska {{left the company}} and joined The Teng Chun's Java <b>Industrial</b> <b>Film,</b> for which he directed Ratna Moetoe Manikam. Most of the cast remained active in cinema {{for the remainder of}} their lives. Both Dhalia and Soerip remained in the film industry for the next fifty years; they acted in their last feature films, Pendekar Jagad Kelana (Warrior of Jagad Kelana) and Sejak Cinta Diciptakan (Since Love was Created) respectively, in 1990. Poniman and Sutinah would remain active in the industry until 1975 and 1986. Only Widjaja is not recorded as performing in any more films.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to the Indies, Andjar formed another {{theatrical}} troupe, Bolero, with Effendi, but left the troupe around 1940 to work at Kolf Publishers in Surabaya. Effendi was left as the head of Bolero, which then became more politicised. At Kolf Andjar edited the publisher's magazine Poestaka Timoer. As his work entailed writing synopses and serials based on popular films for Kolf's magazine, he became increasingly involved in the film industry. He was soon asked by The Teng Chun, with whom he had maintained a business relationship, to direct a film for his company Java <b>Industrial</b> <b>Film</b> (JIF); with this Andjar became one of several noted theatrical personnel who migrated to film following Albert Balink's 1937 hit Terang Boelan (Full Moon).|$|E
5|$|After leaving Dardanella in 1936, Andjar {{established}} his own troupe. He also {{worked at a}} publishers, writing serials based on successful films. In 1940 {{he was asked to}} join The Teng Chun's company, Java <b>Industrial</b> <b>Film,</b> helping with marketing and working as a director for two productions. After the Japanese occupation, during which time he stayed in theatre, Andjar made a brief return to cinema. He directed three films in the late 1940s and wrote four screenplays, which were produced as films in the early 1950s. He published a novel, Noesa Penida (1950). Afterward he worked for the remainder of his life writing serials based on local films and publishing film criticism. Historians recognise him as a pioneer of theatre {{and one of the first}} native Indonesian film directors, although he had little creative control of his productions.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, {{an article}} written by Harvey was {{published}} in an issue of American Cinematographer magazine, concerning innovative special effects techniques that had been developed by the Centron crew during the production of an <b>industrial</b> <b>film.</b> Harvey also occasionally penned reviews of local theater productions for the Lawrence newspaper. In 1957, Harvey commissioned {{the construction of a}} custom-built house within a block of the Centron studios. The resultant home was hailed regionally as an exceptional display of modern suburban architecture and attracted thousands of spectators when opened for public inspection upon its completion. The home's hillside yard was criss-crossed with a winding network of stone walls and terraces, built by Harvey himself.|$|E
500|$|Altogether Roekiah and Djoemala {{acted in}} four films in two years. Biran argues this is {{evidence}} the company [...] "wasted their treasure", as its competitors used their stars more often; Java <b>Industrial</b> <b>Film,</b> for instance, completed six films starring Moh. Mochtar in 1941 alone. Though Roekiah's films {{continued to be}} financial successes, they did not earn as large a profit as her earlier works.|$|E

When told to act like he is doing a newscast, Andy does a Tom Brokaw impersonation. Andy also says that if necessary he will go all-nude for the role in a [...] "full-on Lena Dunham", a reference to her skit at the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards. Darryl tells Andy that he was in a production of The Wiz in high school. Kevin mistakes Orville and Wilbur Wright—the credited inventors of the airplane—for [...] "Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher"—a brand of popcorn.

500|$|On March 12, 1929, {{the first}} feature-length talking picture made in Germany had its premiere. The inaugural Tobis Filmkunst production, {{it was not}} a drama, but a {{documentary}} sponsored by a shipping line: Melodie der Welt (Melody of the World), directed by Walter Ruttmann. This was also perhaps the first feature film anywhere to significantly explore the artistic possibilities of joining the motion picture with recorded sound. As described by scholar William Moritz, the movie is [...] "intricate, dynamic, fast-paced... juxtapos similar cultural habits from countries around the world, with a superb orchestral score... and many synchronized sound effects." [...] Composer Lou Lichtveld was among a number of contemporary artists struck by the film: [...] "Melodie der Welt became the first important sound documentary, the first in which musical and unmusical sounds were composed into a single unit and in which image and sound are controlled by one and the same impulse." [...] Melodie der Welt was a direct influence on the <b>industrial</b> <b>film</b> Philips Radio (1931), directed by Dutch avant-garde filmmaker Joris Ivens and scored by Lichtveld, who described its audiovisual aims: ...|$|E
2500|$|Advertising also grew {{significantly}} in the 1920s, growing from $25 million to $85 million over the decade. For example, the Wrigley Spearmint Gum sign, possibly the biggest electric sign [...] "in the world," [...] cost $9,000 per month to rent. Some contemporary critics, such as Thorstein Veblen and G.K.

2500|$|Romero {{embarked}} {{upon his}} career in the film industry while attending Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He directed and produced television commercials and industrial films for The Latent Image, in the 1960s, a company he co-founded with friends John Russo, and Russell Streiner. The trio grew bored making commercials and wanted to film a horror movie during this period. They wanted to capitalize on the film industry's [...] "thirst for the bizarre", according to Romero. He and Streiner contacted Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman, president and vice president respectively of a Pittsburgh-based <b>industrial</b> <b>film</b> firm called Hardman Associates, Inc. They pitched their idea for a then-untitled horror film. A production company, conceived by Romero, called Image Ten, was formed which included Romero, Russo, Streiner, Hardman and Eastman. The initial budget was $6,000 with the ten members of the production company, investing $600 each for a share of the profits. Another ten investors were found when it was found that another $6,000 was required but this was also soon found to be inadequate. Image Ten eventually raised approximately $114,000 for the budget.|$|E
