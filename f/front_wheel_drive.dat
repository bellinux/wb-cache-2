2500|$|By 1980, {{domestic}} {{luxury cars}} with a [...] wheelbase and gross weights averaging 4,500pounds (2,041kg) {{were no longer}} made. The automakers had begun phasing out the traditional <b>front</b> engine/rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> layout in compact cars in favor of lighter <b>front</b> engine/front <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> designs. A higher percentage of cars offered more efficient 4-cylinder engines. Domestic auto makers also began offering more fuel efficient diesel powered passenger cars as well.|$|R
25|$|Unlike its {{subsequent}} GM E platform stablemates, the Oldsmobile Toronado and Cadillac Eldorado, the Riviera was initially a standard front engine/rear-wheel drive platform, only becoming <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> starting in 1979 {{as part of}} a sweeping move in that direction by the American automobile industry.|$|E
25|$|The two {{fastback}} models (along {{with the}} Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon) proved unpopular, possibly {{because they did}} not appeal to Buick's older, more conservative customer base. With the introduction of the new <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> Century in 1982 (see below), the existing notchback sedan and wagon models were transferred to the Regal line.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover LRX – Land Rover's second concept vehicle, first {{unveiled}} at the 2008 Detroit Auto Show.

25|$|Fuel {{economy was}} notably {{improved}} for the 1986 Riviera, but {{the investment in}} the downsized, transverse engine <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> platform resulted in a substantial price increase, to $19,831 to the base model and $21,577 for the new T-Type. Downsizing also resulted in a dimensional similarity to smaller, less expensive offerings from GM, with shared styling cues reinforcing the unfortunate resemblance.|$|E
25|$|The Polo is {{a compact}} car, with a {{traditional}} transversely mounted engine and <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive.</b> Mark I Polos only came with four cylinder petrol engines, but for the Mark II, a diesel engine was offered for the first time, although only in certain markets, others having {{to wait until the}} launch of the Mark III. The current range includes a variety of three and four cylinder petrol and diesel engines.|$|E
25|$|Buick {{downsized}} the Riviera for 1977 {{onto the}} new smaller GM B platform. While the other E-bodies were <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> since 1966 (1967 for Cadillac's Eldorado), the Buick E platform used a B-body undercarriage (along with the cruciform frame of pre-1965 GMs for the 1966–70 generation). All B-bodies (including C and D platform GM RWDs) were downsized for the 1977 model year which prompted the short-lived 1977/78 generation.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} paraplegics and other individuals {{with little or}} no use of their legs, many manufacturers have designed and released hand-powered recumbent trikes, or handcycles. Handcycles are a regular sight at HPV meetings and are beginning to be seen on the streets. They usually follow a delta design with <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>driven</b> by standard dérailleur gearing powered by hand cranks. Brake levers are usually mounted on the hand holds, which are usually set with no offset rather than the 180° of pedal cranks. The entire crank assembly and the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> turn together, allowing the rider to steer and crank simultaneously.|$|R

25|$|The 1986 LeSabre was {{introduced}} {{on the new}} <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> H platform, after departing from rear wheel drive on the GM B platform. Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the Oldsmobile Delta 88 and the 1987 Pontiac Bonneville, which returned to full-size after a short-lived run as a mid-size on the G platform. One {{of the most striking}} features of the LeSabre version of the H-body was the hood was hinged towards the front instead of towards the back near the cowl and windshield in the same fashion as that of the Buick Electra and Chevrolet Corvette of that era.|$|E
25|$|The Chevrolet Chevy II/Nova {{was a small}} {{automobile}} {{manufactured by}} Chevrolet, and produced in five generations for the 1962 through 1979, and 1985 through 1988 model years. Nova was the top model in the Chevy II lineup through 1968. The Chevy II nameplate was dropped, Nova becoming the nameplate for the 1969 through 1979 models. Built on the X-body platform, the Nova {{was replaced by the}} 1980 Chevrolet Citation introduced in the spring of 1979. The Nova nameplate returned in 1985, produced through 1988 as a NUMMI manufactured, subcompact based on the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> Japan home-based Toyota Sprinter.|$|E
25|$|The Chrysler Concorde {{is a large}} four-door, full-size, <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> sedan {{that was}} {{produced}} by Chrysler from 1992 to 2004. It assumed the C-body Chrysler New Yorker's position as the entry-level full-size sedan in Chrysler's lineup. One of Chrysler's three original Chrysler LH platform models derived from the American Motors/Renault-designed Eagle Premier, it used revolutionary cab forward design. The Concorde {{was related to the}} Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, Chrysler 300M, Chrysler LHS, and the eleventh and final generation Chrysler New Yorker. It was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1993 and 1994.|$|E
50|$|The {{mainshaft}} extends {{outside the}} case in both directions: the input shaft towards the engine, and the output shaft towards the rear axle (on rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> cars. <b>Front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drives</b> generally have the engine and transmission mounted transversely, the differential {{being part of the}} transmission assembly.) The shaft is suspended by the main bearings, and is split towards the input end. At the point of the split, a pilot bearing holds the shafts together. The gears and clutches ride on the mainshaft, the gears being free to turn relative to the mainshaft except when engaged by the clutches.|$|R
50|$|Recumbent tadpole {{or reverse}} trike is a {{recumbent}} design with two steered <b>wheels</b> at the <b>front</b> and one <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> at the back, though one model has the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>driven</b> while {{the rear wheel}} steers. Steering is either through a single handlebar linked with tie rods to the front wheels' stub axle assemblies (indirect) or with two handlebars (rather, two half-handlebars) each bolted to a steerer tube, usually through a bicycle-type headset and connected to a stub axle assembly (direct). A single tie rod connects {{the left and right}} axle assemblies.|$|R

25|$|The {{first of}} the Trabants left the VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau factory in Saxony on 7 November 1957. It was a {{relatively}} advanced car when it was formally introduced the following year, with <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> unitary construction and independent suspension. The Trabant's greatest shortcoming was its engine. By the late 1950s many small Western cars (such as the Renault) had cleaner, more-efficient four-stroke engines, but budgetary constraints and raw-materials shortages mandated an outdated (but inexpensive) two-stroke engine in the Trabant. It was technically equivalent to the West German Lloyd automobile, a similarly sized car with an air-cooled, two-cylinder four-stroke engine. The Trabant had a front, transversely-mounted engine and front-wheel drive {{in an era when}} many European cars were using rear-mounted engines or front-mounted engines with rear-wheel drive. Its greatest drawback was its largely unchanged production; the car's two-stroke engine made it obsolete by the 1970s, limiting exports to Western Europe.|$|E
