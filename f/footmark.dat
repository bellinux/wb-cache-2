5|$|In the First Test of {{the series}} at Nottingham, Davidson removed Cowdrey before his ankle slipped in a <b>footmark</b> during the first innings and a bone was chipped. He was carried off with figures of 1/22 and his ankle plastered. The injury was such that {{he was unable to}} bat even with the {{assistance}} of a runner and was absent. This injury sidelined him until August.|$|E
6000|$|Then suddenly, {{beneath the}} {{disguise}} of the mess, {{he saw the}} clue. A <b>footmark!</b> No less. A crimson <b>footmark</b> on the gray concrete! ...|$|E
60|$|Then suddenly, {{beneath the}} {{disguise}} of the mess, {{he saw the}} clew. A <b>footmark!</b> No less. A crimson <b>footmark</b> on the polished wood! It was as clear and distinct {{as though it had}} been left there for the purpose of assisting him. It was a feminine <b>footmark,</b> the print of a slim and pointed shoe.|$|E

60|$|Paint. Red paint. Obviously {{the same}} paint with which Sammy had been decorated. A <b>footmark.</b> Whose <b>footmark?</b> Plainly {{that of the}} {{criminal}} who had done the deed of decoration.|$|E
60|$|The Sergeant {{pointed to}} the boot in the <b>footmark,</b> without saying a word.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse {{followed}} {{him with a}} dish-cloth, to wipe his large wet <b>footmarks</b> off the parlour floor.|$|R
60|$|WINSOR. He {{must have}} been {{followed}} here. [At the window] After rain like that, {{there ought to be}} <b>footmarks.</b>|$|R
60|$|They left a {{great many}} odd little <b>footmarks</b> all over the bed, {{especially}} little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.|$|R
60|$|He {{followed}} {{the hint of}} a <b>footmark,</b> and went back up the glen slowly and thoughtfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is your man, I fancy. I {{can give}} you his description, {{and we have a}} very {{excellent}} outline of his <b>footmark.</b> That should be enough for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hatteraick's genius here deserted him. 'Der deyvil!' {{he broke}} out, 'how {{could there be}} a <b>footmark</b> on the ground, when it was a frost as hard as the heart of a Memel log?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The bridge-gate is open. Tom hurries {{across the}} road to it. The lanthorn shows him fresh <b>footmarks</b> going into the meadow. Forward! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not try {{something}} cheaper first?" [...] growled Sam—"measurin’ <b>footmarks,</b> or over-’earing fellers talking? It’s just like you, cookie, doin’ expensive things." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{looked as}} though some person had been walking all over the garden {{in a pair of}} clogs--only the <b>footmarks</b> were too ridiculously little! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gleason's bull again, playin' Robin {{all over}} the Farm! Oh, look, Mus' Dan--his great <b>footmark</b> {{as big as a}} trencher. No bounds to his impidence! He might count himself to be a man or--or Somebody----' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jim see 'em, captain, plain enough. When dey all follow sheep, {{not very}} plain to see; but sometimes, when de sheep want to scatter, Jim see one <b>footmark</b> {{on one hand}} and one on the other, and sure to be one man behind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I have {{means of}} identification," [...] Captain Ripon said. [...] "There is a <b>footmark</b> in some earth, at the fowl house door. It {{is made by}} a boot which has got hobnails and a {{horseshoe}} heel, {{and a piece of}} that heel has been broken off.|$|E
60|$|When {{they stopped}} at a muddy pool the punt had gone, but there were fresh <b>footmarks</b> on the bank; and Jim set off again.|$|R
60|$|There was a broad, {{irregular}} smudge covering some {{yards of}} the track. Then {{there were a few}} <b>footmarks,</b> and the tire reappeared once more.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{downward}} {{from the}} steep hill's edge [...] They track'd the <b>footmarks</b> small; [...] And through the broken hawthorn-hedge, [...] And {{by the long}} stone-wall; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{hitherto}} confined my investigations to this world," [...] said he. [...] "In {{a modest}} way I have combated evil, {{but to take}} on the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the <b>footmark</b> is material." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leaping Horse can't say," [...] the Indian replied. [...] "Ground very hard, mark very small. No rain, trail keep fresh a long time. Only find mark twice." [...] He {{led them}} to a spot where, on the light dust among the rocks, was the slight {{impression}} of a <b>footmark.</b>|$|E
60|$|There were trodden places, {{bent and}} broken blades of the coarse grass, and ever {{and again the}} {{sufficient}} intimation of a <b>footmark.</b> And once the leader saw a brown smear of blood where the half-caste girl may have trod. And at that under his breath he cursed her for a fool.|$|E
6000|$|They follow'd {{from the}} snowy bank [...] The <b>footmarks,</b> one by one, [...] Into {{the middle of}} the plank, [...] And further there were none.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here {{they are}} at last!" [...] cried Ivo. [...] "I see the fresh <b>footmarks</b> of men, as well as horses. Push on, knights and men at-arms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. This is {{the point}} where we {{branched}} off. They have hesitated a moment, as you can see by their <b>footmarks,</b> and then they have followed on." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{examined}} the chips, {{which had been}} recently cut. [...] "It's not easy to make out footprints here," [...] said Ian, going {{down on his knees}} the better to observe the ground; [...] "and so many settlers and Indians pass from time to time, having little boys with them too, that--. I say, look here, Vic, this little <b>footmark</b> might or might not be Tony's, but moccasins are so much alike that--" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were two}} things, however, to be {{consider}}ed. Your careful detective must consider everything. In the first place, the paint {{might have been}} upset by the groundsman. It was the groundsman's paint. He had been giving a fresh coating to the woodwork {{in front of the}} pavilion scoring box at the conclusion of yesterday's match. (A labor of love which was the direct outcome of the enthusiasm for work which Adair had instilled into him.) In that case the <b>footmark</b> might be his.|$|E
60|$|Not {{long after}} Jimmy's visit to Kelshope, Margaret one evening rode {{up the trail}} from the station. Her cayuse carried a load of groceries, but when she set off her object was not {{altogether}} to bring home supplies. Wakening before daybreak, she imagined she heard the fence-rails rattle at the corner farthest from the house. Sometimes a deer jumped the fence, and when Margaret got up {{she went to the}} spot. She saw no tracks, but some time afterwards found a <b>footmark</b> where the trail left the clearing. The mark was fresh and she thought it was not made by her father's boot.|$|E
60|$|Next day I went early, {{and he had}} gone, {{and there}} were human <b>footmarks</b> and ugly stains round the muddy hole from {{which he had been}} dragged.|$|R
6000|$|... "They rushed {{round and}} saw my new <b>footmarks</b> flash into {{being on the}} lower step and upon the pavement. 'What's up?' asked someone. 'Feet! Look! Feet running!' ...|$|R
60|$|Then of {{a sudden}} he began to examine the ground. It was soft in spots and plainly showed the <b>footmarks</b> of Jerry and the Si Peters' crowd.|$|R
