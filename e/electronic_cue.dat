40|$|In {{the present}} article, we {{introduce}} the continuous unified <b>electronic</b> (<b>CUE)</b> diary method, a longitudinal, event-based, electronic parent report method that allows real-time recording of infant and child behavior in natural contexts. Thirty-nine expectant mothers {{were trained to}} identify and record target behaviors into programmed handheld computers. From birth to 18 months, maternal reporters recorded the initial, second, and third occurrences of seven target motor behaviors: palmar grasp, rolls from side to back, reaching when sitting, pincer grip, crawling, walking, and climbing stairs. Compliance was assessed as two valid entries per behavior: 97 % of maternal reporters met compliance criteria. Reliability was assessed by comparing diary entries with researcher assessments for three of the motor behaviors: palmar grasp, pincer grip and walking. A total of 81 % of maternal reporters met reliability criteria. For those three target behaviors, age of emergence was compared across data from the CUE diary method and researcher assessments. The CUE diary method was found to detect behaviors earlier and with greater sensitivity to individual differences. The CUE diary method is {{shown to be a}} reliable methodological tool for studying processes of change in human development...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to extend the {{understanding}} of early communication development through the design and implementation of methods, which enable close examination of developmental change as it happens. I pose that meaningful distinctions of infant’s attentional abilities, and preferences, in the early period of infancy are necessary and valuable for understanding the ontogeny of communication. Chapter 2 describes the First Steps longitudinal study, where the work of this thesis took place. Chapter 3 describes an adaptation to a coding scheme that allows for new advances in understanding of early infant’s attention abilities and preferences for social and non-social stimuli. Results show that by 2 -months infants demonstrate group levels of engagement, as well as notable individual differences in time spent attending to mother’s faces and hand actions. Chapter 4 further demonstrates {{the value of the}} methodological adaptation described in Chapter 3, by assessing the predictive power individual differences shown in attention at 2 -months hold for the emergence of social attention at 5 -months. Results show that individual differences in infant attention to the social stimuli of faces and hands, demonstrated at 2 months with the adapted engagement coding scheme, differentially predict the social attention skills of attention following. Chapter 5 further extends the relations found in Chapter 4, by examining the relation between point following {{at the end of the}} first year and the proclivity to attend to hands, during interactions, at 18 - months. Results show infants’ point following performance at 12 -months predicts later durations of attention to hands, while playing with mothers at 18 - months. In this thesis I argue that infant communication development cannot be understood from examining one domain, as infant’s employ multiple domains in the journey to communication. Secondly I argue that detailed observations following a multi-domain approach, offer significant potential for understanding communicative development. Chapter 6 details the design, application and assessment of the continuous unified <b>electronic</b> (<b>CUE)</b> diary method. Results show that the CUE diary method is reliable and valid method for the study of infant development. Chapter 7 utilizes the CUE diary method to examine whether the emergence of independent walking predicts later productive vocabulary. Results show that walking is a unique gross motor predictor of later vocabulary. Further, when entered into a predictive model for language, walking and pointing deliver independent predictive power, with walking demonstrating as strong an association as pointing. Taken together, these observational, experimental, parent-report and electronic diary methods demonstrate the advances in understanding communicative development that can be made when sensitive methods are applied across periods and domains of developmental change...|$|E

He also worked with composer Dominic Muldowney and the BBC Symphony Orchestra in devising the <b>electronic</b> <b>cueing</b> system for the première of Three Pieces for Orchestra. With the Opera24 company, he conducted Così fan Tutte for the 2013 Grimeborn festival, as well as the revival of that production this year.|$|R
500|$|Chosen {{to provide}} the score for Quatermass and the Pit was Tristram Cary. He {{developed}} an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including The Ladykillers (1955). He said of his assignment, “I was not mad about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of electronic material {{and a great deal}} of orchestral music. But I had three kids, all of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed every penny I could get!”. Cary also recalled that, “The main use of electronics in Quatermass, I think, was the violent shaking, vibrating sound that the [...] "thing in the tunnel" [...] gave off [...] It was not a terribly challenging sound to do, though I never played it very loud because I didn't want to destroy my speakers – I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened”. Carey went on to write the score for another Hammer film, Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, in 1971. Several orchestral and <b>electronic</b> <b>cues</b> from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|R
5000|$|To {{compose the}} score for Arrow, {{executive}} producer Greg Berlanti invited Blake Neely, {{with whom he}} had first worked with on Everwood, Neely created a score that combined <b>electronic</b> and orchestral <b>cues,</b> varying between action themes and romantic ones. Berlanti told Neely the series would be dark, and the music should be as well. After reading the pilot script, Neely went away to start composing on his own. According to Neely, [...] "Of course, Oliver has his main theme but also sub-themes for the many layers of his character. He and Laurel have a love theme. Mom had a theme for the Undertaking. The bad guys all have themes, which makes it sad for me when one of them dies. So I try not to become attached to bad guy themes. Diggle has a theme. Even the Island itself has a theme." [...] The soundtrack was released on September 17, 2013. It was composed by Blake Neely.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effect of interruptions and task {{complexity}} on error rates when prescribing with computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems, and to categorize the types of prescribing errors. Design: Two within-subject factors: task complexity (complex vs simple) and interruption (interruption vs no interruption). Thirty-two hospital doctors used a CPOE system in a computer laboratory to complete four prescribing tasks, half of which were interrupted using a counterbalanced design. Measurements: Types of prescribing errors, error rate, resumption lag, and task completion time. Results: Errors in creating and updating electronic medication charts that were measured included failure to enter allergy information; selection of incorrect medication, dose, route, formulation, or frequency of administration from lists and drop-down menus presented by the CPOE system; incorrect entry or omission in entering administration times, start date, and free-text qualifiers; and omissions in prescribing and ceasing medications. When errors occurred, the error rates across the four prescribing tasks ranged from 0. 5 % (1 incorrect medication selected out of 192 chances for selecting a medication or error opportunities) to 16 % (5 failures to enter allergy information out of 32 error opportunities). Any impact of interruptions on prescribing error rates and task completion times was not detected in our experiment. However, complex tasks took significantly longer to complete (F(1, 27) = 137. 9; p< 0. 001) and when execution was interrupted they required almost three times longer to resume compared to simple tasks (resumption lag complex= 9. 6 seconds, SD= 5. 6; resumption lag simple= 3. 4 seconds, SD= 1. 7; t(28) = 6. 186; p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Most electronic prescribing errors found in this study could be described as slips in using the CPOE system to create and update <b>electronic</b> medication charts. <b>Cues</b> available within the user interface may have aided resumption of interrupted tasks making CPOE systems robust to some interruption effects. Further experiments are required to rule out any effect interruption might have on CPOE error rates. 9 page(s...|$|R
