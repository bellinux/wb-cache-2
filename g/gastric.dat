5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. Inflammation of the pyloric antrum {{is more likely to}} lead to duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to <b>gastric</b> ulcers and <b>gastric</b> carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces <b>gastric</b> cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for <b>gastric</b> cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E

5|$|The stomach {{produces}} <b>gastric</b> acid, {{a strongly}} acidic mixture consisting of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium and sodium salts to enable food digestion. Constriction {{of the upper}} and lower esophageal sphincters help to prevent reflux (backflow) of <b>gastric</b> contents and acid into the esophagus, protecting the esophageal mucosa. In addition, the acute angle of His and the lower crura of the diaphragm helps this sphincteric action.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that in obese people, bariatric surgery (and {{especially}} <b>gastric</b> bypass surgery) can lead to resolution of the condition in over 95%.|$|E
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left <b>gastric</b> artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left <b>gastric</b> vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left <b>gastric</b> vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the <b>gastric</b> and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary care {{consists}} of <b>gastric</b> decontamination with either activated carbon or <b>gastric</b> lavage. However, {{due to the}} delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment long after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation.|$|E

25|$|Treatment of a {{recently}} ingested poison may involve <b>gastric</b> decontamination to decrease absorption. <b>Gastric</b> decontamination can involve activated charcoal, <b>gastric</b> lavage, whole bowel irrigation, or nasogastric aspiration. Routine use of emetics (syrup of Ipecac), cathartics or laxatives {{are no longer}} recommended.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastric</b> {{dilation}} is {{also known}} as bloat; may progressive to <b>gastric</b> dilatation volvulus (GDV), in which the stomach twists on itself.|$|E
25|$|Gastroscopy, or {{endoscopic}} {{evaluation of}} the stomach, is useful in chronic cases of colic suspected {{to be caused by}} <b>gastric</b> ulcers, <b>gastric</b> impactions, and <b>gastric</b> masses. A 3-meter scope is required to visualize the stomach of most horses, and the horse must be fasted prior to scoping.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major cause}} {{is the use}} of NSAIDs, such as {{ibuprofen}} and aspirin. The <b>gastric</b> mucosa protects itself from <b>gastric</b> acid with a layer of mucus, the secretion of which is stimulated by certain prostaglandins. NSAIDs block the function of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), which is essential for the production of these prostaglandins. COX-2 selective anti-inflammatories (such as celecoxib or the since withdrawn rofecoxib) preferentially inhibit COX-2, which is less essential in the <b>gastric</b> mucosa, and roughly halve the risk of NSAID-related <b>gastric</b> ulceration.|$|E
25|$|Recurrence of <b>gastric</b> dilatation-volvulus attacks {{can be a}} problem, {{occurring}} in up to 80 percent of dogs treated medically only (without surgery). To prevent recurrence, {{at the same time}} the bloat is treated surgically, a right-side gastropexy is often performed, which by a variety of methods firmly attaches the stomach wall to the body wall, to prevent it from twisting inside the abdominal cavity in the future. While dogs that have had gastropexies still may develop gas distension of the stomach, there is a significant reduction in recurrence of <b>gastric</b> volvulus. One study showed that out of 136 dogs that had surgery for <b>gastric</b> dilatation-volvulus, 4.3 percent of those that did have gastropexies had a recurrence, while 54.5 percent of those without the additional surgery recurred. Gastropexies are also performed prophylactically in dogs considered to be at high risk of <b>gastric</b> dilatation-volvulus, including dogs with previous episodes of <b>gastric</b> dilatation-volvulus or with gastrointestinal disease predisposing to <b>gastric</b> dilatation-volvulus, and dogs with a first-order relative (parent or sibling) with a history of <b>gastric</b> dilatation-volvulus.|$|E
25|$|After {{night time}} {{administration}} of bromazepam a highly significant reduction of <b>gastric</b> acid secretion occurs during sleep {{followed by a}} highly significant rebound in <b>gastric</b> acid production the following day.|$|E

25|$|Parasitic infection, {{especially}} with threadworms (Strongyloides westeri) and ascarids (Parascaris equorum) can produce signs of colic in foals (See Ascarids). Other conditions {{that may lead}} to signs of colic in foals include congenital abnormalities, <b>gastric</b> ulcers (see <b>Gastric</b> ulceration), which may lead to <b>gastric</b> perforation and peritonitis, small intestine volvulus, and uroabdomen secondary to urinary bladder rupture.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gastric</b> outlet {{obstruction}} is a {{narrowing of}} the pyloric canal by scarring and {{swelling of the}} <b>gastric</b> antrum and duodenum due to peptic ulcers. The person often presents with severe vomiting without bile.|$|E
25|$|Chlorpromazine is an {{antagonist}} to H1 receptors (provoking antiallergic effects), H2 receptors (reduction {{of forming}} of <b>gastric</b> juice), M1 and M2 receptors (dry mouth, reduction in forming of <b>gastric</b> juice) and some 5-HT receptors (different anti-allergic/gastrointestinal actions).|$|E
25|$|Kcne2-/- mice exhibit achlorhydria, <b>gastric</b> hyperplasia, and mis-trafficking of KCNQ1 to the parietal cell basal membrane. The mis-trafficking {{occurs because}} KCNE3 is {{upregulated}} in the parietal cells of Kcne2-/- mice, and hijacks KCNQ1, {{taking it to}} the basolateral membrane. When both Kcne2 and Kcne3 are germline-deleted in mice, KCNQ1 traffics to the parietal cell apical membrane but the <b>gastric</b> phenotype is even worse than for Kcne2-/- mice, emphasizing that KCNQ1 requires KCNE2 co-assembly for functional attributes other than targeting in parietal cells. Kcne2-/- mice also develop gastritis cystica profunda and <b>gastric</b> neoplasia. Human KCNE2 downregulation is also observed in sites of gastritis cystica profunda and <b>gastric</b> adenocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) {{block the}} <b>gastric</b> {{hydrogen}} potassium ATPase (H+/K+ ATPase) and inhibit <b>gastric</b> acid secretion. These drugs {{have emerged as}} the treatment of choice for acid-related diseases, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B12 {{requires}} {{intrinsic factor}} from the <b>gastric</b> mucosa to be absorbed. In {{patients with a}} small <b>gastric</b> pouch, {{it may not be}} absorbed, even if supplemented orally, and deficiencies can result in pernicious anemia and neuropathies. Vitamin B12 deficiency is quite common after <b>gastric</b> bypass surgery with reported rates of 30% in some clinical trials. Sublingual B12 (cyanocobalamin) appears to be adequately absorbed. In cases where sublingual B12 does not provide sufficient amounts, injections may be needed.|$|E
25|$|Pertechnetate is {{actively}} accumulated and secreted by the mucoid {{cells of the}} <b>gastric</b> mucosa, and therefore, technetate(VII) radiolabeled with Tc99m is injected into the body when looking for ectopic <b>gastric</b> tissue as is found in a Meckel's diverticulum with Meckel's Scans.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{the effect}} of tenatoprazole on acid {{secretion}} in in vivo animal models, such as pylorus-ligated rats and acute <b>gastric</b> fistula rats, demonstrated a 2- to 4-fold more potent inhibitory activity compared with omeprazole. A more potent inhibitory activity was also shown in several models of induced <b>gastric</b> lesions.,K+-ATPase Inhibitor, on <b>Gastric</b> Acid Secretion in Dogs |year=1999 |last1=Uchiyama |first1=K. |last2=Wakatsuki |first2=D. |last3=Kakinoki |first3=B. |last4=Takeuchi |first4=Y. |last5=Araki |first5=T. |last6=Morinaka |first6=Y. |journal=Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=457–64 |pmid=10385219}} In Asian as well as Caucasian healthy subjects, tenatoprazole exhibited a seven-fold longer half-life than the existing H+/K+ ATPase inhibitors. It is thus hypothesized that a longer half-life results in a more prolonged inhibition of <b>gastric</b> acid secretion, especially during the night.|$|E
25|$|Misoprostol is {{used for}} the {{prevention}} of NSAID-induced <b>gastric</b> ulcers. It acts upon <b>gastric</b> parietal cells, inhibiting the secretion of <b>gastric</b> acid by G-protein coupled receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase, which leads to decreased intracellular cyclic AMP levels and decreased proton pump activity at the apical surface of the parietal cell. Because other classes of drugs, especially H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, are more effective for the treatment of acute peptic ulcers, misoprostol is only indicated for use by people who are both taking NSAIDs and are at high risk for NSAID-induced ulcers, including the elderly and people with ulcer complications. Misoprostol is sometimes coprescribed with NSAIDs to prevent their common adverse effect of <b>gastric</b> ulceration (e.g. with diclofenac in Arthrotec).|$|E
25|$|The <b>gastric</b> outlet {{obstruction}} {{due to the}} hypertrophic pylorus impairs emptying of <b>gastric</b> contents {{into the}} duodenum. As a consequence, all ingested food and <b>gastric</b> secretions can only exit via vomiting, which can be of a projectile nature. While the exact cause of the hypertrophy remains unknown, one study suggested that neonatal hyperacidity {{may be involved in}} the pathogenesis. This physiological explanation for the development of clinical pyloric stenosis at around 4 weeks and its spontaneous long term cure without surgery if treated conservatively, has recently been further reviewed.|$|E
