500|$|When {{filling a}} new or {{unfamiliar}} mould {{for the first}} time, where shot size for that mould is unknown, a technician/tool setter may perform a trial run before a full production run. They start with a small shot weight and fills gradually until the mould is 95 to 99% full. Once this is achieved, {{a small amount of}} holding pressure will be applied and holding time increased until gate freeze off (solidification time) has occurred. Gate freeze off time can be determined by increasing the <b>hold</b> <b>time,</b> and then weighing the part. When the weight of the part does not change, it is then known that the gate has frozen and no more material is injected into the part.

50|$|Important {{parameters}} {{like the}} carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I), spectral efficiency and reuse distance determine {{the quality of}} service of a cellular network.

Calculating the channel <b>holding</b> <b>time,</b> however is not easy. (This is the time a Mobile Station (MS) remains in the same cell duringa call).

40|$|Abstract—In a {{personal}} communication service (PCS) network, the call completion probability and the effective call <b>holding</b> <b>times</b> for both complete and incomplete calls are central parameters {{in the network}} cost/performance evaluation. These quantities {{will depend on the}} distributions of call <b>holding</b> <b>times</b> and cell residence times. The classical assumptions made in the past that call <b>holding</b> <b>times</b> and cell residence times are exponentially distributed are not appropriate for the emerging PCS networks. This paper presents some systematic results on the probability of call completion and the effective call <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> distributions for complete and incomplete calls with general cell residence <b>times</b> and call <b>holding</b> <b>times</b> distributed with various distributions such as Gamma, Erlang, hyperexponential, hyper-Erlang, and other staged distributions. These results provide a set of alternatives for PCS network modeling, which can be chosen to accommodate the measured data from PCS field trials.
