50|$|A {{hydraulic}} hammer {{is a modern}} type of piling hammer used in place of diesel and air hammers for driving steel pipe, precast concrete, and timber piles. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>hammers</b> are more environmentally acceptable than the older, less efficient hammers as they generate less noise and pollutants. However, {{in many cases the}} dominant noise is caused by the impact of the hammer on the pile, or the impacts between components of the hammer, so that the resulting noise level can be very similar to diesel hammers.|$|E

To {{improve the}} {{regulating}} characteristics of impact energy, simplify structure of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammer,</b> a new pulse modulation <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammer</b> {{is presented in}} the paper which can help regulate its impact frequency easily. The motion equations of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammer</b> are established, its simulation model is obtained and the dynamic simulation is carried out on AMESim. The dynamics of high-speed ON/OFF valve is taken into account in the simulation model.

For tall concrete buildings, where neither explosive or high reach demolition with an excavator is safe or practical, the [...] "inside-out" [...] method is used, whereby remotely operated mini-excavators demolish the building from the inside, whilst maintaining the outer walls of the building as a scaffolding, as each floor is demolished.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} ways to place piles for a deep foundation. They can be driven, drilled, or {{installed}} {{by use of}} an auger. Driven piles are extended to their necessary depths with the application of external energy {{in the same way}} a nail is hammered. There are four typical hammers used to drive such piles: drop hammers, diesel hammers, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammers,</b> and air hammers. Drop hammers simply drop a heavy weight onto the pile to drive it, while diesel hammers use a single cylinder diesel engine to force piles through the Earth. Similarly, hydraulic and air hammers supply energy to piles through hydraulic and air forces. Energy imparted from a hammer head varies with type of hammer chosen, and can be as high as a million foot pounds for large scale diesel hammers, a very common hammer head used in practice. Piles are made of a variety of material including steel, timber, and concrete. Drilled piles are created by first drilling a hole to the appropriate depth, and filling it with concrete. Drilled piles can typically carry more load than driven piles, simply due to a larger diameter pile. The auger method of pile installation is similar to drilled pile installation, but concrete is pumped into the hole as the auger is being removed.|$|E

40|$|Due to some {{drawbacks}} {{of conventional}} drilling methods and drilling tools, {{the application of}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammers</b> with a fluidic amplifier have been extensively popularized since its emergence in recent years. However, the performance life of a fluidic amplifier is still unsatisfactory in oil and gas wells drilling, especially the heavy wear or erosion of the fluidic amplifier leads to the reduction of service life time of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammers,</b> which {{is derived from the}} incision of drilling muds with high speed and pressure. In order to investigate the influence of drilling muds, such as particle size, solid content and jet velocity, on the antierosion property of a fluidic amplifier, several groups of drilling muds with different performance parameters have been utilized to numerical simulation on basis of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Simulation results have shown that the jet nozzle of fluidic amplifiers is primarily abraded, afterwards are the lateral plates and the wedge of the fluidic amplifier, which shows extraordinary agreement with the actual cases of fluidic amplifier in drilling process. It can be concluded that particle size, solid content and jet velocity have a great influence on the anti-erosion property of a fluidic amplifier, and the erosion rate linearly varies with the particle size of drilling muds, nevertheless exponentially varies with solid content and jet velocity of drilling muds. As to improve the service life time of a fluidic amplifier, the mud purification system or low solid clay-free mud system is suggested in the operation of directional well drillin...|$|E

40|$|The {{operation}} {{and in particular}} the construction of offshore wind converters induce considerable underwater noise emissions.

40|$|Modern <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammers</b> {{are usually}} {{equipped}} with on-board energy measurement devices. Energy measurements {{in the field}} can therefore be taken continuously during entire pile driving processes. This paper outlines a method that directly uses energy measurements from the field for quantitative pile driving process monitoring. The kinetic energy delivered over one meter of pile penetration (KEMP) and the effective transferred energy delivered over one meter of pile penetration (EEMP) against soil resistance are calculated based on field measurements and are used as two indicators for pile driving process monitoring. The relationship between the EEMP and the pile capacity is confirmed by dynamic tests and static load tests on several well-monitored long steel H-piles. The EEMP values compare well with pile capacity predictions from a pile driving analyzer and from static analyses based on standard penetration tests, and with those measured from static load tests. The two energy indicators {{can also be used}} to effectively monitor the integrity of piles during construction. Potential pile damage caused by obstructions is illustrated by interpreting the KEMP and EEMP records of three abandoned long steel H-piles...|$|E

However, the service {{life of a}} hydraulic hammer is still unsatisfactory due to the heavy wear or abrasion of the horizontal anvil, {{which leads to the}} failure and the reduction of service life in directional well drilling.

Simulation and experimental results have shown that the abrasion rate exponentially varies with the mass of the anvil and the friction coefficient of horizontal oriented slider, nevertheless the abrasion rate of horizontal anvil is almost logarithmically varies with moving velocity of oriented slider. The maximum abrasion rate of horizontal oriented sliders will exceed 4 % while moving velocity of the horizontal anvil is larger than 3 m/s. While the mass of the anvil is 100 kg, the maximum abrasion rate of horizontal oriented slider is 7. 5 ?.

40|$|The paper refers on {{the results}} of a data {{collection}} on workplace environmental conditions at the faces of some Italian tunnels, where the primary drifting is carried out by means of High Energy <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Hammers</b> (H. E. H. H.). Thanks to the substantial improvements in the machine size and efficiency, the use of H. E. H. H. has dramatically grown since some years in Italy, mainly due to the quite stringent Italian regulations on the use and transportation of explosives: as a consequence the blasting techniques can sometimes prove uneconomical. But at the work places some problems arise, mainly due to the exposure conditions of the workers to noise and airborne particulates, since, to win the same quantity of rock won by traditional drilling and blasting techniques, the H. E. H. H. machine must work longer than a multiple arm boomer. Moreover, it is a common practice to carry on the mucking operations together with the H. E. H. H. machine working. As a consequence, the resulting overall environmental pollution at the face can rise to concerning values.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{hydraulic}} pile driving hammers to overcome energy losses during freefall enables {{a greater proportion}} of the impact energy to be transferred to the pile in comparison to diesel hammers. This percentage, termed the energy transfer ratio, is not routinely measured in practice however, and {{there is an element of}} uncertainty regarding appropriate energy transfer ratios to assume in driveability analyses. In light of such uncertainties, the energy transfer ratios of four- and five-tonne <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammers</b> were assessed during installation of driven cast-in-situ piles at several sites in the United Kingdom. The piling rigs were fitted with instrumentation which enabled measurement of the hammer velocity (and hence kinetic energy) at impact for each blow during installation, with the corresponding magnitude of energy transferred to the closed-ended steel installation tube ascertained using a Pile Driving Analyser. The results of the study showed that energy transfer ratios were strongly dependent on the hammer drop height, with transfer ratios of 95 % advocated by the pile hammer manufacturer only achievable when a drop height in excess of about 600 mm was used. As such, lower energy transfer ratios may need to be considered in driveability predictions for these pile types (i. e. steel or DCIS piles) if lower drop heights are used during driving. Further research is required to substantiate limited data suggesting that soil type may also be influential...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{amount of}} energy {{transfer}} from the hammer to the casing is a critical consideration for assessing of the constructability of the required length and diameter of pipe with a given hammer. Due to various contractor-selected pipe-hammer connections and natural sources of energy loss (e. g., thermal, frictional, etc.), the energy transfer efficiency of pipe ramming hammers must be less than 100 percent; however, actual hammer- pipe energy transfer efficiencies, defined as the ratio of actual energy transferred to the rated hammer energy, have not been reported to-date. Overestimates of hammer- pipe energy transfer could result in corresponding overestimates of driving stresses and penetration rates; likewise, over-estimates of driving stress could lead to excessive and uneconomical wall thickness. This study focuses on the characterization of hammer- pipe energy transfer efficiencies for commonly used pneumatic and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammers</b> observed during production and test pipe ramming installations. The observed energy transfer was found {{to depend on the}} type of hammer, the hammer-pipe connection (e. g., collets vs. ram cones), the hammer alignment, and the degree of tension on restraining chains. Observations of energy transfer indicate that hammer efficiency can vary widely; average observed efficiencies ranged from 20 to 50 percent. Additionally, a parametric study on pipe drivability is presented, and confirmed the importance of energy transfer on the rate of pipe penetration. The characterization of pipe-hammer energy transfer provided herein can form the basis for a rational evaluation of pipe drivability for a given hammer and pipe geometry, and can help owners, engineers, consultants, and contractors determine the likelihood of a successful casing installation...|$|E
