5|$|Final Fantasy XI has {{additions}} released <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> Expansion packs add new story, jobs, zones, quests, {{and content}} to the game, while add-ons are smaller in scale, adding a smaller {{selection of the}} aforementioned items. All of the expansions and add-ons have been released on PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows, and Xbox 360, {{with the exception of}} Seekers of Adoulin, which did not see a PlayStation 2 release outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|The late 19th century carvings of Roman Emperors and Governors of Roman Britain on {{the terrace}} {{overlooking}} the Great Bath are particularly susceptible {{to the effect of}} acid rain and are being protected with a wash of a sacrificial shelter coat <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> Exhibits within the temple precincts are susceptible to warm air which had the effect of drawing corrosive salts out of the Roman stonework. To help reduce this, a new ventilation system was installed in 2006.|$|E

2500|$|It is thought, therefore, {{that the}} meteorites all {{originate}} in relatively <b>few</b> impacts <b>every</b> <b>few</b> million <b>years</b> on [...] Mars. The impactors would be kilometers {{in diameter and}} the craters they form on Mars tens of kilometers in diameter. Models of impacts on Mars are consistent with these findings.|$|R
50|$|Pern is at {{the mercy}} of the Thread, a deadly {{microorganism}} native to another planet in the Pern solar system. When the two planets periodically approach each other in orbit <b>every</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>years,</b> the organisms form into long strings of thread that cross the gap through space.|$|R
5|$|Climatologically speaking, {{approximately}} 97 {{percent of}} tropical cyclones that {{form in the}} North Atlantic develop between the dates of June 1 and November 30 – dates which delimit the modern-day Atlantic hurricane season. Though {{the beginning of the}} annual hurricane season has historically remained the same, the official end of the hurricane season has shifted from its initial date of October 31. Regardless, on average once <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> a tropical cyclone develops outside the limits of the season; as of January2016 there have been 66tropical cyclones in the off-season, with the most recent being Tropical Storm Arlene in 2017. The first tropical cyclone of the 1938 Atlantic hurricane season, which formed on January3, became the earliest forming tropical storm and hurricane after reanalysis concluded on the storm in December2012.|$|E
5|$|Many unique {{varieties}} of mango are {{native to the}} country, most having been developed {{during the second half}} of the 20th century. New and improved mango varieties are still introduced to markets <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> Arguably the most popular variety is the Maya type, which is small to medium in size, fragrant, colourful (featuring 3-4 colours) and usually fiberless. The Israeli mango season begins in May, and the last of the fruit ripen as October draws near. Different varieties are present on markets at different months, with the Maya type seen between July and September. Mangos are frequently used in fusion dishes and for making Sorbet.|$|E
5|$|The nectar of the ﬂowers {{is sought}} after by insects, bellbirds, tūī and stitchbirds. The leaves and the rough bark provide {{excellent}} homes for insects such as caterpillars and moths, small beetles, ﬂy larvae, weta, snails and slugs. Many {{of these are}} then eaten by birds such as saddlebacks and robins. The rough bark also provides opportunities for epiphytes to cling and grow, and lizards hide amongst the dead leaves, coming out to drink the nectar and to eat the insects. Good flowering seasons occur <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> only. While {{it is said that}} they foretell dry summers, it has been observed that they tend to follow dry seasons.|$|E

2500|$|Mammalian {{mitochondrial}} DNA mutates so {{fast that}} it causes a problem called [...] "saturation", where random noise drowns out any information that may be present.

5|$|The {{tradition}} of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners {{through the windows of}} Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Seedlings {{would have}} little change of {{surviving}} in a normal dry season; establishment probably requires several consecutive seasons of good rain.

25|$|These slash {{and burn}} methods provide high yields {{the first year}} or two, but they {{eventually}} drain the soil of fertility. This necessitates the clearing of more farmland <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> as this exhausted land can remain infertile for up to ten years.

However, batteries need to be replaced <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> In many areas, battery expenses can be eliminated by attaching the building to the electric power grid and operating the power system with net metering. Utility permission is required, but such cooperative generation is legally mandated in some areas (for example, California).|$|E
