Afolayan {{in an interview}} with Weekend Magazine expressed that it was very stressful shooting October 1 and his previous films were incomparable to it. He stated that it was more challenging, more demanding and it has a budget of over four times that of his previous film. He also said there were times when he and the crew had just three hours of sleep in four days, but however pointed out that he had best hands on deck for the project and he is <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> The film production team on set was made up of about a hundred people; Co-ordinator, Oge Ogu noted that one of the major challenges during filming was co-ordinating and managing the extras to fit into the director's vision, as the crowd often span into hundreds of people.|$|E
500|$|The inquest {{concluded}} in October 2010. Earland, the Exeter and Greater Devon Coroner, recorded a narrative verdict {{and came up}} with several recommendations. Among the recommendations were that Ten Tors participants should undergo more than two training expeditions prior to the main event, that the team managers attain recognised qualifications and that the Health and Safety Executive ensure that independent schools adhere to the same safety standards as state schools. She {{went on to say that}} [...] "It would be a tragedy if [...] was to stop but the public need to be satisfied it is as safe as it reasonably can be, bearing in mind it is what it says, a challenge, not a survival exercise." [...] After the inquest, Shaw's mother stated that she had been helped by the inquest, saying [...] "I have found out the facts and I'm <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> but I am still looking for accountability and some kind of apology and acknowledgement".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{to a total}} of 944 theatres, with an extra 66 being added later. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess {{there are some people who}} feel that I ought to be <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E

2500|$|After {{spending}} 10 {{months as}} a trainee, IU released [...] "Lost Child" [...] (...) as her first single. She performed the song {{live for the}} first time on the music program, M! Countdown, on September 18, 2008, making it her debut performance as a professional singer. Regarding the performance, IU recalled the crowd had hurled insults at her and though she felt discouraged by it, she now considers it a beneficial experience. [...] "Lost Child" [...] is the lead single from her debut extended play Lost and Found, which was released on September 24, 2008. For the album, IU was awarded the [...] "Rookie of the Month" [...] by South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in November 2008. However, the album did not do well commercially. During an interview in 2011, IU said, [...] "My first album failed, but I'm <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> If I had become successful as soon as I made my debut, I wouldn't appreciate my staff members and the popularity that I'm enjoying now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Impressed by her {{performance}} in Under the Skin, Woody Allen cast her in Sweet and Lowdown, {{a romantic comedy}} about a fictional jazz guitarist in the 1930s (played by Sean Penn) who regards himself as the second greatest guitarist in the world. Morton played Hattie, a mute laundress and the love interest of Penn's character. The film was released in September 1999, to wide critical acclaim and moderate success {{at the box office}} in the arthouse circuit. George Perry for BBC.com found her to be [...] "extraordinary" [...] as an [...] "adoring mute who suffers [...] She uses her eyes to convey meaning, reviving techniques of silent cinema". Morton earned Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress for her role, which was especially notable, considering the fact that she does not utter a single word of dialogue in the film. During a 2007 interview with UK's The Guardian, she remarked that the awards recognition, particularly her Oscar nomination, meant [...] "incredible things for me in the [...] I'm <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> It means that [...] I'm able to support the industry".|$|E
2500|$|United States – The US Department of State {{announced}} limited {{support for}} the PYD in February 2016, although it opposes the unilateral establishment of a federal region in northern Syria. In March 2016, {{the day after the}} declaration of the Democratic Federation of Rojava - Northern Syria, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter praised the Rojava YPG militia as having [...] "proven to be excellent partners of ours on the ground in fighting ISIL. We are <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> and we intend to continue to do that, recognizing the complexities of their regional role." [...] The USA have usually supported the YPG militia in its fight against ISIL, both with air support in combat and with embedded US Special Forces. During the Northern Raqqa offensive (May 2016), US Special Operation Forces were widely reported and photographed taking part, wearing YPG and YPJ badges on their uniforms. When in June 2016 the Manbij offensive started, the Washington Post reported it under the headline of [...] "Ignoring Turkey, U.S. backs Kurds in drive against ISIS in Syria". On 7 November 2016, when asked about the federalization of Syria, Mark C. Toner, the Deputy Spokesperson for the US Department of State, said [...] "We don’t want to see any kind of ad hoc federalism or federalist system arise. We don’t want to see semi-autonomous zones. The reality is, though, as territory is liberated from Daesh, you got to get some kind of governance back into these areas, but by no means are we condoning or – any kind of, as I said, ad hoc semi-autonomous areas in northern Syria". According to lieutenant general Stephen J. Townsend of the United States Army in an interview on 29 March 2017, the US does not recognize Rojava as a [...] "Kurdish state" [...] but instead sees it as a [...] "multi-cultural, multi-party, multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian Syrian region being liberated from ISIS." ...|$|E

60|$|Still, on the whole, {{we should}} be <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> a volume <b>that</b> has given us {{specimens}} of Kendall's work, and perhaps Mr. Sladen will some day produce an anthology of Australian poetry, not a herbarium of Australian verse.

We knew now, at least, that a British war-vessel lay moored in the harbour below to watch over our safety.|$|E
6000|$|Jean mumbled a {{good night}} and stood {{watching}} his father's shining white head move away under the starlight. Then the tall, dark form vanished, a door closed, and all was still.

For a moment he sat on his roll of bedding, his thought still locked on the shuddering revelation of his father's words, [...] "They're shore goin' to kill me." [...] The shock of inaction passed. Jean pushed his pack in the dark opening and, crawling inside, he unrolled it and made his bed.|$|E

Then, a burst of gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me, once the blacksmith's boy. Then I thought if she were, as I feared, by no means rapturously <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> destiny yet, when would she begin to be interested in me?
