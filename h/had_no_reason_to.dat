5|$|Miss Honora Sneyd {{would not}} admit the {{unqualified}} {{control of a}} husband over all her actions; she did not feel, that seclusion from society was indispensably necessary to preserve female virtue, or to secure domestic happiness. Upon terms of reasonable equality, she supposed, that mutual confidence might best subsist; she said, that, as Mr Day had decidedly declared his determination to live in perfect seclusion from what is usually called the world, it was fit she should decidedly declare, {{that she would not}} change her present mode of life, with which she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be dissatisfied, for any dark and untried system, that could be proposed to her.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E
5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E

5|$|The {{silencer}} {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to {{have been on the}} rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the silencer was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could not shoot herself with the silencer attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the tour}} {{represented}} a {{changing of the guard}} in Australian cricket. In their late 30s, Johnson and Miller retired from first-class cricket. In the 1956–57 season, Lindwall took 27 wickets at 23.74 and made 243 runs at 27.00. Having had a successful series in the most recent international fixtures, Lindwall <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> expect anything but a continuation of his senior role in the team. Furthermore, having captained the team in the absence of Johnson and Miller, Lindwall was the now the player with the most seniority in terms of leadership. However, when the team for the 1957–58 South African tour was announced, Lindwall's name was omitted altogether. Lindwall heard the news on the radio while he was working, having not being given prior notice. After three consecutive Ashes defeats during Australia's decline in the mid-1950s, the selectors had turned to a radical youth policy in an attempt to reverse the slide. Ian Craig was made youngest Australia's captain at the age of 22, having played only six Tests without securing a regular place in the team. The pacemen selected were Davidson, Ian Meckiff, Ron Gaunt and John Drennan. Davidson had managed only 16 wickets at 34.06 in 12 Tests, while the remaining three had yet to play a Test. While Craig's men defeated South Africa 3–0, Lindwall continued his consistent performances for Queensland in the Sheffield Shield, with 26 wickets at 25.77 and 274 runs at 34.25. During the seasons, Lindwall broke Ernie Jones' record of 209 wickets in Shield competitions in his 54th match in the competition.|$|E

25|$|At this point, {{the crisis}} was ostensibly at a stalemate. The Soviets had shown no {{indication}} that they would back down and had made several comments to the contrary.

25|$|Contrary to the {{negation}} of the diaspora view, {{the acceptance of}} Jewish communities outside Israel was postulated by those, like Simon Rawidowicz (also a Zionist), who viewed the Jews as a culture which had evolved into a new 'worldly' entity that <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> seek an exclusive return, either physical, emotional or spiritual to its indigenous lands, and who believed that the Jews could remain one people even outside Israel.|$|E

25|$|In 2015 FAO was criticised by The Economist {{for giving}} a diploma to Venezuela for {{being one of}} 72 {{countries}} that had “reached the UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the percentage of their populations suffering from hunger”.

Moreover, Flight 954's flight crew had never received word that Runway 27L was an active runway, and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> anticipate encountering other aircraft while taxiing across it.|$|E
25|$|A 13th century {{northern}} English source {{claims that}} William was Mormaer of Moray. As this source <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> deceive, {{it is highly}} likely that William was made the ruler of Moray after the defeat of King Óengus of Moray in 1130. It is feasible that this grant {{had something to do}} with the coming of age of David's son, Prince Henry and may also be a factor in his marriage to a daughter of Óengus. As well as being the ruler of Moray, William controlled the English lands of Allerdale, Skipton and Craven, making him one of the greatest barons of northern England.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains {{is given}} its first modern {{historical}} perspective by Edward Gibbon, who {{called it the}} last victory achieved {{in the name of}} the Western Roman Empire. Gibbon noted that it was from his enemies we hear of his terrible deeds, not from friendly chroniclers, emphasizing that the former <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> elevate Attila's reign of terror, but of proving Attila to be defeatable. The first individual historical survey of the battle was given by Sir Edward Creasy, who heralded it as a triumph of the Christian Europe over the pagan savages of Asia, saving classical heritage and European culture.|$|E

25|$|Not {{everyone}} {{who refused to}} participate in any killing or injuring of animals also abstained from the consumption of meat. Hence the question of Buddhist vegetarianism in the earliest stages of that religion's development is controversial. There are two schools of thought. One says that the Buddha and his followers ate meat offered to them by hosts or alms-givers if they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suspect that the animal had been slaughtered specifically for their sake. The other one says that the Buddha and his community of monks (sangha) were strict vegetarians and the habit of accepting alms of meat was only tolerated later on, after a decline of discipline.|$|E

25|$|The second limb {{of section}} 6(2) was {{examined}} by District Judge Neighbour in Ong Kian Cheong.

He alleged that all he did was to post the tracts after the second accused had prepared them.
