A thong style strap, sometimes called a dance belt, has one narrow <b>elastic</b> <b>strap</b> attached {{to the bottom of}} the pouch, passing between the legs and attaching to the waistband at the middle of the back. A strapless garment, called a jock sock or sometimes a slingshot, has only an elastic waist band with an elastic pouch that holds the genitals from the front.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{the band}} {{received}} a substantial boost in funding, which allowed the band to supply more uniform parts {{free of charge}} that were previously purchased by band students. The band also purchased new cold weather overcoats that could be worn in the stands during a game. Previous cold weather coats included black wool, collared jackets from Holloway and Liz Claiborne. In 2013, the band has switched to double breasted wool overcoats which {{are similar to the}} U.S. Army's Class A overcoat. This coat features six Great Seal of Ohio buttons, and has large pockets to keep band members' hands warm while not playing their instrument. The band also changed the vinyl spats. Previously worn spats had white elastic straps, which were a custom ordered product. Due to shortages in marching band spats across the United States, the band opted to wear standard white vinyl spats which have a black <b>elastic</b> <b>strap.</b>|$|E

50|$|A new FIA {{regulation}} saw {{changes made}} to the seat belts used in the cars. Previously, <b>elastic</b> <b>straps</b> {{had been used to}} keep the seat belts out of the way during driver changes. An investigation by the FIA found that the <b>elastic</b> <b>straps</b> could cause the seat belts to slip in a frontal impact, increasing the risk of injury to the driver. As a result, Supercars mandated that the <b>elastic</b> <b>straps</b> be removed. During test days prior to the event, teams found that the removal of the <b>elastic</b> <b>straps</b> increased the time required for a driver change, noting that this could have an impact during pit stops with a short refuelling time.|$|R

50|$|A {{cigarette}} case (sometimes called a cigarette tin) is a sturdy container used to store {{small numbers of}} cigarettes and prevent them from being crushed. A typical {{cigarette case}} is a flat box (commonly made of metal) that opens symmetrically into two halves. Each half stores a row of cigarettes, which are often {{held in place by}} a spring or an <b>elastic</b> <b>strap.</b> Some cigarette cases are simply sturdy cases used to store standard cigarette packs.|$|E
50|$|A baby jumper is {{a device}} {{that can be used}} by infants to {{exercise}} and play in. The original baby jumper consists of a hoop suspended by an <b>elastic</b> <b>strap.</b> More elaborate baby jumbers have a base made of hard plastic sitting in a frame and a suspended fabric seat with two leg holes, often with trays holding toys. The door jumpers lack the tray. There are also mobile play centers (baby walkers), which look very similar to baby jumpers, but which have wheels.|$|E

50|$|Many {{specialized}} foreskin restoration {{devices that}} grip the skin {{with or without}} tape are also commercially available. Tension from these devices may be applied by weights, <b>elastic</b> <b>straps,</b> or inflation {{as a means to}} either push the skin forward on the penis, or by a combination of these methods. An example of a device using <b>elastic</b> <b>straps</b> is the T-Tape method, which was developed in the 1990s with the idea of enabling restoration to take place more rapidly. In 2009, a method known as Reverse Taping Method, RTM, was introduced to the restoration population that restores the foreskin to intact appearance, many times in under 2 years and was found to be very lifestyle friendly. RTM could be worn under just about anything from slacks to swim briefs and the ability to urinate and apply skin emollients while the taping was on made it a very healthy and rapid restoration method.|$|R
50|$|In fixed-rotation bindings, {{the binding}} is {{attached}} to the snowshoe with an <b>elastic</b> <b>strap</b> that brings the tail of the snowshoe up with each step. The snowshoe therefore moves with the foot and the tail does not drag. Fixed-rotation bindings are preferred for racing. Full-rotation bindings allow the user's toes to pivot below the deck of the snowshoe. They allow the crampon cleats that are under the foot to be kicked into a slope for grip in climbing, but are relatively awkward for stepping sideways and backwards as the tail of the snowshoe can drag. Fixed-rotation bindings often cause snow to be kicked up the back of the wearer's legs; this does not tend to happen with full-rotation bindings.|$|E
50|$|The TLC Tugger is a tapeless {{foreskin}} restoration device {{invented by}} Ron Low. The device {{consists of a}} silicone 'tugger', retaining cone, and an <b>elastic</b> <b>strap.</b> The silicone tugger is placed against the glans. Skin from the penile shaft or inner skin is then rolled over the tugger. The retaining cone is then used to hold the skin in place. Finally, a strap {{is attached to the}} tugger and then tied around the knee in order to induce tension. This tension allows the inner or outer foreskin to grow. A newer version of the TLC Tugger has been created called the TLC Tugger X which includes weights that can be tied to straps to add extra tension allowing for faster growth of the foreskin.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the {{surgical}} masks depends on the mode; usually the masks are 3 ply/3 layers. This 3 ply material is made up from a melt-blown material placed between non-woven fabric. The melt-blown material acts as the filter that stops microbes from entering or exiting the mask. Most surgical masks feature pleats or folds. Commonly, 3 pleats are used allowing the user to expand the mask so it covers the area from the nose to the chin.There are 3 different ways to secure the masks. The most popular is the ear loop, where a string like material {{is attached to the}} mask and placed behind the ears. The other is the tie-on and the head band. The tie-on straps consist of four non-woven straps that are tied behind the head. The head band is an <b>elastic</b> <b>strap</b> that is placed behind the head.|$|E
50|$|Most Murphy beds do {{not have}} box springs. Instead, the {{mattress}} usually lies on a wood platform or wire mesh and is held in place {{so as not to}} sag when in a closed position. The mattress is attached to the bed frame, often with <b>elastic</b> <b>straps</b> to hold the mattress in position when the unit is folded upright. Piston-lifts or torsion springs make modern Murphy beds easy to lower and raise.|$|R

There are standard notches for a strap assembly with 2 to 4 <b>elastic</b> <b>straps.</b> The rack is integrated into the bike design; the taillight is usually mounted {{on the back of}} the rack.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmitter}} pack {{to which}} the microphone is attached may {{also need to be}} hidden under a person's clothing.

Windproof jockstraps have a special layer of fabric to protect the wearer from wind and cold in winter sports. Jockstraps are made in other materials as fetish wear.
