5|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Its {{usefulness in}} PD is an open research topic, Several nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments; however {{there is no evidence}} that vitamins or food additives improve symptoms. There is no evidence to substantiate that acupuncture and practice of Qigong, or T'ai chi, <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> on the course of the disease or symptoms. Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The Mobile Column in the south, {{consisting}} of the Imperial Camel Brigade, the 11th Light Horse, and the mounted City of London Yeomanry Regiments (less two squadrons), advanced from Ferdan and the Ballah railhead to attack the German and Ottoman left flank, working through Bir El Mageibra, Bir El Aweidia and Hod El Bayud. They found Mageibra evacuated on 5 August. After camping there for the night, they fought strong hostile forces between Bayud and Mageibra the following day, but could make no impression. Some days later, on 8 August, the Mobile Column did succeed in getting round the Ottoman flank, but {{was too weak to}} <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> and retired to Bir Bayud.|$|E
5|$|Further east, the strongpoint {{defenses}} were effective. On the Dog Red / Easy Green boundary, {{the defenses}} around the Les Moulins strongpoint took a heavy {{toll on the}} remaining 2nd Battalion, with H/116 and headquarters elements struggling ashore there. The survivors joined the remnants of F/116 behind the shingle, and here the battalion commander was able to organize 50 men for an improvised advance across the shingle. A further advance up the bluffs just east of Les Moulins {{was too weak to}} <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> and was forced back down. To their left, mainly between the draws on the Easy Green / Easy Red boundary, the 116th RCT's support battalion landed without too much loss, although they did become scattered, and were too disorganized to play any immediate part in an assault on the bluffs.|$|E

5|$|The {{peace treaty}} of the First Kappel War did not define {{the right of}} {{unhindered}} preaching in the Catholic states. Zwingli interpreted this to mean that preaching should be permitted, but the Five States suppressed any attempts to reform. The Burgrecht cities considered different means of applying pressure to the Five States. Basel and Schaffhausen preferred quiet diplomacy while Zurich wanted armed conflict. Zwingli and Jud unequivocally advocated {{an attack on the}} Five States. Bern took a middle position which eventually prevailed. In May 1531, Zurich reluctantly agreed to impose a food blockade. It failed to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> and in October, Bern decided to withdraw the blockade. Zurich urged its continuation and the Burgrecht cities began to quarrel among themselves.|$|E
5|$|When {{not in a}} dungeon, Link {{explores the}} overworld. In Seasons, the overworld {{consists}} of Holodrum and the subterranean world of Subrosia. The two worlds are linked by several portals. In Ages, Link travels between present-day Labrynna and the past, connected by Time Holes. In either game, some areas of one world are accessible only from portals from the other and vice versa. Holodrum, Subrosia, and Labrynna contain optional side quests and upgrades for Link and his equipment. One such side quest is ring collection; rings provide Link with various bonuses and abilities, such as improved defense. Some rings {{do not have any}} practical uses, e.g. rings that weaken Link's attack or defense, or transform Link into an enemy creature, or are awarded when certain criteria are met but do not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect.</b> Another side quest is the optional trading game, in which Link receives and delivers special items to certain people throughout the land. Once completed, Link receives an upgraded sword.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} whether instruction with the aid of instructional objectives <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> on student self-efficacy. Secondary aims were investigated as well. These included whether the use of instructional objectives <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> on student achievement, and whether <b>any</b> potential <b>effect</b> of instructional objectives on self-efficacy and achievement was mediated by perceived ability. [...] To do this a two part study dealing with a unit of work on coordinate geometry was taught to four classes of heterogeneously grouped grade nine students. Two classes were taught with the aid of instructional objectives and two were taught without such assistance. [...] From the analysis of variance mixed results were obtained as to whether the use of instructional objectives <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>effect</b> on perceived self-efficacy. However, the results showed that there was a significant difference in achievement levels, but no difference in level of perceived self-efficacy or achievement among students of different ability levels...|$|R
