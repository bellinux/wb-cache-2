5|$|The Indian subcontinent is {{the range}} of {{subspecies}} N. p. ginginianus, {{the smallest of the}} three subspecies, which is identifiable by a pale yellow bill. The subspecies name is derived from Gingee in southern India where the French explorer Pierre Sonnerat described it as Le Vautour de Gingi and it was given a Latin name by John Latham in <b>his</b> <b>Index</b> Ornithologicus (1790).|$|E
5|$|The present bronze {{statue of}} Benavides {{is in front}} of the Main Building of the Sampaloc campus, rising on top of a granite {{pedestal}} flanked by four lions each bearing the coats-of-arms of the Philippines, Spain, Holy See, and the Dominican Order. He dons the rugged habit of the pioneer Dominican missionaries. His right hand is elevated in the preaching fashion, <b>his</b> <b>index</b> finger pointing to heavens. His left hand rests on his chest holding a book bearing the words Santo Evangélico on its cover. A skull cap covers his head, and a pectoral cross hangs from his neck, the symbols of Episcopal dignity.|$|E

5|$|Ba Cụt {{was born}} circa 1923 in Long Xuyên, a {{regional}} {{town in the}} Mekong Delta, in the far south of Vietnam. He was orphaned {{at an early age}} and adopted by a local peasant family. Ba Cụt was illiterate and was known from childhood as a temperamental and fiery person. The family's rice paddies were confiscated by a prominent landlord, the father of Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ. Ba Cụt's bitter personal experience imbued him with a permanent and fanatical hatred towards landowners. Thơ rose to become a leading politician in the 1950s and {{played a key role in}} Ba Cụt's eventual capture and execution. An aura of mystery surrounded Ba Cụt during his life, and foreign journalists incorrectly reported that he had severed his finger as part of a vow to defeat the French. As Ba Cụt became more fanatical in his religious beliefs and spent increasing time with local religious men, Ba Cụt's father demanded that he work more in the family's rice fields. A defiant Ba Cụt severed <b>his</b> <b>index</b> finger, which was necessary for work in the rice paddies.|$|E
5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was {{bitten by}} a black mamba and {{died of a heart}} attack in less than an hour in March 2008. The black mamba had been found near a {{classroom}} at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was bitten by the snake on <b>his</b> <b>index</b> finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed and {{died of a heart attack}}, nearly an hour after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E

25|$|Tattersall had {{an unusual}} style, quite {{different}} from the orthodox Jim Laker, who kept him out of a Test place for most of his career. Tattersall held <b>his</b> <b>index</b> finger around the seam of the ball and this allowed him to bowl a carefully disguised away-swinger to supplement his sharp off-break. He was rather faster than Laker, and this served to increase his penetration on the many wet wickets of his home county. Of small account as a batsman, he did nonetheless help Reg Simpson in a tenth wicket stand of 74 which helped to give England its first victory over Australia since their record win at The Oval in 1938.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally in French, social link was derogatory, {{recently}} {{it has become}} wishful goal. The book by Robert D.

A comparative analysis in several European countries would show, perhaps, a different trend: Europeans trust more their fellow citizens than they use to. ...|$|R

25|$|The Broncos edged Tampa Bay 16–13 behind Cutler's 23-of-34 {{performance}} with 227 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions. The Broncos were 4–1 and leading AFC West. But then followed a 24-7 loss to Jacksonville Jaguars, where Cutler passed for just 192 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. Next, Cutler injured <b>his</b> <b>index</b> {{finger on the}} first play of a 41-7 drubbing at New England; he ended the night with 168 yards and two interceptions. After a bye week, the Broncos suffered their third straight defeat, 26-17 to Miami, behind Cutler's 24-of-46 passing for 307 yards, two touchdowns and season-high three interceptions. During the 1-4 skid, Cutler had all seven of the Broncos touchdowns.|$|E
25|$|On December 10, 2013, Anderson {{was traded}} to the Colorado Rockies for pitcher Drew Pomeranz and minor league pitcher Chris Jensen. In just his third start of the season, on April 12, 2014, Anderson broke <b>his</b> <b>index</b> finder while batting, sending him to the {{disabled}} list. He rejoined the Rockies rotation in July and he pitched well for them for the next month. However, on August 5, he had to leave his start early due to back spasms He wound up undergoing season-ending back surgery to repair a herniated disc in his lower back. He made only eight starts for the Rockies in the injury riddled season, with a 1–3 record and a 2.91 ERA. After the season, the Rockies declined Anderson's $12 million option for 2015, making him a free agent.|$|E
25|$|By late March sports {{writers were}} already penciling in Landrith as the {{definite}} opening day starter behind home plate for San Francisco, but on April 3 Landrith had a freak accident {{with his hand}} in an exhibition game against the Cubs, suffering a hair-line fracture {{on the back of}} <b>his</b> <b>index</b> finger. He hit the bat or helmet of Cubs hitter Lou Johnson when Lou got {{out in front of the}} plate after a swinging strike out in the 4th inning. Landrith attempted to throw the ball to second base as Johnson swung his bat, causing the injury. Frank Bowman, trainer for the Giants, expected him to miss 10 days and opening day. He returned to batting practice on April 19 and pinch hit for the Giants on April 22 against the Cubs, but did not return to full action until almost a full month later on May 2.|$|E
