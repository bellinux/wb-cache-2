Other countries may not send biathletes unless the top 28 countries do not fill their quota. These restrictions apply to each gender, so that the countries who appear in the top 20 in both the men's and the women's list are able to send five men and five women.

25|$|The {{game has}} never been played {{in a region that}} lacked an NFL franchise. London, England has {{occasionally}} been mentioned as a host city for a Super Bowl in the near future. Wembley Stadium has hosted several NFL games as part of the NFL International Series and is specifically designed for large, individual events. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has openly discussed the possibility on different occasions. Time zone complications are a significant obstacle to a Super Bowl in London; a typical 6:30p.m. Eastern Time start would result in the game beginning at 11:30p.m. local time in London, an unusually late hour to be holding spectator sports (the NFL has never in its history started a game later than 9:15p.m. local time). As bids <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>submitted</b> for all Super Bowls through Super Bowl LVI, the soonest that any stadium outside the NFL's footprint could serve as host would be Super Bowl LVII in 2023.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{education}} in this region, North West Territories, began officially in 1885 with Territorial Ordinance #5. North West Territorial Schools Districts or One Room School Houses replaced trading post schooling, missionary schools and private schooling of the past. Moose Jaw School District #1 was formally established December 5, 1884 under the new Board of Education. The 1944 School Act set out to establish larger consolidated schools {{and the formation of}} the schools and school districts presently in use. As with any Canadian province, the Saskatchewan Legislature has almost exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905, the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated before 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling). For historians and genealogists, previous school district records <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>submitted</b> to the Saskatchewan Provincial Archives Regina Branch.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{redevelopment}} {{currently under}} consideration, but numerous proposals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>submitted</b> {{over the past}} twenty years. When Thessaloniki became the European capital of culture during 1997, the city council put together an organizing committee for the redevelopment of the waterfront of the city, including the redevelopment of Aristotelous Square. Of the many designs that were presented to the committee, some of them were very radical and others less so. In almost all proposals, there were provisions for a marina or a similar extension of the square onto waterfront, as well as a wheel similar to the London Eye in London. Up to date, no official redevelopment scheme has been made official. The current mayor of Thessaloniki, Yannis Boutaris, mentioned in his electoral campaign that Thessaloniki would undergo a major redevelopment to bring it into the 21st century, but so far no designs or any new announcements have been made public.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to claims of bias, researchers and investigators have {{found evidence of}} fraud. In 1995, the state of Oklahoma conducted {{an investigation into the}} WHD-provided prevailing wages being used in state projects. Oklahoma had a Little Davis-Bacon law that, in an attempt to save on administrative costs, adopted the federal standards. When the state office was notified that some rates had increased 162%, it requested information from the WHD. The WHD denied the Oklahoma Department of Labor access to the survey forms used to determine the wages, so the Oklahoma Department of Labor undertook a criminal investigation. According to Brenda Reneau, then-Commissioner of the Oklahoma Department of Labor, “This investigation found that grossly inaccurate information had been reported to the Federal Government by what the U.S. Department of Labor calls interested third parties. We found inflated numbers of employees on projects, inflated wage rates reported for these same non-existent workers and we found projects that were never built. We also noticed {{what appears to be a}} pattern in the reporting method on many of the wage survey forms, as our visual presentation will show here today.” In response to this, “a follow-up investigation conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor confirms that not only was a great deal of inaccurate information reported, as we had alleged, but U.S. Department of Labor documents show certain unions in Oklahoma City as the parties who submitted that information. It appears that false information may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>submitted</b> to the U.S. Department of Labor in an attempt, purposefully, to inflate Davis-Bacon wage rates.” In the wake of the state investigations, the WHD withdrew many prevailing wage findings for the state, and the Oklahoma Supreme Court found their Little Davis–Bacon statute to be in violation of the state constitution.|$|E
