5|$|Cirrus Spissatus {{clouds are}} the highest clouds of the main cloud genera. They may form in the higher {{tropopause}} or <b>even</b> <b>at</b> the lower stratosphere. They are dense and opaque, not allowing {{the light of the}} sun or moon to pass through. They are more common on the anvils of cumulonimbus clouds.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear <b>even</b> <b>at</b> a minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for}} a different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E

5|$|During the growth, {{the chamber}} {{materials}} are etched {{off by the}} plasma and can incorporate into the growing diamond. In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the silica windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate. Therefore, silica windows are either avoided or {{moved away from the}} substrate. Boron-containing species in the chamber, <b>even</b> <b>at</b> very low trace levels, also make it unsuitable for the growth of pure diamond.|$|E
5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>at</b> the 1.5m wavelength, antennas of {{practical}} size had relatively low gain and very poor resolution; the transmitter antenna created a fan-shaped signal over 90 degrees wide. This was not useful for homing on a target, so some system of direction indication was required. The team seriously considered phase comparison as a solution, {{but could not}} find a suitable phase shifting circuit.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of stasis has also been corroborated from the genetics of sibling species, species which are morphologically indistinguishable, but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently to suggest they have been separated for millions of years. A paramount example of evolutionary stasis is the fern Osmunda claytoniana. Based on paleontological evidence it has remained unchanged, <b>even</b> <b>at</b> the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years.|$|E

The third period was the decisive quarter, and Cornell won three face-offs and outscored Hofstra five-to-one. In Durham, third-seeded Duke hosted Navy.

5|$|In 1956, Mantle won the MVP {{award for}} a season in which he led the AL and MLB in batting average (.353), home runs (52), and RBIs (130), {{becoming}} the second Yankee (after Gehrig in 1934) to win a Triple Crown. The 1956 Yankees won the franchise's seventh AL championship under Stengel and advanced to a World Series rematch with the Dodgers. In Game 5, with the Series <b>even</b> <b>at</b> 2–2, Yankees pitcher Don Larsen threw a perfect game. In seven games, the Yankees won the Series.|$|E

5|$|In rare cases, beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} polygenic arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) <b>even</b> <b>at</b> a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E
5|$|In the past, it {{was thought}} that {{consumption}} of protein <b>even</b> <b>at</b> normal levels increased the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This {{has been shown to be}} incorrect. Furthermore, many people with chronic liver disease are malnourished and require adequate protein to maintain a stable body weight. A diet with adequate protein and energy is therefore recommended.|$|E

5|$|Iridium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, iridium is generally credited {{with being the}} second densest element (after osmium). It {{is also the most}} corrosion-resistant metal, <b>even</b> <b>at</b> temperatures as high as 2000°C. Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.|$|E

5|$|Metallic silver, like copper, is an {{antibacterial}} agent, {{which was}} known to the ancients and first scientifically investigated and named the oligodynamic effect by Carl Nägeli. Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria <b>even</b> <b>at</b> such low concentrations as 0.01–0.1milligrams per litre; metallic silver has a similar effect due {{to the formation of}} silver oxide. This effect is lost in the presence of sulfur due to the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide.|$|E

In a 2009 study, Herman Pontzer and colleagues calculated the aerobic endurance of various dinosaurs. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> moderate running speeds, Heterodontosaurus would have exceeded the maximum aerobic capabilities possible for an ectotherm (cold-blooded) animal, indicating endothermy in this genus.|$|E
