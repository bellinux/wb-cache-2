40|$|Using a nonhydrostatic {{numerical}} model, {{this work}} demonstrates that onshore winds are a principal agent of overturning and vigorous vertical mixing in nearshore water of lakes and <b>inner</b> <b>continental</b> <b>shelves.</b> On short (superinertial) timescales {{of a few}} hours, onshore winds create surface currents pushing water against the shore which, via the associated pressure gradient force, creates an undercurrent. The resulting overturning circulation rapidly becomes dynamically unstable due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mechanism, internal gravity waves form, and vigorous vertical mixing follows. The vertical extent of the overturning cell depends on the speed of surface currents and density stratification (which is influenced by other processes such as tidal mixing). In smaller enclosed water bodies, wave reflection in conjunction with dynamical instabilities support rapid mixed-layer deepening and overturning of the entire water column. Based on these findings, the author postulates that dynamic instabilities following from onshore wind events are of fundamental importance to biogeochemical cycles and ecological processes in shelf seas and lakes...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Observations are {{revealing}} that striking patterns consisting primarily of grain-size sorting on scales up to kilometers adorn many <b>inner</b> <b>continental</b> <b>shelves.</b> We hypothesize that the sorting could {{be caused by}} a feedback involving variations in sediment flux as a function of bed composition. Where the seabed is covered by coarse sediment, wave-generated ripples are typically large (wavelengths on the order of 1 m and heights on the order of 0. 1 m), and wave-orbital motions interacting with these ripples causes energetic and large-scale turbulence in the bottom boundary layer. Fine sediment will tend to be preferentially entrained over domains that are already coarse, and preferentially deposited where the bed is already finer. Transport of the coarse material will cause coarse domains to migrate, leading to the possibility that they will merge with each other over time, creating a large-scale, well-organized pattern. In a numerical model designed to explore this possibility, finite-amplitude interactions (interactions between well-developed features that emerge from the initial instability) lead to patterns with scales and characteristics consistent with the natural patterns...|$|R

40|$|Many <b>inner</b> <b>continental</b> <b>shelves</b> are {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} large rhythmic bedforms, such as shoreface-connected ridges and the more offshore located sand ridges, which have heights of several meters and are spaced several kilometers apart. This study focuses on explaining the observed orientation difference between shoreface-connected sand ridges and the more offshore located ridges. For this, an existing idealized morphodynamic model is used, but modified such that sea level rise simultaneously induces a steepening of the inner shelf and a retreating shoreface. Different settings (rate of sea level rise; landward depth of the inner shelf) are systematically explored. For each setting, the gross characteristics of ridges (growth rate, height, migration, orientation) during their initial formation and long-term evolution are quantified. Model results show that a rising sea level and associated shoreface retreat and shelf steepening lead to new ridges in the shallow area of the inner shelf, which remain active in time (i. e. ongoing growth and downstream migration in time). Old ridges that were already formed in the antecedent area of the shelf and which in the course of time experience deeper water become less active with the rising sea level. In the case that migration of the offshore parts of the ridges vanishes, these parts change orientation to become more shore-parallel compared with the active onshore parts of these ridges. In the case of small landward depths of the inner shelf and a decreasing rate of sea level rise, the active onshore parts migrate too fast, thereby causing the drowned offshore parts to detach and to become inactive. The characteristics of modeled shore-oblique shoreface-connected and more parallel offshore located ridges agree with those of observed sand ridges. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Sorted bedforms are {{ubiquitous}} on the <b>inner</b> <b>continental</b> <b>shelves</b> worldwide. They {{are described}} as spatially-grain-size-sorted features consisting of small rippled medium-to-coarse sand and can remain stable for decades. However, the knowledge about their genesis and development is still fragmentary. For this study, a representative investigation area (water depth < 15 m) located on the shelf west of the island of Sylt (SE North Sea, Germany) was periodically surveyed with hydroacoustic means (i. e. sidescan sonar, multibeam echo sounder, and sub-bottom profiler) during 2010 - 2014. Since this area is influenced by tidal and wind-driven currents, {{the aim was to}} detect and examine interannual variabilities in the characteristics of the prevailing sorted bedforms. Our measurements reveal sinuous stripes of rippled medium sand which are embedded in shallow symmetrical depressions. These domains are surrounded by relatively smooth fine-sand areas. These sorted bedforms were identified as flow-transverse features that are maintained by ebb and flood currents of almost equal strengths that flow in opposite directions. This bidirectional flow field generates sharp boundaries between the medium- and fine-sand domains in both current directions. Further to the north, where flood currents are dominant, asymmetric sorted bedforms were detected which show sharp boundaries only in flood-current direction. Comparisons between the measurements of the different years show no significant variations in morphology and distribution of the sorted bedforms. However, variations of the boundaries between the medium and the fine-sand domains were observed. Additionally, new minor sorted bedforms and rippled excavation marks as well as new fine-sand areas developed and disappeared occasionally. It can be supposed that such sediment winnowing and focusing processes take place during periodically recurring storm surges, which change the shapes of the features. Moreover, variations in alignments and sizes of the small ripple formations were detected. They seem to indicate the directions and intensities of previous storm events...|$|R

The basis for this review is the premise that variations in the seabed geology will influence variations in the modern seabed habitat. The purpose is to review the seabed geomorphology, near-bottom currents, types of rock outcrop, variations in unconsolidated sediment texture, the variety and distributions of seabed bedforms and selected aspects of sediment inorganic geochemistry. It is intended that the review will provide a basis for a better understanding of conditions in the modern seabed environment and for possible future scenarios of strategic environmental interest. The large-scale physiography of the inner-to-middle <b>continental</b> <b>shelf</b> has originated from varying degrees of rock and unconsolidated sediment resistance to the effects of erosion by icesheets during several glaciations since approximately 1. 1 Ma. Although ice-sheet erosion has also locally dissected the outer <b>continental</b> <b>shelf,</b> other variations in shelf physiography are identified with bedforms that were generated when sediments were deposited as the former ice sheets advanced and retreated across the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf.</b> There is little modern sediment input to the <b>continental</b> <b>shelf.</b> Thus the modern seabed environment now largely reflects the effects of reworking by near-bottom currents on the topography and the sediments that originated during the glaciations.

40|$|Sorted bedforms are spatial {{extensive}} (100 m-km) features {{present on}} many <b>inner</b> <b>continental</b> <b>shelves</b> with subtle bathymetric relief (cm-m) and localized, abrupt variations in grain size (fine sand to coarse sand/gravel). Sorted bedforms provide nursery habitat for fish, are a control on benthic biodiversity, function as sediment reservoirs, and influence nearshore waves and currents. Research suggests these bedforms are {{a consequence of}} a sediment sorting feedback {{as opposed to the}} more common flow-bathymetry interaction. This dissertation addresses three topics related to sorted bedforms: 1) Modeling the long-term evolution of bedform patterns, 2) Refinement of morphological and sediment transport relations used in the sorted bedform model with `machine learning'; 3) Development of a new sorted bedform model using these new `data-driven' components. 	Chapter 1 focuses on modeling the long term evolution of sorted bedforms. A range of sorted bedform model behaviors is possible in the long term, from pattern persistence to spatial-temporal intermittency. Vertical sorting (a result of pattern maturation processes) causes the burial of coarse material until a critical state of seabed coarseness is reached. This critical state causes a local cessation of the sorting feedback, leading to a self-organized spatially intermittent pattern, a hallmark of observed sorted bedforms. Various patterns emerge when numerical experiments include erosion, deposition, and storm events. 	Modeling of sorted bedforms relies on the parameterization of processes that lack deterministic descriptions. When large datasets exist, machine learning (optimization tools from computer science) can be used to develop parameterizations directly from data. Using genetic programming (a machine learning technique) and large multisetting datasets I develop smooth, physically meaningful predictors for ripple morphology (wavelength, height, and steepness; Chapter 2) and near bed suspended sediment reference concentration under unbroken waves (Chapter 3). The new predictors perform better than existing empirical formulations. 	In Chapter 3, the new components derived from machine learning are integrated into the sorted bedform model to create a `hybrid' model: a novel way to incorporate observational data into a numerical model. Results suggest that the new hybrid model is able to capture dynamics absent from previous models, specifically, the two observed end-member pattern modes of sorted bedforms (i. e., coarse material on updrift bedform flanks or coarse material in bedform troughs). However, caveats exist when data driven components do not have parity with traditional theoretical components of morphodynamic models, and I address the challenges of integrating these disparate pieces and the future of this type of `hybrid' modeling.
