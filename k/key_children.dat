40|$|This study {{aimed to}} find out from practitioner’s {{perspectives}} the importance of parent-child relationships, what attachment means {{to them and to}} assess its importance within early years. The research was introduced appraising literature from an array of theory and research. The themes comprised “Development of Attachment”, “Bonding” and “Parenting Styles”. Each theme was explored, analysed and evaluated to provide a rich insight to attachment. An examination of attachment theory highlights the importance of infants and young children forming close bonds with significant adults. The research was conducted using a qualitative research methodology. Semi-structured interviews were generated to find hypothesis which determined the three themes identified by analysing the interview scripts through inductive thematic analysis. The main findings demonstrated that despite the extensive research on attachment, participants mostly reflected on policy and experiences to offer an insight into attachment and relationships. Furthermore, it discovered how individual key persons have a particular style of bonding and expectations of parenting. Data analysis found an issue with attachments comprising the allocation of <b>key</b> <b>children...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project aims {{to explore the}} role of the Key Person in Early Years preschool and nursery settings. The Key Person role is specified in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) guidance, and aims to provide an adult figure with which the children can form a positive and productive learning relationship. The present study originated from previous research conducted in the same authority which looked at the experiences of children in day care settings (Day, 2010). Day (2010) identified children’s attachment needs in day care settings as being an avenue for further research, and it was from this that the present study developed. The current study seeks to understand {{the role of the}} Key Person in terms of how relationships are formed with children in Early Years settings, and what those relationships look like on a daily basis. This is an important line of enquiry, as an understanding of Early Years, adult-child relationships can help inform effective future practice for Early Years staff, as well as enable outside professionals (such as Educational Psychologists) to design more effective means of early intervention for the children who may need additional support. The theoretical foundations for this research lie in attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969), following the language used by the Government Guidance {{on the role of the}} Key Person. Attachment theory is used here as a basis for understanding early adult-child relationships, and the review of the literature looks at research that has explored the impact of children’s attendance in day care settings. The project is divided into two linked research papers. In the first paper, the role of the Key Person is explored through surveying and interviewing a sample of Early Years staff. In doing this, the following research objectives were addressed: • To examine the approaches that Key Persons use to form relationships with the children in their care. • To explore Key Persons’ perceptions of their role within the setting and the challenges they face. • To examine the awareness and impact of the current government guidance on Key Person practice. • To examine how settings organise and evaluate the Key Person role. In the second paper, the relationships between the Key Persons and the children they care for are explored through a series of case studies. This was in order to address the following research objectives: • To explore the relationships between particular children with adults in Early Years settings through intensive case studies. • To examine the Key Person-child relationship by comparing Key Person-child interactions with interactions with other adults in the setting. • To compare cases of Key Person-child relationships between children who have identified social or emotional needs and those who do not. The findings from paper one indicated that Key Persons do not generally seem to use the Government Guidance as a primary influence on the way they build positive relationships with their <b>Key</b> <b>Children.</b> Key Persons seemed to base their practice on experiential knowledge. Furthermore, the organisation of the role in most settings seemed to indicate a more administrative focus than a focus on building specific relationships. Paper two showed that Key Persons generally had more interactions with their <b>Key</b> <b>Children</b> than other adults had with the same children. Differences were found in the types of interactions children experienced with different adults. Relationships were reported to be close with both groups of children, with Key Persons reporting more conflict with the children identified with social or emotional needs. It is hoped that the findings of the two linked papers will inform EP practice in relation to Early Years settings, particularly in terms of developing early intervention. From professional experience, there seems to be a large amount of diversity in the way EP services work with preschool-aged children and the professionals who support them. Perhaps further uses for the findings in this research could be to inform future collaborative working, as well as areas to which EPs can contribute their body of research knowledge. The following document presents each study separately as individual papers, each with appendices which contain additional information on methods and data analysis.

40|$|Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald) : The {{commitment}} {{to establish a}} new Child and Family Support Agency {{is at the heart of}} the Government’s reform of child and family services. The establishment of a single agency, underpinned by legislation and incorporating <b>key</b> <b>children</b> and family services, will provide a focus for the major reforms already underway. This reform programme contains a number of critical elements: The continued and urgent implementation of a comprehensive change programme to improve the quality and consistency of child welfare and protection services; The introduction of legislation to place Children First on a statutory basis; The establishment for the first time of a dedicated budget for children and family services, providing transparency and accountability for the use of resources to meet national priorities; The transition of existing HSE child protection and welfare and services into the new Agency; The merger of the existing Family Support Agency with a budget of over € 26 million into the Child and Family Support Agency; Consideration of the potential for further rationalisation of services for children under the new Agency. A comprehensive change programme is currently being implemented under the leadership of Gordon Jeyes, as National Director of Child and Family Services. The change programme is designed to significantly enhance the level and consistency of child welfare and protection services. This change process will continue into the new Child and Family Support Agency where Gordon Jeyes will be the first Chief Executive. In addition, an open recruitment process is underway with a view to putting in place the other key senior personnel to lead the Agency. I established a Task Force to advise my Department in regard to the necessary transition programme to establish a Child and Family Support Agency. The Task Force has undertaken a considerable body of work in preparation for the new Agency. I met with the Task Force at their twelfth meeting held last month for an update on this work, which is also being advanced through two sub-groups. In the coming weeks I expect to receive the advice of the Task Force on a number of key issues which are critical to my decisions on legislative proposals regarding the new Agency and in particular, a vision for the Agency, governance arrangements and appropriate services for inclusion in the Agency. As I have outlined, extensive work is underway in my Department, in the HSE, and through the Task Force I set up last September to prepare for the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency. I am satisfied that we are making excellent progress in terms of the necessary preparatory work required to meet the Government’s ambitious timetable which will see the Agency assuming full statutory responsibility for services for children and families early in 2013.
