30|$|Mechanical {{manipulations}} involving electrically induced microfluidic {{has started}} {{ever since the}} Coulter principle was established (Figure 4 D). The principle states that any particle moving through an orifice along with electric current should produce a change in impedance. By this means, the impedance changes are due to displacement of electrolytes caused by the particles movement. Vast areas emerged as a result for example electroporation, electrodeformation, electrorotation, dielectrophoresis, microelectrical impedance spectroscopy (μ-EIS) and impedance based flow Cytometry (IFC). Electroporation is referred to swelling or expansion in cell size whenever a cell experiences an externally applied electric field. Famous work by Bao et al. proved that the swelling ratio of cell caused by electroporation may reflect the malignant and metastatic status of a cancer cell [69]. It is notable that the electroporation efficiency still dependent on cell volume. Hence, the effective voltage across the cell membrane {{is a function of}} cell diameter. Therefore, cell with higher diameter when exposed to higher voltage would be easily porated. On the contrary, MacQueen et al.[70] fabricated an array of planar Ti/Pt electrodes for trapping and stimulating hamster ovary cell and human promonocyte cell. This work demonstrated the use of electrodeformation, which is defined as whenever a dielectric forces (DEP) was utilized to apply mechanical stimuli to deform a cell [71]. The Young's Modulus of cell can be determined via analytical models or numerical simulation. A single microchamber array was introduced to improve throughput of an electrodeformation device [72]. It is able to trap RBC using ITO electrodes which allow for correlation of RBC deformation with cell surface. In fact, the limitations of this method coming from time consuming procedures, limited throughput and the complex physical phenomena of unknown cell properties (varying DEP forces as a cell moves make it difficult to quantify). Electrorotation, takes place when a cell is placed in a non uniform electric field and the induced dipole can cause the cell to rotate (ROT). It is closely related to DEP but differs in the principle that, in DEP the cell moves but for ROT the cell will rotate. Furthermore, the ROT is more suitable for determination of intrinsic electrical properties of a single cell. More details on DEP and ROT were discussed elsewhere [73]. Dielectrophoresis is the electronic analog of optical tweezers. An electric field gradient can be created with arrangements of planar metallic electrodes either connected directly to voltage source or free floating in the presence of electric field [74]. DEP was successfully used to manipulate biological cells such as bacterial and mammalian cells [75],[76]. Another technique called microelectrical impedance spectroscopy (μ-EIS) adopted a frequency dependent excitation signal to be applied across a trapped cell for current response measurement. Previous works on μ-EIS used various types of trapping were discussed [77]-[79]. Famous impedance flow Cytometry is the Coulter counter. It is a widely used in clinical instruments for example the haematology analyzers. Suspended cells in a stream will be passed through <b>electronic</b> <b>detection</b> <b>apparatus</b> which allow for multiparametric measurements. Some detection mechanism improvements made by Gawad et al. used coplanar electrodes located in parallel allowing for differential measurements of electrical signals of RBC [80]. Latest advancement introduced by Mernier et al. demonstated the usage of liquid electrode which capable to discriminate the living and dead yeast cells and can also be used for DEP focussing of particles [81]. Eventhough this technique proven to be more powerful than Coulter counters, the establishment between cell physiological changes with their corresponding electrical properties remain vague. Therefore, making electrically induced techniques quite unpopular for cell deformation studies. This is likely {{due to the lack of}} powerful tools for cellular electrical characterization procedures. Moreover, common disadvantages suffered by all electrically induced techniques are slow throughput, complex electrical phenomena and unknown cell properties.|$|E
