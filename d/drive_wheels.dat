5|$|General Motors' then-Vice-Chairman Robert Lutz {{said the}} {{two-seater}} sports car {{being developed by}} Tesla, the Tesla Roadster, and the rapid advancement of lithium-ion battery technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show, overcoming internal opposition. Lutz's initial idea was to develop an all-electric car, but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery, range anxiety concerns, and lack of public charging infrastructure, they could use a smaller battery pack with a small gasoline engine driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the gasoline engine and the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{so it would be}} a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.|$|E
5|$|Coming into series six as reigning champion, Razer {{started its}} title defence by {{qualifying}} from a four-way melee. It then defeated the pyramid-shaped robot Cyrax on a judges' decision {{to set up}} a heat final against Raging Reality. It pushed its opponent towards Matildas flywheel, which ripped off an entire side panel and caused Raging Reality to break down. This saw Razer reach the semi-finals for a second consecutive series. Against Wild Thing, Razer damaged one of its opponent's exposed <b>drive</b> <b>wheels,</b> hampering its movement. Subsequently, Razer grasped it with the arm and dropped Wild Thing into the pit. Razer next fought Dantomkia, which was armed with a pneumatic flipping arm. Although Razer was the early aggressor, Dantomkia retaliated by pushing Razer into the arena wall. The rest of the battle was similarly even, with Razer's more potent attacks being matched by Dantomkia's pushing power. The judges decided that Razer should move on to a second series final.|$|E
5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the wheels {{on one side}} of the robot rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of the robot was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the solid rubber rear wheels used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used custom-made aluminium <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These wheels were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of oversteer in the drive system was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber front wheels were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked protrusions.|$|E

30|$|In the {{proposed}} method using cooperative {{control of the}} <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> and the linear actuator, the linear actuator stretches to lift the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> onto the step. However, in this motion, the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> could move backwards and lose contact with {{the side of the}} step, and the user {{would not be able to}} control this by electric operation. To avoid this situation, the wheelchair first performs a static wheelie motion on the step to hover the front casters above the ground in advance. By cooperative control of the shrinking motion of the linear actuator and the traction force of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel,</b> the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> then climbs onto the step at the same time that the front casters land on the step. Thus, using this proposed method, the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> can climb over a step without relying on the wheel radius. This advantage was also confirmed by an experiment in which the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> climbed over a step higher than its wheel radius.|$|R

25|$|A {{vehicle with}} two <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> has {{the problem that}} when it turns a corner the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> must rotate at {{different}} speeds to maintain traction. The automotive differential is designed to drive a pair of wheels while allowing them to rotate at different speeds. In vehicles without a differential, such as karts, both driving wheels are forced to rotate at the same speed, usually on a common axle driven by a simple chain-drive mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Based on the load, gradient, etc., {{the vehicle}} {{requires}} {{a certain amount}} of torque applied to the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> to move forward. Since an open differential limits total torque applied to both <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> to the amount used by the lower traction wheel multiplied by 2, when one wheel is on a slippery surface, the total torque applied to the driving wheels may be lower than the minimum torque required for vehicle propulsion.|$|E
25|$|The {{trees in}} the {{vicinity}} of the rivers were not planted by farmers for 'visual effect', they were crops and the wood was used for building and fencing; The millers needed beech or hornbeam wood for mill machinery, in particular the cogs on the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> from the waterwheel.|$|E
50|$|An {{internal}} Geneva {{drive is}} a variant on the design. The {{axis of the}} <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> of the internal drive can have a bearing only on one side. The angle by which the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> has to rotate to effect one step rotation of the <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> is always smaller than 180° in an external Geneva drive and always greater than 180° in an internal one, where the switch time is therefore greater than the time the <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> stands still.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rotating}} <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is usually}} {{equipped with a}} pin that reaches into a slot-shaped groove located in the other <b>wheel</b> (<b>driven</b> <b>wheel)</b> that advances it by {{one step at a}} time. The main wheel also has an elevated circular blocking disc that [...] "locks" [...] the rotating <b>driven</b> <b>wheel</b> in position between steps.|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{the design}} {{condition}} {{required for the}} <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> to climb the step was analyzed. As previously described, for the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> to climb over the step, the wheelchair has to first perform a wheelie motion, for which the design condition has already been obtained. Therefore, by satisfying the same condition, the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> can also climb the step.|$|R
25|$|Babs used exposed chains (covered by a fairing) to take {{power to}} the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels.</b> It has been rumored that the high engine cover {{required}} Parry-Thomas to drive with his head tilted to one side.

25|$|The team {{says with}} air {{pressure}} at 140 Pascals, the pod could accelerate at 2.4 G and have 2 Newton aerodynamic drag when traveling at 110m/s. The design includes a fail-safe braking system that automatically halts the pod should the actuators or computers fail, and low speed emergency <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> that {{can move the}} pod 1m/s.|$|E
25|$|The blower {{was driven}} from the rods linking the {{cylinders}} to the wheels, thus the draught was {{proportional to the}} speed of the engine, not to how hard it is working as with a blastpipe. It is assumed that either the blower was worked by hand when the engine was standing or the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> were lifted off the rails. Details of the blower design are not known for certain.|$|E
30|$|For {{the method}} that uses only the {{traction}} {{force of the}} <b>drive</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{it is assumed that}} the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> can perform up-and-down motion without attaching the proposed mechanism. The wheel radius of the active-caster is assumed as 65  mm, and the height of the step is 100  mm, as previously mentioned. In this method, the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> climbs along {{to the side of the}} step, but a force is required to make the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> contact the side of the step in order to generate the traction force. However, generating this force for contact is difficult without the proposed mechanism. Thus, the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> cannot climb over a step higher than its wheel radius by the method that uses only the traction force.|$|R
40|$|This is a final thesis done at BT, {{considering}} one {{of their}} forklift truck models called Reflex. The {{first part of this}} report is about a preliminary investigation investigating what kind of diagnostic systems BTwants to use, and also which demands there are to meet all expectations on such system. Secondly a diagnostic system, which will show if the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> is worn out, will be presented. In the preliminary investigation, two kinds of diagnostic systems were mentioned. These were Model based diagnosis and Predictive analysis. Model based diagnosis is based on measurements made by sensors at the truck, while predictive analysis is based more on statistics and retrieved data about the lifetime of a truck in specific environments. The diagnosis system for the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> is based on a model made in Matlab's Simulink. Due to poor documentation, rough simplifications in the model have been made. However, one can still see the differences of principle. The main thought was detecting a difference in the lowest torque level from the engine, varying the diameter of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel.</b> By measurements made directly at the truck, different torques could be observed with varying diameter of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel,</b> varying load on the truck and varying friction in the gearbox. Using hypothesis tests, it is possible to say whether the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> is worn out or not. Results show that if the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter is reduced by 25 mm, torque is reduced by 7 % and if the <b>drive</b> <b>wheel</b> diameter is reduced as much as 50 mm, a torque reduction of 11 % would be achieved...|$|R

25|$|An {{epicyclic}} differential can use {{epicyclic gearing}} to split and apportion torque asymmetrically between {{the front and}} rear axles. An epicyclic differential {{is at the heart of}} the Toyota Prius automotive drive train, where it interconnects the engine, motor-generators, and the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> (which have a second differential for splitting torque as usual). It has the advantage of being relatively compact along the length of its axis (that is, the sun gear shaft).|$|E
25|$|The {{eccentric}} crank (UK: return crank) (1) is rigidly {{attached to the}} con-rod pin connected to the main drive wheel. Note {{that this is the}} only suitable attachment point on any of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> that is not fouled by the passage of the coupling rod or the connecting rod. The {{eccentric crank}} is of a length such that the pin attachment to the eccentric rod (2) is 90 degrees out of phase with the lead motion.|$|E
25|$|The {{force of}} {{friction}} is always exerted {{in a direction}} that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note {{that it is not the}} direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.|$|E

25|$|The WC was {{the first}} farm tractor to have rubber tires as {{standard}} equipment, and the first tractor tested on rubber in the Nebraska tractor tests. The pneumatic-rubber-tire-on-steel-wheel combination was more expensive to make than a steel wheel with cleats. To make rubber tires standard equipment while also keeping {{the cost of the}} tractor low, the WC's designers, C.E. Frudden and Walter Strehlow, gave the WC drop gearing at the rear (bull-gear-with-pinion final drives), which allowed row-crop ground clearance while having smaller-diameter <b>drive</b> <b>wheels.</b> Drop gearing had appeared many times before on earlier tractors, but never yet for this new reason—to minimize the amount of rubber needed for the tires.|$|E
25|$|Series hybrids use an {{internal}} combustion engine (ICE) to turn a generator, which in turn supplies current to an electric motor, which then rotates the vehicle’s <b>drive</b> <b>wheels.</b> A battery or supercapacitor pack, {{or a combination of}} the two, can be used to store excess charge. Examples of series hybrids vehicles include the Chevrolet Volt (first generation), Fisker Karma, Renault Kangoo, Elect'Road, Toyota's Japan-only Coaster light-duty passenger bus, Daimler AG's hybrid Orion bus, Opel Flextreme concept car, Swissauto REX VW Polo prototype and many diesel-electric locomotives. With an appropriate balance of components this type can operate over a substantial distance with its full range of power without engaging the ICE. As is the case for other architectures, series hybrids can operate without recharging {{as long as there is}} liquid fuel in the tank.|$|E
25|$|The torque {{applied to}} each driving wheel {{is the result}} of the engine, transmission, and drive axle {{applying}} a twisting force against the resistance of the traction at that roadwheel. In lower gears, and thus at lower speeds, and unless the load is exceptionally high, the drivetrain can supply as much torque as necessary, so the limiting factor becomes the traction under each wheel. It is therefore convenient to define traction as the amount of force that can be transmitted between the tire and the road surface before the wheel starts to slip. If the torque applied to one of the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> exceeds the threshold of traction, then that wheel will spin, and thus provide torque only at the other driven wheel equal to the sliding friction at the slipping wheel. The reduced net traction may still be enough to propel the vehicle slowly.|$|E

25|$|Parallel hybrids, such as Honda's Insight, Civic, and Accord hybrids, can {{simultaneously}} {{transmit power}} to their <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> from two distinct sources—for example, an {{internal combustion engine}} and a battery-powered electric drive. Although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicle's engine and transmission, a parallel hybrid can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicle's axles, while its electric motor drives the other axle and/or a generator used for recharging the batteries. This type is called a road-coupled hybrid. The Audi Duo plug-in hybrid concept car {{is an example of}} this type of parallel hybrid architecture. Parallel hybrids can be programmed to use the electric motor to substitute for the ICE at lower power demands as well as to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ICE, both of which substantially increase fuel economy compared to a simple ICE vehicle.|$|E
500|$|After X1 was {{commissioned}} in December 1925 and accepted in April 1926 {{she made a}} voyage to Gibraltar after which her main engine <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> {{were found to be}} damaged. After repairs she was sent to the Mediterranean Sea. Her starboard camshaft driveshaft broke during a full-power run in January 1928 and a new set of gears was needed, but after refitting at Malta her port camshaft driveshaft broke in the same place in April 1928. By 1930 her commanding officer reported [...] "internal arrangements not very satisfactory because of overcrowding with auxiliary machinery, accommodation is cramped, ventilation poor and the ship suffers from humidity, diving arrangements good." [...] Both the main and auxiliary engines were troublesome and she spent most of her time under repair, before being laid up. X1 was placed in reserve after 1930, before she was finally scrapped at Pembroke on 12 December 1936.|$|E
500|$|Holt {{adapted the}} combine {{to work on}} slopes. He added two {{separate}} wooden frames which enabled the <b>drive</b> <b>wheels</b> to be raised or lowered independently. This allowed the combine to operate on slopes as steep as 30 degrees while the threshing machine remained level. In 1890, Holt built his first experimental steam traction engine, nicknamed [...] "Old Betsy". Built on a [...] frame, it developed [...] from a single cylinder ( [...] , [...] ). The firebox could burn wood, coal, or oil as fuel. Carrying [...] of water, the traction engine weighed [...] and rode on huge metal wheels. Holt's tractors were popular despite their weight and awkward size because they could harvest large fields for one-sixth {{the cost of a}} horse-drawn combine. Foresters soon adapted them to haul redwood logs out of road-less forests. By 1897, the company had about 200 employees and had sold over 800 of their combined harvesters in California. Holt Manufacturing made about 130 steam-powered tractors between 1890 and 1904.|$|E
