40|$|For a {{sustainable}} environment, the green building issue {{has become more}} and more important in architectural design recently. <b>Green</b> <b>planting</b> is one of the important strategies of green building design. In fact, the site greenery ratio and quantity are stipulated in the building regulations in newly constructed buildings for CO 2 reduction in Taiwan. On the other hand, in traditional Chinese societies, the concept of Feng Shui for dwellings still affects people’s concepts of building design and garden planning. So, <b>green</b> <b>planting</b> is one of the important elements to be considered in Feng Shui. While green building incorporates plantings for energy savings and sustainable environment, the greenery concept of Feng Shui for dwellings emphasizes harmony between people and the natural environment. Although, both green building and Feng Shui clearly place emphasis on some of the same issues, in some situations they are in conflict. This study focuses the <b>green</b> <b>planting</b> issue, and tries to expose disputed points and to discover common principles to satisfy both schools of thought. Following a literature review, an experts ’ investigation method was applied in this study. In the final results, four main <b>green</b> <b>planting</b> principles have been arrived at. Green plantings for green building design and Feng Shui concepts need not conflict, rather can mutually progress. Thus, green building design can be promoted more, and traditional Feng Shui concepts can be preserved in the modern age. If we can consider the relevant concepts of Feng Shui for dwellings during the process of green building design, it would greatly benefit the propagation and promotion of green building design in Chinese society...|$|E

If {{this is to be}} designed and managed optimally for both nature and people, there is an urgent need for greater understanding of the complex relationships between human aesthetic experience, well-being and actual or perceived biodiversity. This integrative study assessed human aesthetic reaction, restorative effect and perceived biodiversity in relation to fine-grained categories of woodland, shrub and herbaceous planting. We surveyed 1411 members of the public who walked through planting of varying structure, species character and percentage flower cover whilst completing a site-based questionnaire. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were then carried out with 34 questionnaire participants. Correlations between perceived attractiveness and perceived biodiversity were identified for three out of four biodiversity indicators. There was a correlation between perceived attractiveness and restorative effect yet this was not strong. Colourful planting with flower cover above a critical threshold (27 %) was associated with the highest level of aesthetic preference. Subtle green ‘background’ planting afforded a restorative effect. These results are discussed with reference to the Circumplex Model of Affect. Our findings indicate that people appreciate colourful flowering public planting for the ‘wow factor’, but that <b>green</b> <b>planting</b> outside the narrow flowering season of most species is greatly valued. Planting moderately or most natural in structure was perceived as significantly more restorative than that least natural in structure suggesting that people in the UK may be increasingly accepting of a messier ‘ecological aesthetic’ in urban planting...|$|E
40|$|Field and {{greenhouse}} {{studies were}} conducted to assess the effects of row-spacing on diseases, weed control, herbicide persistence and plant development in peanut. Tebuconazole, when averaged across cultivars and row spacing, effectively controlled white mold (57 %) and rust (58 %). Azoxystrobin also controlled white mold (58 %) and controlling rust (44 %). Both fungicides reduced leaf spot severity in the conventional and twin rows when compared to untreated plots. Twin rows showed a 10 % yield increase compared to the conventional planting. Both diclosulam and imazapic, when applied to twin rows at the full and reduced rate, provided better yellow nutsedge control than when applied to the conventional row. Twin rows yielded higher than the conventional rows when averaged across herbicides in one year. All full rate herbicide treatments enhanced yield over the untreated check. Diclosulam and imazapic treated soil sampled 60 DAP adversely affected all four crops. The advantage of planting peanuts in twin rows to reduce diclosulam and imazapic residual concentrations was not apparent. Georgia Green and Tamrun 96 planted in twin rows at {{three of the four}} locations in 1999 and 2000 yielded higher than peanuts planted in conventional rows. Yields were comparable to twin-row spacings that had higher plant densities. Georgia Green and Tamrun 96 planted in conventional rows, in most cases, had higher yields than narrow-rows. Measurements for plant diameter, pod distribution, and main stem length were higher with Tamrun 96 at most row spacings and planting densities compared to the respective Georgia <b>Green</b> <b>planting</b> densities and row spacings. Both cultivars when planted in twin or narrow rows at all planting densities did not enhance maturity when sampled late season. Georgia Green and Tamrun 96 when planted in conventional rows had the most pods/plant compared to the narrow and twin row spacing. No clear evidence was found to suggest that peanuts grown in narrow or twin rows increased white mold disease incidence. Grades for Georgia Green were higher than Tamrun 96 when planted in twin rows at the standard planting density. Tamrun 96 in twin rows at the standard planting density had a higher grade than when planted in conventional rows at the low planting density...|$|E
