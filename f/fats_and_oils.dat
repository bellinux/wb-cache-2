5|$|Extensively reared animals may subsist {{entirely on}} forage, but more intensively kept {{livestock}} will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> and sugar-rich foods, while protein {{may come from}} fish or meat meal, milk products, legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction. Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, {{in the form of}} pelleted or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the different classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} {{when they are}} part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Fats</b> <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> rich in {{stearic acid}} are more {{abundant}} in animal fat (up to 30%) than in vegetable fat (typically <5%). The important exceptions are cocoa butter and shea butter, where the stearic acid content (as a triglyceride) is 28–45%.|$|E
25|$|Compared to liquid water, {{microwave}} heating is less efficient on fats and sugars (which have a smaller molecular dipole moment). Sugars and triglycerides (<b>fats</b> <b>and</b> <b>oils)</b> absorb microwaves {{due to the}} dipole moments of their hydroxyl groups or ester groups. However, due to the lower specific heat capacity of <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> <b>oils</b> and their higher vaporization temperature, they often attain much higher temperatures inside microwave ovens. This can induce temperatures in oil or very fatty foods like bacon far above the boiling point of water, and high enough to induce some browning reactions, much {{in the manner of}} conventional , braising, or deep fat frying. Foods high in water content and with little oil rarely exceed the boiling temperature of water.|$|E

40|$|Rendang is a {{traditional}} Minangkabau foods which voted by CNN viewers in 2011 {{as one of the}} most delicious foods in the world. The basic ingredients of rendang are beef meat, coconut milk, and spices. The process of cooking  R endang took around  5   to  6  hours at the temperature around 80 - 9 3 o C. There are  2  types of food will be produced during the cooking processes differentiated by water content and colors. They are as following:  K alio (cooked until the sauce was thick brown color)  and Rendang  (cooked until the sauce was thick and dry and dark brown color). Rendang if cooked properly still good to consume until 3 weeks at room temperature, even last month stored in the refrigerator and up to six months in frozen.  As the food is cooked in a relatively longer period of time and with various  spices  it is interesting to know the nutritional value of the food. This paper is presenting a preliminary result of the research which aims to evaluate the nutritional value of  R endang by analyzing the chemi cal characteristic of lipid and fatty acid profile of Rendang. Rendang and kalio as a food  will have  3 part such as a the meat, sauce, <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> (<b>fat</b> <b>and</b> <b>oil).</b> This paper will discuss just for the <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> <b>oil</b> of Rendang.

The profile of fatty acid showed that the fatty acid of kalio and rendang are dominated by the saturated fatty acid short chain and medium chain (SCFA and MCFA) around 59, 48 - 59. 91 %, long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) around 31, 41 - 31. 47 % and the rest are unsaturated fatty acid around 9. 10 - 8, 61 %. From chemical characterization of <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> <b>oil,</b> we can take a conclusion that Kalio and Rendang good to consume. </span...|$|R
