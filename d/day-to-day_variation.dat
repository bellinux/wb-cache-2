50|$|Since {{the results}} of a 24-hour diet recall are not representative, it is not a good {{stand-alone}} method and should be utilized with other methods, such as food frequency questionnaires. A 24-hour diet recall cannot account for <b>day-to-day</b> <b>variation,</b> and so should be administered multiple times to be useful. The method has also been criticized due to the administrator and participant variation that it can cause. As the recall is memory dependent, there may also be bias in respondents over or under reporting good/bad foods, or poorly estimating portion sizes. The 24-hour diet recall is affected by reactivity. The 24-hour diet recall is a poor method for measuring intake for food or drink with a high day-to-day variability. The 24-hour diet recall is unsuitable for large scale studies due to its time, literacy, and economic constraints. 24-hour diet recalls are used less frequently in pregnant women.|$|E

It provides useful information for effectively handling travel demand and responding to the <b>day-to-day</b> <b>variations</b> in travel demand.

Moreover, one-day travel surveys cannot obtain an unbiased trip generation rate for different types of activities such as shopping or socio-recreation, which are not realized on a daily basis [3]. The research efforts for understanding <b>day-to-day</b> <b>variations</b> in travel behaviour better, such as intrapersonal variation, has produced substantial results since the 1980 s. Past studies have shown that there is significant day-to-day variability in travel/activity behaviour [4 – 14].

40|$|It {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that the {{equatorial}} electrojet varies from day to day even when solar and geomagnetic activities are very low. The quiet time <b>day-to-day</b> <b>variation</b> is considered to be due to irregular variability of the neutral wind, but little is known about how variable winds drive the electrojet variability. We employ a numerical model introduced by Liu et al. (2013), which takes into account weather changes in the lower atmosphere and thus can reproduce ionospheric variability due to forcing from below. The simulation is run for May and June 2009. Constant solar and magnetospheric energy inputs are used so that day-to-day changes will arise only from lower atmospheric forcing. The simulated electrojet current shows day-to-day variability of ± 25 %, which produces day-to-day variations in ground level geomagnetic perturbations near the magnetic equator. The current system associated with the <b>day-to-day</b> <b>variation</b> of the equatorial electrojet is traced based on a covariance analysis. The current pattern reveals return flow at both sides of the electrojet, in agreement with those inferred from ground-based magnetometer data in previous studies. The <b>day-to-day</b> <b>variation</b> in the electrojet current is compared with those in the neutral wind at various altitudes, latitudes, and longitudes. It is found that the electrojet variability is dominated by the zonal wind at 100 – 120 km altitudes near the magnetic equator. These results suggest that the response of the zonal polarization electric field to variable zonal winds is the main source of the <b>day-to-day</b> <b>variation</b> of the equatorial electrojet during quiet periods...|$|E
