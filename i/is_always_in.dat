The goddesses are flanked by Virabhadra (Shiva's fierce form) and Ganesha (Shiva's elephant-headed son and wisdom god).|$|E
5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's {{has been put}} forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, {{in the same vein}} as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> the context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E
5|$|Plotinus {{argued that}} since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their {{position}} {{with respect to the}} zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Scully {{decide to}} split up and {{interrogate}} the doppelgangers. Betty tells Mulder that Lulu is causing {{all of the problems}} and forcing her to leave, while Lulu tells Scully the same thing. Later, the two look-alikes pass each other and a sewer grate blows open, sucking Mulder into the storm drain and sealing him in. Scully finds that the girls share the same father, a {{man by the name of}} Bob Damphouse, who is in prison. Damphouse is revealed to be mentally insane, and <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> a fit of rage. Eventually, Mulder finds his way out of the storm drain. At the prison, Scully meets a man that looks exactly like Bert Zupanic. Lulu and Betty meet at a stadium and everyone in the audience breaks into a fight. The other Bert Zupanic shows up and everyone stops fighting. The two Zupanics see each other and a fight breaks out again. The episode ends with Mulder and Scully shown bruised and beaten.|$|E
5|$|Space Travel is a spaceflight {{simulation}} video game, {{presented in}} a two-dimensional top-down view, with monochrome graphics consisting of white lines on a black background. In it, the player controls a spaceship as it flies through {{a representation of the}} solar system. The game has no specific objectives, other than to attempt to land on the various planets and moons of the system. The planets and most of the moons in the solar system are represented to scale both in size and distance from each other, though the orbits are simplified to be circles. To land on a body, the player's ship must cross the line representing the surface while moving at a low enough speed. The player is able to control the ship to go forwards and backwards and turn. The ship moves at a constant level of acceleration relative to the scale of the screen, which the player can control; scaling the screen up high enough allows the player to travel across the solar system in seconds, though they risk overshooting their target and becoming unable to find the solar system again, and scaling down allows the player to be moving slowly enough to land. The ship <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> the center of the screen, facing the top; turning the ship right or left therefore rotates the solar system around the ship instead.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} only Mario at the journey's beginning. Ultimately, {{the player}} will gain {{a party of}} five characters, though only three members can be used during a battle at any given time. Mario <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> the player's party, but the other two characters can be selected before battles. Each of the five characters has {{a unique set of}} attacks and techniques. For example, Princess Toadstool's abilities are primarily healing techniques, whereas Geno and Bowser have offensive attacks that deal high amounts of damage. The combat is based on a traditional turn based battle system with the addition of action commands that amplify a move's effects. The player starts each turn by choosing to attack, defend, run, use an item, or perform magic from the combat menu. The action command consists of timed button presses during an attack, special move, defense, or item usage. This {{is one of the more}} innovative features of gameplay, becoming a mainstay of later Mario RPGs.|$|E

25|$|The usual {{rule that}} no flag should be flown {{higher than the}} {{national}} flag does not apply on board a ship: a flag flown at the stern <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> a superior position to a flag flown elsewhere on the ship, even if the latter is higher up.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the General Assemblies, the National Member Organizations are also getting together for Regional Meetings. These meetings follow a similar agenda as General Assemblies, and are organized yearly for each region. They allow more students of the Region to gather, because the meeting <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> the Region, and the agenda is focused on regionally relevant topics.|$|E

25|$|He {{begins by}} briefly proving the {{immortality}} of the soul. A soul <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> motion {{and as a}} self-mover has no beginning. A self-mover is itself the source of everything else that moves. So, by the same token, it cannot be destroyed. Bodily objects moved from the outside have no soul, while those that move from within have a soul. Moving from within, all souls are self-movers, and hence their immortality is necessary.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom {{straddles}} the higher mid-latitudes between 49° and 61°N. It {{is on the}} western seaboard of Afro-Eurasia, the world's largest land mass. Since the UK <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> or close to {{the path of the}} polar front jet stream, frequent changes in pressure and unsettled weather are typical. Many types of weather can be experienced in a single day. In general the climate of the UK is cool and often cloudy, and hot temperatures are infrequent.|$|E
25|$|The E2 {{mechanism}} {{also requires}} a base, but there the {{attack of the}} base {{and the elimination of}} the leaving group proceed simultaneously and produce no ionic intermediate. In contrast to the E1 eliminations, different stereochemical configurations are possible for the reaction product in the E2 mechanism, because the attack of the base preferentially occurs in the anti-position with respect to the leaving group. Because of the similar conditions and reagents, the E2 elimination <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>in</b> competition with the SN2-substitution.|$|E
