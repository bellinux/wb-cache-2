5|$|The very {{extensive}} survey {{carried out}} (2005–2009) by the Battlefields Trust headed by Glenn Foard led eventually {{to the discovery}} of the real location of the core battlefield. This lies about a kilometer further west than the location suggested by Peter Foss. It is in what was {{at the time of the}} battle an area of marginal land at the meeting of several township boundaries. There was a cluster of <b>field</b> <b>names</b> suggesting the presence of marshland and heath. Thirty four lead round shot were discovered as a result of systematic metal detecting (more than the total found previously on all other C15th European battlefields), as well as other significant finds, including a small silver gilt badge depicting a boar. Experts believe that the boar badge could indicate the actual site of Richard III's death, since this high-status badge depicting his personal emblem, was probably worn by a member of his close retinue.|$|E

25|$|The Ordnance Survey {{map shows}} the complex web of fields around the village, {{but it does}} not reveal that many of the fields have local names.

2500|$|Many of {{the corpse}} roads have long disappeared, while the {{original}} purposes {{of those that}} still survive as footpaths have been largely forgotten, especially if features such as coffin stones or crosses no longer exist. Fields crossed by church-way paths often had names like [...] "Church-way" [...] or [...] "Kirk-way Field", and today it is sometimes possible to plot the course of some lost church-ways by the sequence of old <b>field</b> <b>names,</b> local knowledge of churches, local legends and lost features of the landscape marked on old maps, etc. One of the oldest superstitions is that any land over which a corpse is carried becomes a public right of way.|$|E
