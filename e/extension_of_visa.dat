50|$|Victims are {{certified}} with trafficked {{status by}} the New Zealand Police {{and the appropriate}} government agency conducts an investigation and may issue legal proceedings. If the victim is a temporary migrant, they may apply for an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>visa</b> for a 12-month period. Following the investigation, migrant victims may apply for a resident visa and receive ongoing protection, provided {{that they have not}} obstructed the investigation. The Health and Disability Eligibility Direction 2011 entitles all victims to receive government support, including legal aid, counselling and medical treatment, with full coverage under the Accident Compensation Scheme. Victims may apply to Housing New Zealand and the Ministry of Social Development for assistance in the case of financial hardship. Given the low level of trafficking cases in New Zealand, there is no resource allocation dedicated to these services. Victims are assessed on a case-by-case basis and may be directed to receive additional support from Non-governmental organizations.|$|E

50|$|Heehs {{was briefly}} in the news in April 2012 after the Indian home {{ministry}} declined to entertain an application for <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> his resident <b>visa</b> after April 15. Learning of the affair on March 31, Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram said he would review Heehs’s case. A number of prominent scholars, as well as union minister for Rural Development Jairam Ramesh, wrote in support of Heehs to the home minister and to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Leading public intellectuals Ramachandra Guha and Pratap Bhanu Mehta wrote about the issue in their newspaper columns. On April 13, the home ministry announced that it had approved a one-year <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> Heehs’s <b>visa.</b> The affair became a point of reference in discussions in the Indian and international press of freedom of expression, book banning, censorship, xenophobia, and visa policy.|$|R

50|$|A {{total of}} 3.3 million Afghan {{refugees}} were housed in Pakistan by 1988, {{some of whom}} {{continue to live in}} the country up until today. Of this total, about 100,000 were based in the city of Peshawar, while more than 2 million were located {{in other parts of the}} northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (then known as the North-West Frontier Province). At the same time, close to two million Afghans were living in Iran. Over the years Pakistan and Iran have imposed tighter controls on refugees which have resulted in numerous returnees. In 2012 Pakistan banned <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>visas</b> to foreigners. Afghan refugees have also settled in India and became Indian citizens over time. Some also made their way into North America, the European Union, Australia, and other parts of the world. The photo of Sharbat Gula placed on National Geographic cover in 1985 became a symbol both of the 1980s Afghan conflict and of the refugee situation.|$|R

40|$|The Center for International Education ＆ Research {{conducted}} a survey via Questionnaire of 300 companies in Mie Prefecture. The objective of the survey was to identify what kinds of education should be provided to overseas students {{in order to better}} prepare them for employment in Japanese companies. The investigation revealed that there were few companies which have employed people at higher levels. Further, it was noted that employment of overseas graduates had often not been successful with the worker resigning after a short period. The causes of this lack of success were thought to be difficulties with <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>visas</b> and other legal restrictions together with decisions to change occupation, return home and so on. However, a majority of the small number of overseas graduates students with jobs in Japanese companies were employed in technical development and engineering which is thought to be a feature of Mie Prefecture. It was discovered that introduction by educational facilities and the like had {{played an important role in}} facilitating the process of adoption. In order to build on this small adoption track record, it is desirable to recast consciousness in more companies to more closely resemble that found in those companies that have utilized positively the way of thinking, drive etc which an overseas graduate can offer. In this study we also sought to identify what was excellent in Japanese companies, and to consider what kinds of education, informed by global personnel training, may contribute to better understanding the meaning of work from a global viewpoint...|$|R

5000|$|JEWCOM {{officials}} {{knew the}} gravity of the situation, and turned to Setsuzo Kotsuji, a bible scholar and Japanese [...] "Jewish expert". Kotsuji was a friend of the Jews, and personally appealed to foreign minister Yosuke Matsuoka on behalf of the Jews of Kobe. A conclusion was reached that the central government would ignore the forged and expired visas if the local Kobe police would accept such a decision and let their city welcome thousands of refugees. Kotsuji then obtained 300,000 yen, no small amount, to bribe the Kobe police and get them to approve the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the Polish <b>visas.</b> [...] Thus, the first major hurdle in the Jews of Kobe surviving the Holocaust was surmounted.|$|R
40|$|The Action Plan on visas adopted {{during the}} recent EU-Ukraine summit is a success for Ukraine. It {{is the first time}} that Kyiv has succeeded in obtaining a {{definition}} of the conditions and criteria whose fulfilment will enable Ukraine to apply for the lifting <b>of</b> EU <b>visas</b> for its citizens. Ukraine's strong point has been its political will; the lifting <b>of</b> this <b>visa</b> regime has been a priority for all Ukrainian governments since 2005. Since Viktor Yanukovych became president, Ukraine has adopted or prepared key legal acts that brought it nearer to European standards in the area of border and migration management. One of Kyiv's strengths is also its relatively well reformed and efficiently managed border service. Moreover, illegal transit migration via Ukraine is decreasing, and fewer Ukrainians are trying to enter or stay in the EU illegally. Also, Kyiv has efficiently implemented the EU-Ukraine readmission agreement. The hardest task for Ukraine will be to meet the EU’s expectations concerning values, the condition of Ukrainian democracy, and the rule of law. Corruption remains the main barrier to Ukraine's development and modernisation; the courts are weak and the judicial system inefficient. The main undertaking of the new migration service that is being formed at the moment will be to create a civil system of registration, monitoring and regulating the stays of foreign nationals. This may prove difficult, as the supervisory authority (the Ministry of the Interior) remains an unreformed, police-type bureaucratic institution. Ukraine is lagging behind countries such as Russia, Belarus and Moldova when it comes to the introduction of biometric documents. Another problem is the lack of an electronic information system on foreign nationals, visas and border crossings which would be accessible to all the relevant services and institutions. For these reasons, the complete abolition <b>of</b> <b>visas</b> seems to be a longterm perspective, especially considering that many EU countries, which themselves are faced with the problem of migrants’ integration, are rather sceptical about the further liberalisation of movement of people with their eastern neighbours. In the immediate future, if Ukraine meets some of the requirements set by the EU, it will be able to seek the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>visa</b> facilitations that have been in operation since 2008...|$|R

40|$|VISA (also {{known as}} MAVS, IPS- 1 and Cardif) is an {{essential}} adaptor protein in innate immune response to RNA virus. The protein level <b>of</b> <b>VISA</b> is delicately regulated before and after viral infection to ensure the optimal activation and timely termination of innate antiviral response. It {{has been reported that}} several E 3 ubiquitin ligases can mediate the degradation <b>of</b> <b>VISA,</b> but how the stability <b>of</b> <b>VISA</b> is maintained before and after viral infection remains enigmatic. In this study, we found that the ER-associated inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom 2) plays an essential role in mounting an efficient innate immune response to RNA virus by maintaining the stability <b>of</b> <b>VISA</b> through distinct mechanisms. In un-infected and early infected cells, iRhom 2 mediates auto-ubiquitination and degradation of the E 3 ubiquitin ligase RNF 5 and impairs the assembly of VISA-RNF 5 -GP 78 complexes, thereby antagonizes ER-associated degradation (ERAD) <b>of</b> <b>VISA.</b> In the late phase of viral infection, iRhom 2 mediates proteasome-dependent degradation of the E 3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH 5 and impairs mitochondria-associated degradation (MAD) <b>of</b> <b>VISA.</b> Maintenance <b>of</b> <b>VISA</b> stability by iRhom 2 ensures efficient innate antiviral response at the early phase of viral infection and ready for next round of response. Our findings suggest that iRhom 2 acts as a checkpoint for the ERAD/MAD <b>of</b> <b>VISA,</b> which ensures proper innate immune response to RNA virus...|$|R

When delays associated with visa scrutiny cause some genuine scholars to be unable to enter, both the number of foreign scholars sponsored and the intensity <b>of</b> <b>visa</b> scrutiny are higher than their efficient levels.
