500|$|Sal Cinquemani for Slant Magazine praised it as {{the best}} video for a song from Back to Basics. John Montgomery for MTV News commented on Aguilera's [...] "bad girl" [...] image, writing [...] "though Aguilera's mostly going for glam here, she's also plenty bad, too, {{swinging}} her way into some servicemen's heart, coyly sipping on a milkshake and shaking <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> your even your grandpa had to notice." [...] The video brought Aguilera and Rolston an MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Direction at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Justin Timberlake's [...] "What Goes Around...

500|$|Reds catcher Clyde Sukeforth {{asserted}} that Wilson {{should have been}} credited with an additional home run in 1930 as well. [...] "He hit one in Cincinnati one day", he said, [...] "way up in the seats, hit <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that it bounced right back onto the field. The umpire had a bad angle on it and ruled that it had hit the screen and bounced back. I {{was sitting in the}} Cincinnati bullpen, and of course, we weren't going to say anything. But Hack really hit 57 that year." [...] Wilson's official total of 56 stood as the NL record until the 1998 season, when it was broken by Sammy Sosa (66) and Mark McGwire (70).|$|E

500|$|... "Rain" [...] is {{the tenth}} track whose lyrics talk about waiting and hoping for love. The song {{features}} a crescendo towards the end. The subsequent track, [...] "Why's It So Hard," [...] {{is considered the}} album's plea for solidarity with her audience, as Madonna sings: [...] "Why's <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to love one another?" [...] The following song, [...] "In This Life," [...] was written in memory of friends who Madonna had lost to the AIDS epidemic. The drums were compared to a doomsday clock and the keyboard intervals were also compared to George Gershwin's blues lullaby [...] "Prelude No. 2," [...] creating a sense of dis-ease. The thirteenth track, [...] "Did You Do It?" [...] features rappers Mark Goodman and Dave Murphy. The song was omitted in the clean edition of Erotica. [...] Producer Andr√© Betts claimed that for fun, he just rapped over the track [...] "Waiting," [...] while Madonna was gone, and she liked it after hearing later. The last track from the album, [...] "Secret Garden," [...] is described as Eroticas most personal song. In addition, [...] "Secret Garden" [...] {{is dedicated to the}} singer's vagina, [...] "the secret place where she could enjoy herself." [...] It features a jazz-house beat.|$|E

Colin Gentry of 4Music named the song {{the highlight of}} the album, continuing to write that Rihanna pours her heart out to the listener as she sings about the intensity of her [...] "despair". Jon Parales of The New York Times described [...] "Complicated" [...] as being one of the more [...] "emotional" [...] songs on Loud. Emily Mackay of NME noted that the lyrics [...] "Why do you make <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to love you?/I hate it" [...] were reminiscent of songs by English pop girl group, Sugababes. Steve Jones of USA Today observed that Rihanna's opinions of men are not just present on [...] "Complicated", but rather that it is a recurring theme on Loud, writing [...] "On more than one occasion, she makes it clear that she likes her men complicated and that they can expect her to be the same." [...] Jones also listed it as one of his top songs to download from the album. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented that the [...] "spiraling dance-floor siren" [...] persona Rihanna adopted on the lead single from Loud, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", was carried through onto [...] "Complicated". Greenblatt continued to praise Rihanna's vocal performance, writing: [...] "Even while telling a recalcitrant man how hard he is to love, she sounds almost buoyant, her newly expanded vocals eager to scale the song's high-altitude house beat." ...|$|E
