I have said that Mr. Greg had not Byron's historic sense; still this was the Byronic era, and no one felt its influence more fervently. From youth {{to the end of his}} life, through good and evil repute, Mr. Greg maintained Byron's supremacy among poets of the modern time. It was no wonder, then, that he should write home to his friends,--'I am tired of civilised Europe, and I want to see a wild country if I can.' Accordingly at Naples he made up his mind to undertake what would be a very adventurous tour even in our day, travelling through Greece and Asia Minor to Constantinople, and thence northwards through Hungary to Vienna. This wild and <b>hazardous</b> <b>part</b> of his tour gave him a refreshment and pleasure that he had not found in Swiss landscapes or Italian cities, and he enjoyed the excitement of the 'wild countries' as thoroughly as he had expected. On his return to England he published anonymously an account of what he had seen in Greece and Turkey, in a volume which, if occasionally florid and imaginative, is still a lively and copious piece of description. It is even now worth turning to for a picture of the ruin and distraction of Greece after the final expulsion of the Turk.[5] ...|$|E

The effect of this couple of hours was to convince the House that the government had made up their minds that it was easier and safer to go to the country with the plan as it stood, than to agree to changes that would entangle them in new embarrassments, and discredit their confidence in their own handiwork. Ingenious negotiators perceived that their toil had been fruitless. Every man now knew the precise situation that he had to face, in respect alike of the Irish bill and liberal unity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{reliable}} method for {{estimation of the}} movement and spread of lift-generated vortex wakes {{as a function of}} time to better enable aircraft arriving at airports to avoid the hazards associated with the wakes of preceding aircraft. Operations on closely-spaced parallel runways illustrate how the method may be applied. An overview presents the aerodynamic mechanisms that cause the hazardous parts of lift-generated wakes to spread as a function of time. A computational method developed for determination of the spread of vortex wakes as a function of time is then applied to operations of aircraft as they approach closely-spaced parallel runways. The results suggest guidelines for efficiently and effectively avoiding the vortex wakes of preceding aircraft. Because the theoretical tools developed and the measurements of the components of the time-averaged wind and its gust magnitudes contain uncertainties, flight tests are recommended to confirm and to refine the guidelines presented, and to verify the techniques used to measure the atmospheric parameters that control wake intrusion.

40|$|The long-wave {{instability}} of a vortex pair spreads vortex wakes vertically and laterally {{faster than any}} other known aerodynamic mechanism. Initiated by turbulence in the atmosphere, the long-wave instability occurs frequently. However, measurements in flight of {{the timing of the}} process for a range of atmospheric turbulence levels contain a large amount of scatter around predicted values. Possible causes for data scatter are studied by use of a formulation for initiation and growth of the instability that differs slightly from Crow’s and Sarpakaya’s. It is concluded that some of the scatter {{may be due to the}} fact that the strength of vortex filaments in vortex pairs may sometimes be lower than the total centerline circulation on the wing, which causes the growth rate of the instability to be less than predicted. Another source for uncertainty may be caused by the way that the strength of the turbulence in the atmosphere was measured. Suggestions are made on how to use existing information to estimate the growth rate of the instability, and on how the turbulence in the atmosphere should be measured to achieve reliability.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{pristine}} block-and-ash flow deposits from the May–June 2006 eruption of Merapi represent an exceptional record of small-volume pyroclastic flows generated by gravitational lava-dome collapses {{over a period}} of about two months. The deposits form nine overlapping lobes reaching 7 km from the summit in the Gendol River valley on the volcano 2 ̆ 7 s southern flank, which were produced by successive flows generated during and after the major dome-collapse event on June 14. Both, single pulse (post-June 14 events) and multiple-pulse pyroclastic flows generated by sustained dome collapses on June 14 are recognised and three types of deposits, spread over an area of 4. 7 km², are distinguished, totalling 13. 3 × 106 m 3 : (1) valley-confined basal avalanche deposits (11. 7 × 106 m 3) in the Gendol River valley, (2) overbank pyroclastic-flow and associated surge deposits (1. 4 × 106 m 3), where parts of the basal avalanche spread laterally onto interfluves and were subsequently channeled into the surrounding river valleys and (3) dilute ash-cloud surge deposits (0. 2 × 106 m 3) along valley margins. Variations in the distribution, surface morphology and lithology of the deposits are related to the source materials involved in individual pyroclastic-flow-forming events and varying modes of transport and deposition of the different flows. Inferred flow velocities of the largest block-and-ash flows generated on June 14 vary from 43. 8 – 13. 5 m/s for the basal avalanche and from 62. 6 – 24. 2 m/s for the ash-cloud surge. The minimum temperatures range from 400 °C for the basal avalanche to 165 °C for the overlying ash cloud. Due to the potential of being re-channeled into adjacent river valleys and flowing laterally away from the main river channel, the overbank pyroclastic flows are considered the most <b>hazardous</b> <b>part</b> of the block-and-ash flow system. The conditions that lead to their development during flow transport and deposition {{must be taken into account}} when assessing future pyroclastic flow hazards at Merapi and similar volcanoes elsewhere...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{variability}} in the surface geology potentially leads to the modification of earthquake-induced ground motion over short distances. Although this effect is of major importance when seismic hazard is assessed at the urban level, it is very often not appropriately accounted for. In this paper, we present a first attempt at taking into account the influence of the shallow geological structure on the seismic hazard assessment for Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, using a proxy (Vs 30) that has been estimated from in situ seismic noise array analyses, and considering response spectral ratios calculated by analyzing a series of earthquake recordings of a temporary seismic network. To highlight the spatial variability of the observed ground motion, the obtained results are compared with those estimated assuming a homogeneous Vs 30 value over the whole urban area. The seismic hazard is evaluated in terms of peak ground acceleration (PGA) and spectral acceleration (SA) at different periods (frequencies). The presented results consider the values obtained for a 10 % probability of exceedance in 50 years. The largest SA estimated considering a rock site classification of the area (0. 43 g) is observed for a period of 0. 1 s (10 Hz), while the maximum PGA reaches 0. 21 g. When site effects are included through the Vs 30 proxy in the seismic hazard calculation, the largest SA, 0. 67 g, is obtained for a period of 0. 3 s (about 3. 3 Hz). In terms of PGA, in this case the largest estimated value reaches 0. 31 g {{in the northern part of}} the town. When the variability of ground motion is accounted for through response spectrum ratios, the largest SA reaches a value as high as 1. 39 g at a period of 0. 5 s. In general, considering site effects in the seismic hazard assessment of Bishkek leads to an increase of seismic hazard in the north of the city, which is thus identified as the most <b>hazardous</b> <b>part</b> within the study area and which is more far away from the faults. </p...|$|E
30|$|Diagnostic {{laparoscopy}} should ideally {{be performed}} during the follicular {{phase of the}} menstrual function after cessation of the menses [1]. The peritoneum is the most adherent at the umbilicus making it the thinnest part of the abdominal wall. The Verres needle should therefore be inserted {{in the base of}} the umbilicus. It is also the most cosmetically acceptable. It is inserted initially vertically and then angled towards the uterus. The abdominal wall is pulled away from the great vessels by grasping the umbilicus with the thumb and the index finger. The Verres needle should be held halfway up its shaft to prevent inadvertent damage to major vessels due to precipitate insertion. Throughout the insertion of the Verres needle the patient should be kept horizontal, because only the horizontal plane provides reference to the underlying anatomy. The practice of tilting the patient in a Trendlenburg position before pneumoperitoneum is established is unsafe. Various techniques have been described to ensure correct placement of the needle in the peritoneal cavity. Five millilitres of saline is injected through the Verres needle. No aspirate should be obtained in the syringe if the needle is in the peritoneal cavity. The swinging needle test is not recommended as the tip of the Verres needle cannot be visualised during the procedure, and moving it without due care may damage the abdominal viscera. The insuffulation technique is widely practised and easy. Once the surgeon is satisfied that the Verres needle is in the peritoneal space, the gas flow is attached and insufflation is commenced. If the gas flow is at or more than 1  l/min and the intraabdominal pressure is less than 10  mmHg, then the needle is most probably in the peritoneal cavity. The trocar insertion is the most <b>hazardous</b> <b>part</b> of the procedure. The trocar insertion follows similar directions as the insertion of the Verres needle. The trocar should be aimed at the uterus and kept vertically in the midline as deviation to the left or right of the midline can result in damage to the pelvic vessels. Laparoscopic trocars are approximately 10  cm long and, if inserted to their full extent, can easily perforate bowel or vessels. A better option is a shorter trocar (6 – 7  cm in length) with an atraumatic fixing mechanism such as a screw. The traditional valve mechanism found on many trocars restricts free movement on instruments within the trocar. Plastic sheaths are now available and are a suitable alternative. Secondary trocars are usually placed suprapubically or laterally. Insertion should be under direct vision. The inferior epigastric vessels can be avoided by direct inspection of the anterior abdominal wall. The superficial vessels can be observed at transillumination. With open laparoscopy as advocated by Hasson, the risk of injury to blood vessels is reduced; nevertheless, they still could occur especially in thin patients [2].|$|E

Material and Methods: The data on occupational accidents were recorded according to actual European Regulation, {{the form of the}} record meets the requirements of the ESAW (European Statistics on Accidents at Work) methodology. To analyze the data, we used the multiple regression and correlation analysis, contingency tables, and a χ 2 –test. Main results: Almost half of the accidents were the foot injuries and the most frequent type of injury was fracture of a bone. The most hazardous operation was yarding. Most of the accidents occurred between 1301 - 1400 h (22 %). The most frequent agent causing accidents were Particles, dust, splinters, fragments, etc. (14. 05 by ESAW).

The arrangement and location of structures strongly affected their susceptibility to wildfire, with property loss most likely at low to intermediate structure densities and in areas with a history of frequent fire. Rates of structure loss were higher when structures were surrounded by wildland vegetation, but were generally higher in herbaceous fuel types than in higher fuel-volume woody types. Empirically based maps developed using housing pattern and location performed better in distinguishing hazardous from non-hazardous areas than maps based on fuel distribution. The strong importance of housing arrangement and locatio...|$|R
