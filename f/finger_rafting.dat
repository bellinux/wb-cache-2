Note that the fingers shown here are not interlaced normally (with all ten fingers showing from the top), but interlaced as in <b>finger</b> <b>rafting</b> (with only five fingers visible from either the top or bottom).|$|E

50|$|<b>Finger</b> <b>rafting</b> {{develops}} in an ice cover {{as a result}} of a compression regime established within the plane of the ice. As two expanses of sea ice converge toward another, one of them slides smoothly on top of the other (it is overthrusted) along a given distance, resulting in a local increase in ice thickness. The term <b>finger</b> <b>rafting</b> refers to the systematic alternation of interlocking overthrusts and underthrusts involved in this process. Such a pattern derives its name from its resemblance to the interlocking of fingers.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Aerial {{photograph}} showing two {{thin ice}} sheets (made of nilas) that {{are moving toward}} each other. Along {{the length of the}} contact between the two sheets, segments where one sheet climbs onto the other alternate with others where it is the other way around. The lighter areas are where the ice thickness has doubled due to the overlapping process. This pattern is known as <b>finger</b> <b>rafting.</b> In many cases, it is highly systematic.|$|E
50|$|Rafting, {{also called}} telescoped ice, is most {{noticeable}} when it involves new and young ice, but also occurs in ice of all thicknesses. The process of <b>finger</b> <b>rafting</b> as such is commonly observed inside a lead, once {{a thin layer}} of ice (at the nilas stage) has formed. Although this ice is typically very weak (it is unable to support its own weight outside the water), it contains a lot of brine and is also relatively warm, since being that thin, its temperature is near that of the water. Rafting is accompanied with rapid draining of the brine inside the overlying ice sheet. This brine acts as a lubricant, significantly reducing the friction between the two sheets during overthrusting. Such a mechanism, {{and the fact that the}} upper surface of nilas is already slippery, account for overthrust distances in excess of 100 m (a length-to-thickness ratio of 1000 to one).|$|E
50|$|Sea ice {{is often}} {{classified}} {{according to whether}} or not it is attached (or frozen) to the shoreline. If attached, it is called land fast ice. Otherwise, it is called drift ice and is free to move with currents and winds. This is why leads typically belong to the drift ice zone. They are seen as a stress relieving mechanism, in response to divergent current flows or the effects of wind. Leads are cracks or fissures that initiate inside an otherwise continuous sea ice cover, and open up progressively afterward. They are linear features, though generally not rigorously straight, as they may comprise any number of short offsets at an angle with the general trend of the initial crack. This crack may cut right across both thin and thick ice. Because leads are associated with the initial break up of an ice cover, they open the way to various dynamic processes that can take place afterward, involving the interaction between individual floes, such as the formation of pressure ridges. Depending on the state of stress within the drift zone, leads may also close up. As the two sides converge back toward each other, this can lead to <b>finger</b> <b>rafting</b> of the new ice inside the lead.|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{quantitative}} {{explanation of the}} patterns commonly observed during the collision of two floating ice sheets (ice floes) : simple raffing, <b>finger</b> <b>rafting,</b> or {{the formation of a}} pressure ridge. In particular, we analyze the equilibrium configurations of the ice in each of the two types of rafting and show that these are only possible if the ice thickness is below a threshold value that we determine in terms of the strength and elastic modulus of the ice. We construct a regime diagram to characterize the regions of thickness-strength parameter space for which each type of deformation can occur. Using typical values for the strength of sea ice, we find that <b>finger</b> <b>rafting</b> can only occur in ice with thickness ≲ 8 cm, and simple rafting can typically only occur in ice with thickness ≲ 21 cm. These estimates are quantitatively consistent with most field observations reported in the literature. Finally, by quantifying two common complications that occur in reality, we are also able to account for some of the discrepancies between theory and observation that remain. We show that the presence of rubble may allow ice with a thickness of up to 1 m to perform simple rafting, but multiple rafting of thin sheets does not increase the maximum rafting thickness.
