The number and properties of these proteases are {{the subjects of}} this report. We have identified and characterized two distinct protease activities in a crude matrix fraction from rat liver: processing protease I, which cleaves these precursors to the corresponding intermediate form; and processing protease II, which cleaves the intermediate <b>forms</b> <b>to</b> mature subunits. Protease I is insensitive to chelation by EDTA and to inactivation with N-ethylmaleimide; protease II is inhibited by 5 mM EDTA and is inactivated by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide. We have prepared from mitochondrial matrix an 800 -fold-enriched protease I fraction free of protease II activity by using the following steps: ion exchange, hydroxyapatite, molecular sieving, and hydrophobic chromatography. Using similar procedures, we also have prepared an approximately 2000 -fold-enriched protease II fraction, which has a trace amount of contaminating protease I. This enriched protease II fraction {{has little or no}} cleavage activity toward mitochondrial precursors but rapidly and efficiently converts intermediate <b>forms</b> <b>to</b> mature <b>size.</b> Finally, we show that protease I alone is sufficient to cleave the precursor of a third nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein subunit [...] the beta subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase [propanoyl-CoA:carbon dioxide ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6. 4. 1. 3] [...] <b>to</b> its mature <b>size...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} coskewness on the variation of portfolio excess returns in Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) over the period July 1999 to December 2005. We <b>form</b> portfolios according <b>to</b> <b>size,</b> industry, size and book-to-market ratio, momentum and coskewness and compare alternative asset pricing models. The traditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the three-factor model of Fama and French are tested in the multivariate testing procedure of Gibbons-Ross-Shanken (1989). Coskewness is introduced as a fourth factor and its incremental effect over CAPM and Fama-French factors is examined both in multivariate tests and in cross-sectional regressions. The findings reveal that coskewness is able <b>to</b> explain the <b>size</b> premium in ISE. Hence, the basic two-moment CAPM without the coskewness factor would underestimate the expected return of size portfolios. Multivariate test results indicate that coskewness reduces the pricing bias, albeit insignificantly. Cross-sectional analysis uncovers that coskewness has a significant additional explanatory power over CAPM, especially for size and industry portfolios. However, coskewness {{does not have a}} significant incremental explanatory power over Fama-French factors in ISE. ...|$|R
