3000|$|The generic {{design is}} {{composed}} of in silico <b>interface</b> <b>modules,</b> interconnection modules, and in vivo <b>interface</b> <b>modules.</b> The in vivo <b>interface</b> <b>modules</b> allow the system {{to interact with the}} data acquisition systems. The in silico <b>interface</b> <b>modules</b> allow the system to interact with the BMM, set the execution configuration parameters, and provide tools for model optimization and data analysis. The interconnection modules manage the information exchange between the in vivo and in silico <b>interface</b> <b>modules.</b> The design has three data flows. First, data collected from the subject via data acquisition hardware flows into the system through the in vivo <b>interface</b> <b>modules.</b> The interconnection modules then process and send this data to the in silico <b>interface</b> <b>modules,</b> where the data is fed as input to the BMM simulator. In the second data flow, simulation results are fed back into the system via the in silico <b>interface</b> and interconnection <b>modules</b> and are used to control a prosthetic device through the in vivo <b>interface</b> <b>modules.</b> The third data flow propagates the user configuration data to other modules in the design. The user configuration may include some important parameters for the interconnection of in vivo experiments and BMMs, such as the data transmission protocol and data processing options. Though the proposed design deals with interfacing to physical prosthetic devices [10], its integration into the framework is considered future work.
