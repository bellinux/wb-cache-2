50|$|The {{basis for}} the FEGN is in the state {{recreational}} trails system, approved by Legislature in 1979, {{as well as the}} Florida Canoe Trail System and preexisting parks, refuges and water and wildlife management areas. In 1991, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection established a Statewide Greenways Program to achieve greater coherence among the state’s large ecologically significant places. Land acquisition for the purpose of conservation in Florida dates back to the early 1960s. The Greenways Program was developed to determine how conservation efforts could be distributed in order to best benefit the nature and people of Florida. In 1993, the Florida Greenways Commission was created, and it assumed guidance of the program, which includes public education programs in addition to the conceptual work of developing the Greenways system. Until 1995, Florida Greenways Commission worked with support from the 1000 Friends of Florida and The Conservation Fund to assess current greenways and plan for future greenways and state agency leadership of the project. The university compiled a database of existent conservation lands and trails in the state under FGC leadership. In 1995 leadership moved to the Florida Greenways Coordinating Council in cooperation with the state DEP's OGT. The university applied GIS software to identify “ecological and recreational hubs and links” to integrate into the network. Hubs are areas with highest-ranked ecological significance that are large enough to sustain key species and ecological processes. Links are the areas connecting the hubs and sites. In 1997, the FEGN, as part of the Florida Greenways Plan became authorized by state law. The Greenways Implementation Plan, a collaborative effort of “ the Florida Greenways Commission, Florida Greenways Coordinating Council, state, regional, and federal agencies, scientists, university personnel, conservation groups, planners and the general public,” was completed in 1998. The next year, the Florida Greenways and Trail Council (FGTC) took over the work of the Commission and the FGCC. Support from the OGT continued, and the OGT established an “official greenways designation process.” In the following year, the Florida Greenways and Trails Council prioritized the network into 6 different levels of significance, based on their importance for maintaining statewide <b>ecological</b> <b>connectivity.</b> The university, using GIS software, developed a prioritization of land presenting the best opportunities to create a connected statewide ecological system in 2002. Jason Teisinger modeled development pressure, allowing prioritization of critical linkages based on ecological significance and pressure of development. In 2004 the boundaries of the Florida Ecological Network were updated and approved by the Florida Greenways and Trails Council in September., In 2005 Prioritization of land use was updated and approved by the Florida Greenways and Trails Council in November.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We use {{microsatellite}} loci {{to examine}} genetic {{structure of the}} Florida scrub lizard (Sceloporus woodi) and test {{for the effects of}} landscape variables at the scale of neighboring patches. We evaluate <b>ecological</b> metrics of <b>connectivity</b> with genetics data, which to our knowledge is the first application of these particular metrics to land-scape-level genetics studies in Florida scrub. Florida scrub is a highly threatened ecosystem in which habitat patches are remnants of a previously widespread xeric landscape. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has shown that landscape structure influenced the evolutionary history of the Florida scrub lizard (S. woodi) across its range. Our results concur with these mtDNA studies in documenting divergence between xeric ridge systems and also demon-strate divergence at very local scales. Both least-cost dis-tance and pairwise isolation (a metric used in ecological studies that includes patch size, quality and a modified isolation index) were better predictors of genetic distance than Euclidean distance, indicating that mesic and hydric habitat influence spatial patterns in genetic variation. Our results support the need for focusing on spatial distribution of scrub habitat at the scale of neighboring patches, as well as regionally, in conservation management and restoration. Also, our study points to the value of integrating landscape ecology metrics into landscape genetics...|$|R

40|$|The {{growing number}} of {{artificial}} structures in estuarine, coastal and marine environments is causing “ocean sprawl”. Artificial structures do not only modify marine and coastal ecosystems at the sites of their placement, but may also produce larger-scale impacts through their alteration of <b>ecological</b> <b>connectivity</b> - the movement of organisms, materials and energy between habitat units within seascapes. Despite the growing awareness of the capacity of ocean sprawl to influence <b>ecological</b> <b>connectivity,</b> we lack a comprehensive understanding of how artificial structures modify <b>ecological</b> <b>connectivity</b> in near- and off-shore environments, and when and where their effects on connectivity are greatest. We review the mechanisms by which ocean sprawl may modify <b>ecological</b> <b>connectivity,</b> including trophic connectivity associated with the flow of nutrients and resources. We also review demonstrated, inferred and likely ecological impacts of such changes to connectivity, at scales from genes to ecosystems, and potential strategies of management for mitigating these effects. Ocean sprawl may alter connectivity by: (1) creating barriers to the movement of some organisms and resources - by adding physical barriers or by modifying and fragmenting habitats; (2) introducing new structural material {{that acts as a}} conduit for the movement of other organisms or resources across the landscape; and (3) altering trophic connectivity. Changes to connectivity may, in turn, influence the genetic structure and size of populations, the distribution of species, and community structure and ecological functioning.

In the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California, Mexico), {{the presence of}} seeps and vents {{in the absence of}} a biogeographic barrier, and comparable sedimentary settings and depths offers a unique opportunity to assess the role of ecosystem-specific environmental conditions on macrofaunal communities. Six seep and four vent assemblages were studied, three of which were characterised by common major foundation taxa: vesicomyid bivalves, siboglinid tubeworms and microbial mats. Macrofaunal community structure at the family level showed that density, diversity and composition patterns were primarily shaped by seep- and vent-common abiotic factors including methane and hydrogen sulfide concentrations, whereas vent environmental specificities (higher temperature, higher metal concentrations and lower pH) were not significant. The type of substratum and the heterogeneity provided by foundation species were identified as additional structuring factors and their roles were found to vary according to fluid regimes. At the family level, seep and vent similarity reached at least 58 %. All vent families were found at seeps and each seep-specific family displayed low relative abundances (< 5 %).

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of ecological speciation states that as populations diverge in different niches, reproductive isolation evolves as {{a by-product of}} adaptation to these different environments. In this context, we used Nolina parviflora as a model to test if this species evolved via ecological speciation and to explore current and historical gene flow among its populations. Nolina parviflora is a montane species endemic to Mexico with its geographical distribution restricted largely to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.

Using species distribution models, climatic analyses, spatial connectivity and morphological comparisons, we found significant differences in climatic and morphological variables between populations of N. parviflora in two distinct Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt regions (east vs. west). This could mean that the geographically isolated populations diverged from one another via niche divergence, indicating <b>ecological</b> speciation.

Yet few studies have evaluated if they are successful at enhancing actual functional connectivity (i. e. realized dispersal or gene flow) of focal species, or if this enhanced connectivity is enough to maintain genetic diversity and fitness of plant populations. Here we test the efficacy of an <b>ecological</b> <b>connectivity</b> network implemented in southern Germany since 1989 to reconnect calcareous grassland fragments through rotational shepherding. We genotyped 1449 individuals from 57 populations and measured fitness-related traits in 10 populations of Puisatilla vulgaris, a flagship species of calcareous grasslands in Europe. We tested if the shepherding network explained functional connectivity in P. vulgaris and if higher connectivity translated to higher genetic diversity and fitness of populations. We found that population-specific F-st was lowest in populations that had high connectivity within the shepherding network, and that well-connected populations within the network had significantly higher genetic diversity than ungrazed and more isolated grazed populations. Moreover, genetic diversity was significantly positively correlated with both seed set and seed mass. Together our results suggest that the implementation of an ecological shepherding network is an effective management measure to maintain functional connectivity and genetic diversity at the landscape scale for a calcareous grassland specialist. Populations with reduced genetic diversity would likely benefit from inclusion, or better integration into the <b>ecological</b> <b>connectivity</b> network.

40|$|The primary {{function}} of floodplains {{remains to be}} to ensure the safe passage of flood waves. As flood control problems are serious along some river sections, this also requires international cooperation. In landscape ecology, floodplains perform two related functions: they are riparian buffer zones (vital for maintaining river water quality) {{on the one hand}} and <b>ecological</b> corridors (ensuring <b>connectivity</b> and high biodiversity) on the other. Floodplain wetlands play an important part of the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems as they fundamentally influence the ecological status of adjacent water bodies. It is all the more important since along most of its length the Danube crosses densely inhabited areas with intensive agriculture, large-scale industries and well-developed communication networks. Consequently, environmental pressure on the active and protected floodplains is of considerable extent and sharp conflicts arise between different land use types. Land use types promoting the fulfilment of the riparian buffer zone function must have priority. Unfortunately, only restricted sections of the Danubian floodplain are retained in seminatural conditions. In the Danube catchment 80 % of the former wetlands are now disconnected and cannot fulfil their nature conservation role. The national NATURA 2000 networks are so much dependent on seminatural riparian ecosystems that they cannot be efficient without floodplain restoration measures. Predictable climate change tendencies (increasing drought liability) are also a threat to the survival of floodplains as ecological corridors. Remediation efforts are necessary along extensive floodplain sections and better connectivity is identified as an important target. According to th...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{coral reefs}} had their {{origins in the}} Triassic Period, {{and over the past}} 65 million years, have {{expanded}} and contracted due to a variety of extrinsic factors such as sea level and climatic changes. As humans evolved, so did a new era for coral reefs: that of exposure to anthropogenic stressors on top of the already persistent natural events such as hurricanes/typhoons, volcanic eruptions and Acanthaster plancii outbreaks. Early studies of corals and coral reefs focused on taxonomy, ecology and physiology. The establishment of reef-based marine laboratories and technological advances in SCUBA enabled a rapid expansion of in situ studies and the ability to compare reef processes and changes over both space and time. The documented declines in the state of coral reefs worldwide have shifted the focus of many research programs from basic to applied and management-directed research. Expanded studies of reproductive processes, animal-algal symbioses, molecular genetics, ecotoxicology, <b>connectivity,</b> <b>ecological</b> modelling, calcification, cellular biology and biochemistry have allowed researchers to better understand how coral reefs function and how best to respond to a variety of stressors. Coral reef research has necessarily become multidisciplinary in nature, embracing the social and economic as well as the biophysical sciences. In the face of increasing effects of stressors tied to local activities such as poor land-use practices, and mounting concerns tied to global climate change, the bridging of science to policy development, management and conservation is critical {{if there is to be}} a legacy of vital reefs left for future generations to enjoy...|$|R
40|$|Patterns of {{connectivity}} {{are critical}} to structuring both spatial and temporal variation {{in the composition of}} species populations and assemblages. Water resource development has an important impact on longitudinal connectivity in rivers, and disrupts natural patterns of dispersal of individuals between segments of the river network. Consequently, artificial barriers alter the structure, size and distribution of species populations leading to impacts on aquatic biodiversity. * Quantitative assessment of the <b>ecological</b> effects of <b>connectivity</b> alteration is necessary to develop effective conservation plans to manage the impacts of anthropogenic fragmentation. Connectivity alteration is a complex environmental disturbance because the potential scale of impact is dependent on the spatial scale at which biota undergo life-history processes such as spawning and recruitment. Few river networks have single migration barriers, meaning that multiple points of fragmentation are present and have potentially interacting effects. Therefore, conventional 'control-impact' approaches to impact assessment may be inappropriate or confounded. Furthermore, monitoring patterns of fish population or assemblage structure moving through fish passage facilities alone creates a mismatch between the spatial scale of impact and assessment of water resource development. * This paper uses a case study in subtropical Australia to highlight three potential approaches to increasing inference of the impact of fragmentation by barriers on riverine fish. Thorough understanding of life-history and dispersal ecology of fish is necessary to understand and predict the consequences of fragmentation, and comparing patterns of distribution among species with different migration requirements can identify sources of fragmentation. Monitoring patterns in fish assemblages at both the barrier and river network scale increases the strength of inference of the effects of connectivity alteration and management. Experimental removal of artificial barriers would assist in determining the effect of fragmentation by restoring connectivity. Such approaches would improve predictions of connectivity management and underlying drivers of aquatic biodiversity. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|R
