5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E

They can even grow in cold weather when fuel tank heaters are installed. Parts of the colony can break off and clog the fuel lines and <b>fuel</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel {{can be used}} in pure form (B100) or may be {{blended with}} {{petroleum}} diesel at any concentration in most injection pump diesel engines. New extreme high-pressure (29,000 psi) common rail engines have strict factory limits of B5 or B20, depending on manufacturer. Biodiesel has different solvent properties than petrodiesel, and will degrade natural rubber gaskets and hoses in vehicles (mostly vehicles manufactured before 1992), although these tend to wear out naturally and most likely will have already been replaced with FKM, which is nonreactive to biodiesel. Biodiesel has been known to break down deposits of residue in the fuel lines where petrodiesel has been used. As a result, <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> may become clogged with particulates if a quick transition to pure biodiesel is made. Therefore, it is recommended to change the <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> on engines and heaters shortly after first switching to a biodiesel blend.|$|E

50|$|Fuel {{contaminants}} such as {{dirt and}} water {{are often more}} problematic in diesel engines than in petrol engines. Water can cause serious damage, due to corrosion, to the injection pump and injectors; and dirt, even very fine particulate matter, can damage the injection pumps due to the close tolerances that the pumps are machined to. All diesel engines will have a <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> (usually much finer than a filter on a petrol engine), and a water trap. The water trap (which is sometimes part of the <b>fuel</b> <b>filter)</b> often has a float connected to a warning light, which warns when {{there is too much}} water in the trap, and must be drained before damage to the engine can result. The <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> must be replaced much more often on a diesel engine than on a petrol engine, changing the <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> every 2-4 oil changes is not uncommon for some vehicles.|$|R

25|$|Water in fuel {{can damage}} a fuel {{injection}} pump; some diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> also trap water. Water contamination in diesel fuel {{can lead to}} freezing while in the fuel tank. The freezing water that saturates the fuel will sometimes clog the fuel injector pump. Once the water inside the fuel tank has started to freeze, gelling {{is more likely to}} occur. When the fuel is gelled it is not effective until the temperature is raised and the fuel returns to a liquid state.|$|E
500|$|Australian National Airways (ANA) {{ground staff}} in Sydney checked the Amana's fuel tanks for the {{presence}} of water prior to its first departure on 26 June. They found none. The Amana was subsequently re-fuelled in Melbourne and Adelaide but no check of the fuel tanks was made on these occasions. After being re-fuelled in Perth immediately prior to the fatal flight, the <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> in all 4 engines and the fuel drain serving the cross-feed pipe in the wing centre-section were all checked {{for the presence}} of water. The fuel tanks themselves were not checked, partly because, on the night of 26 June, the ground staff were [...] "pressed for time" [...] because one despatch engineer was absent due to illness.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>fuel</b> inlet/fuel <b>filter</b> housing threads {{tend to be}} very fragile. When care is {{not taken}} to align the insert, it is {{possible}} for the fuel inlet to cross-thread and to strip when tightened in the main housing. There are several [...] "fixes" [...] available in the aftermarket: New, oversized, self-tapping <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> inserts; new <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> inserts that seal with O-rings; and Heli-Coil re-threading kits. In nearly all cases, the carburetor will require dis-assembly and internal cleaning of the aluminum thread residue, especially up to and including the needle and seat, (needle valve), to prevent flooding.|$|R

This is not much compact for the small scale industries and the medium scale industries for its production. In our project we are manufacturing the <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> casing by means of single plate injection moulding die. This is more compact for the small scale industries and the medium scale industries for its production of <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> casing. The removal of pattern is also easy by using of this single plate injection moulding die and also the manufacturing cost will be low.

50|$|Fuel {{is pumped}} from an inline {{injection}} pump to the injection nozzles. The injection pump is a pump with a rotational speed controller, <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> and a pump clutch. Some engines have an injection timing device {{instead of the}} pump clutch. The rotational speed controller is either an all-speed controller or an idle speed controller. The speed controllers are driven by the camshaft of the injection pump. The idle speed controller does affect the idle and redline speed only, while the all-speed controller affects every rotation speed. For <b>fuel</b> <b>filtering</b> a paper filter is used.|$|R
50|$|A primary <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> {{is usually}} {{installed}} upstream of the engine, {{so as to}} filter out the larger particles, and filter a larger quantity of water that might {{be present in the}} fuel.|$|R
50|$|Diesel fuel {{is prone}} to waxing or gelling in cold weather; both are terms for the {{solidification}} of diesel oil into a partially crystalline state. Below the Cloud Point the fuel begins to develop solid wax particles giving it a cloudy appearance. The presence of solidified waxes thickens the oil and clogs <b>fuel</b> <b>filters</b> and injectors in engines. The crystals build up in the fuel line (especially in <b>fuel</b> <b>filters)</b> until the engine is starved of fuel, causing it to stop running.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>filters</b> serve a vital {{function}} in today's modern, tight-tolerance engine fuel systems. Unfiltered fuel may contain {{several kinds of}} contamination, for example paint chips and dirt that has been knocked into the tank while filling, or rust caused by moisture in a steel tank. If these substances are not removed before the fuel enters the system, they will cause rapid wear and failure of the fuel pump and injectors, due to the abrasive action of the particles on the high-precision components used in modern injection systems. <b>Fuel</b> <b>filters</b> also improve performance, as the fewer contaminants present in the fuel, the more efficiently it can be burnt.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> is a <b>filter</b> in the <b>fuel</b> {{line that}} screens out dirt and rust {{particles}} from the fuel, normally made into cartridges containing a filter paper. They {{are found in}} most internal combustion engines.|$|R
