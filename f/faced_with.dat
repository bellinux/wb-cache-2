40|$|ABSTRACT—Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} how {{physical and social}} facial cues are integrated {{in the formation of}} face preferences. Here we show that expression differen-tially qualifies the strength of attractiveness preferences for <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> direct and averted gaze. For judgments of <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> direct gaze, attractiveness preferences were stronger for smiling faces than for <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> neutral ex-pressions. By contrast, for judgments of <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> averted gaze, attractiveness preferences were stronger for <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> neutral expressions than for smiling faces. Because expressions can differ in meaning depending on whether they are directed toward or away from oneself, it is only by integrating gaze direction, facial expression, and physical attractiveness that one can unambiguously identify the most attractive individuals who are likely to reciprocat...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that categorizing stimuli containing multi-dimensional information was better when the stimuli were schematic human faces than if they were either polygons or number matrices. It has also been shown that faces are perceived holistically, and that <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> organized inner features are detected more quickly than <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> unorganized inner features. This study used the speeded classification task and found that <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> organized inner features are perceived holistically whereas <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> unorganized inner features showed little evidence for holistic processing. These results suggest that information about organized faces is perceived very efficiently. The implications for using a face as a data display are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{sought to}} clarify {{the nature of the}} face {{processing}} strength commonly observed in individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) by comparing the face recognition ability of persons with WS to that of per-sons with autism and to healthy controls under three conditions: Upright <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> neutral expressions, upright <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> varying affective expressions, and inverted <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> neutral expressions. No differences were observed under the upright/neutral expression condition. However, the WS group was more accurate than the autism group when discriminating upright <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> varying affective expressions, whereas the opposite pattern emerged when discriminating in-verted faces. We interpret these differences as a reflection of the contrasting social features of the two syndromes...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} makeup on {{attractiveness}} {{have been evaluated}} using mainly subjective measures. In this study, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from a total of 45 Japanese women (n = 23 and n = 22 for Experiment 1 and 2, respectively) to examine the neural processing of <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> no makeup, light makeup, and heavy makeup. To have the participants look at each face carefully, an identity judgement task was used: {{they were asked to}} judge whether the two faces presented in succession were of the same person or not. The ERP waveforms in response to the first faces were analyzed. In two experiments with different stimulus probabilities, the amplitudes of N 170 and vertex positive potential (VPP) were smaller for <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> light makeup than for <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> heavy makeup or no makeup. The P 1 amplitude did not differ between facial types. In a subsequent rating phase, <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> light makeup were rated as more attractive than <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> heavy makeup and no makeup. The results suggest that the processing fluency of <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> light makeup {{is one of the reasons}} why light makeup is preferred to heavy makeup and no makeup in daily life...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the neural basis {{of the effect of}} gaze direction on facial expression processing in children with and without ASD, using event-related potential (ERP). Children with ASD (10 – 17 -year olds) and typically developing (TD) children (9 – 16 -year olds) were asked to determine the emotional expressions (anger or fearful) of a facial stimulus with a direct or averted gaze, and the ERPs were recorded concurrently. In TD children, <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> a congruent expression and gaze direction in approach–avoidance motivation, such as an angry <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a direct gaze (i. e., approaching motivation) and a fearful <b>face</b> <b>with</b> an averted gaze (i. e., avoidant motivation), were recognized more accurately and elicited larger N 170 amplitudes than motivationally incongruent facial stimuli (an angry <b>face</b> <b>with</b> an averted gaze and a fearful <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a direct gaze). These results demonstrated the neural basis and time course of integration of facial expression and gaze direction in TD children and its impairment in children with ASD...|$|R

40|$|Many {{researchers}} regard attractiveness as {{a simple}} physical property of faces. There are, however, several social cues from faces, such as expression and direction of attention, that impact on preferences. Few studies have investigated how different facial cues, physical and social, are integrated when forming face preferences. Here we show that effects of gaze direction and expression on preferences for attractive faces interact to determine face preferences. For example, expression differentially qualified the strength of attractiveness preferences for <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> direct and averted gaze. For judgments of <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> direct gaze, attractiveness preferences were stronger for smiling <b>faces</b> than <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> neutral expressions. By contrast, for judgments of <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> averted gaze, attractiveness preferences were stronger for <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> neutral expressions than smiling faces. Because expressions can differ in meaning when directed at you,rather than away from you, it is only by integrating gaze direction, facial expression and physical attractiveness that we can unambiguously identify the most attractive individuals to engage with {{who are most likely}} to reciprocate our own social interest...|$|R
