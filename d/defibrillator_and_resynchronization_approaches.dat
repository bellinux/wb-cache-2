40|$|Not {{that long}} ago a {{diagnosis}} of heart failure was a death sentence. For example, a patient hospitalized with heart failure in the late 1980 s had a median survival of &# 60; 1. 25 years after discharge. Those with reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF) died either from progressive pump failure or suddenly, mainly due to ventricular arrhythmias. This picture has been transformed {{in the past two}} decades. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and devices (implanted cardioverter <b>defibrillators</b> <b>and</b> cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy) have completely changed the prognosis for patients with HF-REF.

40|$|Many cardiac {{therapeutic}} modalities, including pacemakers, implantable cardioverter <b>defibrillators,</b> <b>and</b> cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy devices, {{are used}} to treat abnormalities in cardiac function and conduction. Both electrical and mechanical dyssynchrony can have deleterious effects including reduced cardiac output and an increased susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias.

In this study, a novel system was developed to study these effects by altering the electro-mechanical activation sequence in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocyte monolayers by dyssynchronously stimulating the monolayers with applied electrical fields and pulsatile mechanical strain. Specifically, optical mapping was utilized to compare action potential duration and quantify arrhythmia susceptibility of cardiomyocytes subjected to pulsatile mechanical strain, electrical stimulation, and dyssynchronous electrical and mechanical stimulation.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundOutcomes {{of heart}} failure (HF) have {{improved}} dramatically {{with the use of}} blockers of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems, as well as with more prevalent use of implantable cardiac <b>defibrillators</b> <b>and</b> cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy. Despite these interventions, however, the overall prognosis of HF patients remains poor. Recently, stimulation of the right cervical vagus nerve in patients with symptomatic heart failure has been evaluated.

However, much remains to be learned about the risks and benefits of therapies that alter autonomic regulatory function for the treatment {{of heart failure}}. MethodsThe Autonomic Neural Regulation Therapy to Enhance Myocardial Function in Heart Failure (ANTHEM-HF) study has been designed to address several key clinical questions about the role of autonomic regulation therapy (ART) in patients with LV dysfunction and chronic symptomatic heart failure.

40|$|Clinical {{management}} of refractory heart failure remains challenging, {{with a high}} rate of rehospitalizations despite advances in medical and device therapy. Care can be provided in person, via telehomecare (by telephone), or telemonitoring, which involves wireless technology for remote follow-up. Telemonitoring wirelessly transmits parameters such as weight, heart rate, or blood pressure for review by health-care professionals. Cardiac implantable devices (<b>defibrillators</b> <b>and</b> cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy) also transmit continually inter-rogated physiological data, such as heart rate variability or intrathoracic impedance, which may be of value to predict patients at greater risk of hospitalization for heart failure. The use of remote monitoring techniques facilitates a rapid and regular review of such data by health-care workers as part of a heart failure management programme. Current evidence supports the feasibility of such an approach but routinely assessed parameters have been shown not to impact patient outcomes. Devices that directly assess cardiac haemodynamic status through invasive measurement of pressures are currently under investigation and could potentially increase the sensitivity and specificity of predicting heart failure events. The current evidence for telemonitoring and remote monitoring, including implantable haemodynamic devices, will be reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Heart failure {{represents}} an end-stage phenotype {{of a number}} of cardiovascular diseases and is generally associated with a poor prognosis. A number of organized battles fought over the last two to three decades have resulted in considerable advances in treatment including the use of drugs that interfere with neurohormonal activation and device-based therapies such as implantable cardioverter <b>defibrillators</b> <b>and</b> cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy. Despite this, the prevalence of heart failure continues to rise related to both the aging population and better survival in patients with cardiovascular disease. Registries have identified treatment gaps and variation in the application of evidenced-based practice, including the use of echocardiography and prescribing of disease-modifying drugs. Quality initiatives often coupled with multidisciplinary, heart failure disease management promote self-care and minimize variation in the application of evidenced-based practice leading to better long-term clinical outcomes. However, to address the rising prevalence of heart failure and win the war, we must also turn our attention to disease prevention.

These devices have both intravascular and extravascular components and infection can involve the generator, device leads and native cardiac structures or various combinations. ICED infections can be life-threatening, particularly when associated with endocardial infection, and all-cause mortality of up to 35 % has been reported.

40|$|International audienceThe {{management}} of chronic heart failure (HF) with low ejection fraction (EF) has changed considerably {{over the past}} 30 years: the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), β-blockers, angiotensin-receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists and recently, the Ifblocker, ivabradine, {{has led to a}} significant reduction in overall mortality and HF mortality. Recently, a trial testing a dual inhibitor blocking the angiotensin-II receptor and neprylisin, the enzyme responsible for B-type natriuretic peptide degradation, showed that this complex molecule improved clinical outcomes compared with the ACEI enalapril. However, challenges remain in the {{management of}} HF, with suboptimal implementation of guideline-recommended therapies, a changing profile of patients who are older and have multiple comorbidities and a high rate of early rehospitalization for HF. Use of devices such as implantable cardiac <b>defibrillators</b> <b>and</b> cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy are also associated with an improvement in outcomes in this condition. HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), a growing fraction of the HF population, remains a clinical dilemma: no pharmacological intervention has so far demonstrated any convincing benefit on outcome. Heterogeneity of the populations tested, role of comorbidities, difficulties in identifying patients with HFpEF, as well as a mismatch between the clinical phenotypes and the treatments tested, can explain the failure to find beneficial interventions. Overall, the management of HF after discharge remains fragmented and concerted action by all professionals concerned is needed...|$|R

In consecutive cohort admitted in 18 governmental hospitals with heart failure between October 2009 and December 2010. ResultsOf 1664 patients with acute on chronic systolic heart failure enrolled in the HEARTS registry, 227 (13. 64 %) have undergone a past ICD/CRT, 148 (8. 9 %) patients with ICD and 79 (4. 7 %) patients with CRT. 1437 (86. 36 %) patients did not go through an ICD or a CRT. From 71 VT/VF patients who are required to have an ICD only 10 (14 %) patients received an ICD therapy. 223 patients have a left bundle branch block and 35 (15. 6 %) of those patients received an ICD/CRT device.

40|$|A nuclear {{cardiology}} test is {{the most}} commonly performed non-invasive cardiac imaging test in patients with heart failure, and it plays {{a pivotal role in}} their assessment and management. Quantitative gated single positron emission computed tomography (QGS) is used to assess quantitatively cardiac volume, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), stroke volume, and cardiac diastolic function. Resting and stress myocardial perfusion imaging, with exercise or pharmacologic stress, plays a fundamental role in distinguishing ischemic from non-ischemic etiology of heart failure, and in demonstrating myocardial viability. Diastolic heart failure also termed as heart failure with a preserved LVEF is readily identified by nuclear cardiology techniques and can accurately be estimated by peak filling rate (PFR) and time to PFR. Movement of the left ventricle can also be readily assessed by QGS, with newer techniques such as three-dimensional, wall thickening evaluation aiding its assessment. Myocardial perfusion imaging is also commonly used to identify candidates for implantable cardiac <b>defibrillator</b> <b>and</b> cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapies. Neurotransmitter imaging using 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine offers prognostic information in patients with heart failure. Metabolism and function in the heart are closely related, and energy substrate metabolism is a potential target of medical therapies to improve cardiac function in patients with heart failure. Cardiac metabolic imaging using 123 I- 15 -(p-iodophenyl) 3 -R, S-methylpentadecacoic acid is a commonly used tracer in clinical studies to diagnose metabolic heart failure. Nuclear cardiology tests, including neurotransmitter imaging and metabolic imaging, are now easily preformed with new tracers to refine heart failure diagnosis.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to determine if seasonal variation in temperature affects daily PA in patients with HF and ICD/CRTs. Patients and methodsSecondary analysis of data from 16 subjects with HF and Medtronic® ICD/CRT devices enrolled in a randomized trial investigating interventions to improve daily PA. Due to the rolling study enrollment, daily PA data for all subjects were not available for the entire time frame and were divided into two groups. Determination of seasonal variation of daily PA was determined using visual analysis of daily PA plotted with average temperature, autocorrelation, visual analysis of seasonal subseries plots and boxplot analysis, as well as Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. ResultsSubjects 1 - 8 demonstrated the greatest differences in daily PA during periods of seasonal transition whereas subjects 9 - 16 demonstrated the greatest variation in daily PA with greatest seasonal temperature difference. Wilcoxon signed-rank testing of the lowest and highest months for daily PA revealed median differences of 0. 30 (p = 0. 050) and 0. 36 hours (p = 0. 036) for subjects 1 - 8 and 9 - 16, with effect sizes of 0. 69 and 0. 74, respectively.

40|$|Who needs a heart {{transplant}}? The aim of transplant assessment programmes is {{selecting a}} patient who will benefit from receiving a cardiac transplant. The recipient {{should be expected to}} live longer with a better quality of life when compared with continuing on medical (or other non-transplant) therapy. Until the mid- 1990 s, the management of heart failure comprised angio-tensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), diuretics, and digoxin. With this limited armoury, there was consensus that many ambulant patients with NYHA classes III and IV chronic heart failure would benefit from heart transplan-tation. Since the late 1990 s, there has been a dramatic change in the management of heart failure. Beta-adrenoreceptor, aldosterone and angiotensin receptor blockers, implantable cardioverter <b>defibrillators,</b> <b>and</b> cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy have all become esta-blished therapies that reduce mortality rates. 1 – 5 With this improvement in therapy for heart failure, we have to reassess who would benefit from heart transplantation. How do we select patients? Quantifying the risk of an individual with heart failure is notoriously difficult. Indeed, around 70 different variables have been identified as independent risk factors. Attempting to measure risk is crucially important and is fun-damental when trying to predict who would be likely to benefit from a cardiac transplant. Heart Failure Survival Score When trying to decide who is likely to benefit from cardiac transplantation, one of the most commonly used measures has been the Heart Failure Survival Score (HFSS). 6 This is a composite scoring system that relies on several non-invasive measures (Table 1), which has been the cornerstone of assessment of risk in many transplant services over the last 8 years. Patients with scores suggesting high risk have been listed for cardiac transplantation. Is the HFSS relevant to patients with advanced heart failure in 2005 ?

40|$|Jennifer Farroni Host, Ayesha Hasan Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Wexner Medical Center at the Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA Abstract: With {{the aging}} of the world&# 39;s {{population}} and the rise of chronic illness such as heart failure (HF), the economic burden, number of hospitalizations, and penalties imposed for failure to meet hospital readmission expectations will continue to rise, thus increasing pressure on clinicians to utilize successful HF monitoring interventions to improve these measures. Telephone monitoring in patients with chronic HF utilizes a proactive approach in the care of such patients, and for this review is grouped into three categories, ie, structured telephone support, telemonitoring, and remote implantable device monitoring. Earlier studies on structured telephone support and telemonitoring suggested a clear benefit on mortality and HF admissions, although several recent large, randomized controlled studies have been neutral. Optimizing medical therapy requires an accurate assessment of volume status by the clinician; therefore, symptom report and weight monitoring alone are often challenging in the identification of true HF decompensation because they are not very sensitive markers. The use of remote monitoring technology for follow-up of patients with implantable devices, including implantable cardiac <b>defibrillators</b> <b>and</b> cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> therapy devices, can aid in identifying HF decompensation. Self-care or self-management is an essential component of a chronic illness such as HF, and it is important for such patients to be engaged in their health care to best utilize the telephone monitoring intervention. System design, adequate staffing, patient satisfaction, and treatment adherence are important for success of the telemonitoring system. Telephone monitoring seems to be an effective approach in the chronic HF population. In the future, large-scale telemonitoring programs may come into place as well as additional remote implantable monitoring devices.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study sought to: 1) {{determine}} {{the feasibility of}} using 3 -dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (3 D TTE) in patients with implantable cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> devices, pacemakers, <b>and</b> <b>defibrillators</b> to visualize the device leads in the right heart and their position relative to the tricuspid valve leaflets; 2) {{determine the}} prevalence of different lead positions; and 3) study the relationship between lead location and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) severity. BackgroundPacemaker, <b>defibrillator,</b> <b>and</b> cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> device implantation is currently guided by fluoroscopy, not allowing targeted lead positioning relative to the tricuspid valve leaflets. These leads {{have been reported to}} cause TR of variable degrees, but echocardiography is not routinely used to elucidate the mechanisms of lead interference with tricuspid valve leaflets in individual patients. Methods 3 D TTE full-volume images of the right ventricle and/or zoomed images of the tricuspid valve were obtained in 121 patients with implanted devices. Images were viewed offline to determine the position of the device-lead relative to the tricuspid valve leaflets. Severity of TR was estimated on the basis of vena contracta measurements. Results 3 D TTE clearly depicted lead position in 90 % of patients. The right ventricular lead was impinging on either the posterior (20 %) or septal (23 %) leaflet or was not interfering with leaflet motion (53 %) when positioned near the posteroseptal commissure or in the central portion of the tricuspid valve orifice. In the remaining patients, leads were impinging on the anterior leaflet (4 %) or positioned in either the anteroposterior or anteroseptal commissure (3 %). Leads interfering with normal leaflet mobility were associated with more TR than nonimpinging leads (vena contracta: median 0. 62 cm [1 st and 3 rd quartiles: 0. 51, 0. 84 cm] vs. 0. 27 cm [1 st and 3 rd quartiles: 0. 00, 0. 48 cm]; p < 0. 001).

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} how accurately the current clinical atrial fibrillation (AF) classifications reflect its temporal persistence. BackgroundClinical classification of AF is employed to communicate its persistence, to select appropriate therapies, and as inclusion criterion for clinical trials. MethodsCardiac rhythm histories of 1, 195 patients (age 73. 0 ± 10. 1 years, follow-up: 349 ± 40 days) with implantable devices were reconstructed and analyzed. Patients {{were classified as}} having paroxysmal or persistent AF by physicians at baseline in accordance with current guidelines. AF burden, measured as the proportion {{of time spent in}} AF, was obtained from the device. Additionally we evaluated the agreement between clinical and device-derived AF classifications. ResultsPatients within the same clinical class were highly heterogeneous with regards to AF temporal persistence. Agreement between the clinical AF classification and the objective device-derived assessments of AF temporal persistence was poor (Cohen's kappa: 0. 12 [95 % CI: 0. 05 to 0. 18]). Patient characteristics influenced the clinical decision to classify AF as paroxysmal or persistent. Higher ejection fraction (odds ratio: 0. 97 /per unit [95 % CI: 0. 95 to 0. 98 /per unit]; p < 0. 0001) and presence of coronary artery disease (odds ratio: 0. 53 [95 % CI: 0. 32 to 0. 88]; p =  0. 01) were independently associated with a lower probability of being classified as persistent AF for the same AF burden level. ConclusionsThe currently used clinical AF classifications poorly reflect AF temporal persistence. Patient characteristics significantly influence the physician's classification of AF. Patients classified in identical clinical categories may be inherently heterogeneous with regard to AF temporal persistence. Further study is required to determine if patient selection on the basis of objective criteria derived from rigorous AF monitoring can improve reported outcomes and better identify responders and non-responders to treatments.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHeart failure hospitalizations (HFHs) {{cost the}} US {{health care system}} ∼$ 20 billion annually. Identifying {{patients}} at risk of HFH to enable timely intervention and prevent expensive hospitalization remains a challenge. Implantable cardioverter <b>defibrillators</b> (ICDs) <b>and</b> cardiac <b>resynchronization</b> devices with defibrillation capability (CRT-Ds) collect a host of diagnostic parameters that change with HF status and collectively {{have the potential to}} signal an increasing risk of HFH. These device-collected diagnostic parameters include activity, day and night heart rate, atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation (AT/AF) burden, mean rate during AT/AF, percent CRT pacing, number of shocks, and intrathoracic impedance. There are thresholds for these parameters that when crossed trigger a notification, referred to as device observation, which gets noted on the device report. We investigated if these existing device observations can stratify patients at varying risk of HFH. MethodsWe analyzed data from 775 patients (age: 69  ±  11 year, 68 % male) with CRT-D devices followed for 13  ±  5 months with adjudicated HFHs. HFH rate was computed for increasing number of device observations. Data were analyzed by both excluding and including intrathoracic impedance. HFH risk was assessed at the time of a device interrogation session, and all the data between previous and current follow-up sessions were used to determine the HFH risk for the next 30 days. Results 2276 follow-up sessions in 775 patients were evaluated with 42 HFHs in 37 patients. Percentage of evaluations that were followed by an HFH within the next 30 days increased with increasing number of device observations. Patients with 3 or more device observations were at 42 × HFH risk compared to patients with no device observation. Even after excluding intrathoracic impedance, the remaining device parameters effectively stratified patients at HFH risk.
