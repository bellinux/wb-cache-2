40|$|Abstract Discontinuous planes often {{develop in}} soils and affect the {{mechanical}} behavior (stiffness and strength) and transport properties of sediments (fluid migration and diffusion). The fundamental un-derstanding {{of the development}} of discontinuities in soils must rec-ognize their inherent granular nature and effective-stress dependent behavior. We use complementary experimental, analytical and nu-merical methods to study particle-scale mechanisms involved in contraction-driven shear failure due to mineral dissolution, desicca-tion cracks, and hydraulic fractures. We show that: (1) under zero-lateral strain conditions, particle-scale volume contraction causes a stress decrease from k 0 -to-ka so that shear strain localization can de-velop in sediments with post-peak strain softening response; (2) the development of desiccation cracks in fine grained sediments is de-termined by the invasion of the air-water interface membrane and ensuing changes in particle forces and displacements; (3) hydraulic fracture results from positive feedback between changes in pore size and the associated changes in particle-level capillary forces (immis-cible <b>fluids),</b> <b>seepage</b> drag forces (miscible fluids) and skeletal forces.

Near-bottom multbeam data have revealed remarkable details of seabed features resulting from the expulsion of mud, fluid and gas.

40|$|International audienceSeawater {{samples were}} {{collected}} by submersible above methane seeps in the Gulf of Guinea (Regab and Baboon pockmarks) in order to investigate the behaviour of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and rare earth elements (REE) during <b>fluid</b> <b>seepage.</b> Our aim {{was to determine whether}} cold seeps may represent potential sources of dissolved chemical species to the ocean. Dissolved (< 0. 45 mu m filtered samples) and total dissolvable (unfiltered samples) concentrations were determined over similar to 50 m long vertical transects above the seafloor and at various discrete locations within the pockmarks. We show that substantial amounts of Fe and Mn are released into seawater during seepage of methane-rich fluids. Mn is exported almost quantitatively in the dissolved form (more than 90 % of total Mn; mean Mn-DISS similar to 12 +/- 11 nmol/kg). Although a significant fraction of Fe is bound to particulate phases, the dissolved iron pool still accounts on average for approximately 20 percent of total iron flux at vent sites (mean Fe-DISS similar to 22 +/- 11 nmol/kg). This dissolved Fe fraction also appears to remain stable in the water column. In contrast, there was no evidence for any significant benthic fluxes of pore water REE associated with <b>fluid</b> <b>seepage</b> at the studied sites. Overall, our results point towards distinct trace element behaviour during <b>fluid</b> <b>seepage,</b> with potential implications for the marine geochemical budget. The absence of any dissolved REE enrichments in bottom waters clearly indicates effective removal in sub-surface sediments. Most likely, precipitation of authigenic mineral phases at cold seeps (i. e. carbonates) represents a net sink for these elements. While Mn appears to behave near-conservatively during <b>fluid</b> <b>seepage,</b> the observed relative stability of dissolved Fe in the water column above seepage sites could be explained by complexation with strong organic ligands and/or the presence of Fe-bearing sulfide nanoparticles, as reported previously for submarine hydrothermal systems.

Measured particulate organic carbon (POC) content, and porewater sulfate (SO 4 2 -), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations and δ 34 S-SO 4 2 - distributions were used to constrain a non-steady-state reaction-transport model and quantify POC mineralization rates as well as estimate the time when fluid flow ceased at the investigated pockmark. An increase in POC content and δ 34 S-SO 4 2 - {{and a decrease in}} sulfate concentrations in the upper ca. 2 m at the pockmark and a reference core implied an increase in the flux and reactivity of organic matter during the early Holocene around 10 kyrB.

40|$|International audienceThe Late Jurassic {{deposits}} of the Boulonnais area (N-France) represents the proximal lateral-equivalent of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation; they accumulated on a clastic-dominated ramp subject to synsedimentary faulting in {{relation with the}} northward propagation of the Atlantic rifting. Within the terrigenous accumulations, some carbonate objects are visible at various conspicuous levels: oyster patch reefs and fine-grained carbonate beds, either continuous, or more or less nodular. Preliminary studies demonstrated that the carbonate beds of the Bancs Jumeaux Formation {{as well as the}} carbonate matrix of the oyster patch reefs are of diagenetic origin.

30|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the origin of}} the <b>seepage</b> <b>fluids</b> on the Oomine Ridge by examining concentrations of B. The level of B in <b>seepage</b> <b>fluids</b> is controlled mainly by interactions of sediment or rock with water, which depends on the temperature of the reaction (You and Gieskes [2001]). High B concentrations have been reported in pore fluids from mud volcanoes (Aloisi et al. [2004]; Teichert et al. [2005]; Haese et al. [2006]; Hensen et al. [2007]; Reitz et al. [2007]; Chao et al. [2011]). Proposed sources of high B concentrations in pore fluids are organic matter desorption at low temperature (Brumsack et al. [1992]; You et al. [1993 b]) and smectite-illite alteration in the temperature range of 50 °C and 160 °C (You et al. [1996]). The high temperatures required for such alteration occur at great depths in sediments and rocks of the Earth's crust, depending on the thermal gradient in a given area. Generally, average thermal gradients are between 50 °C/km and 60 °C/km (Parsons and Sclater [1977]), and high-temperature environments of 150 °C to 160 °C are found at 2 to 3  km below the seafloor. Thus, by examining B concentrations, the contribution of deep-sourced fluids to pore fluids can be investigated (Martin et al. [1996]; Aloisi et al. [2004]; Haese et al. [2006]). Using a submersible, we collected sediment samples from sediment depths of up to 30  cm at cold seep sites on the Oomine Ridge, and we evaluated the chemical and isotopic compositions, especially the B concentrations, of pore fluids extracted from the sediments. Then, we inferred the origins of the <b>seepage</b> <b>fluids</b> from these chemical and isotopic compositions.|$|R
40|$|Large {{deposits}} of barite {{were discovered in}} association with biological communities, indicative of active <b>fluid</b> <b>seepage</b> on the middle slope of Paita and in the Chiclayo Canyon, in the Peru margin. We postulate that the barium source for the deposits {{is associated with the}} high concentration of non-detrital barite buried in sediments from this high productivity region. Barite is remobilized within the sediment column due to sulfate depletion. Subsequent flushing of the barium-rich fluids from the sediment to the bottom water, leads to the formation of barite deposits at the cold vent sites. High barium concentrations measured in pore fluids of sediments are consistent with remobilization of barium sulfate below the zone of sulfate depletion. Fluid samples—collected in a time sequence using a benthic chamber in the Paita middle slope vent sites — document a contemporaneous release of barium to the bottom water at a rate of 23 μmol cm− 2 yr− 1. <b>Fluid</b> <b>seepage</b> in the Peru margin is not restricted to the middle slope of Paita and the Chiclayo Canyon where barite deposits occur, but is also evident in the upper and lower slopes of Paita and in the Chimbote upper slope.

The crusts sampled consist of carbonate cemented layered hemipelagic sedimentary Unit 1 associated with several centimetres thick microbial mats. Three different carbonate morphologies were observed: (a) tabular slabs, (b) subsurface cavernous carbonates consisting of void chambers up to 20 cm 3 in size and (c) chimney and tubular conduits vertically oriented or forming a subhorizontal network in the subsurface. The methanogenic origin of the carbonates is established based on visual observations of <b>fluids</b> <b>seepage</b> structures, 13 C depletion of the carbonates (δ 13 C varying between − 36. 7 ‰ and − 27. 4 ‰), and by thin carbonate layers present within the thick microbial mats.

Combined petrography, visual observations and sandbox simulations allowed a characterization of the dynamics and the structures of the plumbing system in the near subsurface.

The drilling beneath the seafloor since 2007 has revealed chemical and isotopic compositions of the pore water in the sediments to several hundred meters below the seafloor. The isotopic compositions of the pore water in the shallow sediments of Nankai accretionary prism both had negative values, similar to those of meteoric water (Figure  2). In this study, we focused on B concentrations in the pore fluids, which showed that the <b>seepage</b> <b>fluids</b> on the Oomine Ridge as well as Kumano mud volcano fluids are influenced by freshwater derived from CMD. The source fluids of the cold seeps can thus become mixed with SPF during their ascent to the seafloor.

We cannot rule out the possibility, however, that the characteristics of the original fluids in the deeper environments have been changed by mixing with SPF in the shallower sediments during the ascent. In the future, by conducting experiments with water and rock to determine trace elements not analyzed by You et al.

The <b>seepage</b> <b>fluids</b> on the Oomine Ridge have been inferred to originate from horizontally transported groundwater because the δ 18 OH 2 O and δDH 2 O values of the pore fluids at the cold seep sites on the Oomine Ridge are in the range of those of groundwater in coastal northwestern Japan (Toki et al. [2004]).|$|R

A total of 126 species, mostly cnidarians, sponges, brachiopods, crustaceans and echinoderms and 19 habitats have been observed in the underwater images, including anoxic bottoms with cold seep fauna or remains (Siboglinum sp., Lucinoma asapheus, Solemya elarraichensis), bottoms with authigenic carbonates colonized by gorgonians and anthipatharians, extensive muddy bottoms with sea pens (Kophobelemnon sp., Protoptilum sp.) and bamboo corals (Isidella elongata) and cold-water coral banks (Madrepora oculata). Habitat type and distribution seem influenced by sedimentary features, presence of hard substrates with authigenic carbonates, seepage activity, depth and hydrodynamic conditions. Cold seep related species and heterotrophic species not directly linked to <b>fluid</b> venting represent <b>seepage</b> activity indicators and induce habitat and biodiversity differentiation among the fluid venting edifices...|$|R
30|$|In the {{development}} process of low permeability reservoir, acoustic wave or artificial seismic wave inside the wellbore is applied to stimulate fluid percolation and enhance oil recovery in the media saturated with the initial percolating <b>fluid</b> (simplified as <b>seepage</b> media hereafter). This method is called (artificial) seismic production technology or low-frequency vibration oil extraction technology (Cidoncha 2007; Kurawle et al. 2009), which has been tested in many oil fields with certain effects, including increase in injection rate, production rate improvement, and plugging removal. When the technology is used, two processes are involved because of the fluid–solid coupling. One process is wave propagation in the seepage media distinct from that in seismic exploration. The interpretation of wave propagation in seismic exploration is based on general poroelastic theory, with the most classic model proposed by Biot. However, the theory assumes that the media are initially saturated with static fluid. The other process is fluid percolation enhancement by wave-induced solid–fluid relative motion. Research has proven that the wave-induced percolation is relevant in various mechanisms through its influence on the matrix, fluid, and interaction between them.|$|R
