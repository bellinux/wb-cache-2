5|$|At the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army, Simeon I marched from Preslav {{through the}} Balkan Mountains and {{the valley of}} the river Tundzha and besieged Adrianople. While the bulk of the Bulgarian forces were {{concentrated}} in Thrace, the Byzantines bribed the Serbian prince Pavle Branović, who was a Bulgarian protégé, to switch sides. The Bulgarians answered with a successful intervention in Serbia, easily gained control of the country and placed in power another Bulgarian candidate, Zaharija Pribisavljević. The conflict in Serbia distracted the Bulgarian military operations against the Byzantine Empire for the rest of 921.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond's stepmother, Sybil, {{wanted to}} secure the {{succession}} of Antioch to her son, William. Leo, Lord of Armenian Cilicia exploited her ambitions. With her assistance, he captured and imprisoned Bohemond III in early 1194. Leo also forced Bohemond III to surrender Antioch to him, but the Latin and Greek burghers formed a commune and prevented the Armenian soldiers from seizing the town. The commune proclaimed Bohemond III's elder son, Raymond, regent. Bohemond hurried from Tripoli to Antioch at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army to help his brother, compelling the Armenian troops to return to Cilicia. Leo released their father only after Bohemond III renounced his claim to suzerainty over Cilicia.|$|E

50|$|Pope Paul also {{established}} {{that on the}} death of a pope the posts <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> departments become vacant, with the exception of those of Cardinal Vicar for Rome, Camerlengo and Major Penitentiary.

5|$|Dominik died on 16 November 1910. That same year, Atangana {{returned}} to Jaunde and received an administrative post, perhaps {{as head of}} the Ewondo-Bane court, which presided over civil disputes and small claims and was the conduit through which the Germans transmitted communiqués (and gauged the response to them). However, he resigned the post when the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sublineage died; Atangana took over as headman of the sublineage and Mvolyé village.|$|E

5|$|In June 1964, {{during a}} {{performance}} at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> guitar on the low ceiling of the stage. Angered by the audience's laughter, he smashed the instrument on the stage, then picked up another guitar and continued the show. The following week, the audience were keen to see {{a repeat of the}} event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became a feature of the Who's live set.|$|E
5|$|President Cho's chief advisor and <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cabinet is Jung Jyun-jun (Jung Han-yong), {{and is one}} of the few {{around him}} that the {{president}} feels he can trust with any information, no matter how sensitive it may be. Later in the series, he becomes the only reliable lifeline the president has against the influence of sabotage originating inside and outside the Blue House.|$|E
5|$|Raymond, Prince of Antioch, and {{thousands}} of his soldiers fell in the Battle of Inab on 28June 1148, leaving the principality almost undefended. BaldwinIII of Jerusalem (who was the cousin of Raymond's widow, Constance, the ruling Princess of Antioch) came to Antioch at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army {{at least three times}} during the following years. To secure the defence of the principality, Baldwin tried to persuade her to remarry, but she did not accept his candidates. She also refused John Roger, whom the Byzantine Emperor, Manuel I Komnenos, proposed for her husband.|$|E

25|$|The {{call for}} new {{materials}} in painting bore fruit later {{the same year}} when Hausmann and Höch holidayed on the Baltic Sea. The guest room they were staying in had a generic portrait of soldiers, onto which the patron had glued photographic portrait <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son five times.|$|R
5|$|Romney {{became a}} {{management}} consultant and in 1977 secured {{a position at}} Bain & Company. Later serving as Bain's chief executive officer (CEO), he helped lead the company out of a financial crisis.

Active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) throughout his adult life, he served as the bishop of his ward (<b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> local congregation) and then as stake president in his home area near Boston.|$|E
5|$|Sir Clive Sinclair's {{interest}} in the possibilities of electric vehicles originated in the late 1950s during a holiday job for the electronics company Solatron. Fifteen years later, in the early 1970s, he was the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own successful electronics company, Sinclair Radionics, based in St Ives in Cambridgeshire. He tasked one of his employees, Chris Curry – later a co-founder of Acorn Computers – to carry out some preliminary research into electric vehicle design.|$|E
5|$|The Manor of Deptford or West Greenwich was {{bestowed}} by William the Conqueror upon Gilbert de Magminot or Maminot, {{bishop of}} Lisieux, {{one of the}} eight barons associated with John de Fiennes for the defence of Dover Castle. Maminot held the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> barony at Deptford and according to John Lyon writing in 1814, he built himself a castle, or castellated mansion at Deptford, of which all traces had by then long since been buried in their ruins, but from the remains of some ancient foundations which had been discovered the site was probably on the brow of Broomfield, near the Mast Dock and adjacent to Sayes Court.|$|E

50|$|The {{political}} {{response of}} the Old English community was to appeal directly to the King of Ireland in England, over the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> representatives in Dublin, effectively meaning {{that they had to}} appeal to their sovereign in his role as King of England, a necessity which further disgruntled them.|$|R
5|$|The Rhodesian Prime Minister {{acted as}} <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> or Her Majesty's Rhodesian Government, under the largely {{symbolic}} supervision of a British colonial Governor, until Rhodesia issued its unrecognised Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965. British-appointed {{figures such as}} the Governor were thereafter ignored by Salisbury. The unrecognised state's system of government, however, remained otherwise unchanged, right down to its declared loyalty to Elizabeth II, which Britain did not acknowledge. This situation remained until March 1970, when Rhodesia adopted a republican system of government. In republican Rhodesia, the Prime Minister instead nominally reported to the President.|$|E
5|$|When Nazi Germany conquered Poland in September 1939, it {{was faced}} with the {{disposition}} of the large Jewish population. In view of the German populace's tepid response to the orchestrated violence of Kristallnacht, the Nazis perceived an urgent need for films that would move German popular sentiment {{in favor of the}} Nazi Final Solution to the 'Jewish question'. Frustrated with the delays on the Jud Süß project, Goebbels ordered Fritz Hippler, the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> film department, to sack Brauer and bring in Veit Harlan to take over as director.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged {{that at the time}} when he, as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E
50|$|Sudarshana Chakra: The magical Chakra, a {{spinning}} disc with sharp outer spears. The Sudarshan flies at {{the command of}} Krishna, spinning away to tear off the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> opponents, or to perform any function desired by Vishnu.

50|$|Each of {{the nine}} rulers serves as the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own state, {{as well as the}} <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the {{religion}} <b>of</b> Islam in <b>his</b> state. As with other constitutional monarchs around the world, the rulers do not participate in the actual governance in their states; instead, each of them is bound by convention to act on the advice <b>of</b> the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> government <b>of</b> <b>his</b> state, known as Menteri Besar (pl. Menteri-menteri Besar). However, the ruler of each state has discretionary powers in appointing the Menteri Besar that commands a majority in the state legislative assembly, and refusing a dissolution of the state assembly when requested by the Menteri Besar.|$|R
