40|$|A {{study was}} made of the pumping {{capacity}} of pitched blade impellers (two, three, four, five and six blade pitched blade impellers with pitch angles α = 35 ° and 45 °) coaxially located in a cylindrical pilot plant vessel with cylindrical <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> provided with a standard dished bottom. The <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> was equipped with four equally spaced radial baffles above the impeller pumping liquid upwards towards the liquid surface. In all investigated cases the liquid aspect ratio H/T = 1. 2 - 1. 5, the <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> / vessel diameter ratios DT /T = 0. 2 and 0. 4 and the impeller / <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> diameter ratio D/DT = 0. 875. The pumping capacity of the impeller was calculated from the radial profile of the axial component of the mean velocity in the <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> below the impeller at such an axial distance from the impeller that the rotor does not affect the vorticity of the flow. The mean velocity was measured using a laser Doppler anemometer with forward scatter mode in a transparent <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> and a transparent vessel of diameter T = 400 mm. Two series of experiments were performed, both of them under a turbulent regime of flow of the agitated liquid. First, the optimum height of the dished bottom was sought, and then the dependences of the dimensionless flow rate criterion and the impeller power number on the number of impeller blades were determined for both pitch angles tested under conditions of optimum ratio HT /DT. It follows from the results of the experiments that the optimum ratio HT /DT = 0. 25 when the cross sectional areas of the horizontal flow around the bottom and the vertical inflow to the <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> are the same. For all the tested pitched blade impellers the impeller power number when α = 45 ° exceeds the value of this quantity when pitch angle α  =   35 °, while the flow rate number when α = 35 ° exceeds this quantity when α = 45 °. On the other hand, the absolute values of the impeller power number when the <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> was introduced correspond fairly well to the dimensionless impeller power input measured in a system without a <b>draught</b> <b>tube.</b> However, the absolute values of the flow rate number found in the former system are significantly lower than the dimensionless impeller pumping capacity determined in the latter system. The hydraulic efficiency of pitched blade impellers N 3 Qp/Po for the investigated geometry of the agitated systems does not depend on the number of impeller blades, but it is significantly lower than the quantity determined in an agitated system with a dished bottom but without the <b>draught</b> <b>tube.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|Static mixers were {{introduced}} in the <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> of a three-phase, concentric tube type airlift bioreactor, resulting in a 30 % increase in ethanol productivity during glucose fermentation with a highly flocculent strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Increased productivity was obtained {{as a consequence of}} the floc size reduction provoked by the new design of the <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> and of the smaller applied aeration rates, allowing a higher dilution rate to be used. Steady state data at different dilution rates were measured for both systems and the results were compared in terms of specific consumption / production rates and ethanol productivity. An approach based on heterogeneous catalysis principles was used in order to consider the presence of porous yeast flocs. Total glucose conversion was achieved at a dilution rate of 0. 34 hˉ¹. The smaller floc size contributed to the higher observed reaction rates by reducing diffusional limitations inside the flocs. The respiratory quotient had a constant value (around 23) at all dilution rates, meaning that the metabolic state of the cells in the flocs remained constant, having a strong fermentative metabolism.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{model of}} fluid circulation in polymerization reactors agitated by helical ribbon impellers is presented. An expression is {{developed for the}} circulatory flow generated by a double helical impeller in a reactor with a <b>draught</b> <b>tube.</b> The product of circulation time and ribbon rotational speed is predicted to be a function only of geometric variables for Newtonian fluids in the viscous flow regime. The circulation of Newtonian fluids in an experimental reactor is investigated to verify the model. There is good agreement between the model and experimental results for Reynolds numbers less than 500. At higher Reynolds numbers, inertial effects increase fluid circulation times. Preliminary data are also presented for non-Newtonian fluids. The implications of these results in the scale-up of polymerization reactors are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|The hydrodynamics of biotechnological {{processes}} is complex. So far, {{few studies}} {{were made with}} bioreactors of the airlift type with an enlarged degassing zone. In this work, the influence of solids loading, solids specific gravity and <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> dimensions on mixing and circulation times and critical air flow rate for an internal loop airlift bioreactor with an enlarged sedimentation/degassing zone is studied. The {{results indicate that the}} critical air flow rate as well as the mixing time increase with an increase in solids loading in the bioreactor. Circulation time presents a maximum for a solids load between 5 and 10 % (v/v). It is also shown that small variations in solids specific gravity, for values close to that of the liquid, have a significant influence on the critical air flow rate and on the mixing time. An optimal (minimal) value for the circulation time and for the critical air flow rate was obtained for a riser to down comer diameter ratio of 0. 46.

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} behaviour of a 60 l threephase airlift bioreactor, of the concentric <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> type, with {{an enlarged}} degassing zone has been studied. Ca-alginate beads {{were used as}} the solid phase. Airflow rate (from 1. 9 to 90. 2 l/min), solids loading (0 % to 40 % (v/v)) and solids density (1016 and 1038 kg/m³) were manipulated and their influence on solids and gas holdup, circulation and mixing times and in the interstitial liquid velocity was determined. Riser and downcomer solids holdup was found to decrease {{with the increase of}} airflow rate and to increase with solids loading and density. On the contrary, gas holdup in the riser and in the downcomer increased with airflow rate and decreased with solids loading and density. By increasing airflow rate, a decrease in circulation time was observed while the effects of solids loading and density were negligible. Mixing time decreased with airflow rate, increased with solids density, in the studied range, and presented a maximum for solids loading of approximately 20 % (v/v).

An experimental rig was built up that consist of air lift loop reactor was constructed with draft tube of 9 cm diameter and 1. 25 m in height extends vertically in the center of and 1. 5 m height of outer rectangular Plexiglas box (29 x 15. 5 cm) and the solid particlesgranular activated carbon (GAC) were put in the annulus and gas was spared through the inner draft tube using a multi hole pouros distributor whereas liquid flowed through the down comer and a stable circulating liquid flow is induced by the density difference between the aerated liquid in the <b>draught</b> <b>tube</b> and the annulus. The draft tube is constructed to be open at both ends and was fitted with three supports at the upper, medium and the lower end of the column so as to locate it in central position at any distance above the base. A mechanism is provide to maintain constant liquid level inside the reactor, the mechanism to maintain constant liquid level is a valve or a raised outlet tube raised to the level of the liquid present in the reactor. The adsorption, stripping and oxidation processes take place during the circulation of oxidized waste water through (GAC) bed in annulus and this step give more time to complete the stripping, oxidation and adsorption processes in high efficiency. The major finding suggests that the air flow rate at 7 L/min and a molar ratio of MTBE/H 2 O 2 equal 20 over the synthetic wastewater caused a greater removal of MTBE.
