500|$|The order Anura (from the Ancient Greek a(n)- meaning [...] "without" [...] and oura meaning [...] "tail") {{comprises}} the frogs and toads. They usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them, shorter forelimbs, webbed toes with no claws, no tails, large eyes and glandular moist skin. Members of this order with smooth skins are {{commonly referred to}} as frogs, while those with [...] skins are known as toads. The difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule. Members of the family Bufonidae are known as the [...] "true toads". Frogs range in size from the [...] <b>Goliath</b> <b>frog</b> (Conraua goliath) of West Africa to the [...] Paedophryne amauensis, first described in Papua New Guinea in 2012, which is also the smallest known vertebrate. Although most species are associated with water and damp habitats, some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts. They are found worldwide except for polar areas.|$|E
500|$|Frogs {{range in}} size from the {{recently}} discovered [...] Paedophryne amauensis of Papua New Guinea to the [...] <b>goliath</b> <b>frog</b> (Conraua goliath) of Cameroon. The skin hangs loosely on the body {{because of the lack of}} loose connective tissue. Frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is transparent to protect the eyes underwater, and two vary from translucent to opaque. They have a tympanum on each side of their heads which is involved in hearing and, in some species, is covered by skin. True toads completely lack teeth, but most frogs have them, specifically pedicellate teeth in which the crown is separated from the root by fibrous tissue. These are on the edge of the upper jaw and vomerine teeth are also on the roof of their mouths. No teeth are in the lower jaw and frogs usually swallow their food whole. The teeth are mainly used to grip the prey and keep it in place till swallowed, a process assisted by retracting the eyes into the head. The African bullfrog (Pyxicephalus), which preys on relatively large animals such as mice and other frogs, has cone shaped bony projections called odontoid processes at the front of the lower jaw which function like teeth.|$|E
50|$|Goliath tadpoles are herbivorous {{and feed}} {{on a single}} aquatic plant, Dicraeia warmingii, found only near waterfalls and rapids, which may help explain their {{restricted}} range. Adult <b>goliath</b> <b>frogs</b> feed on spiders, worms, and insects, such as dragonflies and locusts. They also eat smaller frogs, crabs, baby turtles, and young snakes. A bat reportedly {{was found in a}} <b>goliath</b> <b>frog's</b> stomach.|$|R
50|$|Brazaitis was {{involved}} in field herpetological studies, including the NYZS Nixon Griffis expedition to Cameroon in 1981 to capture <b>Goliath</b> <b>frogs.</b> He also led expeditions to study crocodilian population biology on Palau and throughout South America.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goliath</b> <b>frogs</b> are {{considered}} {{to be a source of}} food in some parts of their native range. They were also extensively exported to zoos and animal dealers to be sold as pets. Unfortunately, these frogs fail to thrive in captivity and almost never reproduce there. Due to their classification as an endangered species, the Equatorial Guinean government has declared that no more than 300 goliaths may be exported per year.|$|R

50|$|The <b>goliath</b> <b>frog</b> {{can live}} up to 15 years in the wild. In captivity, they can {{live up to}} 21 years. It is preyed upon by snakes, Nile crocodiles, and Nile monitors, among other predators.|$|E
50|$|Typically, true frogs are {{smooth and}} moist-skinned, with large, {{powerful}} legs and extensively webbed feet. The true frogs vary greatly in size, ranging from small - {{such as the}} wood frog (Lithobates sylvatica) - to the largest frog in the world, the <b>goliath</b> <b>frog</b> (Conraua goliath).|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} 105 mammal species which {{includes}} 16 species of primates. Some of the primate species recorded are Colobus satanas, Cercocebus torquatus, mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Other mammal species include elephants (bush elephants, Loxodonta africana, and forest elephants, Loxodonta cyclotis), and shrews (Crocidura grassei). Sixty-five species of reptiles are reported, including crocodiles. Amphibians reported include Petropedetes palmipes and Leptodactylodon stevarti {{which are in}} the IUCN Red List. <b>Goliath</b> <b>frogs</b> (Conraura <b>goliath)</b> {{are found in the}} southern part of the park.|$|R
50|$|Conraua robusta, the Cameroon {{slippery}} frog, is {{a species}} of frog in the Conrauidae family found in western Cameroon and eastern Nigeria. This species is congeneric to the <b>goliath</b> <b>frog,</b> the largest known frog species in the world, they are extremely developed frogs, living in colder, fast-moving river currents and streams.|$|E
50|$|Monte Alén National Park {{is located}} {{near the center of}} Equatorial Guinea. It was {{established}} in 1990. With an area of 2000 km2, it is the country's largest national park. The <b>goliath</b> <b>frog</b> (Conraua goliath), one of the prominent amphibians found in the park, is the biggest frog in the world; hunting it is prohibited.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species may}} {{have grown to}} 41 cm and 4.5 kg — larger than any living frogs, {{including}} the largest known species, the <b>goliath</b> <b>frog,</b> which can be up to 32 cm. The head was big, and bones of the skull roof show a rugous external surface, indicating at least parts of the head may have borne bony scales, called scutes.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an {{expedition}} led by Jacques Cousteau reported frogs up to 50 cm in outstretched length and 1 kg in weight, making these {{some of the}} largest exclusively aquatic frogs in the world (the fully aquatic Lake Junin frog is larger, as is the African <b>goliath</b> <b>frog,</b> which sometimes can be seen on land). The snout-vent length is typically 7.5 - 13.8 cm. Females grow larger than males.|$|E
50|$|In {{a sample}} of 15 individuals, weights ranged between 600 and 3250 g, and snout-vent lengths were between 17 and 32 cm. Their eyes can be nearly 2.5 cm in diameter. The {{conspicuous}} tympanum has a diameter around 0.5 cm and is separated from the eye by about 5 cm in adults. <b>Goliath</b> <b>frog</b> eggs and tadpoles {{are about the same}} size as other frogs despite their very large adult form.|$|E
50|$|The <b>goliath</b> <b>frog</b> or giant {{slippery}} frog (Conraua goliath) is {{the largest}} living frog on Earth. Specimens can grow up to 32 cm (12.6 in) in length from snout to vent, and weigh up to 3.25 kg (7.17 lb). This species has a relatively small habitat range in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. Its numbers are dwindling due to habitat destruction and its collection for food and the pet trade.|$|E
50|$|Like most amphibians, {{water is}} vital for their reproduction. Because the <b>goliath</b> <b>frog</b> lacks a vocal sac, it does not produce mating calls, a {{behavior}} generally present in frogs and toads. Males construct spawning and breeding areas alongside and within rivers by pushing rocks into semicircular patterns. The egg masses consist of several hundred eggs, approximately 3.5 mm each, attached to vegetation {{at the bottom of}} rivers. Larval development takes between 85 and 95 days.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Morphology== These frogs {{are very}} muscular, have very {{well-developed}} upper leg muscles, have superb jumping and swimming capabilities, and can overpower large prey.The Cameroon slippery frog {{is smaller than}} the <b>goliath</b> <b>frog,</b> which can grow to 25 - 32 cm in snout-vent length; even larger individuals have been reported. The Cameroon slippery frog is capable of killing mice, rats, or comparable vertebrates and large insects. Their lifestyle, habitats, and ecology are still rather unknown.|$|E
50|$|Bangem area also {{is home to}} {{many species}} of {{interesting}} birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes as well. Including the world's largest frog, the <b>Goliath</b> <b>frog,</b> the Mount Kupe Brush Shrike, various species of hornbills etc. Furthermore, the nearby Lake Bermin boasts of the highest species diversity of fishes {{as compared to the}} size of the lake, of any lake in the world. The 9 tilapia species are endemic sister species, implying sympatric speciation, making it of critical interest to conservationists and evolutionary biologists alike.|$|E
50|$|Conraua derooi {{are large}} frogs (though {{much smaller than}} their relative, the <b>goliath</b> <b>frog</b> Conraua goliath), with males {{measuring}} 76 - 84 mm and females about 74 - 82 mm in snout-vent length. The head is relatively large with prominent eyes and a fairly small snout. The tympanum is not visible externally. The hindlimbs are very long and robust. The toes are long and have distinct adhesive discs and webbing extending midway to the discs. The forelimbs are short but muscular with webbed fingers.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>goliath</b> <b>frog</b> is {{normally}} found in and near fast-flowing rivers with sandy bottoms in the Middle African countries of Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. [...] These rivers are usually clear and highly oxygenated. Their actual range spans {{from the last}} 200 km of the Sanaga basin in Cameroon to the north to the last 50 km of the Benito River basin in Equatorial Guinea to the south. The river systems in which these frogs live are often found in dense, extremely humid areas with relatively high temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife in {{the area}} {{includes}} forest elephants and many primates such as Cross River gorillas and chimpanzees (particularly in Cross River National Park in Nigeria), while Preuss's red colobus (Procolobus pennanti preussi) is found only in this ecoregion {{and a number of}} others are nearly endemic including red-eared guenon (Cercopithecus erythrotis), crowned guenon (Cercopithecus pogonias), drills (Mandrillus leucophaeus), northern needle-clawed bushbaby (Euoticus pallidus), and Pennant's colobus, one population of which is found on Bioko. There is also a great variety of amphibians and reptlies including the <b>Goliath</b> <b>frog.</b> The forests are also extremely rich in butterflies including the Charaxes superbus and Charaxes acraeoides.|$|E
50|$|Both {{males and}} females grow to an adult length of 24 to 40 cm from snout to vent, with a total length of 30 to 74 cm, making them the third-largest aquatic {{salamander}} species in the world (after the Chinese giant salamander and the Japanese giant salamander) and the largest in North America. An adult weighs 1.5 to 2.5 kg, making them the fourth heaviest living amphibian in the world after their Chinese and Japanese cousins and the <b>goliath</b> <b>frog,</b> while the largest cane toads may also weigh {{as much as a}} hellbender. Hellbenders reach sexual maturity at about five years of age, and may live 30 years in captivity.|$|E
50|$|The {{smallest}} amphibian (and vertebrate) in {{the world}} is a microhylid frog from New Guinea (Paedophryne amauensis) first discovered in 2012. It has an average length of 7.7 mm and is part of a genus that contains four of the world's ten smallest frog species. The largest living amphibian is the 1.8 m Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existed—the extinct 9 m Prionosuchus, a crocodile-like temnospondyl dating to 270 million years ago from the middle Permian of Brazil! The largest frog is the African <b>Goliath</b> <b>frog</b> (Conraua goliath), which can reach 32 cm and weigh 3 kg.|$|E
50|$|Endemic to Africa are the {{families}} Arthroleptidae, Astylosternidae, Heleophrynidae, Hemisotidae, Hyperoliidae, Petropedetidae, Mantellidae. Also widespread are Bufonidae (Bufo, Churamiti, Capensibufo, Mertensophryne, Nectophryne, Nectophrynoides, Schismaderma, Stephopaedes, Werneria, Wolterstorffina), Microhylidae (Breviceps, Callulina, Probreviceps, Cophylinae, Dyscophus, Melanobatrachinae, Scaphiophryninae), Rhacophoridae (Chiromantis), Ranidae (Afrana, Amietia, Amnirana, Aubria, Conraua, Hildebrandtia, Lanzarana, Ptychadena, Strongylopus, Tomopterna) and Pipidae (Hymenochirus, Pseudhymenochirus, Xenopus).The 2002-2004 ‘Global Amphibian Assessment’ by IUCN, Conservation International and NatureServe revealed that {{for only about}} 50% of the Afrotropical amphibians, there is least concern about their conservation status; approximately 130 species are endangered, about one-fourth of which are at a critical stage. Almost all of the amphibians of Madagascar (238 species) are endemic to that region. The West African <b>goliath</b> <b>frog</b> is the largest frog species in the world.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Ray {{installed}} Boy with Frog, {{his first}} outdoor commissioned work, at the Punta della Dogana, Venice. Grand {{in size and}} realized with a smooth white finish that references the important tradition of marble sculpture in Italy, it depicted a boy holding a <b>goliath</b> <b>frog</b> above the Grand Canal. The sculpture called to mind the Apollo Sauroktonos, an ancient Roman sculpture at the Musée du Louvre in Paris of a nude adolescent reaching out his arm to catch a lizard climbing a tree; and, the Boy with Thorn (Lo Spinario), a bronze statue at the Palazzo dei Conservatori, Musei Capitolini, of a seated Roman boy plucking a thorn from the sole of his foot. The statue was removed in 2013 and replaced with a lamp-post that had previously occupied the site.|$|E
50|$|Frogs are {{regionally}} significant prey for small, young crocodiles in many regions, mainly {{those in}} the 0.5 to 1.5 m size range. The main amphibian prey species from Uganda and Zambia was the African common toad (Amietophrynus regularis) while in Botswana the main amphibian prey was the reed frog (Hyperolius viridiflavus). Even the largest frog in the world, the <b>goliath</b> <b>frog</b> (Conraua goliath), has reportedly been preyed on by young Nile crocodiles. In general, reptiles become relatively common only in the diet in larger juvenile specimens and subadults. Large reptiles, or armoured reptiles such as turtles were almost negligible in crocodiles under 2.5 m and most common in the stomachs of crocodiles over 3.5 m in length from Uganda and Zambia. Small species of reptiles are largely ignored as prey at this size. Freshwater turtles are often the most frequently recorded reptilian prey, unsurprisingly perhaps because most other reptiles other than a small handful of Lycodonomorphus water snakes are more terrestrial than water-based.|$|E

50|$|The largest {{member of}} the largest order of {{amphibians}} is the African <b>Goliath</b> <b>frog</b> (Conraua goliath). The maximum size this species is verified to attain is a weight of 3.8 kg and a snout-to-vent length of 39 cm. The largest of the toads, the cane toad (Rhinella marina), is also the second largest {{member of the}} frog order. This infamous, often invasive species can grow to maximum mass of 2.65 kg and measure a maximum of 33 cm from snout-to-vent. Rivaling the previous two species, the African bullfrog (Pyxicephalus adspersus) can range up to a weight of 2 kg and 25.5 cm from snout to vent. Another large frog is the largest frog in North America, the American bullfrog, which can reach weights of up to 0.8 kg and snout-to-vent-length (SVL) of 20 cm. However, the toad Beelzebufo ampinga, found in fossil from the Cretaceous era {{in what is now}} Madagascar, could grow to be 41 cm long and weigh up to 4.5 kg, making it the largest frog ever known. The largest tree frog is the Australasian white-lipped tree frog (Litoria infrafrenata), the females of which can reach a length of 14 cm from snout to vent and can weigh up to 115 g. The family Leptodactylidae, one of the most diverse anuran families, also has some very large members. The largest is the Surinam horned frog (Ceratophrys cornuta), which can reach 20 cm in length from snout to vent and weigh up to 0.48 kg. While not quite as large as Ceratophrys cornuta, Leptodactylus pentadactylus is often heavier; it can reach 18.5 cm long and weigh 0.60 kg. The largest dendrobatid is the Colombian golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), which can attain a length of 6 cm and nearly 28.3 g. Most frogs are classified under the suborder Neobatrachia, although nearly 200 species are part of the Mesobatrachia suborder, or ancient frogs. The largest of these are the little-known Brachytarsophrys or Karin Hills frogs, of South Asia, which can grow to a maximum snout-to-vent length of 17 cm and a maximum weight of 0.54 kg.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{gastro-intestinal}} helminth parasites of <b>goliath</b> <b>frog</b> (Conraua goliath) {{from the}} Littoral Region of Cameroon in the Localities of Loum, Yabassi and Nkondjock were surveyed. Out of the 30 goliath frogs examined (13 males and 17 females) between April and May 2013, 26 (85 %) contained {{at least one}} helminth parasite and yielded a total of nine hundred and seventy three (973) helminths comprising: Nematodes (90. 5 %), Trematodes (9. 4 %) and Pentastomids (0. 1 %). Nematodes included: Africana taylori (60 %), Oswaldocruzia perreti (0. 2 %), Aplectana sp. (21 %), Gendria sp. (7. 1 %), Amphibiophilus sp. (0. 2 %), Strongyluris sp. (0. 1 %), Physalopteroides sp. (1. 6 %), and Oxyuridae gen. sp. (0. 3 %). Trematodes comprised: Mesocoelium sp. (7. 3 %) and Diplodiscus subclavatus (2. 1 %). Pentastomids were represented by Sebekia sp. (0. 1 %). The mean species richness and diversity were 1. 97 ± 2. 12 and 0. 41 ± 0. 04 respectively. The intensity of parasite infection was correlated with host body weight, positively for Africana taylori, Aplectana sp., Diplodiscus subclavatus, and Mesocoeliumsp. Infection rates were influenced by land-use pattern. Thus higher prevalences were observed in Loum (intensive agricultural area) ...|$|E
