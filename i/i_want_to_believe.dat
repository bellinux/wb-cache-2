However, on January 17, 2015, Fox Television Group chairman and CEO Gary Newman revealed that there was network interest in reviving The X-Files, not as a movie franchise, but as a limited run television event.|$|E

It {{is the second}} feature film installment of The X-Files franchise created by Carter, following the 1998 film. Three main actors from the television series, David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, and Mitch Pileggi, reappear in the film to reprise their respective roles as Fox Mulder, Dana Scully, and Walter Skinner.|$|E

500|$|The X-Files {{has spawned}} one sequel, a 2008 film {{entitled}} [...] released {{six years after}} the series ended. The film performed modestly {{at the box office}} and received a less positive response than the first film. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Chris Carter announced that if <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> proved successful, he would propose that a third movie go back to the television series' mythology and focus on the alien invasion foretold within the series, due to occur in December 2012. No third movie appeared; instead, the TV series was revived in 2016.|$|E
500|$|As writers Carter and Frank Spotnitz {{aimed to}} avoid complicating the storyline of [...] with {{superfluous}} appearances of characters {{from the television}} series, Skinner is the only returning character in the movie. He {{was included in the}} film's plot only when a fitting opportunity to involve him arose, and Spotnitz and Carter were very happy to write Skinner into the story. The scenes of The X-Files: <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> that include Skinner were filmed very late in the movie's filming schedule, and the particular scene that acts as the character's introduction in the movie was filmed, for reasons of time, in two different locations.|$|E
500|$|The X-Files was {{inspired}} by earlier television series which featured elements of suspense and speculative fiction, including Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, Tales from the Darkside, and especially [...] When creating the main characters, Carter sought to reverse gender stereotypes by making Mulder a believer and Scully a skeptic. The first seven seasons featured Duchovny and Anderson equally. In the last two seasons, Anderson took precedence while Duchovny appeared intermittently. New main characters were introduced: FBI agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish). Mulder and Scully's boss, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), also became a main character. The first five seasons of The X-Files were filmed and produced in Vancouver, British Columbia, before eventually moving to Los Angeles to accommodate Duchovny. The series later returned to Vancouver to film The X-Files: <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> {{as well as the}} tenth season of the series.|$|E

500|$|In several {{interviews}} {{around the}} release, Carter {{said that if}} the X-Files: <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> film proved successful at the box office, a third installment would be made going back to the TV series' mythology, focusing specifically on the alien invasion and colonization of Earth foretold in the ninth-season finale, due to occur on December 22, 2012. In an October 2009 interview, David Duchovny likewise said he wanted to do a 2012 X-Files movie, but did not know if he would get the chance. Anderson stated in August 2012 that a third X-Files film is [...] "looking pretty good". As of July 2013, Fox had not approved the movie, although Carter, Spotnitz, Duchovny and Anderson expressed interest. At the New York Comic Con held October 10–13, 2013, Duchovny and Anderson reaffirmed that they and Carter are interested in making a third film, with Anderson saying “If it takes fan encouragement to get Fox interested in that, then I guess that's what it would be.” ...|$|E
500|$|Owing to its {{popularity}} and media exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster {{is often used}} as a modern version of Russell's teapot. Proponents argue that, since {{the existence of the}} invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster—similar to other proposed supernatural beings—cannot be falsified, it demonstrates that the burden of proof rests on those who affirm the existence of such beings. Richard Dawkins explains, [...] "The onus is on somebody who says, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in God, Flying Spaghetti Monster, fairies, or whatever it is. It is not up to us to disprove it." [...] Furthermore, according to Lance Gharavi, an editor of The Journal of Religion and Theater, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is [...] "ultimately...an argument about the arbitrariness of holding any one view of creation", since any one view is equally as plausible as the Flying Spaghetti Monster. A similar argument was discussed in the books The God Delusion and The Atheist Delusion.|$|E
500|$|The ninth season {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews by critics and garnered negative reaction from many long-time fans and viewers. Sabadino Parker from PopMatters, called the show [...] "a pale {{reflection of the}} show it once was". Elizabeth Weinbloom from The New York Times concluded, [...] "shoddy writing notwithstanding, it was this halfhearted culmination {{of what was once}} a beautifully complicated friendship", between Mulder and Scully that ended remaining interest in what was a [...] "waning phenomenon". Another The New York Times review stated, [...] "The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination." [...] The A.V. Club listed the ninth season and the 2008 film The X-Files: <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> as the [...] "bad apple" [...] of The X-Files franchise, describing the ninth season as [...] "clumsy mish-mash of stuff that had once worked and new serialized storylines about so-called 'super soldiers'". Brian Linder from IGN, on the other hand, was more positive to the ninth season, saying that the series could still have aired if the writers created a new storyline for Patrick and Gish's characters.|$|E
500|$|Ryan Brockington for the New York Post was {{critical}} of Hollywood Records decision to not include Rihanna and Brown's version on the soundtrack, writing [...] "the Pussycat Dolls are listed as the artist, {{and as much as}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it was a typo, I pressed play, and there was Nicole Scherzinger and her kittens singing away." [...] Brockington continued to express his distaste, writing [...] "Now I have to listen to some overproduced vocals by a pack of hyenas and their booty-slap noises." ...|$|R

The film grossed $4 million on its opening day in the United States. It opened fourth on the U.S. weekend box office chart, with a gross of $10.2 million. By the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed $20,982,478 domestically and an additional $47,373,805 internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $68,369,434. Among 2008 domestic releases, it finished in 114th place. The film's stars both claimed that the timing of the movie's release, a week after the highly popular Batman film The Dark Knight, negatively affected its success. The film received mixed to negative reviews. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream film critics, reported [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews, with an average score of 47 based on 33 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 32% of 160 listed film critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.9 out of 10. The website wrote of the critics' consensus stating; [...] "The chemistry between leads David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson do live up to The X-Files televised legacy, but the roving plot and droning routines make it hard to identify just what we're meant to believe in." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for the miniseries continuation of the series, Keith Uhlich of The A.V. Club suggested The X-Files: <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> is [...] "much better than its reputation suggests." [...] He continues, saying: [...] "It was never this writer’s opinion that <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe...</b> was some worthless addition to X-Files canon. On first view, it seemed a very consciously low-key study of the Mulder/Scully dynamic, filtered, as per usual, {{through the prism of}} the latest mystery the agents were called in to solve. If Fight The Future, which dealt in grandiose fashion with the series’ convoluted alien myth arc, was The X-Files in summer blockbuster mode, <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> was its attempt at an intimate chamber drama—more Ingrid Bergman than Michael Bay." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{composing}} {{the score}} for <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe,</b> Snow called it [...] "different" [...] {{from the previous}} film which followed the shows mytharc storyline about the government conspiracy and aliens. He said it was much [...] "more heart, warmth and tuneful music" [...] since this film was based more around Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) relationship.|$|E
60|$|For {{some years}} after my marriage, I too was for leaving them alone.

In matters of private morals these were my most uncharitable years. <b>I</b> didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> think of these things any more for ever. I hated the people whose talk or practice showed they were not of my opinion. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that their views were immoral and objectionable and contemptible, because I had decided to treat them as at that level.

2500|$|On April 16, 2008, the {{official}} {{title of the}} film was announced: The X-Files: <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe.</b> Carter referred to the title as a [...] "natural title", saying that it pertained to [...] "a story that involves the difficulties in mediating faith and science.

This title is a popular phrase among X-Files fans. It is featured on the UFO poster above Mulder's desk.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{told you}} that I had lost my innocence and my blind faith in the eternity of love.

We are {{separated}} for too long at a {{time for us to}} be bound together forever. There's something hopeless and very sad about this feeling. You asked me about a child, and I said what I did because I'm not thinking that far ahead—because a child is the most wonderful creation and the final bond {{between a man and a}} woman (at least, that's how I see it, or let's say, that's how it should be and how I'd want it to be). And I'm not thinking that far ahead because I'm not convinced it's eternal. I only wish I could free myself of this doubt." ...|$|E

Fox Chairman Tom Rothman, responding to an interview question regarding the possibility of a third X-Files movie, said in October 2008, [...] "It's really up to Chris , David [...] and Gillian [...] ". During an interview at the Sarajevo Film Festival in August 2009, Anderson was asked about a third film and responded, [...] "They talked about maybe doing it in 2012. I think there were discussions about that. I don't know whether that's going to happen or not, but there isn't any reason not to do it." [...] Frank Spotnitz responded to his blog readers' requests for clarification regarding Anderson's comments by denying that any deal was in place, saying, [...] "I'm afraid I have no news to report other than our continuing desire to make a third film if there's an audience for it."
