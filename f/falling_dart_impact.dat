AIDA is a joint ESA-NASA cooperative project [1, 2], that includes the ESA Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM) rendezvous spacecraft and the NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission. The AIDA target is the near- Earth binary asteroid 65803 Didymos, which will make an unusually close approach to Earth in October, 2022. The 300 -kg DART spacecraft is designed to impact the Didymos secondary at 7 km/s and demon- strate the ability to modify its trajectory through momentum transfer. DART and AIM are currently Phase A studies supported by NASA and ESA respectively. The primary goals of AIDA are (1) perform a full-scale demonstration of the spacecraft kinetic impact technique for deflection of an asteroid, by targeting an object larger than 100 m and large enough to qualify as a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid; (2) measure the resulting asteroid deflection, by targeting the second- ary member of a binary NEO and measuring the period change of the binary orbit; (3) understand the hypervelocity collision effects on an asteroid, including the long-term dynamics of impact ejecta; and validate models for momentum transfer in asteroid impacts, based on measured physical properties of the asteroid surface and sub-surface. The primary DART objectives are to demonstrate a hypervelocity impact on the Did- ymos moon and to determine the resulting deflection from ground-based observatories. The <b>DART</b> <b>impact</b> on the Didymos secondary will cause a measurable change in the orbital period of the binary.

40|$|Binary near-Earth {{asteroid}} (65803) Didymos is {{the target}} of the proposed NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), part of the Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission concept. In this mission, the DART spacecraft is planned to impact the secondary body of Didymos, perturbing mutual dynamics of the system. The primary body is currently rotating at a spin period close to the spin barrier of asteroids, and materials ejected from the secondary due to the <b>DART</b> <b>impact</b> are likely to reach the primary. These conditions may cause the primary to reshape, due to landslides, or internal deformation, changing the permanent gravity field. Here, we propose that if shape deformation of the primary occurs, the mutual orbit of the system would be perturbed due to a change in the gravity field. We use a numerical simulation technique based on the full two-body problem to investigate the shape effect on the mutual dynamics in Didymos after the <b>DART</b> <b>impact.</b> The results show that under constant volume, shape deformation induces strong perturbation in the mutual motion. We find that the deformation process always causes the orbital period of the system to become shorter. If surface layers with a thickness greater than ~ 0. 4 m on the poles of the primary move down to the equatorial region due to the <b>DART</b> <b>impact,</b> a change in the orbital period of the system and in the spin period of the primary will be detected by ground-based measurement.

40|$|Developing {{blown film}} resins for the {{production}} of films that exhibit the toughness properties of LLDPE with the stiffness and tensile characteristics of HDPE has historically been difficult to achieve for both resin producers and film converters. Resin producers have attempted to push the density higher for LLDPE film resins and lower for HDPE film resins. Separately, film producers are continuously searching for the same hybrid film through blending low, linear low, medium and high-density polyethylenes. Producing successful film blends for heavy-duty applications with densities over 0. 918 g/cc usually results in a high performance LLDPE film resin blended with low levels of a MDPE or HDPE. As the level of MDPE or HDPE increases, loss of critical toughness properties such as machine direction tear (MD tear) and <b>dart</b> <b>impact</b> strength is observed. There now exists a novel method of producing films that possess a full density range between 0. 918 g/cc and 0. 938 g/cc. This approach is based on the utilization of a new family of lower density, high molecular weight medium density (HMW-MDPE) film resins. Blending a HMW-HDPE with a resin density of 0. 938 g/cc with high performance LLDPE film resins, films can be fabricated over a wide range of densities without the loss of tear and impact properties. These blends can be produced at thin or thick gauge on either high stalk or conventional blown film equipment...|$|R

FM Plastics Industries Sdn. Bhd. {{is one of}} the SMIs companies that owned by 100 % bumiputera with capacities of 15 employees that supply Tubular Tubing Rolls. FM Plastic Industries Sdn. Bhd. managed to secure and officially be appointed as a vendor for PETRONAS under the Vendor Development Programme (VDP) by supplying Polyethylene heavy duty bagging rolls to Polyethene Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (PEMSB) known as subsidiary company for PETRONAS. Many initiatives have been taken by FM Plastic Industries in order to fulfil the requirement as PETRONAS vendor including to implement the requirement of quality management system ISO 9001 : 2008 towards developing a sound quality management. The high quality of their product also being the core to secure the vendor because their product will be through seven types of testing before being supply; physical test, thickness test, <b>dart</b> <b>impact</b> test, sealing test, friction test, composition and analyzer test and drop test. Continuous improvement provides by the company also being play a vital role to secure the vendor. FM Plastic Industries joined together with Universiti Malaysia Pahang in Knowledge Transfer Programme under the project of Control System Technology Transfer, Design of Plastic Printing and Engineering Management in Industrial Management is an initiative {{to improve the quality of}} their product lead to build confidence and expectation for PETRONAS to appoint the company as a vendor...|$|R

40|$|The Asteroid Impact Deflection Assessment (AIDA) {{mission is}} an {{international}} collaboration of ESA and NASA, with the primary goals to test the ability to perform a spacecraft impact on a near-Earth asteroid and to measure and characterize the deflection caused by the impact. The ESA led Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM) is to be designed on a low-cost approach and to be launched in 2020. Its primary objective is to characterize the asteroid 65803 Didymos (1996 GT) and then to assess the consequences of an impact from a NASA provided spacecraft named DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) on the secondary asteroid in the binary asteroid system. Prior {{to the arrival of}} DART, AIM is planned to rendezvous with the asteroid system in mid- 2022. On arrival, AIM would conduct observations {{that can be used to}} complement and prepare for the <b>DART</b> <b>impact</b> and perform technology demonstration. In addition, it is planned to release a number of CubeSat opportunity-payload and place the MASCOT- 2 lander on the surface of the secondary asteroid. Further, a demonstration of deep space optical communications is planned. AIM is currently studied in the scope of a Phase B 1 under ESA contract by two consortia, one of those being led by OHB System. This paper presents OHB's current mission and asteroid operations strategy, addressing mission design and operational challenges. The tight schedule (launch in 2020) and the low cost approach for spacecraft design and operations are challenging, especially in context of the high complexity and performance requirements connected to deep space mission operations and navigation. Special focus is therefore placed on asteroid local operations, the planned payload operations, the deployment of MASCOT- 2 to the surface of the secondary asteroid in the binary system, the navigation strategy of AIM, and how OHB plans to overcome the challenges posed by this unique mission scenario...|$|R
