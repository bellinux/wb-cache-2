25|$|Looking at the large, sophisticated, {{high-tech}} {{enterprise that}} Canadian <b>gas</b> <b>processing</b> is today, {{it is hard}} to imagine the challenges the industry faced as it grew up. <b>Gas</b> <b>processing</b> developed as an adjunct to the construction of the major gas transmission pipeline system, which began operating in the late 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} is to recover the natural gas liquids (NGL) for which most large, modern <b>gas</b> <b>processing</b> plants use another {{cryogenic}} low temperature distillation process involving expansion of the gas through a turbo-expander followed by distillation in a demethanizing fractionating column. Some <b>gas</b> <b>processing</b> plants use lean oil absorption process rather than the cryogenic turbo-expander process.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, natural <b>gas</b> <b>processing</b> had come of age. Since its infancy, when {{operators}} removed only few {{of a gas}} stream's impurities, the gas sector had matured to become {{an important part of}} the petroleum industry and of the economy itself. Gas moved around the North American continent in unprecedented volumes. It was and is an environmentally desirable fuel, and <b>gas</b> <b>processing</b> is the handmaiden of natural gas sales.|$|E

25|$|Natural <b>gas</b> <b>processing</b> {{changes the}} {{commodity}} in two critical ways. First, it extracts valuable by-products; second, it renders natural gas {{fit to be}} transported to a point for commercial sale and consumption. Through the use of evolving technology, the <b>gas</b> <b>processing</b> industry of each era extracts higher percentages of {{a wider range of}} hydrocarbons and other commercial by-products than its predecessors. It also removes ever-higher percentages of dangerous and other unwanted impurities. Steady growth has made natural gas a major industry, with 180 cubic kilometres of gas flowing from Canadian fields to market, every year.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{a series}} on Canada's {{petroleum}} industry, this entry focuses on the second of these two functions of <b>gas</b> <b>processing</b> - removing impurities from the gas stream - rather than recovering natural gas liquids, described elsewhere. Of course, most large plants perform both functions, and plants have no other ultimate purpose than to quickly, safely and profitably turn raw gas into products to be safely shipped (mostly by pipeline) to market. The discussion covers <b>gas</b> <b>processing</b> as an engineering feat, critical developments in exploration and development and the fundamentals of the marketplace.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{describes}} the processes {{used to obtain}} thermostructural Carbon/Carbon composites. The processing of these materials begins with {{the definition of the}} architecture of the carbon fiber reinforcement, in the form of stacked plies or in the form of fabrics or multidirectional reinforcement. Incorporating fiber reinforcement into the carbon matrix, by filling the voids and interstices, leads to the densification of the material and a continuous increase in density. There are two principal processing routes for obtaining these materials: liquid phase <b>processing</b> and <b>gas</b> phase <b>processing.</b> In both cases, thermal processes lead to the formation of a carbon matrix with specific properties related to their precursor. These processes also differ in terms of yield. With liquid phase impregnation the yield is around 45 per cent, while <b>gas</b> phase <b>processing</b> yields around 15 per cent...|$|R
