Calls from panel offices to manual offices required PCI (Panel Call Indicator) signals to tell the [...] "B Board Machine Incoming" [...] operator or <b>incoming</b> <b>operator</b> the phone number.

50|$|The No. 4 Crossbar {{switching}} system {{had been introduced}} in the 1940s to switch four-wire circuits and replace the <b>incoming</b> <b>operator.</b> With semiautomatic operation analogous to {{the early days of}} the panel switch, the operator in the originating city used a multifrequency keypad to dial an access code to connect to the correct city and to send the seven digit number to incoming equipment at the terminating city. This design was further refined to serve DDD.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{contribute}} {{to the understanding of the}} effects of political instability on the tourism industry in Madagascar. It particularly investigates the effects of the political incidents of 2002 and 2009 on <b>incoming</b> tour <b>operators</b> and their marketing environment. Based on the roles of <b>incoming</b> tour <b>operators</b> in the tourism distribution channels and their micro and macro environment, this study seeks to explore the impacts of the political crises on the marketing environment, their perception of risk and uncertainty within a volatile political climate and the responses of <b>incoming</b> tour <b>operators</b> to these challenges. A qualitative approach based on personal interviews was conducted to collect the required data. The findings indicated that a decline of demand, internal changes followed by a period of inactivity, damaged destination image, late recovery for tourism industry and economic downturn were the main consequences of the two political crises. To manage these impacts, <b>incoming</b> tour <b>operators</b> implemented diversification of their portfolios of supply services, product innovation, market diversification and cooperation with private and public institutions. <b>Incoming</b> tour <b>operators</b> also perceived business related risks such as loss of partnerships, product constraints, competition and uncertain financial situation in addition to the exogenous low level of safety and security risk. Furthermore, the findings revealed that they attempted to minimize or eliminate these risks by the means of development of trust-based relationships, improvement of human resources management practices, product innovation and implementation of safety and security measures. Thus, the perceived challenges stemmed from the uncertainty of the environment in which <b>incoming</b> tour <b>operators</b> are operating that challenges these companies to maintain their market relationships, the rebuilding of the image of the destination and the elaboration of a disaster management plan. Key words: <b>incoming</b> tour <b>operators,</b> risk and uncertainty, disaster management, risk management...|$|R

40|$|Unbundling {{consists}} of the possibility for a new operator to have special access to an incumbent's network infrastructure {{in order to provide}} value-added services without the necessity to duplicate the infrastructure itself. Local loop unbundling has received the most attention in Europe and in Italy. Most Italian operators are interested mainly in physical access to copper loop, which gives the opportunity to offer broadband services pervasively by exploiting the capabilities of xDSL technology. Technical issues to be faced in offering these services are severe and include loop qualification, interference evaluation, and shortage of available loops. Nonetheless, the Italian case, where more than 20 <b>incoming</b> <b>operators</b> are planning to deploy services on unbundled local loops, demonstrates that this opportunity can be a major driver {{for the development of the}} broadband services market...|$|R

50|$|The {{company had}} broken into the French market very early on with Vacances Transat (France), the largest tour {{operator}} offering travel to Canada, and soon expanded within France, the United Kingdom {{and the rest of}} Europe. It acquired French tour operator Look Voyages in 1996, Greek <b>incoming</b> tour <b>operator</b> Tourgreece in 2001, British tour operator Canadian Affair in 2006, and French tour operator Amplitude Internationale (today Amplitravel), which specializes in travel to Tunisia, in 2007. At its destinations, the company opened offices in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Florida {{in order to be able}} to provide its customers with complementary services. In 2007, Transat created a five hotel, 1,600-room joint venture with the major Spanish chain H10 Hotels in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. In 2010, Transat became an outgoing tour operator in Mexico, when it founded Eleva Travel.|$|R
40|$|Gorcery {{retailing}} in Great Britain {{has not had}} {{the best}} of times in recent years, particularly in comparison to other European countries and retailers. Attacked on the one hand by the Press and city analysts for their pricing and accounting policies and confronted on the other hand by a wave of <b>incoming</b> discount <b>operators,</b> the leading food multiples have had to rethink their tactical and strategic positioning. This rethinking has thus far focused on tactical price positioning and sub-brand developments to face down price competition accounting policy restructuring to assuage City fears and the beginnings of strategic responses through experiments with new formats. This paper by Steve Burt and Leigh Sparks aims to inform the debate and consideration of change in the grocery market in both Britain and continental Europe as a whole. It endeavours to provide an understanding of reasons for the current changes, focusing in particular on the arrival of the limited line discount store in Britain and through a retail format analysis, suggests likely directions for the future. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} a {{pilot project}} in Costa Rica aimed to examine and improve the market linkages of 24 small-scale tourism initiatives to tour operators in Costa Rica and the Netherlands. It links pro-poor tourism {{and the concept of}} tourism chain to actor-network theory. The analysis shows that the tangible results in terms of pro-poor tourism of the project itself were meagre, as, initially, only three and later only one out of 24 projects was included in the tourism chain. However, the analysis of this project contributes to an increasing body of knowledge on how to make tourism work for the poor, in Costa Rica as well as elsewhere. It argues to move beyond existing ways of theorising tourism and to explore the heuristics of conceptualising tourism in terms of actor-network theory and suggests to examine processes of translation in which the researcher follows and supports development organisations, <b>incoming</b> tour <b>operators</b> or any other particular actor in the process of creating associations that produce the desired effect: the increase of net benefits for the poor...|$|R
40|$|Tracking in {{the ground}} target domain is not as {{developed}} as the tracking of aircrafts and vessels. One of the main difficulties with tracking land objects is the irregularity of the <b>incoming</b> data; an <b>operator</b> must rely on reconnaissance reports together with snippets of sensor information. This puts high demands on the operator to associate the right report with the right tracked object. The Data Fusion team at Saab Systems is interested in investigating how ontological engineering can support decision-making in a Battle Management System. This thesis looks into how ontological reasoning {{can be used to}} find associations between an incoming report and an existing object represented in a knowledge base. The approach is to only present objects that are consistent with the incoming report. A method to rank the possible matches by their similarity using methods from the area of Information Retrieval is also presented. To get a broader picture of the benefits of methods within ontological engineering, a study of how it can be used within the field of situation detection is also included in this thesis. Results from the prototype application developed shows that it is achievable to retrieve only objects that ar...|$|R
40|$|The {{data used}} in this study was {{obtained}} from a mobile phone operator, from now on referred to as the “operator”. We focus exclusively on voice calls, filtering out all other services, such as voice mail, data calls, text messages, chat, and operator calls. For the purpose of retaining customer anonymity, each subscription is identified by a surrogate key such that {{it is not possible to}} recover the actual phone numbers from it. Since there is no other information available for identifying or locating customers, this guarantees that their privacy is respected. We have filtered out calls that involve other <b>operators,</b> <b>incoming</b> or outgoing, keeping only those transactions in which the calling and receiving subscription is governed by the operator. This filtering is needed to eliminate the bias between the operator and other mobile service providers as we have a full access to the customers of the operator, but only partial access to the activity of other providers. A small fraction of the subscriptions appears to be used for business or business-like purposes, which appear as users with a very large number of calls never returned. To ensure that we are dealing with genuine social interactions, we require links to represent reciprocal calls within the investigated time period, so that A needs to call B and vice versa for a link t...|$|R
