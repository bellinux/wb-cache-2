5|$|The frailty of the {{argument}} is that <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> God, a being which does not suffer from transworld depravity by the assumption of omnibenevolence, is unable to recreate a transworld-depravity-free being, which is seemingly contradictory to the assumption of omnipotence.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover 55 Cancri d is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. In the case of 55 Cancri d, this lower limit was around 3.835 times the mass of Jupiter. In 2004, astrometric measurements with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the planet's orbit is inclined by around 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. If this measurement is confirmed, <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> the planet's true mass is 25% greater than the lower limit, at around 4.8 Jupiter masses; and it will not be coplanar with the innermost planets e and b (both 85°).|$|E
5|$|The Roda Codex, {{the sole}} source for Onneca's Christian marriage, places this union with her cousin Aznar Sánchez de Laron before her marriage, as a widow, to Abdullah of Córdoba. Based on this, French {{historian}} Évariste Lévi-Provençal developed a chronology for Onneca's life that placed her birth date around 835. Lévi-Provençal believed that Onneca did not accompany her {{father when he}} returned to Pamplona in 882, either because she had already died, or because she had converted to Islam and chose to remain in Abdullah's harem. However, such a chronology is problematic since <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> Onneca's children by Aznar were born before or only shortly after her father's capture in 860, thus making Onneca's daughter Toda Aznárez a sexagenarian {{at the time of her}} son García Sánchez I's birth (which is known to have occurred in either 919 or 922), and nearly a centenarian at the time of her 958 visit to Cordoba. Therefore, most historians addressing the question have concluded that the Roda Codex was in error with regard to the order of Onneca's two marriages.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} anxiety {{sensitivity}} expressed two ideas. First, <b>it</b> <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> {{the fear of}} fear is at least sometimes rooted in cognition or beliefs, not Pavlovian associations with prior panic experiences. Second, <b>it</b> <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> the fear of fear could precede panic experiences and even predict panic attacks, post-traumatic stress, phobias, and other anxiety conditions.|$|R
30|$|The charts {{generated}} {{were examined}} {{to see which}} boundary was crossed. If the upper boundary was crossed, <b>it</b> <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> knees with anterolateral incision were preferred by the patients. If the lower boundary was crossed, <b>it</b> <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> knees with midline incision were preferred. If none of the two boundaries were crossed, <b>it</b> <b>implied</b> <b>that</b> patients did not prefer any one knee over the other. This method allowed us to conclude the trial {{as soon as the}} boundary was crossed. The upper boundary was crossed after charting the preferences of 19 patients; however, at that point the last patient was already recruited and so was allowed to complete the trial.|$|R

25|$|The Cartan–Hadamard theorem {{states that}} a {{complete}} simply connected Riemannian manifold M with nonpositive sectional curvature is diffeomorphic to the Euclidean space Rn with n = dim M via the exponential map at any point. <b>It</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> any two points of a simply connected complete Riemannian manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature {{are joined by}} a unique geodesic.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{analytical}} index is usually hard to evaluate directly, {{it is at}} least obviously an integer. The topological index is by definition a rational number, but it is usually not at all obvious from the definition that it is also integral. So the Atiyah–Singer index theorem implies some deep integrality properties, as <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> the topological index is integral.|$|E

25|$|One {{of their}} enigma {{is the fact}} they were not {{mentioned}} in local and foreign medieval documents. Franciscan chronicles which recorded many unusual things, like Turkish cemetery, did not mention them. Folk tradition preserved mythical perception full of superstitions and fantasy tales. <b>It</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> occurred discontinuity of historical memory among all three ethnic groups, caused by ethnic migrations and religious conversions during the Ottoman occupation.|$|E
25|$|This theorem is {{a special}} case of Thurston's orbifold theorem, {{announced}} without proof in 1981; it forms part of his geometrization conjecture for 3-manifolds. In particular <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> if X is a compact, connected, orientable, irreducible, atoroidal 3-orbifold with non-empty singular locus, then M has a geometric structure (in the sense of orbifolds). A complete proof of the theorem was published by Boileau, Leeb & Porti in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Language-nonselective {{access is}} the {{automatic}} co-activation {{of information in}} both linguistic systems. <b>It</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> when a bilingual encounters a spoken or written word, the activation happens in both contextually appropriate and inappropriate linguistic subsystems. Also, {{there is evidence that}} bilinguals take longer than monolinguals to detect non-words while in both bilingual and monolingual modes, providing evidence that bilinguals do not fully inactivate their other language while in a monolingual mode.|$|E
25|$|By {{the same}} reasoning, this {{statement}} is evidence that (2) if something is not black then {{it is not a}} raven. But since (as above) {{this statement is}} logically equivalent to (1) all ravens are black, it follows that the sight of a green apple is evidence supporting the notion that all ravens are black. This conclusion seems paradoxical, because <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> information has been gained about ravens by looking at an apple.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a {{holomorphic}} {{function is}} a complex-valued function {{of one or}} more complex variables that is complex differentiable in a neighborhood of every point in its domain. The existence of a complex derivative in a neighborhood is a very strong condition, for <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> any holomorphic function is actually infinitely differentiable and equal to its own Taylor series (analytic). Holomorphic functions are the central objects of study in complex analysis.|$|E

25|$|Neutrino {{oscillation}} is {{of great}} theoretical and experimental interest, as the precise properties of the process can shed light on several properties of the neutrino. In particular, <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> the neutrino has a non-zero mass, which requires a modification to the Standard Model of particle physics. The experimental discovery of neutrino oscillation, and thus neutrino mass, by the Super-Kamiokande Observatory and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatories was recognized with the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physics.|$|E
25|$|From about 1000Hz, {{the dynamic}} {{range of the}} {{auditory}} system decreases with decreasing frequency. This compression is observable in the equal-loudness-level contours, and <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> <b>that</b> even {{a slight increase in}} level can change the perceived loudness from barely audible to loud. Combined with the natural spread in thresholds within a population, its effect may be that a very low-frequency sound which is inaudible to some people may be loud to others.|$|E
