500|$|Photos of Parks and Recreation {{producers}} {{were included}} among {{the photos of}} past city council members on the town hall walls. The photo of Norm Hiscock is the one Leslie said she believes, [...] "No matter what direction I move, he's always staring at my chest. Mark's social networking site featured in [...] "Boys' Club" [...] included the character {{with a wide range}} of promiscuous women. The pictures were shot during a photo session during which, according to series co-creator Michael Schur, [...] "We brought in a lot of women and basically said, you're really trashy. You're trashy women, and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> picture now." [...] During the courtyard party scenes, a brief clip shows Poehler, Jones and Schneider dancing together. The clip was actually the three actors out-of-character playing around between takes, but the Parks producers decided to add it to the episode.|$|E
2500|$|The Fanzine's Richard Parks, {{interviewing}} Mikey Heppner, {{noted that}} many of the album's lyrics were threatening in some way; in addition to the aforementioned references to death, other songs have dark subtexts. [...] "Time Will Cut You Down" [...] has a straightforward message of [...] "one frustrated person warning someone else", according to Heppner, while [...] "Talk to Her" [...] seemed according to Parks to be [...] a distorted take on the Beatles song [...] "She Loves You". [...] "In 'She Loves You', the guy is trying to help his friend who's in a relationship," [...] explained Parks, [...] "but in 'Talk to Her' it becomes a threat - more like, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> girl away from you." [...] Heppner remarked that a closer comparison would be to the other Beatles tune [...] "You're Going to Lose That Girl", whose message about losing in a relationship was similarly blunt. Heppner acknowledged that the songs [...] "fit together" [...] with regard to their apparent similarities in subject matter, but denied the presence of an intentional unifying theme around which the songs were written.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{said the}} Duck, who {{was of a}} very peaceable disposition, and never quarrelled with any one, [...] "everybody has {{different}} tastes. I hope, at any rate, that you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up <b>your</b> residence here." ...|$|R
60|$|LAWTON: 'If {{you suppose}} I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you at <b>your</b> own figure--' They {{walk up the}} room together, and return as before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aren't you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> camera?" [...] asked Giant {{as he drew}} in {{his line}} and took both his photo outfit and his firearm.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-day," [...] she said, [...] "there {{are many}} Chattertons who must die {{before the world}} will listen to them. Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> place amongst them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{one more}} or less of these ha'penny fever rags?" [...] cried my cousin with a ringing scorn. [...] "Surely you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> Folkestone news from mere London papers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{him into}} <b>your</b> confidence? {{to open your}} whole mind to such a man as the man we have just left?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nobody knows you, {{and it is}} {{unimportant}} how you look; and, as {{you have}} some very nice things here, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of <b>your</b> kindness and--' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{took her}} hand again, and with a return to his studiedly cheerful manner called her to witness that she had promised to come to see his paintings. [...] "And please {{remember}} that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you at <b>your</b> word and dine with you--perhaps this very night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{promise of}} yours is {{any good to}} me. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> conduct into my own hands. Pay {{attention}} to what I am going to say. You are my prisoner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> {{hand off}} his collar this instant, or get {{yourself}} into trouble," [...] and the merchant from Waterville forced {{his way through}} the throng until he stood by Teddy's side.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{sure thing}} you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> canoes through. Say, I don't {{want to see you}} lose the grub and tools. Drop the fool plan and I'll take off a cent a pound." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{enter on}} the merits of Ben Drummond's beauty," [...] said Moses; [...] "but I don't believe the Typhoon was one whit {{superior}} to our ship. Besides, Miss Sally, I thought you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it under <b>your</b> especial patronage, and let me honor it with your name." ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. M. 'Fraid you won't {{be entered}} in the Stud Book {{correctly}} unless you go Home? Take six months, then, and come out in October. If I could slay off a brother or two, I s'pose I should be a Marquis of sorts. Any fool can be that; but it needs men, Gaddy--men like you--to lead flanking squadrons properly. Don't you delude yourself into the belief that you're <b>going</b> Home <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> place and prance about among pink-nosed Kabuli dowagers. You aren't built that way. I know better.|$|R
60|$|Fellow-Workmen: I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up <b>your</b> time by {{compliment}}ing you. It {{has been}} the fashion to compliment kings and other authorities when they have come into power, and to tell them that, under their wise and beneficent rule, happiness would certainly overflow the land. But the end has not always corresponded to that beginning. If it were true that we who work for wages had more of the wisdom and virtue necessary to the right use of power than has been shown by the aristocratic and mercantile classes, we should not glory much in that fact, or consider that it carried with it any near approach to infallibility.|$|R
6000|$|... “In {{the first}} place I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> clothes,” Stephen said. “You can {{say that you were}} insensible when I {{stripped}} you; but first I {{want you to tell me}} how I can get out.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Ursula!" [...] the {{newcomer}} exclaimed. [...] "You are here early! My word, I'll warrant you don't keep it up. That's Mr. Williamson's peg. This is yours. Standard Five teacher always has this. Aren't you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> hat off?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> place, Sam, {{when you}} have {{finished}} your breakfast," [...] Harry said, as he came up. [...] "If the Utes found out last night that we had gone, their scouts may be coming down before long. My rifle shoots a bit straighter than yours does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will we?' said George, unpleasantly. 'Would {{you like}} to know what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do to you, then? I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hit you very hard under the jaw, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> hold of <b>your</b> neck and squeeze it till you lose consciousness, and then I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drag you to the beach and tell people I had to hit you because you lost your head and struggled.' ...|$|R
500|$|By November 2009, Franceschi {{described}} {{playing the}} material live as having [...] "become suffocated almost and we've really overplayed some of them". Prior to Slam Dunk Festival 2015, there were rumours that {{the band was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> perform <b>Take</b> Off <b>Your</b> Colours in its entirety. Franceschi later explained the band would be [...] "extensively paying homage to that with songs" [...] from the album.|$|R
5000|$|His {{world is}} rocked when Grace {{comes into the}} picture. And announces she's pregnant. [...] "You got {{yourself}} into this situation," [...] he tells her. [...] "You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to get yourself out. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> responsibility for <b>your</b> baby." [...] While at first he runs away from any intimacy, he renews contact with Grace later. From then on begins their discovery of mutual commitment and their journey to parenthood.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{just take}} it easy, Mrs. Doctor, dear," [...] said Susan, coming {{abruptly}} in. [...] "Have {{a good time and}} do not worry about the pantry. Susan is at the helm. There is no use in keeping a dog and doing your own barking. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> breakfast up to you every morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you've beaten {{me in this}} affair," [...] she said, with no {{apparent}} resentment, [...] "you're clever enough to become famous some day. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> advice about the letter and if that climax you're predicting arrives on schedule time I'll not be sorry to quit this dreary, dragging case {{and pick up a}} more interesting one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr Doyce {{mentioned}} incidentally, in {{the course}} of our conversation, that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> valuable advice on the subject of finding such a partner. If you should think our views and opportunities at all likely to coincide, perhaps you will let him know my available position. I speak, of course, in ignorance of the details, and they may be unsuitable on both sides.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, say, Rover, {{you make}} me tired!" [...] sneered the bully, glaring at Jack. [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> girl away from you. There are plenty of better girls around Haven Point. You go about your {{business}} and leave me alone;" [...] and, thus speaking, Slugger Brown passed into the moving-picture theater, followed a moment later by Nappy Martell. The two others watched them out of sight, and then {{looked at each other}} knowingly.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Faulkner sat {{silent for}} a few minutes. [...] "I am so glad you came to me," [...] she said presently. [...] "I have always known Miss Port as a scandal-monger and a mischief-maker, but I never thought {{of her as a}} wicked woman. This {{persecution}} of you is shameful, but when I think of your niece it is past belief! You are right, Captain Asher; it must be a woman who must <b>take</b> up <b>your</b> cause. In fact," [...] said she after a moment's thought, [...] "it must be women. Yes, sir." [...] And as she spoke her face flushed with enthusiasm. [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up <b>your</b> cause, and my friends in there, the ladies of the Dorcas Society, will stand by me, I know. I don't know what we shall do, but we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stand by you and your niece." ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of December 3, 1988, Ruiz, Reyes, their son Fernando, and Fernando's wife Leticia, who was {{pregnant}} with their fourth child, were all praying the Rosary. Ruiz in particular was praying for her son Reyes Jr., who was struggling with cocaine addiction and for Fernando and Leticia's marriage. During the final decade, Ruiz says she saw a light emanating from {{a portrait of the}} Immaculate Heart of Mary that grew brighter until it forced her to close her eyes. At that moment, the Virgin spoke to her: [...] "Don't you know that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of <b>your</b> children?" [...] Ruiz was overcome with emotion and began to cry, calling out, [...] "Qué linda! Qué linda!" [...] ("She's beautiful! She's beautiful!").|$|R
6000|$|Such {{an army of}} revolution, 7,000,000 strong, is a {{thing to}} make rulers and ruling classes pause and consider. The cry of this army is, [...] "No quarter! We want all that you possess. We will be content with nothing less than all that you possess. We want in our hands the reins {{of power and the}} destiny of mankind. Here are our hands. They are strong hands. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> governments, your palaces, and all your purpled ease away from you, and in that day you shall work for your bread even as the peasant in the field or the starved and runty clerk in your metropolises. Here are our hands. They are strong hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} I said," [...] said Masterman in parenthesis. [...] "Anyhow, you're {{doing the right}} and sane thing, and that's a rare spectacle. You're going to marry your equal, and you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> own line, quite {{independently}} of what people up there, or people down there, think you ought or ought not to do. That's about the only course one can take nowadays with everything getting more muddled and upside down every day. Make your own little world and your own house first of all, keep that right side up whatever you do, and marry your mate.... That, I suppose, is what I should do--if I had a mate.... But people of my sort, luckily for the world, don't get made in pairs. No! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such {{an army of}} revolution," [...] he said, [...] "twenty-five {{millions}} strong, is a {{thing to}} make rulers and ruling classes pause and consider.

6000|$|Sally {{returned}} to him, {{ready to go}} out. She seemed {{to be afraid of}} him, when he approached her, and took her hand. [...] "Have I done anything wrong?" [...] she asked, in her childish way. [...] "Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me <b>to</b> some other Home?" [...] The tone and look with which she put the question burst through the restraints which Amelius had imposed on himself for her sake. [...] "My dear child!" [...] he said, [...] "can you bear a great surprise? I'm dying to tell you the truth--and I hardly dare do it." [...] He took her in his arms. She trembled piteously. Instead of answering him, she reiterated her question, [...] "Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> me <b>to</b> some other Home?" [...] He could endure it no longer. [...] "This is the happiest day of your life, Sally!" [...] he cried; [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you <b>to</b> <b>your</b> mother." ...|$|R

5000|$|Yasmah-Adad is most {{well known}} for the {{criticism}} he received from his father. Yasmah-Adad was accused of being lazy, self indulgent and not applying himself to his kingly duties. He was once chided for dallying with women and abandoning his duties for his sexual pleasures. The correspondence between the father and sons {{was found in the}} archives of the city of Mari and provides an interesting and at times humorous look into the dynamics of this family. He was ridiculed frequently by both his brother Ishme-Dagan and his father and was accused of inactive leadership over his district. [...] Yasmah-Adad's character was attacked within a letter from his father Shamshi-Adad I, which states, [...] "How long do we have to guide you in every matter? Are you a child, and not an adult? Don't you have a beard on your chin? When are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> charge of <b>your</b> house? Don't you see that your brother is leading vast armies? So, you too, <b>take</b> charge of <b>your</b> palace, your house!" [...] Another letter from his father indicates Shamshi-Adad I's irritation with his youngest son's behavior, comparing Yasmah-Adad to his older brother, a successful warrior: [...] "While here your brother is victorious, down there you lie about among the women." [...] Many of these critiques arose from Yasmah-Adad's failure to perform the political duties that were his to deal with, regardless of what his father was doing. It was Yasmah-Adad's responsibility to fill certain positions within his district, such as appointing a governor of Terqa, or delegating the position of mayor for the Mari palace, and his failure to fulfill these duties was the basis of many of his father's terse letters.|$|R
