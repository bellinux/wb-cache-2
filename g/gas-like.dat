5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and {{his companion}} Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) travel to Victorian Cardiff on Christmas, 1869 where {{there have been}} sightings of strange <b>gas-like</b> creatures. The Doctor and Rose team up with Charles Dickens (Simon Callow) to investigate Mr Sneed (Alan David), a man who runs a funeral parlour where it seems that corpses have come to life. It is revealed that the gaseous Gelth (voiced by Zoe Thorne) have entered Cardiff through a Rift, and wish to survive by taking over the corpses.|$|E
5|$|HeliumI has a <b>gas-like</b> {{index of}} {{refraction}} of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.|$|E
5|$|Moscovium is {{predicted}} to be the third member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 in the periodic table, below bismuth. In this group, each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of +5 but with differing stability. For nitrogen, the +5 state is mostly a formal explanation of molecules like N2O5: {{it is very difficult}} to have five covalent bonds to nitrogen due to the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands. The +5 state is well represented for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. However, for bismuth it becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect, so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. It is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p1/2 electrons, as the binding energy of the lone 7p3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p1/2 electrons. Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and moscovium(I) is likely to show some unique properties, probably behaving more like thallium(I) than bismuth(I). Because of spin-orbit coupling, flerovium may display closed-shell or noble <b>gas-like</b> properties; if this is the case, moscovium will likely be typically monovalent as a result, since the cation Mc+ will have the same electron configuration as flerovium, perhaps giving moscovium some alkali metal character. However, the Mc3+ cation would behave like its true lighter homolog Bi3+. The 7s electrons are too stabilized to be able to contribute chemically and hence the +5 state should be impossible and moscovium may be considered to have only three valence electrons. Moscovium would be quite a reactive metal, with a standard reduction potential of −1.5V for the Mc+/Mc couple.|$|E

25|$|In physics, a photon gas is a <b>gas-like</b> {{collection}} of photons, which has {{many of the}} same properties of a conventional gas like hydrogen or neon – including pressure, temperature, and entropy. The most common example of a photon gas in equilibrium is black body radiation.|$|E
25|$|Dima Bolmatov, V. V. Brazhkin and K. Trachenko {{discovered}} that specific heat shows a crossover between two different dynamic regimes of the low-temperature rigid-liquid and high temperature non-rigid <b>gas-like</b> fluid. Rigid liquids are rigid like a solid on short time scales, but flow like a liquid on long time scales; while a supercritical <b>gas-like</b> fluid has the dynamic motions {{of a gas}} but is able to dissolve materials, like a liquid. The crossover challenges the currently held belief that no difference can be made between a gas and a liquid above the critical point and that the supercritical state is homogeneous in terms of physical properties. Bolmatov and colleagues formulated a theory of system thermodynamics and heat capacity above the crossover. In that theory, energy and heat capacity are governed by the minimal length of the longitudinal mode in the system only, and do not depend on system-specific structure and interactions. Bolmatov and colleagues predicted relationship between supercritical exponents of heat capacity and viscosity and derived a power law for the supercritical state.|$|E
25|$|Manykin et al. have {{suggested}} atmospheric Rydberg matter {{as an explanation}} of ball lightning phenomena. Rydberg matter is a condensed form of highly excited atoms in many aspects similar to electron-hole droplets in semiconductors. However, in contrast to electron-hole droplets, Rydberg matter has an extended life-time—as long as hours. This condensed excited state of matter is supported by experiments, mainly of a group led by Holmlid. It {{is similar to a}} liquid or solid state of matter with extremely low (<b>gas-like)</b> density. Lumps of atmospheric Rydberg matter can result from condensation of highly excited atoms that form by atmospheric electrical phenomena, mainly due to linear lightning. Stimulated decay of Rydberg matter clouds can, however, take the form of an avalanche, and so appear as an explosion.|$|E
2500|$|Materials heated {{beyond a}} few tens of {{thousands}} of kelvins dissociate into their electrons and nuclei, producing a <b>gas-like</b> state of matter known as plasma. Like any hot gas, the plasma has an internal pressure and thus tends to expand according to the ideal gas law. For a fusion reactor, the problem is keeping the plasma contained; any known substance would melt at these temperatures.|$|E
2500|$|A plasma railgun is {{a linear}} {{accelerator}} and a [...] plasma energy weapon which, like a projectile railgun, uses two long parallel electrodes to accelerate a [...] "sliding short" [...] armature. However, in a plasma railgun, the armature and ejected projectile consists of plasma, or hot, ionized, <b>gas-like</b> particles, {{instead of a}} solid slug of material. MARAUDER (Magnetically Accelerated Ring to Achieve Ultra-high Directed Energy and Radiation) is, or was, a United States Air Force Research Laboratory project concerning {{the development of a}} coaxial plasma railgun. It is one of several United States Government efforts to develop plasma-based projectiles. The first computer simulations occurred in 1990, and its first published experiment appeared on August 1, 1993.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{there is}} no surface tension in a {{supercritical}} fluid, as {{there is no}} liquid/gas phase boundary. By changing the pressure and temperature of the fluid, the properties can be [...] "tuned" [...] to be more liquid-like or more <b>gas-like.</b> One of the most important properties is the solubility of material in the fluid. Solubility in a supercritical fluid tends to increase with density of the fluid (at constant temperature). Since density increases with pressure, solubility tends to increase with pressure. The relationship with temperature is a little more complicated. At constant density, solubility will increase with temperature. However, close to the critical point, the density can drop sharply with a slight increase in temperature. Therefore, close to the critical temperature, solubility often drops with increasing temperature, then rises again.|$|E

50|$|Usually, {{strongly}} attractive quantum gases {{are expected}} to form dense particle clusters and lose all <b>gas-like</b> properties. But in 2005, it was proposed by Stefano Giorgini and co-workers {{that there is a}} many body state of attractively interacting bosons that does not decay in one-dimensional systems. If prepared in a special way, this lowest <b>gas-like</b> state should be stable and show new quantum mechanical properties.|$|E
50|$|Ions {{in their}} <b>gas-like</b> state are highly reactive, {{and do not}} occur in large amounts on Earth, except in flames, lightning, {{electrical}} sparks, and other plasmas.|$|E
50|$|Supercritical liquid-gas {{boundaries}} are {{lines in the}} p-T diagram that delimit more liquid-like and more <b>gas-like</b> states of a supercritical fluid. They comprise the Fisher-Widom line, the Widom line, and the Frenkel line.|$|E
5000|$|To {{create this}} response, {{incident}} light couples with the undulating, <b>gas-like</b> charges (plasmons) normally {{on the surface}} of metals. This photon-plasmon interaction results in SPPs that generate intense, localized optical fields. The waves are confined to the interface between metal ...|$|E
5000|$|On January 24, 2012, an {{oil spill}} was {{discovered}} at Kinder Morgan's Sumas terminal in Abbotsford. Local residents began reporting a strong <b>gas-like</b> smell {{coming from the}} area as early as 4:30 a.m. The spill {{was reported to be}} limited to a [...] "containment area." ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{class of}} large scale behaviour, {{which does not}} imply {{directed}} motion is either the spontaneous formation of clusters or the separation in a <b>gas-like</b> and a liquid-like phase, an unexpected phenomenon when the SPP have purely repulsive interaction. This phase separation has been called Motility Induced Phase Separation (MIPS).|$|E
50|$|Plasma {{parameters}} define various {{characteristics of}} a plasma, an electrically conductive collection of charged particles that responds collectively to electromagnetic forces. Plasma typically {{takes the form of}} neutral <b>gas-like</b> clouds or charged ion beams, but may also include dust and grains. The behaviour of such particle systems can be studied statistically.|$|E
50|$|Paint Banbara: Appears in episode 23. Powers include {{transforming}} into a blob {{of paint}} or gas, emitting paint-like and <b>gas-like</b> acid, summoning high wind, a pocket dimension filled with acidic paint called the Accursed World, paint tube-like homing missiles called the Tube Missiles, and an acidic paint storm called the Paint Blizzard.|$|E
5000|$|On January 8, 2007 {{a mysterious}} <b>gas-like</b> odor was {{detected}} throughout New York City. Several buildings, including the Manhattan Center (where {{the show was}} produced) were evacuated. Cold Pizza was replaced with a simulcast of ESPNEWS, with the Mike & Mike Bottom Line informing viewers that [...] "Cold Pizza will return Tuesday." ...|$|E
50|$|From the {{discussion}} above {{one can see}} that the microscopic behavior of particles of moderate and high temperature fluids is qualitatively different. If one heats up a fluid from a temperature close to the melting point up to some high temperature, a crossover from the solid-like to <b>gas-like</b> regime appears. The line of this crossover was named Frenkel line after Yakov Frenkel.|$|E
50|$|An {{overlooked}} {{property of}} hydrophobic concrete {{is its ability}} to repel humidity in the air as well. In contrast tp liquid water, water molecules in the air moving with a higher kinetic energy and ultimately exist in a <b>gas-like</b> form. The crystal structures in hydrophobic concrete are compact enough to prevent humidity from moving through the capillaries of the concrete.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} edition Monster Manual, an allip is {{described}} as having the same features that it did in life, but greatly distorted. The mouth is twisted, and the eyes glow.

It leaves a faint trail of fog behind it as it moves.|$|E

50|$|TEPP {{has shown}} {{to be a very good}} {{insecticide}} to pests like aphids, mites, spiders, mealybugs, leafhoppers, lygus bugs, thrips, leafminers, and many others. TEPP and other organophosphates are the most widely used pesticides in the U.S. due to their effectiveness and relative small impact on the environment. Organophosphates are hydrolyzed and broken down so easily, that the residual period is approximately 48 hours for TEPP. That is enough time for TEPP to do its work, since TEPP is mostly acute toxic with its nerve <b>gas-like</b> properties.|$|E
50|$|Four {{days before}} the explosion, {{residents}} started complaining of a strong <b>gas-like</b> smell coming from the sewers which became progressively more pungent {{over the course of}} those days. They were experiencing symptoms such as stinging in their eyes and throats; and nausea. Some residents even found gasoline coming out of their water pipes. City workers were dispatched to check the sewers and found dangerously high levels of gasoline fumes. However, the city mayor did not feel it was necessary to evacuate the city because he felt that there was no risk of an explosion.|$|E
50|$|According to {{textbook}} knowledge, it {{is possible}} to transform a liquid continuously into a gas, without undergoing a phase transition, by heating and compressing strongly enough to go around the critical point. However, different criteria still allow to distinguish liquid-like and more <b>gas-like</b> states of a supercritical fluid. These criteria result in different boundaries in the pT plane. These lines emanate either from the critical point, or from the liquid-vapor boundary (boiling curve) somewhat below the critical point. They do not correspond to first or second order phase transitions, but to weaker singularities.|$|E

It leaves a faint trail of fog behind it as it moves. The more recent Monster Manuals use the same image {{that was used in}} the earlier ones, despite it not matching the newer description.|$|E

5000|$|A {{collection}} of non-aqueous <b>gas-like</b> ions, {{or even a}} gas containing a proportion of charged particles, is called a plasma. Greater than 99.9% of visible matter in the Universe {{may be in the}} form of plasmas. [...] These include our Sun and other stars and the space between planets, as well as the space in between stars. Plasmas are often called the fourth state of matter because their properties are substantially different from those of solids, liquids, and gases. Astrophysical plasmas predominantly contain a mixture of electrons and protons (ionized hydrogen).|$|E
50|$|Bashir {{finds a way}} {{to remove}} the telepathic {{influence}} from the crew and Odo plays on the trust of both Kira and Sisko to lure both sides into one of the cargo bays. There, Odo and Bashir surprise them as they are about to kill one another. Odo activates Bashir's cure. A purple <b>gas-like</b> cloud emerges from the crew, who regain their senses and demand to know what is happening. He orders everyone to grab hold of something stable and opens the cargo bay doors, venting the cloud into space and removing the telepathic imprint permanently.|$|E
50|$|Materials heated {{beyond a}} few tens of {{thousand}} degrees dissociate into their electrons and nuclei, producing a <b>gas-like</b> {{state of matter}} known as plasma. According to the ideal gas law, like any hot gas, the plasma will have an internal pressure and thus want to expand. For a fusion reactor, the problem is keeping the plasma contained; any known substance would melt at these temperatures. But because a plasma is electrically conductive, it is subject to electric and magnetic fields. In a magnetic field, the electrons and nuclei orbit around the magnetic field lines, confining them to the area defined by the field.|$|E
5000|$|These <b>gas-like</b> ions rapidly {{interact}} with ions of opposite charge to give neutral molecules or ionic salts. Ions are also {{produced in the}} liquid or solid state when salts {{interact with}} solvents (for example, water) to produce [...] "solvated ions," [...] which are more stable, for reasons involving a combination of energy and entropy changes as the ions move {{away from each other}} to interact with the liquid. These stabilized species are more commonly found in the environment at low temperatures. A common example is the ions present in seawater, which are derived from the dissolved salts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{strength}} of the color force means that unlike the <b>gas-like</b> plasma, quark-gluon plasma behaves as a near-ideal Fermi liquid, although research on flow characteristics is ongoing. Liquid or even near-perfect liquid flow with almost no frictional resistance or viscosity was claimed by research teams at RHIC and LHC's Compact Muon Solenoid detector. QGP differs from a [...] "free" [...] collision event by several features; for example, its particle content is indicative of a temporary chemical equilibrium producing an excess of middle-energy strange quarks vs. a nonequilibrium distribution mixing light and heavy quarks ("strangeness production"), {{and it does not}} allow particle jets to pass through ("jet quenching").|$|E
50|$|Currently {{the first}} known group of Horsemen of Apocalypse dates from the 11th century and were sent by Apocalypse to kill a pagan named Folkbern Logan in medieval London. To fill the role of Pestilence, Apocalypse {{recruited}} a mutant that greatly resembles Orb with his arms replaced by wings which allowed him to fly. For the role of Famine, Apocalypse had chosen a Native American female. For the role of War, Apocalypse had recruited a mutant that resembles a mummy. For the role of Death, Apocalypse recruited a mutant who seemed to possess a <b>gas-like</b> body which allowed him to fly. Thor comes to Folkbern's aid and kills the Horsemen of Apocalypse single-handedly.|$|E
