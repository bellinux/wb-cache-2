5|$|Lead's high density, atomic number, and {{formability}} {{form the}} basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation. Lead has no natural resonance frequencies; as a result, sheet-lead is used as a sound <b>deadening</b> layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios. Organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy, mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe. Lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in X-ray rooms due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient. Molten lead {{has been used as a}} coolant for lead-cooled fast reactors.|$|E

25|$|The BAe 146 {{is powered}} by four Avco Lycoming ALF 502 {{turbofan}} engines, which are fixed on pylons underneath the aircraft's high wing. The ALF 502 {{was derived from the}} Lycoming T55 turboshaft powerplant that powers the Chinook heavy transport helicopter. Notably, the ALF 502 had a very low level of operational noise, much lower than most other competing aircraft. This was achieved largely {{through the use of a}} geared turbofan engine; the gearbox allows the fan blade tip speed to stay below the speed of sound dramatically reducing the aircraft noise. Additionally other sound <b>deadening</b> measures include a high bypass ratio compared to contemporary aircraft and additional sound damping layers built into the engine.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{progress}} made {{in improving the}} street's architectural coherence post-1916 and 1922, poor planning controls in the 1970s and 1980s had {{a negative impact on}} the vitality and presentation of O'Connell Street. Like much of Dublin of that time, property speculators and developers were permitted to construct on the thoroughfare what were widely accepted to be inappropriately designed buildings, often entailing the demolition of historic properties, in spite of its Conservation Area status. Fine Victorian and 1920s buildings were demolished in the 1970s including the elaborate Gilbey's premises at the northern end, the Metropole and Capitol cinemas next to the GPO, and even the last intact Wide Streets Commission buildings on the street dating from the 1780s located on the present day site of a well-known shoe shop {{at the southern end of}} the street. Coupled with a neglect of the public domain by the authorities, the emergence of many fast-food joints, gaming arcades, convenience shops and <b>deadening</b> office developments, and poor planning controls that enabled plastic signage, PVC windows and inappropriate alterations to buildings to flourish, O'Connell Street became a shadow of its former self as one of the grand thoroughfares of Europe.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, {{soon after}} Concorde began flying, a Concorde [...] "B" [...] model was {{designed}} with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with {{leading edge slats}} to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds, {{with the objective of}} expanding the range to reach markets in new regions. It featured more powerful engines with sound <b>deadening</b> and without the fuel-hungry and noisy afterburner. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593. This would have given [...] additional range and a greater payload, making new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.|$|E

500|$|MY10: {{versions}} of the VE were released in September 2009. New 3.0-litre and 3.6-litre V6s have been introduced, featuring Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) and coupled to a new six-speed automatic transmission (see above). These revised powertrains are marketed as part of Holden's EcoLine range. Visually, all SIDI versions are distinguished by relocated and additional EcoLine badging. 3.0-litre versions now utilise twin exhaust outlets. Updated cars also gain a recalibrated suspension setup and an extra ball-joint in the rear suspension (previously introduced on the Sportwagon); the result is increased tautness and improved handling in models fitted with 18 and 19-inch diameter wheels. These cars are also equipped with a larger [...] rear stabiliser bar. Additional engine bay sound <b>deadening</b> and a new muffler have resulted in reduced noise, vibration, and harshness. Elsewhere, the fitment of lighter low rolling-resistance tyres aids fuel consumption by minimising friction.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V.

He also felt that, after [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today"—which he called a [...] "snooze-fest"—"Daemonicus" [...] was a [...] "disheartening [...] to get back to monster of the week episodes". Other reviews were more positive. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, said the episode was [...] "sluggishly paced" [...] but praised the [...] "wonderfully tense atmosphere" [...] and Spotnitz's [...] "stylish directing choices".

500|$|Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars. Reviewer Jim DeRogatis praised the album as [...] "one of the rare epic rock {{releases}} whose bulk is justified in the grooves".

[...] DeRogatis contended that while Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness [...] "may even match The Wall in its sonic accomplishments", Corgan's lyrics lacked in comparison. Mojo reviewer Ben Edmunds also praised the music while criticizing Corgan's lyrics. Edmunds wrote, [...] " [...] lyrics {{appear to be the}} repository for the worst aspects of his most treasured influences. He writes with a heavy metal aptitude for wordplay and an inflated prog-rock conviction of its worth, a <b>deadening</b> combination. But there's a sliver of distance in his rage-mongering now that comments as well as expresses."

500|$|The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower {{was opened}} in 1909, the {{culmination}} of a long building project by N. LeBrun and Sons to hold Metropolitan Life's growing headquarters staff, 2,800 strong by 1909. At [...] high and with 50 stories, it became the world's new tallest building. Metropolitan Life intended the skyscraper to promote the company's image, and the building was surrounded by publicity. The tower featured on the front of prominent magazines such as Scientific American, {{as well as on the}} sides of corn flake boxes, coffee packets, and cars. The tower was loosely modeled on the Venician St Mark's Campanile, and featured extensive Early Renaissance-style detailing, with the more modern additions of huge clock faces, electric floodlights for night-time illumination, and an observation deck at the top. Contemporary architects Everett Waid and Harvey Corbett described how the building had [...] "the latest ideas in ventilation, air conditioning, sound <b>deadening,</b> artificial lighting, intercommunicating pneumatic tubes, telephones, call bells, unit operating clock systems [...] special elevator and escalator installations". The design won critical acclaim within the American architectural profession.|$|E
500|$|Katherine Gustafson of ArchitectureWeek {{thought the}} {{building}} [...] "succeeds as a monumental edifice befitting {{its place in}} the urban frame of the National Mall" [...] while Nathan Guttman of The Jewish Daily Forward described the headquarters as an [...] "architectural gem." [...] Architect Roger K. Lewis, professor emeritus of architecture at the University of Maryland, had mixed feelings about the building. [...] He said it was [...] "most visible and aesthetically enticing after dark", while its [...] "unique, idiosyncratic form appears somewhat less enticing" [...] during the day. [...] During the NCPC meeting in 2007 giving final approval to the building, a National Park Service representative said [...] "This building will be a foreign object in the landscape of classical architecture of this city", criticizing the design compared to the neoclassical and Beaux-Arts buildings along Constitution Avenue. [...] The building is highly visible to commuters on Interstate 66 as they enter the city, a fact lamented by Philip Kennicott, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for The Washington Post. [...] In two scathing reviews of the headquarters, Kennicott said [...] "If {{it were not for the}} roof, the building would be unexceptional, just another exercise in boxy architecture pierced by <b>deadening</b> rows of identical rectangular windows" [...] and [...] "The institute’s design marks yet another low point in Safdie’s long descent into repetitive corporate architecture." ...|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley's last {{full-length}} book, {{written in}} the form of letters and published in 1844, was Rambles in Germany and Italy in 1840, 1842 and 1843, which recorded her travels with her son Percy Florence and his university friends. In Rambles, Shelley follows the tradition of Mary Wollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and her own A History of a Six Weeks' Tour in mapping her personal and political landscape through the discourse of sensibility and sympathy. For Shelley, building sympathetic connections between people is the way to build civil society and to increase knowledge: [...] "knowledge, to enlighten and free the mind from clinging <b>deadening</b> prejudices—a wider circle of sympathy with our fellow-creatures;—these are the uses of travel". Between observations on scenery, culture, and [...] "the people, especially in a political point of view", she uses the travelogue form to explore her roles as a widow and mother and to reflect on revolutionary nationalism in Italy. She also records her [...] "pilgrimage" [...] to scenes associated with Percy Shelley. According to critic Clarissa Orr, Mary Shelley's adoption of a persona of philosophical motherhood gives Rambles the unity of a prose poem, with [...] "death and memory as central themes". At the same time, Shelley makes an egalitarian case against monarchy, class distinctions, slavery, and war.|$|E
