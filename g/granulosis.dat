50|$|The {{most common}} {{biological}} control of codling moth is {{the application of}} codling moth <b>granulosis</b> virus (CMGV) in a water based formulation including the <b>granulosis</b> virus, Occlusion Bodies (OBs). CMGV occurs naturally in all major pome fruit growing regions around the world. CMGV is widely used in the commercial and organically grown orchards of Europe and North America. A widely used brand is Virosoft CP4. CP4 is the region of Quebec where the CP4 strain was originally isolated. The CMGV is applied at initiation of egg hatch. The codling moth larvae consume the OB. Next the OB is degraded by the alkaline gut of the codling moth larvae. Then the virus infests the gut membrane linings and reproduces within the larvae. The larvae then stop feeding and eventually die within 3-7 days.|$|E

40|$|The {{conclusions}} {{which may}} {{be drawn from the}} results of the experiments here presented are: 1. The cornea of the rabbit is highly sensitive to the action of various injected bacteria. The lesions vary from insignificant, transient changes to severe, destructive panophthalmitis, with fine gradations from the mildest to the violent form of inflammation. Moreover, animals that receive the same organisms show like changes. 2. The varying degree of inflammatory reaction is related to the pathogenicity of the special culture employed; as, for example, is shown by the reactions to Type I pneumococci and to Bacterium <b>granulosis.</b> It is evident that when a microorganism having a certain degree of virulence is used, a lesion of localized vasculonebulous keratitis resembling pannus tenuis or vasculosus of human trachoma can be induced. Thus Bacterium <b>granulosis,</b> Bacillus xerosis, Hemophilus influenzae, Pneumococcus Type II, Streptococcus viridans, and gonococcus can cause the pannus-like corneal changes in the rabbit. Of these organisms, however, only Bacterium <b>granulosis</b> induces early, uncomplicated and enduring keratitic lesions; the others cause first, diffuse keratitis with suppurative lesions; then, as a residual effect, transient, localized, vasculonebulous changes in the cornea. These changes, in contradistinction to the <b>granulosis</b> lesions, are, therefore delayed, complicated, and transient. When, on the other hand, the invasiveness and infecting power of the organisms are low, {{as is the case with}} the filtrable, Gram-negative bacillus and the small, Gram-negative bacilli ultimately derived from cases of folliculosis, no marked effect is produced by their intracorneal inoculation. If the pathogenicity of bacteria is high (as shown by Pneumococcus Type I, hemolytic streptococcus, and the remaining bacteria), intracorneal inoculation of the microorganisms leads to serious suppurative or destructive changes. 3. The results of experiments with monkeys indicate that while pannus is not a sequel of experimental trachomatous conjunctivitis, a lesion resembling it follows intracorneal inoculation of Bacterium <b>granulosis.</b> 4. One can infer from these results, therefore, that the stimulus necessary to produce corneal changes in animals, similar to those of trachomatous pannus, is an agent having a definite but extremely low power of invasiveness and infectivity...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} parasitism and temperature on the production of intersexes in the amphipod Gammarus duebeni from a field population at Cumbrae, Scotland.

Prevalence of Nosema <b>granulosis,</b> a feminising microsporidian parasite, also varied temporally {{and there was a}} significant correlation between parasite prevalence and intersex frequency in the field. Intersexes (16. 3 ± 0. 4 mg) were larger than true females (14. 8 ± 0. 1 mg) but produced fewer eggs thus demonstrating a cost of intersexuality. Intersexes {{were less likely to be}} paired than true females. In a breeding experiment, only females infected by N. <b>granulosis</b> produced intersex offspring. Temperature had no effect on intersex frequency. Intersexes therefore appear to be the result of incomplete feminisation by N. <b>granulosis</b> in this population. These results contrast with previous studies of G. duebeni from different populations which found that intersexes were the result of abnormal development under environmental sex determination.

40|$|Background: Hydatidosis is {{a common}} {{zoonosis}} that affects {{a large number of}} humans and animals, especially in poorly developed countries. The infesting parasite has four forms named Echinococcus <b>granulosis,</b> E. multilocularis, E. vogeli and E. oligarthrus (very rare in humans). The most frequently involved organs are liver followed by the lung. The involvement of the genital tract is rare and the occurrence in the uterus is an extreme rarity. We report a case of hydatid cyst in the uterus. Case: A 70 -year-old female with a history of hydatid cysts of the liver, was admitted to hospital after complaining of low abdominal pains. On physical and gynecological examinations, no pathological finding was detected. However, the uterus was significantly large for a postmenopausal patient. Transvaginal sonography (TS) revealed a cystic mass in the uterus with a size of 7 ´ 6 cm. After further examinations a subtotal hysterectomy was performed. Microscopic examination showed scolices of Echinococcus <b>granulosis.</b> Conclusion: Hydatid cysts in the genital tract are rare and the occurrence in the uterus is an extreme rarity.

By cloning, sequencing, and hybridization analysis, one of these insertions {{was identified as a}} transposon-like element derived from the C. leucotreta genome. This element, called TCl 4. 7, was found in the genome of CpGV which naturally replicates in C. pomonella. Sequence analysis suggested that TCl 4. 7 is 4726 bp in size, flanked by imperfect inverted terminal repeats of 29 bp, and integrated into the target dinucleotide TA. TCl 47 encompasses an open reading frame sharing homologies to transposase genes of the Tc 1 -related transposable elements found in Caenorhabditis and in Drosophila species. The open reading frame might represent a pseudogene since it is missing an ATG start codon. The integration site of TCl 4. 7 is located in a non-protein-coding region of the CpGV genome at m. u. 9. 5. In bioassays the TCl 4. 7 -carrying virus and all the other mutants except for one showed LC 50 values similar to those of CpGV and ClGV.

40|$|In {{a recent}} Clinics article(1), the authors {{reported}} on a patient with liver and lung hydatid cysts and identified the causative agent being the parasite Echinococcus. Hydatid cysts are rare human infections, but are complex disease processes with its geographical area of occurrence becoming larger, and therefore, emerging as a greater public health hazard(2, 3). The two Echinococcus organisms reported to cause cysts are Echinococcus granulosus(2) or <b>granulosis</b> and E. alveolari(2, 4). It {{should be noted that}} E. alveolaris is probably better identified as E. multilocularis (alveolaris or alveolar) (2). It is mentioned that domestic dogs are the definitive host; however, others reported that it is also in the fox(3). As suggested by the authors(1), other animals can serve as intermediate hosts for these parasites (e. g. sheep) (2). It is likely that infected foxes are transmitting these parasites to domesticated dogs and cats, resulting in a wider diversity of intermediate hosts(3). There are distinct differences in hydatid cysts caused by E. <b>granulosis</b> and E. multilocularis. Cysts caused by E. <b>granulosis</b> are “typically uniocular as spherical or subspherical”, with smooth, thin-walled lesions which are well-defined, and have clear fluid often associated with a single chamber(2, 5).

We believe we have succeeded, by a suitable technique, in doing this and in producing thereby in the experimental animals a condition closely resembling the florid type of human trachoma (Type IIb and c of MacCallan). The organisms used were some of those which are found in the conjunctival sac of monkey and man with different types of granular conjunctivitis.

In this paper we shall present the results of cultivation experiments with conjunctival tissue from patients with trachoma residing in New York City, and of transmission tests in monkeys with the same materiM. The susceptibility of monkeys to conjunctival secretions from animals experimentally infected with trachomatous tissues or with cultures of Bacterium <b>granulosis</b> has also been studied.

40|$|The {{evidence}} hitherto reported {{concerning the}} filtration of trachomatous material, and inoculation {{of man and}} monkeys with the filtrates points {{to the conclusion that}} the incitant of trachoma is not, as a rule, filtrable. Our findings confirm this view and indicate further that no virus causing the disease is adsorbed to Bacterium <b>granulosis.</b> On the other hand, Bacterium <b>granulosis</b> itself in heavy suspensions is irregularly filtrable through Berkefeld V candles, like some other bacteria (14), but it is present in the filtrates in only small numbers. When suspensions were used of trachomatous human and monkey tissues, which contain much fewer organisms than do actual cultures, Bacterium <b>granulosis</b> was never recovered from the filtrates. The conception that trachoma is a disease caused by an ultramicroscopic virus is based on (a) the positive results of filtration in two animals, as reported by Nicolle and his coworkers, and (b) the presence of so called "inclusion bodies" in some of the cells of the lesions. One can state definitely that the evidence is now greatly against the filtrability of the etiological agent of trachoma. Furthermore, filtrability does not in itself suffice for the classification of an agent as an ultramicroscopic virus. Concerning (b), a vast literature has accumulated which indicates that the "inclusion bodies" of trachoma are not specific for the disease and that the bodies themselves may be bacterial in origin (15).
