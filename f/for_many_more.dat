5|$|Fare is payable by MetroCard. Since {{this card}} enables free {{transfers}} for a continuing {{ride on the}} subway and bus systems, <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> riders there is effectively no fare at all for riding SIR. Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus, SIR, and a Manhattan bus or subway near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR's farebox recovery ratio in 2001 was 0.16that is, for every dollar of expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares, the lowest ratio of MTA agencies. The low farebox recovery ratio {{is part of the}} reason the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper which will simplify the accounting and subsidization of what is essentially a single line.|$|E

5|$|The German attack caught {{large numbers}} of Soviet Air Force {{aircraft}} on the ground.

Even Göring found these figures hard to believe and ordered them to be re-checked. As the ground troops advanced, the figures could be directly confirmed and were found to be too low. Within days, Kesselring was able to fly solo over the front in his Focke-Wulf Fw 189.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} role in the Clan is that of the leader. The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make all the important decisions, such as whether or not to engage in battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> moons to come. This means that Clan leaders can often live longer than that of a normal cat. To mark their new status, Clan leaders are given the suffix –star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan leaders sleep alone, although male leaders are allowed to take a mate. Female leaders are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits, which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series.|$|E

A ship about 105mi (165km) {{from the center}} reported sustained winds of 48mph (77km/h), supporting an upgrade to Tropical Storm Greg by 18:00UTC on September5. In spite of dissipating banding features, a large mass of extremely deep convection developed near the center that night. Radar out of Los Cabos indicated that an eye {{was in the process}} of forming by early on September6, and Greg was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane in conjunction with satellite intensity estimates by 18:00UTC that day. Six hours later, the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 986mbar (hPa; 29.12inHg). Greg maintained its status <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> hours, even though outflow became restricted to the northeast and low-level cloud lines near the storm's eye became exposed.|$|E
