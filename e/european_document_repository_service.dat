The major technical contribution of our approach is the seamless integration of features found in systems such as file systems, <b>document</b> <b>repositories,</b> directory <b>services,</b> classification hierarchies, and email folders into a single folderbased system. The user may specify a rules for characterizing interesting or relevant document classes. Based on these rules which are checked for consistency, folder are not only populated with documents, but folders themselves are created and deleted based on the occurrence of values in documents...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{personal}} desktops have faced {{the problem of}} information overload due to increasing computational power, {{easy access to the}} Web and cheap data storage. Moreover, an increasing number of diverse end-user desktop applications have led to the problem of information fragmentation. Each desktop application has its own data, unaware of related and relevant data in other applications. In other words, personal desktops face a lack of interoperability of data managed by different applications. Recent years have also seen the rapid growth of shared data in online social network communities. Desktop users have been publishing extensively data from their personal desktops to different social-networking sites. In the current data- publishing scenario, desktop data that is published to a social network becomes completely disconnected from desktops they originate. Moreover, there is no interoperability between the same desktop data published to different social networks. A core idea of a Social Semantic Desktop vision is to enable semantic integration and data interoperability on the personal desktop by applying Semantic Web technologies, and to connect data from personal desktops into a unified information space of social network communities. This thesis introduces a new form of documents, called Semantic Documents, which attempts to bring desktop documents closer to this vision and provides a software architecture, namely Semantic Document Architecture (SDArch) that supports semantic documents. Semantic documents enable unique identification, semantic annotation, and semantic linking of fine-grained units of documents’ data. Semantic links can be established between the semantically related document data units, whether they are stored on the same personal desktop or shared within social networks. Therefore, semantic documents integrate data of desktop documents into a unified desktop information space as well as fill the gap between the desktop information space and the information space of the social network communities. New processes such as the semantic document search and navigation, which are enabled by such integrated desktop information space, improve the effectiveness and efficiency of desktop users in carrying out their daily tasks. The thesis’s main contributions are the development of the Semantic Document Model (SDM) that describes semantic documents and the design of SDArch that provides solutions for the semantic <b>document</b> <b>repository,</b> <b>services</b> that support semantic documents related processes, and tools that enable desktop users to interact with semantic documents. Additionally, in order to validate the thesis I implemented the SDArch prototype, which is a fully-functional software providing the implementation of all the intended SDArch functionalities. The thesis is validated by two evaluation studies: i) the experimental evaluation of the information retrieval in integrated collections of semantic documents, and ii) the usability evaluation of the user effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in using the SDArch services and tools. The results of these two evaluation studies proved that semantic documents have potential to semantically integrate and improve interoperability of desktop data, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of desktop users while carrying out their daily tasks...|$|R

40|$|Institutional <b>document</b> <b>repositories</b> show a {{systematic}} growth {{as well as}} a sustainable deployment. Therefore, they represent the current backbone of a distributed repository infrastructure. Many developments for electronic publishing through digital repositories are heading in the direction of innovative value-added services such as citation analysis or annotation systems. A rich service-layer based on machine-to-machine communication between value-added <b>services</b> and <b>document</b> <b>repositories</b> requires a reliable operation and data management within each <b>repository.</b> Aggregating search <b>services</b> such as OAISTER and BASE provide good results. But in order to provide good quality they also have to overcome heterogeneity by normalizing many of the data they receive and build specific profiles for sometimes even one individual repository. Since much of the normalization is done {{at the side of the}} service provider, it often remains unclear — maybe sometimes also to the manager of a local repository — exactly which data and services are exposed to the public. Here, an exploratory validation method for testing specification compliance in repositories is presented...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{trend towards}} open data and open science {{as well as}} a demand for {{holistic}} and interdisciplinary research requires platforms that allow the distribution and exchange of research data, including geographic information. While the requirements and benefits of data exchange are widely discussed, there are few proposals on how to implement data platforms that not only permit the exchange of research data among researchers, but also permit to distribute research results and data to the interest public. We elaborate what points are important for implementing a (geographic) data repository and propose then to adopt the concept of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) as a solution for the implementation of research data repositories. We present as a case study the geographic data and <b>document</b> <b>repository</b> of the Chilean research Centre on Sustainable Urban Development (CEDEUS), the CEDEUS Observatory. Besides the infrastructure to host and distribute data, communication tools are an important component of such a data <b>repository</b> <b>service.</b> For this case study we analyse which things have worked well and which things have not worked well based on the experiences collected during three years of operation. We close with some recommendations for the implementation of data repositories for research...|$|R
