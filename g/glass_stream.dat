40|$|The {{development}} of vitrification technology for converting radioactive waste {{into a glass}} solid {{began in the early}} 1960 s. Some problems encountered in the vitrification process are still waiting for a solution. One of them is wicking. During pouring, the <b>glass</b> <b>stream</b> flows down the wall of the pour spout until it reaches an angled cut in the wall. At this point, the stream is supposed to break cleanly away from the wall of the pour spout and fall freely into the canister. However, the <b>glass</b> <b>stream</b> is often pulled toward the wall and does not always fall into the canister, a phenomenon known as wicking. Phase 1 involves the assembly, construction, and testing of a melter capable of supplying molten glass at operational flow rates over a break-off point knife edge. Phase 2 will evaluate the effects of glass and pour spout temperatures as well as glass flow rates on the glass flow behavior over the knife edge. Phase 3 will identify the effects on wicking resulting from varying the knife edge diameter and height as well as changing the back-cut angle of the knife edge. The following tasks were completed in FY 97 : Design the experimental system for glass melting and pouring; Acquire and assemble the melter system; and Perform initial research work...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Glass dust waste creates chronic {{environmental}} problems, mainly {{due to the}} inconsistency {{of waste}} <b>glass</b> <b>streams.</b> <b>Glass</b> is widely used in our lives through manufactured products such as sheet glass, bottles, glassware, and vacuum tubing. Glass is an ideal material for recycling. The use of recycled glass helps in energy saving. The increasing awareness of glass recycling speeds up inspections {{on the use of}} waste glass with different forms in various fields. One of its significant contributions is to the construction field where the waste glass was reused for concrete production. The properties of concretes containing glass dust waste as fine aggregate were investigated in this study. Glass dust waste was used as a partial replacement for sand at 10 %, 20 % and 50 % of concrete mixes. Compression strength for 7, 14 and 28 days concrete of age were compared with those of concrete made with natural fine aggregates. The results proved that highest strength activity given by glass dust waste after 28 days. The compressive strength of specimens with 10 % glass dust waste content were 32. 9373 MPa, higher than the concrete control specimen at 28 days. Using glass dust waste in concrete is an interesting possibility for economy on waste disposal sites and conservation of natural resources...|$|R

40|$|Issue: Increasing {{amounts of}} {{equipment}} are being advertised, purchased, and installed for crushing glass. There {{are two reasons}} for the proliferation of equipment. First, container manufacturers are using higher percentages of recycled glass in their batches, requiring greater supplies of recycled glass. Second, in areas where glass cannot be economically shipped to container manufacturers, or for mixed color glass that has no value to container manufacturers, local groups are investing in equipment to process collected glass for local uses. There are no “one-size-fits-all ” glass processing systems. Purchasing decisions generally are reduced to a trade-off between cost and quality. Any group considering the purchase of glass processing equipment should consider the factors described in this Best Practice. Best Practice: Maintenance and warranty Crushing equipment should be easy to operate and maintain, and training should be available from the manufacturer. In addition to the expected wear of impact surfaces, all surfaces coming {{into contact with the}} <b>glass</b> <b>stream</b> will wear.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate a}} variety of materials and coatings for the DWPF pour spout bellows liner. The intent was to identify materials that would minimize or eliminate adherence of glass on the bellows liner wall and help minimize possible pluggage during glass pouring operations in DWPF. Glass has been observed adhering to the current bellow`s liner, which is made of 304 L stainless steel. Materials were identified which successfully allowed molten glass to hit these surfaces and not adhere. Results {{of this study suggest}} that if these materials are used in the pouring system glass could still fall into the canister without appreciable plugging, even if an unstable <b>glass</b> <b>stream</b> is produced. The materials should next be evaluated under the most realistic DWPF conditions possible. Other findings of this study include the following: (1) increasing coupon thickness produced a favorable increase in the glass sticking temperature; (2) highly polished surfaces, with the exception of the oxygen-free copper coupon coated with Armoloy dense chromium, did not produce a significant improvement in the glass sticking temperature, increasing angle of contact of the coupon to the falling glass did not yield a significant performance improvement; (3) electroplating with gold and silver and various diffusion coatings did not produce a significant increase in the glass sticking temperature.

40|$|AbstractThis {{experimental}} study aimed to design an {{autoclaved aerated concrete}} (AAC) with different kind of glass wastes as an alternative fine aggregates for mass housing projects that will meet the requirements {{in order to help}} contribute to the industry in saving the environment. Moreover we want to encourage the government to find solutions regarding the disposal to landfills of glassy waste materials and provide new knowledge to the contractors and developers on how to improve the construction industry methods and services by using glassy waste to sustain good product performance and meet recycling goals. Different kinds of glass wastes in the form of sub grain packaging glass cullet, CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) panel glass waste and calsi glass, were used as a sand replacement in AAC production. Large proportion of the post-consumer glass is recycled into the packaging stream again, but some sub grain packaging glass cullet does not meet the strict criteria for packaging glass thus is sent to landfill. CRT is classified as a hazardous glass waste and there are several issues surround CRTs which create barriers to increased recovery of the glass. In countries e. g. Latin America and Asia where still CRT glass is being produced even when shredder, the <b>glass</b> <b>stream</b> is a mixture of panel and funnel glass, making it difficult for reuse in new CRTs. Based on our knowledge also calsi glass as a processed blast furnace slag is not used in packaging production. The viability of current and novel applications of mentioned glasses is examined here. Although aerated concrete was initially envisaged as a good insulation material, there has been renewed interest in its structural characteristics in view of its lighter weight, savings in material and potential for large scale utilization of wastes. Due to this fact we undertake the studies of an influence of different amounts of glass wastes onto properties of aerated concrete in terms of physical (microstructure, density), mechanical (compressive and tensile strengths) and chemical characteristic. Use of milled waste glass in concrete as partial re-placement of sand represents an important step towards development of sustainable (environmentally friendly, energy-efficient and economic concrete-based infrastructure systems...|$|E

40|$|Issue: Ferrous metal {{contaminants}} {{are common}} in post-consumer <b>glass</b> waste <b>streams.</b> However, enduse specifications frequently call for near zero levels of ferrous metals (see Specifications for Container Manufacturing and Specifications for Fiberglass Manufacturing Best Practices). Ferrous metals can cause damage to glass furnaces and production equipment. Also, many alternative uses for recycled glass cannot tolerate ferrous metals because of chemical incompatibilities or because the ferrous metals will oxidize over time. In addition to these manufacturing problems, larger pieces of ferrous metal may also damage crushing and screening equipment. Therefore, efficient and economical ferrous metal removal is critical in glass processing. Best Practice: The positive characteristic of ferrous contamination is that these materials are magnetic and therefore can be detected and removed with the strategic use of magnetic separation technologies. Magnetic separation {{has been used in}} many material-handling applications for decades. Magnetic separators can be configured in numerous ways to meet the processing needs of any commodity.

Both dirty and clean culler was considered. The analyses, carried out in the MIR spectral field (2280 - 4480 nm), show that ceramic glass and glass fragments can be recognized according to their different spectral signature.

40|$|A {{recommendation}} {{to eliminate all}} characterization of pour <b>stream</b> <b>glass</b> samples and the glass fabrication and Product Consistency Test (PCT) of the sludge batch qualification sample was made by a Six-Sigma team chartered to eliminate non-value-added activities for the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) sludge batch qualification program and is documented in the report SS-PIP- 2006 - 00030. That recommendation was supported through a technical data review by the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and is documented in the memorandums SRNL-PSE- 2007 - 00079 and SRNL-PSE- 2007 - 00080. At the time of writing those memorandums, the DWPF was processing sludge-only waste but, has since transitioned to a coupled operation (sludge and salt). The SRNL was recently tasked to perform a similar data review relevant to coupled operations and re-evaluate the previous recommendations. This report evaluates the validity of eliminating the characterization of pour <b>stream</b> <b>glass</b> samples and the glass fabrication and Product Consistency Test (PCT) of the sludge batch qualification samples based on sludge-only and coupled operations. The pour stream sample has confirmed the DWPF's ability to produce an acceptable waste form from Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) blending and product composition/durability predictions for the previous sixteen years but, ultimately the pour stream analysis has added minimal value to the DWPF's waste qualification strategy. Similarly, the information gained from the glass fabrication and PCT of the sludge batch qualification sample was determined to add minimal value to the waste qualification strategy since that sample is routinely not representative of the waste composition ultimately processed at the DWPF due to blending and salt processing considerations. Moreover, the qualification process has repeatedly confirmed minimal differences in glass behavior from actual radioactive waste to glasses fabricated from simulants or batch chemicals. In contrast, the variability study has significantly added value to the DWPF's qualification strategy. The variability study has evolved to become the primary aspect of the DWPF's compliance strategy {{as it has been}} shown to be versatile and capable of adapting to the DWPF's various and diverse waste streams and blending strategies. The variability study, which aims to ensure durability requirements and the PCT and chemical composition correlations are valid for the compositional region to be processed at the DWPF, must continue to be performed. Due to the importance of the variability study and its place in the DWPF's qualification strategy, it will also be discussed in this report. An analysis of historical data and Production Records indicated that the recommendation of the Six Sigma team to eliminate all characterization of pour <b>stream</b> <b>glass</b> samples and the glass fabrication and PCT performed with the qualification glass does not compromise the DWPF's current compliance plan. Furthermore, the DWPF should continue to produce an acceptable waste form following the remaining elements of the Glass Product Control Program; regardless of a sludge-only or coupled operations strategy. If the DWPF does decide to eliminate the characterization of pour stream samples, pour stream samples should continue to be collected for archival reasons, which would allow testing to be performed should any issues arise or new repository test methods be developed...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 A new, energy {{efficient}} recycling technology {{is being developed}} that is compatible with post-consumer and post-industrial waste glass. This technology {{may be used to}} produce sustainable materials for the green building industry. During the process, materials are consolidated through cold isostatic pressing and then densified at temperatures up to 55 % lower than the melting temperature. Densification through warm working was found to be compatible with common contaminants present in the <b>glass</b> waste <b>stream</b> and the process results in porous materials that possess up to 95 % recycle content. Moreover, when compared to traditional manufacturing techniques, this process will reduce energy consumption by up to 70 %. The objectives of this research were to characterize the physical and mechanical behavior of materials created through this process and compare these behaviors to established models for porous brittle materials. In addition, the sintering behavior of contaminated waste glass was characterized through fractography. The results of this research show that high strength materials with predictable physical and mechanical behavior can be successfully formed at very low temperatures. Given the random nature of the pore structure, a probabilistic rather than deterministic approach was utilized in characterizing the mechanical behavior of the material. Analysis of the data yielded values for compressive strength varying between 6. 8 and 150. 8 MPa and values for transverse rupture strength varying between 2. 8 and 29. 9 MPa. In addition, the presence of contaminants did not impede sintering and materials {{with a wide range of}} porosity could be produced by using this process. Further, it was found that the resulting materials exhibited performance characteristics in excess of requirements for common masonry materials used in the construction industry...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) waste {{management}} strategy revolves around specific treatment of individual {{or groups of}} separated waste streams. A goal for the separations processes is to efficiently manage the waste to be dispositioned as high level radioactive waste. The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) baseline technology for immobilization of the lanthanide (Ln) and transition metal fission product (TM) wastes is vitrification into a borosilicate glass. A current interest is to evaluate the feasibility of vitrifying combined waste streams to most cost effectively immobilize the wastes resulting from aqueous fuel reprocessing. Studies showed that high waste loadings are achievable for the Ln only (Option 1) stream. Waste loadings in excess of 60 wt % (on a calcined oxide basis) were demonstrated via a lanthanide borosilicate (LaBS) glass.

Prior to actual plutonium glass testing, surrogate testing (using Hf as a surrogate for Pu) was conducted to evaluate the homogeneity of significant quantities of Hf (Pu) in the glass, determine the most appropriate methods to evaluate homogeneity for Pu glass testing, and to evaluate the impact of Hf loading in the glass on select glass properties. Surrogate testing was conducted using Hf to represent between 0 and 1 wt % Pu in glass on an equivalent molar basis. A Pu loading of 1 wt % in glass translated to {approx} 18 kg Pu per Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) canister, or about 10 X the current allowed limit per the Waste Acceptance Product Specifications (2500 g/m{sup 3 } of glass or about 1700 g/canister) and about 30 X the current allowable concentration based on the fissile material concentration limit referenced in the Yucca Mountain Project License Application (897 g/m{sup 3 } 3 of glass or about 600 g Pu/canister). Based on historical process throughput data, this level was considered to represent a reasonable upper bound for Pu loading based on the ability to provide Pu containing feed to the DWPF. The task elements included evaluating the distribution of Pu in the glass (e. g. homogeneity), evaluating crystallization within the glass, evaluating select glass properties (with surrogates), and evaluating durability using the Product Consistency Test [...] Method A (PCT-A). The behavior of Pu in the melter was evaluated using paper studies and corresponding analyses of DWPF melter pour samples. The results of the testing indicated that at 1 wt % Pu in the glass, the Pu was homogeneously distributed and did not result in any formation of plutonium-containing crystalline phases as long as the glass was prepared under 'well-mixed' conditions. The incorporation of 1 wt % Pu in the glass did not adversely impact glass viscosity (as assessed using Hf surrogate) or glass durability. Finally, evaluation of DWPF glass pour samples that had Pu concentrations below the 897 g/m{sup 3 } limit showed that Pu concentrations in the <b>glass</b> pour <b>stream</b> were close to targeted compositions in the melter feed indicating that Pu neither volatilized from the melt nor stratified in the melter when processed in the DWPF melter...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{abrasive}} waterjet (AWJ) cutting {{systems in}} the industrial sector has been limited to applications {{that are difficult to}} machine using conventional methods. A major factor for this limited use is the high cost of the garnet abrasive currently used. Initial studies indicated that glass can be processed to produce particles with the desired characteristics {{at a fraction of the}} existing price of garnet. Inexpensive abrasive waterjet cutting systems would allow a wider array of glass products to be produced while eliminating many existing design limitations. Availability of low-cost abrasive waterjet cutting media would open new markets for glass applications by making glass a more versatile material. A fundamental goal of this project was to scale up and refine the circuit that was established in the initial phase of this project, which using waste glass as a feed stream, could economically produce glass particles displaying high angularity, sharp edges and a low aspect ratio which would prove suitable for use in abrasive waterjet (AWJ) cutting systems. Using commercial scale equipment, demonstration runs were conducted at various manufacturers facilities to further establish that waste glass is a viable source for the production of an inexpensive AWJ media for use in cutting glass and a variety of other materials. The glass abrasive produced was used to demonstrate that processed waste glass could serve as a less costly alternative to garnet in many AWJ cutting applications. Studies indicated that glass can be processed to produce particles with the desired characteristics at less than 1 % of the existing price of garnet. The waste stream resulting from the use of the glass abrasive in an AWJ system was in turn used as a source for inexpensive fillers in various polymers. The reduced energy requirements needed to produce glass abrasives and lower cost associated with the use of waste glass over garnet, as well as the environmental benefits associated with the recycling of <b>glass</b> waste <b>streams</b> were the primary objectives of this project. The use of the glass abrasive produced in this study did not result in feed rates as high as was expected when used as the media in the cutting of plate glass products. Furthermore, the process and equipment refinements that have been implemented at the PPG and Donnelly facilities since this project was initiated have also served to reduce their energy requirements and in turn the cost associated with the production of sidelites and foiled prisms using conventional means. In addition, further improvements would have to be realized in the cutting of these harder materials before the use of an AWJ system could be viewed as an economically viable means of establishing the perimeter of either product. The possibility of tempering to increase the hardness of the glass media may be one means of achieving this goal...|$|R
40|$|There are {{hundreds}} of commercially installed SNCR systems {{on a wide range}} of boiler configurations including: dry bottom wall fired and tangentially fired units, wet bottom units, stokers, and fluidized bed units. These units fire a variety of fuels such as coal, oil, gas, biomass, and waste. Other applications include thermal incinerators, municipal and hazardous solid waste combustion units, cement kilns, process heaters, and <b>glass</b> furnaces. Emission <b>Stream</b> Characteristics: a. Combustion Unit Size: In the United States, SNCR has been applied to boilers and other combustion units ranging in size from 50 to 6, 000 MMBtu/hr (5 to 600 MW/hr) (EPA, 2002). Until recently, it was difficult to get high levels of NOx reduction on units greater than 3, 000 MMBtu (300 MW) due to limitations in mixing. Improvements in SNCR injection and control systems have resulted in high NO X reductions (> 60 %) on utility boilers greater than 6, 000 MMBtu/hr (600 MW). (ICAC, 2000). b. Temperature: The NO X reduction reaction occurs at temperatures between 1600 °F to 2100 °F (870 °C to 1150 °C) (EPA, 2002). Proprietary chemicals, referred to as enhancers or additives, can be added to the reagent to lower the temperature range at which the NO X reduction reactions occur. c. Pollutant Loading: SNCR tends to be less effective at lower levels of uncontrolled NO X. Typical uncontrolled NO X levels vary from 200 ppm to 400 ppm (NESCAUM, 2000). SNCR is better suited for applications with high levels of PM in the waste gas stream than SCR. d. Other Considerations: Ammonia slip refers to emissions of unreacted ammonia that result from incomplete reaction of the NO X and the reagent. Ammonia slip may cause: 1) formation of ammonium sulfates, which can plug or corrode downstream components, 2) ammonia absorption into fly ash, which may affect disposal or reuse of the ash, and 3) increased plum...|$|R
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) began {{processing}} Sludge Batch 6 (SB 6), {{also referred}} to as Macrobatch 7 (MB 7), in June 2010. SB 6 is a blend of the heel of Tank 40 from Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5), H-Canyon Np transfers and SB 6 that was transferred to Tank 40 from Tank 51. 1 SB 6 was processed using Frit 418. Sludge is received into the DWPF Chemical Processing Cell (CPC) and is processed through the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and Slurry Mix Evaporator Tank (SME). The treated sludge slurry is then transferred to the Melter Feed Tank (MFT) and fed to the melter. During processing of each sludge batch, the DWPF is required to take at least one glass sample to meet the objectives of the Glass Product Control Program (GPCP) and to complete the necessary Production Records so that the final glass product may be disposed of at a Federal Repository. The DWPF requested various analyses of radioactive glass samples obtained from the melter pour stream during processing of SB 6 as well as reduction/oxidation (REDOX) analysis of MFT samples to determine the impact of Argon bubbling. Sample analysis followed the Task Technical and Quality Assurance Plan (TTQAP) and an Analytical Study Plan (ASP). Four Pour <b>Stream</b> (PS) <b>glass</b> samples and two MFT slurry samples were delivered to the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) from the DWPF. Table 1 - 1 lists the sample information for each pour <b>stream</b> <b>glass</b> sample. SB 6 PS 3 (S 03472) was selected as the official pour stream sample for SB 6 and full analysis was requested. This report details the visual observations of the as-received SB 6 PS No. 3 glass sample as well as results for the chemical composition, Product Consistency Test (PCT), radionuclide content, noble metals, and glass density. REDOX results will be provided for all four pour stream samples and vitrified samples of MFT- 558 and MFT- 568 A. Where appropriate, data from other pour stream samples will be provided...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Over {{the past}} 50 years U. S. {{consumers}} and municipalities have made efforts to decrease landfill waste and reduce raw material extraction through recycling. The {{rate of recycling}} has risen tenfold over that time period and many materials, such as paper and aluminum, can be efficiently and effectively recycled into new products. However, this is often {{not the case for}} glass. Currently, over 11 million tons of post-consumer glass enters the municipal solid waste stream annually and the majority is collected for recycling. Unfortunately, less than 30 % of the collected glass is successfully recycled into new products, while the remaining ~ 7. 5 million tons is ultimately sent to landfills. A new, energy efficient glass recycling technology is being developed at EnVitrum, Inc., a UW spinout based in Seattle. The process uses waste glass as the primary feedstock in the manufacture of high recycle-content building materials. This technology is compatible with post-consumer and post-industrial waste glass and may provide a commercial outlet for the vast quantities of post-consumer glass that cannot be recycled using current technology. Moreover, due to reduced process temperatures and densification times, the materials produced through this process would have lower embodied energy and shorter production cycle times than traditional products. This would be of great benefit to potential manufacturers and in addition, the end-products resulting from this process would provide the construction industry with a sustainable material alternative. During the process, materials are consolidated through cold isostatic pressing and then densified at temperatures up to 55 % lower than the melting temperature. Initial studies conducted by Marchelli and Prabhakar at EnVitrum, showed that densification through warm working was found to be compatible with common contaminants present in the <b>glass</b> waste <b>stream</b> and the process resulted in porous materials that possessed up to 95 % recycle content. In 2012, an exploratory study was undertaken by Prabhakar and the results indicated that overall the physical and mechanical behavior of the material could be predictably calibrated by modification of process parameters (primarily densification temperature). However, the results presented were preliminary and it was hypothesized that inconsistencies stemmed from issues associated with processing. Therefore, advanced improvements of the process will be needed. The purpose of the research described herein was to i) investigate improvements to material processing conditions that may have affected the preliminary results, ii) characterize the physical & mechanical behavior with respect to peak densification temperature, and iii) compare the mechanical properties to zero porosity values and evaluate the suitability of established porosity-property correlations. Through this work, several improvements were made to the formation and densification processes. As a result, it was determined that the EnVitrum process is compatible with post-consumer waste glass and high strength materials can be created at lower temperatures than indicated by previous investigations. Most importantly, the findings agree with Prabhakar’s earlier assertion that the mechanical behavior of the material could be predictably calibrated by modification of process parameters and it was found that materials with sufficient strength for a variety of construction applications could be produced...|$|R
