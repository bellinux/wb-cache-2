5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the <b>docking</b> module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter <b>Docking</b> System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the <b>docking</b> module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the <b>docking</b> ring on the Orbiter <b>Docking</b> System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to module-specific equipment, Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr and Priroda were each equipped with one Lyappa arm, a robotic arm which, after the module had docked {{to the core}} module's forward port, grappled one of two fixtures positioned on the core module's <b>docking</b> node. The arriving module's <b>docking</b> probe was then retracted, and the arm raised the module {{so that it could}} be pivoted 90° for <b>docking</b> to one of the four radial <b>docking</b> ports.|$|E
5|$|On flight day 3, the STS-74 {{crew members}} {{successfully}} mated the 15-foot Russian built <b>docking</b> module with the shuttle's Orbiter <b>Docking</b> System. No problems were reported during the mating operation.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 19th century {{a series}} of {{enclosed}} <b>dock</b> systems was built, surrounded by high walls to protect cargoes from river piracy. These included West India <b>Docks</b> (1802), East India <b>Docks</b> (1803, originating from the Brunswick <b>Dock</b> of 1790), London <b>Docks</b> (1805), Surrey Commercial <b>Docks</b> (1807, originating from the Howland Great Wet <b>Dock</b> of 1696), St Katharine <b>Docks</b> (1828), Royal Victoria <b>Dock</b> (1855), Millwall <b>Dock</b> (1868), Royal Albert <b>Dock</b> (1880), and Tilbury <b>docks</b> (1886).|$|R
5|$|The Russian {{unmanned}} resupply spacecraft Progress M1-4 docked to {{the station}} on 18 November. The Progress spacecraft's automatic <b>docking</b> system failed, necessitating a manual <b>docking</b> controlled by Gidzenko using the TORU <b>docking</b> system. Although manual dockings are routine, they have caused some concern among flight controllers since an attempt in 1997 {{which resulted in the}} spacecraft colliding with Mir, causing significant damage.|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{delivered}} {{a pair of}} solar arrays along with the Russian-built Mir <b>Docking</b> Module to allow <b>docking</b> with the station by the space shuttle without moving Mirs Kristall module. During the three-day <b>docking,</b> the Russian, Canadian, and American crew transferred supplies and equipment between Atlantis and Mir, moved several long-term experiments, and upgraded the station with new equipment, particularly during {{the installation of the}} <b>docking</b> module.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three hours}} into the flight, Commander Ken Cameron and Pilot Jim Halsell fired the orbiter's {{reaction}} control thrusters {{in the first of}} a series of rendezvous burns that refined Atlantiss path towards Mir. Shortly after the burn, the first Canadian mission specialist, Chris Hadfield, activated the Russian-built <b>docking</b> module, housed in the shuttle's payload bay, ready for the <b>docking</b> of the module with Atlantiss Orbiter <b>Docking</b> System on flight day 2.|$|E

5|$|At 08:15:44UTC on 18 November, Atlantis undocked {{from the}} <b>docking</b> module's bottom {{androgynous}} unit, leaving the <b>docking</b> module permanently {{attached to the}} Kristall module, where it provided clearance between the shuttle and Mirs solar arrays during subsequent dockings.|$|E
5|$|Crew {{members also}} mounted a {{centerline}} camera {{into the top}} hatch of the <b>docking</b> module. The camera later provided the primary visual cue for Cameron as he maneuvered Atlantis to its <b>docking</b> with Mir on flight day four.|$|E
5|$|Mission specialists Jerry Ross and Bill McArthur {{inspected}} the spacesuits they would don should a spacewalk become necessary during the mating or <b>docking</b> operations. Following the space suit inspection, Mission Specialist Chris Hadfield powered up the orbiter's robot arm {{in preparation for}} the next day's transfer of the <b>docking</b> module over to Atlantiss <b>docking</b> system. All systems affiliated with the robot arm operated as expected and were ready to support the mating.|$|E

50|$|In 1773, the Hull Corporation, Hull Trinity House and Hull merchants {{formed a}} <b>Dock</b> Company, the first {{statutory}} <b>dock</b> company in Britain. The Crown gave the land which contained Hull's city walls {{for construction of}} <b>docks,</b> and an Act of Parliament was passed in 1774 allowing the <b>Dock</b> Company to raise up to £100,000 by shares and loans; thus Hull's first <b>dock</b> (the Old <b>Dock)</b> (a wet <b>dock)</b> began construction. Three <b>docks,</b> known as the Town <b>Docks,</b> which followed {{the path of the}} town walls were constructed by the company between 1778 and 1829: The Old <b>Dock,</b> later Queen's <b>Dock,</b> (1778), Humber <b>Dock</b> (1809), and Junction <b>Dock,</b> later Prince's <b>Dock,</b> (1829). An extension of the Town <b>Docks</b> (Railway <b>Dock)</b> was built in 1846 just north of the terminus of the then recently opened Hull and Selby Railway. The first <b>dock</b> in Hull east of the River Hull (Victoria <b>Dock)</b> was constructed between 1845 and 1850; this became the main <b>dock</b> for timber trade, and was expanded in the next two decades including the construction of large timber ponds.|$|R
50|$|Sandon Half Tide <b>Dock</b> is a half tide <b>dock</b> on the River Mersey, England, {{and part}} of the Port of Liverpool.

Sandon <b>Dock</b> was situated to the north of Wellington <b>Dock</b> and was accessible via Sandon Half Tide <b>Dock.</b>|$|R
5|$|Prior to Endeavour <b>docking,</b> the Russian {{resupply}} spacecraft Progress M1-4, {{which came}} to the station in mid-November, was undocked {{to make room for}} the space shuttle. This Progress spacecraft remained undocked for the duration of STS-97, parked in orbit about a mile away from the station. It docked manually again with the station on 26 December by Gidzenko, after Endeavour left. The automatic <b>docking</b> system for this Progress spacecraft had failed on the first <b>docking</b> in November. The crew spent much of the following week unloading the Progress spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Soyuz TM-30 {{launched}} at 05:01:29 UT on April 4, 2000. <b>Docking</b> {{occurred on}} April 6 at 06:31:24 UT. Although the Soyuz <b>docking</b> system is automated under normal conditions, the final few meters {{of the approach}} to the station were executed in manual mode. The decision to switch to manual mode came after the cosmonauts noticed a small deviation in the spacecraft's approach to the targeted <b>docking</b> port. At about 09:32 UT {{on the day of}} <b>docking,</b> the crew prepared to open the hatches between the Soyuz spacecraft and the station. After entering the station the crew stabilized the atmosphere inside Mir and undertook routine maintenance work.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{relocated}} the Kristall module {{to another}} <b>docking</b> port {{from the port}} intended for use by Progress M-28 on July 17 using its Lyappa manipulator arm. This operation was performed {{in preparation for the}} next <b>docking</b> of Space Shuttle Atlantis to the station on the STS-74 mission later in the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{near-miss}} and collision incidents presented further safety issues. Both {{were caused}} by failure of the same piece of equipment, the TORU manual <b>docking</b> system, which was undergoing tests at the time. The tests were called in order to gauge the performance of long-distance <b>docking</b> in order to enable the cash-strapped Russians to remove the expensive Kurs automatic <b>docking</b> system from the Progress ships.|$|E
5|$|The studies {{looked at}} {{minimizing}} required {{modifications to the}} Gemini spacecraft. Three <b>docking</b> methods were considered. The first was use of the existing <b>docking</b> system used on Gemini-Agena missions. This would have allowed the mission to be accomplished with little modification to the Gemini spacecraft needed, however crew transfer {{could only have been}} accomplished by means of an Extra-vehicular activity (EVA). Changes that would have been required included strengthening the nose, installing two solid rockets to be used for a separation burn, adding the necessary equipment to perform the transfer EVA, and providing provisions for flight to and from the station. The number of retro-rockets would have been increased from four to six. A second method would have seen the spacecraft dock in the same way, but after <b>docking,</b> the spacecraft would be swung round and attached {{to the side of the}} space station. A tunnel would then have been placed over the Gemini's hatches, allowing the crew to transfer to the station without performing an EVA. Some modifications to the hatches would have been required. The final proposed <b>docking</b> method was to use a port mounted on the rear of the equipment module, which would have allowed the crew to transfer directly between the spacecraft and space station, through the <b>docking</b> port.|$|E

5000|$|Branch <b>docks</b> are {{terminal}} {{branches of}} a main floating <b>dock.</b> They are not isolated from the main <b>dock</b> by gates or locks and they share the same water level. Where <b>docks</b> join other <b>docks</b> or basins through gates, these are usually given a distinct name rather than being termed a 'branch'. Floating <b>docks</b> that are separated from tidal waters by a half tide <b>dock</b> commonly have related names such as Sandon <b>Dock</b> and Sandon Half Tide <b>Dock.</b> Branch <b>docks</b> are usually numbered, following {{the name of their}} main <b>dock,</b> i.e. 'Gladstone Number Three Branch Dock', rather than individually named.|$|R
5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the cargo module. If one of the forward <b>docking</b> configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the <b>docking</b> would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its <b>docking</b> would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} cargo module.|$|E

As the name suggests, this type of leveler is contained in a recess, or pit, beneath the <b>dock</b> door and floor surface. <b>Dock</b> levelers are stronger than <b>dock</b> plates and have similar ranges to <b>dock</b> boards, making them suitable not only for motorized fork lift trucks but also for master conveyors (for which neither <b>dock</b> plates or <b>dock</b> boards are suitable). Safety, also, is very high for this kind of product: Safety rules as EN1398 (European Standard) specifies the safety requirements for design, construction, installation, maintenance and testing of <b>dock</b> levelers and for safety components on <b>dock</b> levelers. NOTE: edge of <b>dock</b> levelers have fixed positions which have restricted ranges making them unsuitable for nonstandard <b>dock</b> heights.|$|R
