5|$|Clathrus ruber was {{illustrated}} in 1560 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner in his Nomenclator Aquatilium Animantium—Gesner mistook the mushroom for a marine organism. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> a woodcut in John Gerard's 1597 Great Herball, shortly thereafter in Carolus Clusius 1601 Fungorum in Pannoniis Observatorum Brevis Historia, {{and was one}} of the species featured in Cassiano dal Pozzo's museo cartaceo ("paper museum") that consisted of thousands of illustrations of the natural world.|$|E
5|$|Little Annie Fanny is a comics {{series by}} Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> 107 two- to seven-page episodes in Playboy {{magazine}} from October 1962 to September 1988. Little Annie Fanny is a humorous satire of contemporary American {{society and its}} sexual mores. Annie Fanny, the title character, is a statuesque, buxom young blonde woman who innocently finds herself nude in every episode.

5|$|On 11 February, one {{day after}} the {{conclusion}} of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.|$|E
5|$|Some Bach {{scholars}} {{believed that}} the cantata was written in 1734 {{for the end of}} the War of the Polish Succession, but the discovery of the printed text showed that it was not related. The cantata was not published until 1876 when <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> the Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe, the first complete edition of the composer's works.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} S.thiersii grow during the mid or late summer until early fall. Since {{it was first}} {{reported}} in 1952 in Texas, this species has been expanding its range. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> southern Illinois in the 1990s and has since spread to central Illinois, where it is the most common mushroom found in lawns during July and August. Today it occurs in nine states including Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Kentucky, Ohio, Kansas and Illinois. It also occurs in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{mansion in}} the game has reappeared in other Mario games, usually acting as Luigi's home stage. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, Mario Kart 7, Mario Power Tennis, Mario Kart DS, Mario Hoops 3-on-3, Mario Super Sluggers and Mario Sports Mix. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, a Luigi's Mansion stage is unlockable. It can be {{destroyed}} when characters hit a set of pillars, but it can rebuild itself later on. There are also some stickers and trophies based on the game. The stage reappears in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.|$|E
5|$|Before it {{was founded}} in 1810 by Lewis Tregonwell, the area was a deserted {{heathland}} occasionally visited by fishermen and smugglers. Initially marketed as a health resort, the town received a boost when <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> Augustus Granville's 1841 book, The Spas of England. Bournemouth's growth truly accelerated {{with the arrival of the}} railway and it became a recognised town in 1870. Historically part of Hampshire, it joined Dorset with the reorganisation of local government in 1974. Since 1997, the town has been administered by a unitary authority, meaning it is independent of Dorset County Council, although it remains part of that ceremonial county. The local council is Bournemouth Borough Council.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1953, Carson began {{library and}} field {{research}} on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, The Edge of the Sea, which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems (particularly along the Eastern Seaboard). <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; The Edge of the Sea received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.|$|E
5|$|Edisto Beach, South Carolina {{was changed}} forever by Gracie, due to human efforts to renourish the beach after its passage. Most {{of the shell}} hash beach {{currently}} at Edisto was placed there after Gracie. In order to expand the beach, an inland marsh was excavated {{and moved to the}} shoreline. This created highly desirable beach front property which led to new development along the coast seaward of Palmetto Boulevard, but also created an environmental catastrophe along the nearby ocean floor. A species of isopod which grows in coastal estuaries, the Cyathura Polita, disappeared after the passage of this hurricane from the Ashepoo River in South Carolina. The Kermadec petrel, a bird, was swept to Lookout Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania during Gracie, marking the first time <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> North America.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of Political Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy created a storm of enthusiasm when <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E

Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group opened The Young Victoria in limited theatrical release in the United States on 18 December 2009 through Apparition. Critical reception was generally positive, and it scored a 76 percent rating on film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based upon 139 reviews.

The film also won for the Best Make-Up and Hair and Best Costume Design at the 63rd British Academy Film Awards.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1923 the Great North of Scotland {{became a}} part of the Scottish {{division}} of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), who received a total of 122 locomotives, 100 4-4-0 tender locomotives and 22 tank engines, all capable of being used on either passenger or goods trains. Forty-four locomotives were still in service when the railway was nationalised in 1948, and the last two Great North locomotives to be withdrawn were two of the Aberdeen harbour tanks in 1960. No. 49, Gordon Highlander was restored to Great North green in 1958, although it had not previously carried the green livery as <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> Heywood's lined black. It was used on special trains before becoming a static exhibit at the Glasgow Transport Museum in 1965, and is currently on loan to the Scottish Railway Museum at Bo'ness.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1821, the House of Keys had no {{official}} home, but met first at Castle Rushen, and {{later at the}} Bishop of Sodor and Man's library in Castletown. After criticism from a Royal Commission, plans were drawn up for a new meeting house for the Keys in 1813, but after concerns about the cost, they were redrawn and approved in 1819. The building, designed by Thomas Brine, was completed in 1821. It housed the House of Keys until 1874, when the Keys followed the other primary functions of the island and moved to Douglas. After their move, the Old House became a branch of 's Bank, and later Parr's Bank. In 2000, Manx National Heritage acquired the building and began restoring the house to how <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> 1866. The building {{opened to the public}} as a museum in November 2001.|$|E

5|$|The lion's closest {{relatives}} {{are the other}} species of the genus Panthera: the tiger, the snow leopard, the jaguar, and the leopard. Studies from 2006 and 2009 concluded that the jaguar is a sister species to the lion and the leopard is a sister taxon to the jaguar/lion clade while 2010 and 2011 studies have swapped the positions leopard and jaguar. P. leo evolved in Africa between 1 million and 800,000 years ago, before spreading throughout the Holarctic region. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> the fossil record in Europe {{for the first time}} 700,000 years ago with the subspecies Panthera leo fossilis at Isernia in Italy. From this lion derived the later cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), which appeared about 300,000 years ago. Lions died out in northern Eurasia {{at the end of the}} last glaciation, about 10,000 years ago; this may have been secondary to the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna.|$|E
5|$|The punchbowls are a 'harlequin pair', {{similar but}} not exactly matching. The bowls have been donated independently, {{one to the}} State Library of New South Wales (SLNSW) in 1926 {{and the other to}} the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM) in 2006. The Library bowl is the more widely known of the pair. Its {{earliest}} provenance places it in England in the late 1840s, where it is said to originally have been commissioned for William Bligh; another source suggests Henry Colden Antill. It passed through several owners in Britain before it was presented to the State Library. The Museum bowl's first provenance is from England in 1932 and {{it has been suggested that}} it was made to the order of Arthur Phillip. Its whereabouts were unknown until <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> the Newark Museum, United States, in 1988, on loan from Peter Frelinghuysen Jr.. Through donations, the Maritime Museum later acquired the punchbowl from Frelinghuysen.|$|E
5|$|The series began {{receiving}} {{recognition in}} 2014, when <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! and had its volumes placed {{as one of}} the top thirty selling novels in Japan. It was reported in April 2014 that 1.1 million copies were in circulation. The English localization of the manga and anime were also well received: the manga adaption appeared on The New York Times Manga Best Sellers; meanwhile, English reviewers were generally turned away by the first episode of the anime, though reviewers who have completed the series generally praised the character dynamics, game strategies, and animation, while disliking the fan service featuring the underage Shiro.|$|E
