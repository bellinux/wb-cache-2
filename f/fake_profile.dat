2500|$|On June 4, 2009, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch {{reported}} that La Russa had sued the online social network platform Twitter {{the previous month}} for a fake page established under {{his name on the}} site. [...] La Russa claimed that he had [...] "suffered significant emotional distress (and) damage to reputation" [...] because of the profile. The <b>fake</b> <b>profile</b> made several [...] "distasteful references" [...] to La Russa and his team, according to the suit. [...] Twitter's terms of service forbids impersonation directly, stating that users [...] "may not impersonate others through the Twitter service in a manner that does or is intended to mislead, confuse, or deceive others." [...] Reports that Twitter had settled ("the first celebrity lawsuit against the 32-million-user site", according to the Wall Street Journal) were rebuffed on the official Twitter blog. La Russa eventually filed a request to dismiss the suit, while Twitter, whether in regard to the suit or not, continued improving its privacy protections.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2011, a {{video was}} leaked {{containing}} footage of Silas supposedly preparing to attack Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) at a night-time rave. This led viewers {{to believe that}} Theresa would become Silas's next victim. It was then revealed that Silas would feature in the fourth series of the Hollyoaks late-night spin-off, Hollyoaks Later. It was confirmed that Silas would line Theresa up as his next victim. Porter said it was [...] "amazing" [...] {{to be involved in}} the storyline. The storyline begins when Theresa's aunt, Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane), inappropriately touches Silas and blames it on Theresa. This puts Theresa in danger as Silas targets girls who he is unhappy with because of their behaviour. Silas hates girls who are promiscuous and Porter opined that Theresa is [...] "probably a prime suspect" [...] as she enjoys receiving men's attention. Theresa signs up for an online dating website as she wants to find love. Theresa's love interest, Will Savage (James Atherton), learns of this and talks to Silas about it. Porter stated that Silas is being [...] "clever" [...] as he befriends Will while plotting against Theresa. Silas encourages Will to set up a <b>fake</b> <b>profile</b> on the website to check on Theresa. Will creates an online alter ego named Juan which Silas is involved with. Theresa makes contact with the profile online, not realising she is putting herself in danger. Porter said that it [...] "scary and worrying" [...] but would not confirm whether Silas kills Theresa. Hollyoaks series producer, Emma Smithwick, confirmed that the spin-off would feature the death of a regular character.|$|E

50|$|Some {{critics have}} also claimed that social {{networking}} games {{have caused the}} numbers of fake profiles to rise. Creating a <b>fake</b> <b>profile</b> can be advantageous if the game, for example, offers rewards whenever a user introduces the game to their friends. By inviting the <b>fake</b> <b>profile</b> to play the game, the user can trick the games' point-based system into thinking that they are actually helping the game gain popularity and in return, they may receive rewards from the game. Social networking sites such as Facebook eliminates fake profiles {{if and only if}} these profiles are reported by other users.|$|E

40|$|In online social networks, the {{audience}} size commanded by an organization or {{an individual is}} a critical measure of that entity’s popularity and this measure has important economic and/or political implications. Such efforts to measure popularity of users or exploit knowledge about their audience are complicated {{by the presence of}} <b>fake</b> <b>profiles</b> on these networks. In this study, analysis of 62 million publicly available Twitter user profiles was conducted and a strategy to identify automatically generated <b>fake</b> <b>profiles</b> was established. Using a combination of a pattern-matching algorithm on screen-names and an analysis of update times, a reasonable number (∼ 0. 1 % of total users) of highly reliable fake user accounts were identified. Analysis of profile creation times and URLs of these fake accounts revealed their distinct behavior relative to a ground truth data set. The characteristics of friends and followers of users in the two data sets further revealed the very different nature of the two groups. The ratio of number of followers-to-friends for ground truth users was ∼ 1, consistent with past observations, while the <b>fake</b> <b>profiles</b> had a median ratio ∼ 30, indicating that the fake users we identified were primarily focused on gathering friends. An analysis of the temporal evolution of accounts over 2 years showed that the friends-to-followers ratio increased over time for <b>fake</b> <b>profiles</b> while they decreased for ground truth users. Our results, thus, suggest that a profile-based approach can be used for identifying a core set of fake online social network users in a time-efficient manner...|$|R

50|$|In a {{study by}} Bitdefender, it was shown that social games {{increase}} spam and phishing by 50 percent in social media platforms. This is made possible through hackers creating <b>fake</b> <b>profiles</b> and relying on bots to send spam messages to other users via social gaming applications. Many of these users who receive the messages willingly add the spammers' <b>fake</b> <b>profiles</b> into their circle of friends to depend on them for additional gaming support. In doing so, several users have become more prone to being victims of data, identity theft, account hijacking, and other issues. The spammer's action here, however, does not constitute as abuse since it is typically the user who adds the spammer on their end. As such, the spammer's account cannot be suspended by a social network.|$|R

5000|$|This is a {{detection}} method suggested by Gao et al. to make memory-based collaborative filtering more robust. [...] Some popular metrics used in collaborative filtering to measure user similarity are Pearson correlation coefficient, interest similarity, and cosine distance. (refer to Memory-based CF for definitions) A recommender system can detect attacks by exploiting {{the fact that}} the distributions of these metrics differ when there are spam users in the system. Because shilling attacks inject not just single <b>fake</b> <b>profile</b> but a large number of similar fake profiles, these spam users will have unusually high similarity than normal users do.|$|E
40|$|Social {{networks}} such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+ {{have attracted}} millions of {{users in the}} last years. One {{of the most widely}} used social networks, Facebook, recently had an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2012, which was among the biggest in Internet technology. Forprofit and nonprofit organizations primarily use such platforms for target-oriented advertising and large-scale marketing campaigns. Social networks have attracted worldwide attention because of their potential to address millions of users and possible future customers. The potential of social networks is often misused by malicious users who extract sensitive private information of unaware users. One of the most common ways of performing a large-scale data harvesting attack is the use of <b>fake</b> <b>profiles,</b> where malicious users present themselves in profiles impersonating fictitious or real persons. The main goal of this research is to evaluate the implications of <b>fake</b> user <b>profiles</b> on Facebook. To do so, we established a comprehensive data harvesting attack, the social engineering experiment, and analyzed the interactions between <b>fake</b> <b>profiles</b> and regular users to eventually undermine the Facebook business model. Furthermore, privacy considerations are analyzed using focus groups. As a result of our work, we provided a set of countermeasures to increase the awareness of users...|$|R

Some of the main shilling attack strategies are random attacks, average attacks, bandwagon attacks, and segment-focused attacks.|$|R
