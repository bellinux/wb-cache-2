5|$|The first {{historical}} {{mention of}} the use of <b>hops</b> in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as Adalard of Corbie, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of <b>hops</b> for use in beer is the thirteenth century. Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which <b>hops</b> took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, grains of paradise or alehoof. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as <b>hops</b> are now used. Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than <b>hops</b> for flavouring.|$|E
5|$|That <b>hops</b> {{could be}} used for {{flavoring}} beer had been known at least since Carolingian times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the widespread use of <b>hops,</b> gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used. Gruit had the same preserving properties as <b>hops,</b> though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it, and the end result was much more variable. Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. <b>Hops</b> may have been widely used in England in the tenth century; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.|$|E

5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains — most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with <b>hops,</b> which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of <b>hops.</b> In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations {{requires}} that the beer should {{be made by the}} alcoholic fermentation of yeast.

5|$|Various legal {{definitions}} of beer exist in different countries. Historically, {{the most famous}} of these was the Reinheitsgebot, which applied to parts of the Holy Roman Empire and Germany and required beer to be made from only water, <b>hops,</b> and barley. Today in Canada, the Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations state that beer must have alcohol content that ranges from 1.1% to 8.6%, though it also includes a stipulation that it could be greater than 8.6% and labeled accordingly. Beer in South Korea must have less than 25% ABV, which means {{that it has to be}} 25 mL of alcohol or less per 100 mL of solution and can be considered ‘lite’ only if it has less than 30 kcal per 100ml. Additionally, beer in South Korea must use only water, <b>hops,</b> and starches (wheat, rice, barley, corn, or potato) as ingredients in the brewing process. In Singapore, beer must have at minimum 1.0% alcohol by volume concentration at 20°C. It is often brewed from a mixture of grains like malt, sugars or its equivalent, and <b>hops</b> or other vegetables.|$|E

5|$|Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (FES) is a stout {{produced}} by the Guinness Brewery, an Irish brewing company owned by Diageo, a drinks multinational. First brewed by Guinness in 1801, FES was designed for export, and is more heavily hopped than Guinness Draught and Extra Stout, and typically has a higher alcohol content (at around 7.5% ABV), which gives it a more bitter taste. The extra <b>hops</b> were intended as a natural preservative for the long journeys the beer would take by ship.|$|E

2500|$|Hip <b>hop</b> [...] or hip-hop is a {{subculture}} and art movement {{developed in}} South Bronx in New York City {{during the late}} 1970s. While the term hip <b>hop</b> {{is often used to}} refer exclusively to hip <b>hop</b> music (also called rap), hip <b>hop</b> is characterized by nine elements, of which hip <b>hop</b> music is only four elements (rapping, djaying, beatboxing and breaking). Afrika Bambaataa of the hip <b>hop</b> collective Zulu Nation outlined the pillars of hip <b>hop</b> culture, coining the terms: [...] "rapping" [...] (also called MCing or emceeing), a rhythmic vocal rhyming style (orality); DJing (and turntablism), which is making music with record players and DJ mixers (aural/sound and music creation); b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing (movement/dance); and graffiti art. Other elements of hip <b>hop</b> subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are: hip <b>hop</b> culture and historical knowledge of the movement (intellectual/philosophical); beatboxing, a percussive vocal style; street entrepreneurship; hip <b>hop</b> language; and hip <b>hop</b> fashion and style, among others.|$|R

5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with <b>hops,</b> to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is very {{difficult}} for <b>hopping</b> robots to follow the trajectory without controlling <b>hopping</b> angle. A <b>hopping</b> angle controller is designed for combustion piston type <b>hopping</b> robot to adjust the angle of <b>hop</b> which is required to achieve a desired distance or height. So, the controller adds functionality to <b>hopping</b> robot for altering the <b>hopping</b> angle during operation according to obstacle height and obstacle distance. A proportional Integrated Derivative (PID) and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) are designed and compared for adjusting <b>hopping</b> angle by using MATLAB / SIMULINK environment. As result, both controllers are capable to control <b>hopping</b> angle but PID gives better performance. An implementation of PID controller for the <b>hopping</b> angle control is given by using a DC motor. The experiment also carried out on prototype by using PID controller and found satisfactory results...|$|R
