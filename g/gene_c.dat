5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by <b>gene</b> <b>C</b> (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E

40|$|The <b>genes</b> <b>C,</b> C 2, R, A, A 2, Bz, Bz 2 and Pr are {{required}} {{for the formation of}} purple anthocyanin in the aleurone tissue of maize, and the recessive gene(s) result in non-purple (red, bronze and colorless). Aleurone extracts of recessive a and certain double recessive combinations were analyzed by paper chromatography, absorption spectra in the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared, mass spectra, and other analytical techniques. Homozygous recessive a tissue accumulates the flavonol, quercetin, while the double combinations a c and a r lack it, suggesting that dominant <b>genes</b> <b>C</b> and R {{are required}} for its formation and act prior to A in the synthesis of flavonols, as in the gene action sequence for anthocyanin synthesis. Dominant C-I inhibits the formation of quercetin, whereas Bz, Bz 2 and In do not affect its formation. These results suggest a close biogenetic relationship between quercetin and cyanidin- 3 -glucoside and also independently confirm the position of A in both sequences...|$|R

Multiple copies of component genes have been previously identified in fish, suggesting a key role for this system in aquatic organisms. Herein, we confirm the presence of three different previously reported complement <b>c</b> 3 <b>genes</b> (<b>c</b> 3. 1, c 3. 2, c 3. 3) and identify five additional <b>c</b> 3 <b>genes</b> (<b>c</b> 3. 4, c 3. 5, c 3. 6, c 3. 7, c 3. 8) in the zebrafish genome.

Furthermore, while reconciling the phylogenetic tree with the fish species tree, we uncovered an event of c 3 duplication common to all teleost fishes that gave rise to an exclusive c 3 paralog (c 3. 7 and c 3. 8).
