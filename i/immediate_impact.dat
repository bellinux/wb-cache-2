5|$|Between April 1918 and May 1919, the Spanish Flu killed {{approximately}} 25 {{million people}} worldwide, {{far more than}} {{had been killed in}} four years of war. A rigorous quarantine policy was implemented in Australia; although this reduced the <b>immediate</b> <b>impact</b> of the flu, the nation's death toll surpassed 11,500.|$|E
5|$|Lamarck's {{evolutionary}} theory made little <b>immediate</b> <b>impact</b> on his fellow zoologists, {{or on the}} public at the time. The historian of science Richard Burkhardt argues that this was because Lamarck was convinced his views would be poorly received, and made little effort to present his theory persuasively.|$|E

30|$|Based {{both on the}} lead-user {{survey and}} the co-ordinator survey, {{scientific}} publications and {{a high level of}} scientific expertise in general were considered as the main <b>immediate</b> <b>impacts</b> of FP 5. Improved networking between researchers and public/private organisations and strengthened networks between international parties were seen as the major <b>immediate</b> <b>impacts</b> of FP 6. In addition, patents and standards produced in IndCo projects (especially in FP 6), represent the <b>immediate</b> <b>impacts,</b> even though the transport industry and service sector seem not to have been greatly involved.|$|R

5|$|The Marlins and Rockies {{used the}} {{expansion}} draft {{to build their}} teams using different strategies. As the Rockies had a smaller operating budget than the Marlins, the Rockies targeted prospects with low salaries, while the Marlins selected older players intended to provide more <b>immediate</b> <b>impact.</b> All three rounds of the draft were televised by ESPN.|$|E
5|$|Abdur-Rahim was {{selected}} third overall by the Vancouver Grizzlies in the 1996 Draft, behind Allen Iverson and Marcus Camby. He made an <b>immediate</b> <b>impact</b> {{playing for the}} Grizzlies, becoming the team's leading scorer while setting a franchise record of 18.7 ppg. He also averaged 6.9 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 35minutes per game. He finished third in balloting for the Schick NBA Rookie of the Year behind Philadelphia's Allen Iverson and Minnesota's Stephon Marbury, and he was picked for the All-Rookie First Team. By {{the end of the}} 1996–97 season, Abdur-Rahim led the team in scoring on 33 occasions, rebounding on 23 occasions.|$|E
5|$|After {{just one}} winning season in 10 years under coaches Sandra Hamm (1974–75), Wanda Flora (1975–80) and Jean Balthaser (1980–85), UConn hired as their new head coach the Italian-born Geno Auriemma, {{who had served}} as {{assistant}} coach at Virginia, {{with the goal of}} revitalizing the program. Auriemma's training skills had an <b>immediate</b> <b>impact</b> and the team showed steady signs of progress: after going 12–15 in his first season in 1985–86, Auriemma led UConn to winning seasons in 1986–87 and 1987–88.|$|E
30|$|Some of the {{environmental}} consequences of wildland fires are vegetation mortality, plant species and type shifts, non-native plant invasions, wildlife habitat alteration, soil erosion, floods, watershed function changes, water supply disruption, and air pollution.

5|$|Cody made an <b>immediate</b> <b>impact</b> for the Crimson Tide {{defensive}} line, recording four tackles—one for loss—in a 34–10 rout of the Clemson Tigers. He and {{the rest}} of the defense also held the Tigers, which included running backs James Davis and C. J. Spiller, to zero net rushing yards. With his presence in the middle of the Crimson Tide defensive line, Cody earned himself the nickname of “Mount Cody.” By mid-season he was already considered the No. 1 nose tackle prospect for the 2009 NFL Draft by league scouts.|$|E
5|$|He played college {{football}} for the University of Texas, where {{he won the}} Heisman Trophy and earned unanimous All-America honors in his senior season, as well as numerous other accolades.

Campbell was named the NFL's Offensive Player of the Year {{in each of his}} first three seasons, during which he averaged nearly 1,700 rushing yards per season. He won the AP NFL Most Valuable Player Award in 1979 after leading the league in rushing yards and touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Me Against the World, {{released}} while Shakur was imprisoned, made an <b>immediate</b> <b>impact</b> on the charts, debuting {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200.

The album served as one of Shakur's most positively reviewed albums, with many calling it the magnum opus of his career, and {{is considered one of the}} greatest and most influential hip hop albums of all-time. Me Against the World won best rap album at the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards.|$|E
40|$|Following the {{commencement}} of construction works of a 250 MW hydropower plant at Dumbbell Island in the Upper Victoria Nile in September 2007, BEL requested NaFIRRI to conduct continuous monitoring of fish catches at two transects i. e. the immediate upstream transect of the project site (Kalange-Makwanzi) and the immediate downstream. transect (Buyala-Kikubamutwe). The routine monitoring surveys were designed to be conducted twice a week {{at each of the}} tWo transects. It was anticipated that major <b>immediate</b> <b>impacts</b> were to occur during construction, and these needed to be known by BEL as part of a mitigation strategy. For example, the construction of it cofferdam could be accompanied by rapid changes in water quality and quantity downstream of the construction. These changes in turn could affect the fish catch and would probably be missed by the quarterly monitoring already in place. Therefore, a major cbjective of the more regular and rapid monitoring was to discern <b>immediate</b> <b>impacts</b> of construction activities by focusing on selected water quality parameters (total suspended solids, water conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH) and fish catch characteristics (total catch, catch rates and value of the catch...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} a number of {{high-profile}} plant closures in the UK. In several cases, the policy response has included setting up a task force to deal with the impacts of the closure. It can be hypothesised that task force involving multi-level working across territorial boundaries and tiers of government is crucial to devising a policy response tailored to people's needs and to ensuring success in dealing with the <b>immediate</b> <b>impacts</b> of a closure. This suggests that leadership, and vision, partnership working and community engagement, and delivery of high quality services are important. This paper looks at the case of the MG Rover closure in 2005, to examine the extent to which the policy response to the closure at the national, regional and local levels dealt effectively with the <b>immediate</b> <b>impacts</b> of the closure, and the lessons that can be learned from the experience. Such lessons are of particular relevance given the closure of the LDV van plant in Birmingham in 2009 and more broadly – such as in the case of the downsizing of the Opel operation in Europe following its takeover by Magna...|$|R
50|$|Austerlitz and the {{preceding}} campaign profoundly altered {{the nature of}} European politics. In three months, the French had occupied Vienna, decimated two armies, and humbled the Austrian Empire. These events sharply contrast with the rigid power structures of the 18th century, when no major European capital was ever held by an enemy army. Austerlitz {{set the stage for}} a near-decade of French domination on the European continent, but one of its more <b>immediate</b> <b>impacts</b> was to goad Prussia into war in 1806.|$|R
5|$|The British {{presence}} in the Adriatic was greatly strengthened in 1809 {{with the arrival of}} the frigates HMS Amphion under William Hoste and HMS Belle Poule under James Brisbane. These reinforcements made an <b>immediate</b> <b>impact</b> with a series of raids in the Dalmatian and Ionian islands. In February Belle Poule captured the Var off Valona; the French responded by despatching the frigates Danaé and Flore from Toulon. HMS Topaze attacked these frigates as they arrived, but were able to reach Corfu before sailing north to augment French defences in the Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 had an <b>immediate</b> <b>impact</b> on the {{fortunes}} of Sinclair Research and Clive Sinclair himself. The company's profitability rose enormously, from a pretax profit of £818,000 on a turnover of £4.6 million in 1980–81 to £8.55 million on a turnover of £27.17 million in 1981–82. Clive Sinclair {{became one of the}} UK's highest-profile businessmen and a millionaire, receiving a £1 million bonus on top of a salary of £13,000. He received a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours and the Young Businessman of the Year award in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{new rule}} was not applied retroactively, {{therefore}} all American-bred horses registered before 1913 {{remained on the}} register, and their descendants were also eligible for registration. Of the 7,756mares in Volume 27 of the General Stud Book, published in 1933, 930 would have been ineligible under the new rule. The Jersey Act did have an <b>immediate</b> <b>impact</b> however, as {{the winner of the}} 1914 Epsom Derby, Durbar II, was ineligible for registration, as his dam, Armenia, was bred in the United States and was not herself eligible for the General Stud Book.|$|E
5000|$|By contrast, the United States Strategic Bombing Survey found {{attacks on}} waterways, {{beginning}} 23 September with strikes against the Dortmund-Ems Canal and Mittelland Canal, produced tremendous traffic {{problems on the}} Rhine River.

50|$|A {{new issue}} that {{emerged as a}} focal point in the Paris {{negotiations}} rose {{from the fact that}} many of the worst effects of climate change will be too severe or come too quickly to be avoided by adaptation measures. The Paris Agreement specifically acknowledges the need to address loss and damage of this kind, and aims to find appropriate responses. It specifies that loss and damage can take various forms—both as <b>immediate</b> <b>impacts</b> from extreme weather events, and slow onset impacts, such as the loss of land to sea-level rise for low-lying islands.|$|R

5|$|After {{not being}} able to host the Games in 1944, Cortina d'Ampezzo was {{selected}} to organise the 1956 Winter Olympics. At the opening ceremonies the final torch bearer, Guido Caroli, entered the Olympic Stadium on ice skates. As he skated around the stadium his skate caught on a cable and he fell, nearly extinguishing the flame. He was able to recover and light the cauldron. These were the first Winter Games to be televised, and the first Olympics ever broadcast to an international audience, though no television rights were sold until the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. The Cortina Games were used to test the feasibility of televising large sporting events. The Soviet Union made its Olympic debut and had an <b>immediate</b> <b>impact,</b> winning more medals than any other nation. Chiharu Igaya won the first Winter Olympics medal for Japan and the continent of Asia when he placed second in the slalom.|$|E
5|$|After the 2002 World Cup, {{the team}} {{weakened}} {{with the loss}} of more veterans and coach Waseige. They missed out five successive major finals from Euro 2004 until Euro 2012, and went through an equal number of head coaches. A 2005 win over reigning European champions Greece meant nothing but a small comfort. In between, a promising new generation was maturing at the 2007 European U-21 Championship; Belgium's squad qualified for the following year's Summer Olympics in Beijing, where the Young Red Devils squad finished fourth. Seventeen of them appeared in the senior national team, albeit without making an <b>immediate</b> <b>impact.</b> Belgium finished in second (and last) place at the Kirin Cup in May 2009, and lost against the 125th FIFA-ranked Armenian team in September 2009.

Italy qualified through the group stage in second-place behind the Netherlands, eliminating Romania and France. In the quarter-final against eventual champions Spain, Del Piero made a substitute appearance during extra-time, and with the game ending in a 0–0 draw, it was decided by a penalty shootout in which Spain won 4–2.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades policymakers have been seeking new ways to secure {{improved}} performance from higher education institutions. One popular approach has been performance funding, which involves use of a formula to tie funding to institutional performance on specified indicators. This report reviews findings from studies on performance funding programs in a multitude of states. The studies suggest that tying funding to outputs has <b>immediate</b> <b>impacts</b> on colleges in the form of changes in funding, greater awareness by institutions of state priorities and of their own institutional performance, and increased status competition among institutions. Because of these <b>immediate</b> <b>impacts,</b> performance funding produces intermediate institutional changes in the form of greater use of data in institutional planning and policymaking and in changes in academic and student service policies and practices that promise to improve student outcomes. However, claims that performance funding does indeed increase ultimate outcomes [...] in the form of improved rates of retention, completion of developmental education, and graduation [...] are not validated by solid data. In the face of this finding, this report identifies obstacles to the effective functioning of performance funding, as well as unintended impacts. The report closes by providing recommendations for overcoming the many obstacles to the effective functioning of performance funding and addressing the unintended impacts documented by the studies reviewed...|$|R
