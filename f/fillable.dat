40|$|An odd-dimensional {{differentiable}} manifold {{is called}} holomorphically <b>fillable</b> {{if it is}} diffeomorphic to the boundary of a compact strongly pseudoconvex complex manifold, Stein <b>fillable</b> if this last manifold may be chosen to be Stein and Milnor <b>fillable</b> if it is diffeomorphic to the abstract boundary of an isolated singularity of normal complex analytic space. We show that the homotopical dimension of a manifold-with-boundary of dimension at least 4 restricts the cohomology ring (with any coefficients) of its boundary. This gives restrictions on the cohomology rings of Stein <b>fillable</b> manifolds, on the dimension of the exceptional locus of any resolution of a given isolated singularity, and on the topology of smoothable singularities. We give also new proofs of structure theorems of Durfee & Hain and Bungart about the cohomology rings of Milnor <b>fillable</b> and respectively holomorphically <b>fillable</b> manifolds.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} <b>fillable</b> contact {{structures on}} odd-dimensional manifolds. For that purpose, Rabinowitz-Floer homology (RFH) is used which {{was introduced by}} Cieliebak and Frauenfelder in 2009. A {{major part of the}} thesis is devoted to technical problems in the definition of RFH. In particular, it is shown that the moduli spaces involved are cut out transversally. Moreover, it is proved that RFH is essentially invariant under subcritical handle attachment. Finally, RFH is calculated for some Brieskorn manifolds. The obtained results are then used to show for every manifold, which supports <b>fillable</b> contact structures, that there exist either infinitely many different <b>fillable</b> contact structures, or one contact structure with infinitely many different fillings or for every <b>fillable</b> contact structure holds that RFH is infinite dimensional in every degree.

40|$|We {{continue}} our study of contact structures on manifolds of dimension {{at least five}} using complex surgery theory. We show that in each dimension 2 q+ 1 > 3 there are 'maximal' almost contact manifolds to {{which there is a}} Stein cobordism from any other (2 q+ 1) -dimensional contact manifold. We show that the product M x S^ 2 admits a weakly <b>fillable</b> contact structure provided M admits a weak symplectic filling (W, ω) with ω(π _ 2 (M)) = 0. We also study the connection between Stein fillability and connected sums: we give examples of almost contact manifolds for which the connected sum is Stein <b>fillable,</b> while the components are not. Concerning obstructions to Stein fillings, we show that the (8 k- 1) -dimensional sphere has an almost contact structure which is not Stein <b>fillable</b> once k > 1.
