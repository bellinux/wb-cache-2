2500|$|A {{miniature}} snap-action switch, also trademarked {{and frequently}} {{known as a}} micro switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little physical force, {{through the use of}} a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an [...] "over-center" [...] mechanism. Common applications of micro switches include the <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> on a microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. The miniature snap-action switch was invented in 1932 by Peter McGall, who was an employee of the Burgess Battery Company in Freeport, Illinois.|$|E

Micro switches {{are commonly used}} in tamper switches on gate valves on fire sprinkler systems and other water pipe systems, where {{it is necessary to}} know if a valve has been opened or shut.|$|E
5000|$|The FP/FT {{units have}} a <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> system, which {{prevents}} the driver applying power while the train doors are still open and unlocked. On the EM/ET units, drivers had to double-check the [...] "doors closed" [...] light was on before applying power, potentially leading to human error. This configuration {{led to an}} incident in March 2013 when three EM/ET units left Wingate station with their doors open and no passenger staff on board, after the driver mistakenly thought he heard the [...] "right-of-way" [...] buzzer.|$|E

50|$|Based on the Paris Métro's MP 59 rolling stock, the MR-63 were {{constructed}} by Canadian Vickers from 1965 - 1967 and was introduced on October 14, 1966 {{on the opening}} of the Montreal Metro, and are still in service. During this time the fleet has undergone numerous technological and reliability upgrades, starting with the introduction of Automatic Train Control in 1976 (with subsequent revisions of hardware and software), major refurbishments of the MR-63 coaches by GEC Alsthom at Pointe St. Charles workshops in 1993, solid-state <b>door</b> <b>interlocks</b> in 2003, modern ergonomic driver cabs with new digital dashboards, and automatic station announcements in 2005 (voiced by Michèle Deslauriers).|$|R
5000|$|This model saw the {{introduction}} of a sliding side door added on both sides (although a version without the driver's side door remained available), with a full [...] "B" [...] pillar to enhance body stiffness instead of the approach used by the Nissan Prairie which had the front and rear <b>doors</b> <b>interlock.</b> Minor horsepower improvements were introduced in 1977 along with an increase in the width of the vehicle. A sunroof was added to the options list in 1979. 4WD was introduced as an option in 1980, on both the van and truck bodystyles, coinciding with the same feature being offered on the Subaru Rex.|$|R
50|$|AS-Interface {{provides}} {{a basis for}} Functional Safety in machinery safety/emergency stop applications. Safety devices communicating over AS-Interface follow all the normal AS-Interface data rules. The required level of data verification is provided by dynamic changes in the data. This technology is called Safety at Work and allows safety devices and standard, non-safe devices {{to be connected to}} the same network. Using appropriate safe input hardware (e.g. light curtains, e-stop buttons, and <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> switches), AS-Interface can provide safety support up to SIL (Safety Integrity Level) 3 according to EN 62061, CAT 4 according to EN954-1 as well as Performance Level e (PL e) according to EN ISO 13849-1.|$|E
50|$|In March 2012, TTC {{officials}} {{admitted that}} the door threshold incidents {{were the result of}} “teething issues”. Another issue that was acknowledged involves a short delay in opening of the doors when the train pulls into a station. On the older train models, the door release interlock could be triggered just before or immediately after the vehicle came to a complete stop. The TR trains must come to a complete stop with confirmation from the onboard computer before the <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> can be released and the guard can open the doors. This causes a one- or two-second delay from the time the train appears stopped and the time the doors open.|$|E
5000|$|The Isis uses {{a unique}} {{approach}} to the sliding doors in that the front passenger door and the rear passenger sliding <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> when closed, instead of having a doorjamb that the doors attach to. Toyota calls this on the Japanese Wikipedia article [...] "Panoramic Door". This door system is used only on the passenger side. The doors on the driver's side attach with a conventional doorjamb. The front passenger seat can be folded flat upon itself and then tilted forward to further provide passenger access. The doors also interlock with {{the top and bottom}} door openings so that both doors can be opened independently of each other. This door feature was first used by Toyota on the Toyota Raum. This door approach is also used on the U.S.-spec 2000-2006 Toyota Tundra Extra Cab. This type of door was first used on the Nissan Prairie in 1981.|$|E
50|$|Safety during pigging {{relies on}} the strict {{adherence}} to safety procedures, which give detailed description of a safe valve operating sequence. By physically blocking incorrect operations, valve interlocks enforce such sequences, rather than interfering with them. Valve interlocks are permanently mounted to manual and motor operated valves and the closure <b>door.</b> The <b>interlocks</b> block operation of a valve or door, unless the appropriate keys are inserted.|$|R
50|$|The Birney Car also {{introduced}} {{the use of}} pneumatically balanced and <b>interlocked</b> <b>doors.</b> If a door was stuck open, or a passenger or other object blocked the door, the motors could not be started.|$|R
40|$|Counting {{the number}} of people is {{something}} many security application focus on, when dealing with controlling accesses in restricted areas, as it occurs with banks, airports, railway stations and governmental offices. This paper presents an automated solution for detecting the presence of more than one person into <b>interlocked</b> <b>doors</b> adopted in many accesses. In most cases, <b>interlocked</b> <b>doors</b> are small areas where other pieces of information and sensors are placed in order to detect the presence of guns, explosive, etc. The general goals and the required environmental condition, allowed us to implement a detection system at lower costs and complexity, with respect to other existing techniques. The system consists of a fixed array of microwave transceiver modules, whose received signals are processed to collect information related to a sort of volume occupied in the <b>interlocked</b> <b>door</b> cabin. The proposed solution has been statistically validated by using statistical analysis. The whole solution has been also implemented to be used in a real time environment and thus validated against real experimental measures...|$|R
50|$|Because of the Piccadilly extensions, {{which were}} above ground, heaters were fitted, {{and the use}} of British {{materials}} in its construction was used for publicity purposes, {{at a time when there}} was an industrial depression. It became known as the 'All British' train, and operated on the Piccadilly and Northern lines. Transfer between the two was aided by the construction of a junction at Kings Cross in 1927. The Northern line offered heavier traffic, with which to assess the effectiveness of the new features. 62 production cars were ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell, which was formed from the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance Co. and Cammell Laird at this time, for delivery to the Bakerloo line. They replaced the Watford Joint Stock, which although relatively new, needed a larger crew and had to stop for longer at stations, because of its swing doors. Problems with the swing doors were highlighted by a fatal accident in which a passenger got caught in them, but the <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> did not detect it.|$|E
50|$|On a gate stock train, each of {{the cars}} had its own conductor, who was {{responsible}} for the operation of the doors on that car. It was originally planned to work the air operated doors in a similar fashion, but the method adopted was for all the doors on a 3-car train to be controlled by a guard {{at the rear of the}} motor car. This reduced the number of staff needed to operate a 6-car train from seven to three, consisting of a driver, a rear guard and a front guard. Each guard controlled the doors on the three cars at his end of the train. The cars were initially fitted with yellow flipper arms, which protruded from the side of the vehicle when a door was open, and enabled staff to identify doors which had not yet closed. The design was unsatisfactory, and the arms were replaced by indicator lamps interlocked to the air engines in 1924. Traction control circuits and door operating circuits were carried along the train by 10-core jumpers fitted at roof height between the cars. There were two lighting circuits, one fed from {{each of the}} motor cars. It was possible to operate a 3-car train, but in order to do so, a shorting plug had to be fitted to the control trailer, to connect the lighting circuits, and to complete the <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> circuit.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two doors}} at the front which swing {{outwards}} from the centre: to close and lock the cabinet, the left door is closed first, and then the right <b>door,</b> which <b>interlocks</b> with a flange {{on the edge of}} the left door, thus holding it in the closed position, and the cabinet may be locked by turning a key in a lock in the right door. For added security, this door is usually equipped with three-point locking. Unlike lockers, stationery cabinets are not usually sold with a padlocking option.|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis is a {{major concern}} in low- and middle-income countries, but may be {{diagnosed}} using standard chest x-rays. Conventional film-screen x-ray detectors require more maintenance than digital x-ray detectors and need a good supply chain of developer chemicals and film, which make them difficult to maintain in low-infrastructure areas of the world. Current digital x-ray technology is prohibitively expensive for this market, although it brings the possibility of tele-radiology and tele-medicine, quicker diagnosis time, and virtually no cost per test compared to other diagnostics for tuberculosis. This thesis examines the requirements on a small-sized, low-cost digital x-ray detector for this application. Two small x-ray detectors were integrated into x-ray systems, then characterized for detector performance using metrics known as modulation transfer function, noise power spectrum, and detective quantum efficiency. The system designs and the results of the experiments are shown. Details are also shown about the setup of the x-ray lab, including the <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> system for a lead-lined x-ray cabinet. To determine whether a smaller x-ray detector is diagnostically accurate enough for tuberculosis diagnosis compared to full-size chest radiography equipment, a medical study was designed and run using a web-based survey of radiologists in Pakistan, where tuberculosis is a recognized disease. In an attempt to compare x-ray detector performance, MATLAB code was written to measure the modulation transfer function, noise power spectrum, and detective quantum efficiency of x-ray systems. The details about this code, and challenges in simulating the performance of physically different detectors are explained in the thesis...|$|E

40|$|The {{control of}} {{perchloroethylene}} (127184) (PERC) exposure in commercial dry cleaning through ventilation was reviewed. Health hazards associated with PERC included {{central nervous system}} depression, liver and kidney damage, memory impairment, dermatitis, respiratory irritation, and other symptoms. Effective ventilation {{was considered to be}} one of the least expensive engineering measures for reducing worker exposures to PERC. Ventilation was used for controlling PERC exposures and thermal comfort, both of which were important in dry cleaning shops. Possible ventilation methods included local exhaust ventilation and general ventilation. Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) captured and removed the contaminant at or near the source of release, thereby reducing vapor levels in the worker's breathing zone and minimizing vapor diffusion. PERC vapor exposures were greatest during machine maintenance and loading and unloading. LEV implemented at the loading and unloading door was usually activated by a <b>door</b> <b>interlocking</b> system. The retrofitting of an external ventilation hood outside the machine door was an option for older machines lacking built in exhaust ventilation. General ventilation diluted the concentration of the contaminant before it reached the breathing zone of the worker. It was used to supply conditioned fresh air and exhaust contaminated air from the general work area. A workroom air exchange every 5 minutes involving sufficient volumes of make up air was recommended. Systems of emergency ventilation were needed to control solvent vapors resulting from solvent spills or leaks. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 [principal contributors, Gary S. Earnest, Charles S. Hayden, Daniel S.

50|$|The vehicle's name is German for chamber, berth, room, space, expanse, scope, area, or sphere and {{attempts}} to emphasize the vast amount of space it contains relative to its size. This is because the front doors on both the driver and passenger sides open conventionally, but the rear doors slide open rearward and attach {{to the top and}} bottom of the <b>door</b> openings and <b>interlock</b> to the front doors. The Raum uses a similar door approach also used on the first-generation Mitsubishi RVR/Space Runner.|$|R
5000|$|The main artwork in {{the station}} {{consists}} of murals designed by James Sutherland, entitled Spadina Summer Under All Seasons. Using thousands of pieces of glass, colourful mosaics of flowers were created directly into the station’s tiling. Two large mosaics of a giant flower in cross-section face {{each other across the}} tracks, reaching upward into a mezzanine level lined with smaller flower mosaics. Sculptor Ron Baird designed massive circular <b>interlocking</b> <b>doors</b> which provide access to the electrical substation, which is nestled behind the northwest entrance.|$|R
50|$|The first {{generation}} Prairies were innovative vehicles - featuring no B-pillar between {{the front and}} rear <b>doors</b> (instead the <b>interlocking</b> front and sliding rear doors locked onto both the floor and roof of the vehicle); front seatbelts mounted on the doors (excluding the US versions) that facilitated a totally unimpeded side entrance; front seats that could be slid {{all the way to the}} front of the passenger compartment and fully reclined; rear seats that could not only be folded away conventionally, but could also be reclined fully to make a double bed (in combination with the front seats); rear window winders that folded into themselves (to prevent catching when the doors were slid open); tailgate that opened to the floor of the luggage compartment (the center section of the rear bumper was mounted on the tailgate); optional front-facing third row of seats. This type of entry was later introduced on the Toyota Isis, but only on the passenger side.|$|R
5000|$|The Passenger Transfer Vehicle or Passenger Transport Vehicle (PTV) (mobile lounge) is a 54-by-16-foot {{carriage}} {{mounted on}} a scissor truck, capable of carrying 102 passengers. These vehicles were designed by the Chrysler Corporation {{in association with the}} Budd Company, and are sometimes nicknamed [...] "moon buggies" [...] due to their otherworldly appearance. When mobile lounges were first introduced, they had ramps at one end that could be raised or lowered to the floor height of an aircraft. However, after Dulles built the midfield concourses, some of the lounges were retrofitted to be used only for inter-terminal passenger transport. The ramps were removed and <b>doors</b> that could <b>interlock</b> with a terminal building were fitted to either end. Mobile lounges have a driver's cab at each end. The wheels {{at either end of the}} lounge can be steered, but the wheels at the end opposite the driver lock into a straight-ahead configuration so that the lounge is steered only by the forward driving wheels.|$|R
50|$|An {{interlock}} is {{a feature}} that makes the state of two mechanisms or functions mutually dependent. It {{may be used to}} prevent undesired states in a finite-state machine, and may consist of any electrical, electronic, or mechanical devices or systems. In most applications, an interlock is used to help prevent a machine from harming its operator or damaging itself by preventing one element from changing state due to the state of another element, and vice versa. Elevators are equipped with an interlock that prevents the moving elevator from opening its doors, and prevents the stationary elevator (with open doors) from moving. Although both are idiot proof strategies, an interlock {{should not be confused with}} a simple safety switch. For example, in a typical household microwave oven, the switch that disables the magnetron if the door is opened is not an interlock. Rather, it would be considered an <b>interlock</b> if the <b>door</b> were locked while the magnetron is on, and the magnetron were prevented from operating while the <b>door</b> is open. <b>Interlocks</b> may include sophisticated elements such as curtains of infrared beams, photodetectors, a computer containing an interlocking computer program, digital or analogue electronics, or simple switches and locks.|$|R
