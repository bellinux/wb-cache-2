40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the introduction of}} competition into the English and Welsh water and sewerage industry following privatisation of the 10 regional water authorities in 1989.

Despite competitive innovations, the industry remains highly regulated, complex and difficult to enter. One of Ofwat’s outstanding challenges for the next decade is to examine the means by which the regulatory burden might be lightened and barriers to entry lowered, to encourage potential entrants to compete with incumbents. ...|$|R
40|$|A key {{piece in}} {{understanding}} {{the link between the}} extension and research missions of Land Grant universities is to understand the role of faculty with (and without) extension appointments within agricultural colleges. This article provides a comparative empirical portrayal of the primary activities of agricultural college faculty, and demonstrates the basic vitality <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> professors within the Land Grant system. Professors with smaller extension appointments are heavily engaged in the major research efforts of their universities at even greater levels of production than professors without extension responsibilities. Professors with heavy levels <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> <b>appointments</b> experience increasing tradeoffs between core extension activities and research outputs and graduate training. Professors with no extension appointments engage substantively in extension activities and frequently have links to core extension clientele. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{current study}} completes a {{three-phase}} process to determine critical professional development {{needs of the}} University <b>of</b> Florida <b>Extension</b> (UFE) state specialists. Phase I {{data were collected from}} county directors, Phase II from county faculty, while this phase involved data collected from state extension specialists themselves. In addition to identifying critical professional development needs using the matrix analysis method, the researchers also examined differences in those needs based upon age, percentage <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> <b>appointment,</b> years <b>of</b> professional experience, academic rank, and program typology. This study revealed three critical professional development needs (“knowledge of current research findings”, “ability to identify funding sources for program development”, and “ability to incorporate appropriate instructional techniques in my own presentations”). UFE specialists differed based upon professional development needs on only one of the personological characteristics (gender) and on none of the organizational variables. Individuals planning professional development programs should keep in mind that these critical professional development needs cut across most of the personological and all of the organizational characteristics included in this study.
