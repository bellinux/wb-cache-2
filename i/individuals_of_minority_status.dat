40|$|The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) {{supports}} {{the instruction of}} students within heterogeneous classrooms that recognize and accommodate individual student differences in learning style, ability, and interests. NASP opposes the use of tracking, a permanent approach where students are assessed and placed into specific classrooms with peers of similar ability, because of its demonstrated negative effect for many students. Tracking {{is a form of}} whole-group instruction that is characterized by a single and a set curriculum that is delivered at the same pace for all students within the classroom. Placement is based solely upon the child’s perceived ability level and is therefore considered to be an unacceptable approach for the grouping of students (Tieso, 2003). The effects of ability grouping have been analyzed and debated related to various populations including individuals identified as gifted and talented, individuals identified with educational disabilities, <b>individuals</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status,</b> and economically disadvantaged students.

Two manuscripts were developed for this dissertation. The first is a critical literature review which establishes the relationship <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> stress, persistence, and leadership values within psychological and higher educational scholarship of Black students at PWIs. The paper seeks to clarify the connection between the aforementioned variables {{as it relates to the}} Black student experience at PWIs. As <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> stress causes a threat to Black student persistence, leadership conceptualized using the values or the Cs of the Social Change Model of Leadership Development (SCM) were introduced as coping methods Black students have used to increase their persistence and minimize the negative effects <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> stress. The second article is a quantitative study examining the relationship <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> stress and persistence employing the Cs of the SCM as mediators in a sample of 340 Black college students. Results indicated that none of the Cs of the SCM fully mediated the relationship between <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> stress and persistence when employed as composite scores. However, when the six <b>individual</b> factors <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> stress (environmental stressors, race-related stressors, racial-identity stressors, intrapersonal and interpersonal stressors, achievement-related stressors, and <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> stressors) and the 5 factors of persistence (academic and intellectual development, faculty concerns for student development and teaching, interactions with faculty, institutional and goal commitments, and peer group interactions) were employed in a series of multiple mediation analyses with the Cs of the SCM as mediators, there were several instances of full mediation by the Consciousness of Self, Citizenship, and Change values. The findings emphasized the importance of these three values in conceptualizing Black student leadership at PWIs and in understanding the role of leadership in Black student persistence in lieu <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> stress.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Considerable {{research}} has shown that greater intergroup contact corresponds with lower intergroup prejudice, yet little is known regarding how the relation-ships between contact and prejudice may vary for mem-bers <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> and majority <b>status</b> groups. The present research examined differences in contact-prejudice rela-tionships among members <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> and majority <b>status</b> groups, using data from a larger meta-analytic study of the effects of intergroup contact. Results indicate that the relationships between contact and prejudice tend to be weaker among members <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> groups than among members of majority status groups. Moreover, es-tablishing Allport’s (1954) proposed conditions for optimal intergroup contact significantly predicts stronger contact-prejudice relationships among members of majority status groups, but not among members <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> groups.

We examined the hypothesis that fewer primary care visits by minority patients contribute to these dispari-ties. Methods: We analyzed claims for Medicare beneficiaries 65 and older {{who participated in the}} Medi-care Current Beneficiary Survey, 1998 to 2002. Five preventive services were included: colorectal cancer testing, influenza vaccination, lipid screening, mammography, and Papanicolaou smear screening.

40|$|IntroductionNon–small-cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{is the leading}} cause of cancer-related {{morbidity}} and mortality. Unfortunately, patients with NSCLC have relatively poor survival rates compared with patients diagnosed with most other types of cancer. Accordingly, managing physical and mental health symptoms are important treatment goals. In the current investigation, we sought to determine whether individual socioeconomic status (SES; as indexed by level <b>of</b> education), racial/ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>status,</b> and hospital type (public versus tertiary care center) were associated with NSCLC cancer patients’ depressive severity. Importantly, we investigated whether NSCLC patients’ individual SES was more or less prognostic of their depressive severity compared with <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> and the hospital context where they received treatment. MethodsPatients scheduled for chemotherapy were assessed for depressed mood by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Data were collected at baseline and at approximately 6, 12, and 18 weeks. ResultsNSCLC patients with less education had more depressive severity than those with more education. Treatment setting and <b>minority</b> <b>status</b> were not associated with depressive severity. The interaction between education level and treatment setting predicting depressive severity was not significant, suggesting that the association between education level and depressive severity did not differ by treatment setting.

Of special interest was the question of utilization differences among rural minority populations, as compared with urban non-Latino whites. DATA SOURCE: Data from the 1992 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).

DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Health Interview Survey, 1992. The survey included information about the race/ethnicity of the respondent, health status, utilization of services, insurance status, and socioeconomic status. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The most salient determinant of utilization of healthcare services is insurance status, regardless of race/ethnicity or (rural or urban) place of residence. Racial and ethnic minorities were less likely than whites to use physician services, and use was generally lower for rural residents. The most striking differences were for rural Latinos and rural Asians/other persons.

To determine if health status modifies the effect of race on receiving vaccination among nursing home residents, we used cross-sectional data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for Michigan from October 1, 2005 through March 31, 2006 in 291 racially mixed nursing facilities (n= 66, 895 residents). Analyses included multilevel models, stratified by the proportion of black residents in the nursing home, to assess whether frailty, measured with the Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS), the Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and the Changes in Health, End-stage disease and Symptoms and Signs (CHESS), contributed to vaccination inequity (i. e., white-black difference) within nursing homes. In facilities with few ( 50 %) blacks, the inequity decreased with increasing frailty (CPS: 8. 7 to 0. 8; ADL: 9. 3 to 2. 1; and CHESS: 6. 7 to 4. 6).

Also, there may be differences in attitudes toward minorities across states that are correlated with the minorities’ wage disadvantages. Accordingly, we re-estimate (1) adding state-M interactions. The resulting estimates of α 3 are - 0.892 (s.e= 0.029), 0.528 (s.e.= 0.056) and 0.317 (s.e.= 0.043) for women, Hispanics and African-Americans respectively. As with the alternative specifications discussed above, nothing much changes for women and African-Americans. For Hispanics, on the other hand, the estimate changes drastically, no doubt because of the very uneven concentrations of Hispanics across states over much of this period. The change illustrates the difficulty of estimating this effect for Hispanics.|$|R
