40|$|This paper {{examines}} the consequences and {{effects on the}} financial statements under the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 38, Intangible Assets. The paper also investigates more intangibles-related issues, such as goodwill, R&D, plus the profitability of companies which have intangible assets. The sample consists of 241 UK industrial firms that are listed on the London Stock Exchange, while the period under analysis is 1 January to 31 December 2005, with some exceptions to spring or summer of 2006 with relative starting date. The study shows that the firms that have intangible assets have improved key financial measures such as leverage, profitability and growth rather that the firms that <b>haven</b> <b>t.</b> Firms with intangible assets would tend to borrow more often and try to expand more. For example, the study indicates that large firms with intangible assets would pay a larger dividend per share {{in order to attract}} investors whilst they are having liquidity problems and their debt ratios are larger than those that <b>haven</b> <b>t.</b> However, the results show that firms that present intangible assets at their balance sheet tend to exhibit more favourable financial results compared to firms that don t. Similar findings are obtained for firms that have goodwill and R&D expenses. The more profitable firms are usual to have intangible assets rather than the firms that are less profitable. The IAS 38 is being implemented thoroughly, by the firms at the London Stock Exchange at least, and it shows the strength behind the intellectual capital, brand names, goodwill, investments on projects and the means to more profitable results...|$|E

Furthermore, the projed assessed {{the children in the}} system with the aim of accommodating them in the least restrictive, most empowering child care facility. This narrative action research study focused on the effects of Project Go and the transformations on the children at the Children's <b>Haven</b> M <b>T</b> R Smit This study can also be described as emanciipatory action research. This qualitative study is positioned within a social construction discourse. Knowledge was socially constructed through multiple reflexive conversations.

A narrative approach was employed. I relied on the Foucauldian discourse to come to some understanding of issues of power and resistance. Following Foucauldian thought, I investigated discourses constituting the care that the children at the Children's <b>Haven</b> M <b>T</b> R Smit received. This investigatlon led me to formulate some understanding {{of the history of the}} Dutch Reformed Church (DRC) the body responsible for the management of the haven since it was founded in the earty 1920 s. 0 nce I reached an understanding of some of the historical developments of the DRC (which l learned was closely linked lo Afrikaner politics), I explored some implications of the transformation for the DRC's future involvement with the children in its care. This exploration led me to a comparison of the theology of the DRC and black liberation theology, focusing on prophetic practice. Although not an initial aim of this study, I learned that the transfornation of child and youth care held implications not only for the pastoral practice of the DRC, but also for the helping professions such as psychology, social work and child care. l focused briefly on the ethics and some limitations of care provided by the profession of psychology.

40|$|A {{software}} {{system has been}} developed for prioritizing newly acquired geological data onboard a planetary rover. The system {{has been designed to}} enable efficient use of limited communication resources by transmitting the data likely to have the most scientific value. This software operates onboard a rover by analyzing collected data, identifying potential scientific targets, and then using that information to prioritize data for transmission to Earth. Currently, the system is focused on the analysis of acquired images, although the general techniques are applicable {{to a wide range of}} data modalities. Image prioritization is performed using two main steps. In the first step, the software detects features of interest from each image. In its current application, the system is focused on visual properties of rocks. Thus, rocks are located in each image and rock properties, such as shape, texture, and albedo, are extracted from the identified rocks. In the second step, the features extracted from a group of images are used to prioritize the images using three different methods: (1) identification of key target signature (finding specific rock features the scientist has identified as important), (2) novelty detection (finding rocks we <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> seen before), and (3) representative rock sampling (finding the most average sample of each rock type).

It {{was found that the}} breed of terminal sire <b>haven.</b> <b>t</b> had influence on cold carcass weight and fat thickness measured for TP method of lean percentage estimation. Inclusion of Pietrain as terminal sire had influence on MLD thickness measured for TP and INS methods which was significantly higher, while fat thickness measured for instrumental method was significantly lower (p< 0. 01). Carcasses of the same group had higher lean percentage estimated by TP and INS methods (p< 0. 05 and p< 0. 01, resp.). Also, different methods of lean percentage estimation resulted in different classification of the carcasses into SEUROP classes. The choice of the lean percentage estimation method had no significant effect on the price of the carcasses from 2 nd group which had Large White as terminal sire, while in pig carcasses from the 1 st group (Pietrain as terminal sire), the choice of lean percentage method of estimation determined the price of the carcasses, and by this also economic surplus (or loss) of the producers. It is concluded that both methods are equally applicable in the case of Large White crossbreeds, while caution should be taken in the case of pig carcasses originated from Pietrain as terminal sire because carcasses of such pigs reached higher prices when estimated by instrumental method...|$|E

The {{effect of a}} chromosomal deletion on chromosome transfer. J. Bacteriol. 88 : 367 – 373. 1964. —Evidence is presented that in an F′ strain of Escherichia coli. AB 1206, the chromosomal region corresponding to the merogenote of F 14 is deleted. AB 1206 differs from all other F′ strains in its stability and in its relative inability to transfer chromosomal markers under conditions in which transfer of the merogenote occurs at a frequency of 100 %. Its stability can {{be accounted for by}} the fact that the loss of the F merogenote, which contains approximately 10 % of the genetic information of the cell, would be a lethal event. The failure of AB 1206 to transfer chromosomal markers, except at very low frequencies, can be explained in terms of the crossover model proposed to explain chromosome transfer by F′ strains, since the homologous chromosomal region is missing in this strain. The conclusion that the chromosomal region is deleted is strengthened by the finding that the different enzymes coded for by the genes on F 14 are present in AB 1206 at the level found in haploid strains, but have double this activity in homozygous diploids carrying F 14...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{descriptive}} study {{of health care}} in the Inuit settlement of Gjoa <b>Haven,</b> N. W. <b>T.</b> The purpose of the research was primarily to describe and analyse the interactional networks of health and illness related behaviour that are associated with the Nursing Station. The cultural and organizational background of the administrators and nurses who provide medical services to Inuit are described, as are the attitudes and beliefs held by Inuit about illness and about the health care delivery system. The thesis examines the acculturation of Inuit beliefs and practices related to illness throughout the contact period and focuses particularly on the changing role of the Inuit healer, the anqatquq or shaman. Various influences such as epidemic diseases, missionary activity, and changing economic orientations that have contributed to Inuit dependency patterns and changed beliefs about illness, its causes and cures, are detailed. Theoretically, the thesis is partly a study of the replacement of a traditional medical system by the cosmopolitan medical system and the gradual attenuation of the traditional curer's role. It is also an examination of {{the manner in which the}} conflict resulting from differences in attitudes between administrators, nurses and Inuit, affects the delivery and utilization of health services in Gjoa Haven. It demonstrates that where problems occur they are as much a result of conflict between administrators and nurses, as they are due to conflict between nurses and Inuit. The substantive portion of the thesis examines specific domains of interaction such. as health education, agency coordination and native participation and points out areas where failure occurs in each of these arenas. Recommendations are included that suggest strategies for improving the effectiveness of health care delivery and ultimately the health levels of the Inuit population...|$|R

Nowadays, while some people are still one or more tantalising steps removed from having the basic {{information}} they need on agriculture and rural development, {{there is a growing}} feeling that many others have, at first sight, perhaps too much. The emphasis is coming to lie on being able to select what is important from what is less important, and to manage it efficiently. Here, the complex skill of priority setting can help in raising the quality of agricultural information services, from defining user needs to delivery. Over the last three years, CTA has been steadily refining a methodology for the determination of priority themes for agricultural information, and it recently completed a series of six pilot studies at national level. The studies were undertaken in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Senegal and Zambia. They centred around workshops involving representatives of National Agricultural Systems as well as related non-governmental organisations and rural organisations. As a result, the next phase of this programme will enable other ACP countries to be able to conduct similar exercises, although the issue of their funding remains an item.

40|$|Video {{games are}} no longer a means of simple {{entertainment}} that serve as a form of escapism. They are perceived not simply as free time distractions, but as logic of engagement and platforms of creative thinking. Furthermore, online video games have taken the idea of interaction to a level no any other media has ever achieved. Online video games known as virtual world or MMO (massively multiplayer online) are a mega interaction platform that attract millions of players across the globe. They are the ultimate goal that all architects have ever dreamed of, i. e. to create an interactive space that satis es the needs of users. This thesis research will tend to examine a variety of video games from 3 perspectives: space, structure and interactivity, with a view to understanding and exploring the behaviour of players in video games, as known as, virtual stages. In recognizing and articulating such behaviour, followed by exploring the relationship between architects, users and spaces, the interpretation of architectural languages can then be translated into physical spatial form. This research then questions the possibilities of promoting the gaming industry in South Africa. In the current digital era, the IT (information and technology) industry is a main stream profession that helps with the growth of a country as a whole. The role of the gaming industry therefore cannot be ignored in this instance. The gaming industry is a rapid growing profession that comprises a lot of speci c professionals. SA does not offer nor focus on the video game eld and as a result, we are experiencing a shortage of professionals in this eld. This thesis proposes a facility to facilitate current and future game industry related professionals, on the same time, providing a playful environment that integrates the building and local context, allowing deeper engagement for those who <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> been exposed to the real meaning behind video games...|$|E
40|$|Oyster reefs {{around the}} world are declining rapidly, and {{although}} they <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> received as much attention as coral reefs, they are just as important to their local ecosystems and economies. Oyster reefs provide habitats for many species of fish, invertebrates, and crustaceans, as well as the next generations of oysters. Oysters are also harvested from many of these reefs and are an important segment of many local economies, including that of Mobile Bay, where oysters rank in the top five commercial marine species both by landed weight and by dollar value. Although the remaining Mobile Bay oyster reefs are some of the least degraded in the world, projected climate change could have dramatic effects on the health of these important ecosystems. The viability of oyster reefs depends on water depth and temperature, appropriate pH and salinity levels, and the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. Projected increases in sea level, changes in precipitation and runoff patterns, and changes in pH resulting from increases in the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in the oceans could all affect the viability of oyster reefs in the future. Human activities such as dredging and unsustainable harvesting practices are also adversely impacting the oyster reefs. Fortunately, several projects are already under way to help rebuild or support existing or previously existing oyster reefs. The success of these projects will depend on the local effects of climate change on the current and potential habitats and man s ability to recognize and halt unsustainable harvesting practices. As the extent and health of the reefs changes, it will have impacts on the Mobile Bay ecosystem and economy, changing the resources available to {{the people who live there}} and to the rest of the country, since Mobile Bay is an important national source of seafood.

However, the acts accepted as. crime. and the penalties imposed upon criminals for the same crime have revealed differences in each society and in each era. Prior to the Modern Age, almost in all societies, punishment was an open public activity to warn people and imprisonment was not a way of punishment; instead it was only a measure impeding the criminal. s escape until the execution of punishment. Modern world, at the beginning, has tried to use punishment for dictating definite. norms. instead of frightening; later on, instead of corporal execution some other punishment systems have been used as a means of creating individuals submitting to the authority {{on the way to the}} formation of inspection oriented. New Society [...] This new approaches in punishment systems has required spatial and organizational solutions. As a result, prisons in which imprisonment would be executed have developed as a new building type requiring architectural design as other new building types developed during modernization. However, prison architecture is different from all other buildings as an architectural end product. This architectural product is such a place that whoever stays in never wants to live in there and wants to get out it as soon as possible since there is no relation between the spatial properties of the building and the preferences of a person staying in it, in other words, the criminal. Although debate on prison buildings seems to be a current issue in public opinion, discussions on the spatial organizations of prisons. coincides with the of F-type applications of Ministry of Justice in Turkey. On the other hand, the problems of this building type <b>haven.</b> <b>t</b> been examined enough in terms of architectural design approaches. It is important to discuss how prisons. spatial design have been developed throughout the history; and which architectural properties a prison has to have today must be considered. Whether a prison system, in which the person serving his/her sentence will not be damaged both physically and mentally by public authority, environment and other criminals during its detention period, is created or not, or relevance of the created spaces to the prevailing understanding of punishment and their appropriateness to its functions should also be studied. Therefore, this study aims at understanding prison architecture., their development and change in relation to changing social structures. A typological analysis on case studies is used to understand their spatial organizations in a retrospective perspective.

40|$|A experiência como psicóloga escolar permitiu perceber que expressões do tipo "fiquei um lixo no churrasco da turma", "fizemos uma resenha interna só de meninas e ficamos todas embriagadas", se fazem presentes de um modo constante nas conversas das estudantes do Ensino Fundamental e do Médio, sinalizando uma preocupante incidência do consumo do álcool em adolescentes do sexo feminino. Contudo, os estudos sobre o tema ainda não se detiveram na realidade agora vivenciada pelas meninas. O presente estudo teve como objetivo compreender aspectos da relação entre meninas e álcool, partindo do pressuposto de que o consumo exacerbado é expressão de rituais de iniciação em grupos, facilitador das relações sociais, fator de sociabilidade. Apoiou-se na aplicação de questionário em 1028 adolescentes do sexo feminino, com idade entre 12 e 18 anos, estudantes de escolas privadas de Natal, capital do estado do Rio Grande do Norte. Indicou que o primeiro contato com a bebida alcoólica tem se dado em ambientes domésticos, em companhia de pais e amigos, de forma bastante precoce, por volta dos 10 anos de idade, por curiosidade. Em relação ao consumo atual, a bebida mais consumida é a ice; o {{principal}} motivo que as levam a beber é para passar o tempo; {{a principal}} ocasião são as festas e elas não bebem sozinhas (93 % do universo pesquisado), configurando o caráter socializador e recreativo do álcool. Consideram o álcool uma droga, mas não demonstram medo de se viciar. Os comportamentos que mais destacam nas amigas que bebem estão relacionados a desinibição, do tipo ficam mais alegres (40, 3 %) e perdem a timidez (29, 4 %), e atitudes de caráter moral, como ficam com qualquer menino (18, 5 %), ficam tontas (9, 9 %), ou ficam tristes (1, 9 %). Acham vulgar as meninas beberem, dependendo da quantidade, e recebem estímulo dos amigos para que bebam. O estudo aponta para a necessidade de intervenções sistemáticas da psicologia escolar, que auxiliem na prevenção e erradicação do problema, ao mesmo tempo que representa uma interrogação na formação deste profissionalThe {{experience as a}} school psychologist allowed me to notice that expressions like I was like trash in the gang s barbecue, and we chatted away, only the girls, and we all got drunk, are very common in conversations between Elementary and High School students, pointing out to a concerning incidence of alcohol consumption among female adolescents. However, studies about this theme <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> gone deep in the nowadays reality these girls are living in. This study aimed at comprehending the aspects {{of the relation between}} girls and alcohol, starting from the point that exaggerated consumption indicates introductory rituals for some groups, making social relations easier and becoming a sociability factor. To give this study some support, a questionnaire was applied to 1028 female teenagers, between 12 and 18 years old, students in private schools in Natal, capital of Rio Grande do Norte. The context chosen {{for the development of the}} study - private schools -, arose from the notion that the majority of the data collection carried out about alcohol and other psychotropic drugs aim at public school students. The instrument used was divided in two parts, one that treated about the first contact with alcohol (experimentation), and other that points to the current relation with alcoholic beverages, with 27 closed questions but nevertheless with available space for manifestation like if other; which?, applied collectively in classrooms. The data received a statistic treatment from SPSS and showed that the first contact with alcoholic beverage happens in domestic environment, having parents and friends as companions, very precociously, around 10 years of age, as curiosity. At this moment, Ice drink is the most consumed beverage. The main reason that leads them to drink is to pass the time in parties, and they don t drink alone (93 % of students researched), what gives alcohol this recreational and socializing characteristic. They do consider alcohol a kind of drug, but are not afraid of getting addicted. People that drink usually show to be extroverted, they get happier (40, 3 %) and are not shy at all (29, 4 %), have attitudes of moral character, like to get involved with unknown boys (18, 5 %), get numb (9, 9 %), or get sad (1, 9 %). They label as vulgar the girls that drink, depending on the amount, and to be stimulated by the boys to drink.

40|$|In this thesis, allelochemistry of Alexandrium tamarense, a {{well-known}} producer of saxitoxin and its analogues {{was investigated in}} an attempt to interpret the chemical characteristics and mode of action of the allelochemicals produced. As the response of target cells was lysis, the allelochemicals were thereafter designated as lytic compounds. One A. tamarense clonal strain, Alex 2, with potent lytic activity, was chosen as the producer of the lytic compounds. Another A. tamarense clonal strain from the same geographical population, but without measurable lytic activity was introduced as a negative control. First, a cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina bioassay was used to guide the isolation and eventual structural characterization of the unknown lytic substances. Highest lytic activity per cell of A. tamarense cultures was achieved in the stationary growth phase, however, the allelopathic potency per cell remained constant throughout the entire exponential phase. The supernatant of stationery cell cultures prepared via centrifugation was chosen as the major source of lytic compounds for research through out the whole thesis. Further isolation and purification of the supernatant often resulted in major loss or even disappearance of lytic activity, prompting the physico/chemical characterization of the lytic compounds. Although temporal stability of the lytic compounds was high, in that the lytic activity was stable over wide ranges of temperatures and pH and was refractory to bacterial degradation (at least of the bacteria consortium present in the cultures), substantial losses were evident during purification. The lytic compounds possessed high adsorption to various materials including polycarbonate and other plastics, glass, etc. Additionally, the lytic activity was reduced when stored at low concentration, in deionized water, or in vessels with large surface area/volume ratios. Similar to the bioactivity of allelochemicals produced among other harmful algal bloom species, A. tamarense produced a suite of metabolites acting as lytic compounds. At least two groups of lytic compounds with various polarities were separated and quantified via reversed phase solid phase extraction (SPE). Emphasis was put on the less polar fraction because of its higher lytic activity. Further purification of this SPE fraction was performed via both C 8 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and hydrophilic interaction ion-chromatography (HILIC). Through matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) masses of the spectra between the lytic and non-lytic strain in SPE, C 8 HPLC, and HILIC fractions were compared. Two small unique masses, 1061. 6 Da and 1291. 6 Da were found in lytic but not in non-lytic SPE fractions, however, they were later excluded to be related to lytic compounds by both HPLC and HILIC. Trypsic digestion and trypsic digestion-coupled size exclusion chromatography (SEC) suggested that the lytic compounds are large non-proteinaceous compounds less than 22. 3 kDa. Although the large masses range from 7 to 15 kDa found only in HILIC lytic fraction <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> been proved to be lytic, the mass range deduced from SEC suggest that they are probably related to the lytic compounds. Total sugar content analysis suggested the percentage of sugar in dry mass equivalent in the lytic fraction was rather low, indicating the major composition of the lytic compounds may not be related to sugar. Alexandrium tamarense causes lysis of a broad spectrum of target protistan cells, and since the process is rapid, direct membrane disruption of target cell was suspected to be the mode of action. The lytic compounds increased permeability of the cell membrane for calcium ion from buffer external to the outer cell membrane, and such increase was not inhibited even during blockade of calcium ion channels with cadmium. This indicates that the lytic compounds lyse membrane directly, and the molecular targets are not ion channels. Membrane sterols were then suspected as the molecular target of lytic compounds. Adding sterols to a lysis bioassay with the R. salina for evaluation of competitive binding indicated that the lytic compounds possessed apparent affinity for free sterols. For three tested sterols, the lytic compounds showed highest affinity towards cholesterol followed by ergosterol and brassicasterol. However, analysis of sterol composition of isolates of A. tamarense and of five target protistan species showed that both lytic and non-lytic A. tamarense strains contain cholesterol and dinosterol as major sterols, whereas none of the other tested species contain dinosterol. Cholesterol comprised a higher percentage of total sterols in plasma membrane fractions of A. tamarense than in corresponding whole cell fractions. It is therefore concluded that the molecular targets of the lytic compounds are not, or are not exclusively, sterol components of the membranes...|$|E

Objetivou-se com o presente trabalho avaliar a produ????o e qualidade de amoreiras-pretas, utilizando diferentes sistemas de condu????o, doses de torta de mamona como aduba????o e aplica????es de c??lcio em pr??-colheita, visando a manuten????o da fruta em p??s-colheita. Os experimentos foram realizados na Embrapa Clima Temperado, Pelotas/RS e, as an??lises qu??micas, no Laborat??rio de Fisiologia da P??s-colheita da mesma, no per??odo 2010 a 2012. No experimento 1, avaliou-se os sistemas de condu????o, o espa??amento utilizado foi de 0, 50 x 3, 0 m, o delineamento {{experimental}} foi em blocos casualizados, em um fatorial 3 x 3 : tr??s sistemas de condu????o (sem tutor, espaldeira e Y) e tr??s cultivares de amoreira-preta (Tupy, Guarani e Xavante). A cultivar Tupy apresentou maior produ????o e massa m??dia de fruta em todos os sistemas de condu????o. O sistema em Y possibilitou melhores resultados. No experimento 2, testou-se a aplica????o de torta de mamona como aduba????o de base, utilizou-se a cultivar Tupy, com espa??amento de 0, 70 x 3 m. Os tratamentos foram: T 1 - testemunha; T 2 - 200; T 3 - 400; T 4 - 800; T 5 - 1. 600 gramas de torta de mamona por planta. O delineamento experimental foi o de blocos ao acaso. As vari??veis n??o foram influenciadas pelas doses de torta de mamona. No experimento 3, avaliou-se a aplica????o de c??lcio em pr??-colheita, o delineamento experimental foi inteiramente casualizado. Em 2010 o experimento teve quatro repeti????es de oito frutas por repeti????o, num esquema fatorial 2 x 5 x 2, duas aduba????es com e sem torta de mamona; cinco de aplica????es de c??lcio (0, 1, 2, 3 e 4 aplica????es), e dois per??odos de armazenamento em c??mara fria (0 e 3 dias). Em 2011, utilizou-se tr??s repeti????es de dez frutas por parcela, e duplicou-se o n??mero de aplica????es de c??lcio (0, 2, 4 e 8), matendo-se a mesma concentra????o por aplica????o, e tr??s per??odos de armazenamento (0, 3 e 8 dias), num esquema fatorial 2 x 4 x 3. Durante o armazenamento ocorreu redu????o dos s??lidos sol??veis totais das amoras-pretas. Com o armazenamento ocorreram perdas significativas de massa das amoras-pretas. O tratamento que recebeu maior n??mero de aplica????es de c??lcio apresentou menor perda de massa das frutas. As aplica????es de c??lcio n??o influenciaram na firmeza da fruta. The blackberry is {{a rustic}} specie and despite {{it has been}} introduced in Brazil in the 1970, there is few works about the cultural practices of this rosacea were conducted. The aim of this work was to evaluate production and quality of blackberries, using different trellis systems, castor bean pie as fertilization and calcium foliar applications in preharvest. The experiments were conducted at Embrapa Temperate Climate, Pelotas-RS and the chemical analyses, were made at Postharvest Fisiology Laboratory of this institution, from 2010 to 2012. In the first experiment was evaluation the trellis systems type, spaced between row of 0. 50 x 3. 0 m, where the experimental design was in randomized block, with a factorial design 3 x 3 : being three conduction systems (free, trelli and Y) and three cultivars of blackberry (Tupy, Guarani and Xavante). The cultivar Tupy showed a higher production and fruit flesh average in all conduction systems. The system Y showed better results. In the second experiment was castor bean pie applicated as a base fertilization. The cultivar was cultivar Tupy, using the row spacing as 0. 70 x 3 m. The treatments were: T 1 - pattern; T 2 - 200; T 3 - 400; T 4 - 800; T 5 - 1. 600 grams of castor bean pie per plant. The experimental design was randomized blocks. The variables <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> been influenced by castor bean pie. In the third experiment was the calcium foliar application in preharvest. The experimental design was randomized. In 2010 the experiment had four repetitions with eight fruits per repetition, with a factorial design 2 x 5 x 2, with two fertilizations levels with and without castor bean pie; five calcium foliar applications x g L- 1 (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 applications), and two storage periods on cold chamber (0 and 3 days). In 2011, there were three repetitions with ten fruits per block, and were doubled the application number of calcium foliar (0, 2, 4 and 8), and it was kept the same concentration per application, and three storage times (0, 3 and 8 days), with a factorial design 2 x 4 x 3. During storage there was a reduction of SS of blackberries, and there were significant losses of blackberries mass. The treatment which received {{a larger number of}} calcium applications showed a smaller mass loss of fruit. The calcium applications didn t influence the fruit firmness...|$|E
40|$|Existem valores que predizem a saúde? Mais ainda, será que sua ausência ocasionaria deterioro ao bem-estar subjetivo? A presente pesquisa buscou encontrar respostas a estas questões verificando em que medida os valores humanos explicam o bem-estar subjetivo experimentado pelas pessoas, nos diferentes contextos de referência valorativos. Para isso, foram estudadas as profissões de músico e advogado. Em um estudo preliminar, composto de duas pesquisas, buscou-se preencher lacunas quanto à carência de {{bibliografia}} que torne conhecido o contexto atual dessas profissões na cidade de João Pessoa, por meio de reportagens do Jornal Correio da Paraíba e entrevistas com informantes privilegiados. Foi utilizada a análise de conteúdo identificando os principais dilemas das profissões, bem como seus contextos sócioocupacionais. No segundo estudo (o estudo principal), o objetivo foi verificar as relações entre as variáveis bem-estar subjetivo e valores humanos para os profissionais, adotando o panorama sócio-econômico das profissões como suporte para as análises. Neste estudo participaram 387 profissionais, sendo 148 músicos (31, 8 % musicista) e 239 advogados (36, 8 % cível), com idades variando de 18 a 77 anos (M = 35, 9; DP = 12, 35), e de 22 a 79 anos (M = 38, 6; DP = 12, 31), respectivamente, que responderam ao Questionário dos Valores Básicos; à Escala de Afetos Positivos e Negativos; à Escala de Vitalidade; ao Questionário de Saúde Geral - QSG- 12; à Escala de Satisfação com a Vida e a Informações sócio-demográficas. Utilizou-se o Pacote Estatístico para as Ciências Sociais (SPSS Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) e se observou que, quanto aos músicos, destaca-se a importância do tipo de valor Existência/Bio-social apenas com o indicador vitalidade. O tipo de valor Realização/Poder mostrou-se importante para os afetos positivos e para a vitalidade, enquanto que os tipos de valores Realização/Autodireção e Normativos não tiveram influência no bem-estar subjetivo. Apenas a relação entre o tipo Existência/Bio social e vitalidade foi mediada pela variável sexo e estado civil. Para os advogados, o tipo de valor preditor do bem-estar subjetivo foi o Normativo [F(1, 219) = 11, 8, p &# 8804; 0, 001; Rmúltiplo = 0, 23, R 2 ajustado = 0, 05]. O tipo de valor Realização/Autodireção não apresentou influência alguma no bem-estar subjetivo. O tipo Existência/Bio-social apresentou uma relação direta com vitalidade e inversa com depressão. Para Realização/Poder observou-se uma relação direta com afetos positivos e inversa com depressão. Este estudo concluiu que a congruência dos valores pessoais com aqueles que foram promovidos, no contexto social de referência, pode ser um indicador de bem-estar subjetivo, desde que se tenha um contexto social valorativo bem demarcadoAre there {{values that}} predict health? Moreover, would {{the absence of}} health motivate deterioration in the subjective well-being? This research has attempted to find {{answers to these questions}} by verifying in which proportion human values explain the subjective well-being experienced by people in different contexts of value reference. Both musicians and lawyers have been studied. In a preliminary study, composed of two researches, it was attempted to overcome the lack of bibliography in order to make known the current context of these professions in João Pessoa, Paraíba, through newspaper articles from the Correio da Paraíba and interviews with privileged informers. The technique of content analysis was then used identifying the main dilemmas of the professions as well as their socio-occupational contexts. In the second and main study, the aim was to verify the existing relations among the variables of subjective well-being and the human values for these professionals adopting the socioeconomical panorama of the occupations to support the analysis. 387 professionals took part in this study: 148 musicians (31. 8 % instrumentalists) and 239 lawyers (36. 8 % civil), with ages varying from 18 up to 77 years old (M= 35. 9; SD= 12. 35), and from 22 up to 79 years (M = 38. 6; SD= 12. 31), respectively, answered the Basic Human Values (BHV); Positive and Negative Affect Scale; Vitality Scale; General Health Questionnaire GHQ- 12; Satisfaction with Life Scale and the socio-demographic questions. The SPSS Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was used and it could be observed that, for the musicians, the importance of the type of existence/bio-social value stands out just as an indicator of vitality. The type of value Accomplishment/Power, showed itself important for the positive affection and for vitality, while the types Accomplishment/Self-direction and Normative <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> had any influence in the subjective well-being. Only the relation between the Existence/Bio- Social type and vitality was mediated by the sex and marital status variables. As for the lawyers, the type of predictor value of the subjective well-being was the normative [F(1, 219) = 11, 8, p &# 8804; 0, 001; Rmultiple = 0, 23, R 2 adjusted = 0, 05]. On the other hand, the type Existence/Bio social presented a direct relation with vitality but inverse with depression. It was then concluded that the congruency of personal values with those promoted in the social context of reference may be an indicator of subjective well-being, given the existence of a social value context well demarcate...|$|E
40|$|A summary, as if {{the reader}} mattered "La {{condition}} primordiale d une étymologie rigoureuse : l établissement du sens initial" Emile Benveniste (1938), Les Mages dans l Ancien Iran 					 There is this tendency to if ever challenged to refer to some original sense in a phrase. 	This sense may then be broken down to its main, undivided atomic building block; the word (and surely to even smaller elements). But the word is not logos, it is nomos; it is a name. It becomes logos. It becomes law. 	Now enters this tiny voice, so insistent what if that original sense has been wrongly perceived ? Worse, what {{if it is not}} ? Worst, what if it is less existant than a dream ? A lot of buildings may then be seen to be castles in the air; wonderful, till they fall. They do so every day, all those disasters brought to us by the rumours, mishaps we prefer to treat from a distance. They re so many, they will exhaust any serious listing. 	But what if I am wrong, and that the word actually carries that initial sense (Benveniste) ? In that case, my rather new-kindled interest in the history of vir virtú, vertu, aretē & dygd finds its easy justification (but my project was not from the outset one of taxonomy.) 	One {{does not have to be}} Socrate, Cratylus, Plato or Buddha to work with these questions. One cannot be, one has to do it by oneself. It may be tough in the start, but it becomes not just a necessity it is that serious it may also, curiously, become an art, and a beautiful, joyful one. 	This mémoire treats basic experience. It departs from an uneasiness : How come some works of arts just won t let go of me ? Could their tenacity be explained, not just by their being sublime (Longinus), but by their virtuosity ? What, then, is virtuosity ? 	I would have to do a re-reading : a reading of my readings. Three experiences decided, unanimously, inconsiderate, to be re-read by me : those with Madame de La Fayette (1678), Miles Davis (1958), and Georges Perec (1975). These re-readings of mine turned out to be readings of me; I followed some counsel, and looked into the dusty chamber of an hidden art, etymology. From there, I was sent to the very border of the Indo-European, into truly pre-historic mythos, a primordial sea of knowledge beyond the nostratic (a presumed substratum of language). I was, literally, sent back to Memory. (A mother of mine. Her name is Mnemosyne). What I found shook me, no, that s way too weak, and unprecise. I was clawed. ( [...] .) 	 	What I came close to, is what I am. Ever grateful to great readers and writers Kertesz, Balzac, Felman, Barthes, Bourdieu to mention just a handful I have to say that it is beyond paragate male dominance. Beyond Vir mensura and beyond model thinking, it is parasamgate even beyond that. It is virtuosity itself; the aesthetic, sensual legitimation of dominance. It is of Eros, so poorly understood (I speak for myself, of course). It is violent. 	I spoke of joyful. I will not take from the reader any pleasure, or throe, of reading this mémoire. Therefore I speak of other things, other ways to just about the same core. Like any writing, it beats about the bush : ça tourne autour du pot, as one extraordinarily astute reader told me dryly, over that table (merci). Now and then, I hope, the reader will nevertheless become aware of a strange thing; the pot is right here (right here, write now, cf. Calder 1982, on Burroughs). The reading is that pot, and the reading is magic (which means wonderful, and not understood). This is the writing of my reading. 	So, to resume. There are three main strata of perspective in this work. These angles treat basic experience. The first level is my wonderment towards the effect of art. I ask again, and again, how come (my rendez-vous with) certain fragments stay with me, stay in me and thus seem to have provoked a change of me ? The second level rises from such questioning : could the effect of art be adequately accounted for by my use of a word such as virtuosité ? I would then have to examine that word, thing and notion more closely, and that work takes up about forty percent of this mémoire, rooting up the *wir, vr, etc. The third level is hardly governed by will alone. It is the discovery of my lecture. 	I have come to look upon lecture as far more, and older, than reading. It is something I am born with, but <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> cultivated; I no longer can assume that any litterate person can do a lecture, nor that analphabetism per definition means a life deprived of possibilities. On the contrary, I am on the verge of discovering all the things that can be experienced through a stripping-down of conventional readings. For a great keyword it is, conventional. And what is reading (fr. lecture) ? The etymologist will remind us that the root-sense of that word has to do with collecting and gathering, so there is from the outset this element of choice to it. 	It s most interesting. 	This reading that I m writing, has brought me to Paris for a short semester (2005) and for a few days visit to Poland. In Oświęcim as in Paris I was so privileged, I could walk and walk around, taking pictures and notes fram dawn to dusk and let the History of Europe, and of the IndoEuropean seep into me. In that way I was allowed to combine a pélérinage, with the falcon of Robert Burton as a faithful travelmate, with the study of Georges Perecs W ou le souvenir d enfance. This drawn-out exercice has enabled me to do interpretations of my chosen art-objects in a scope, and to a degree that I could not have imagined from the outset. 	I bring no grand conclusions today. The reader will be able to surmise that this work has a strong flavor of exploration. In that sense it has just barely started. Let me then hasten to say that anyone really can take similar approaches, and explore those mythical limits between subject and object with their own heart as guide. 	I end this with what may be seen as the start. In this work, I have made a lecture. This is the name of that lecture: Madame de La Fayette, Miles Davis, Georges Perec : Virtuosité Lecture de l art, appropriation de la langue I do find it necessary to challenge the idea that reading is well taken care of and I do so, {{as if the}} reader mattered.

40|$|Jane {{is of the}} new {{generation}} of information professionals: open, enthusiastic, committed, demand-responsive. Between workshops at a CTA seminar on farmers organisations, she spoke with Spore about her work, deeds and dreams. Listen in to a chat under a tree. She has just said, intoning it three times, that 'Information is power'. Why is that so important to her? 'When someone has information and knowledge, they have confidence, and the skills to take informed decisions. ' Is she saying that a person is only a full person when they have full confidence, that some people she works with are not full people, not full farmers? In a way, she agrees. Some farmers do not have full confidence, even though they and their predecessors may have been farming for centuries. They have information about practical aspects, of course, but they do not have enough about the market. If you re a farmer and don t know what the market demand is, you may be producing maize very well, according to best farming practices, but there may be no market. And then you lose interest in your maize, because it has lost its value for you. What about the power angle, we wonder? Our work, Jane reflects, is about people having the power and confidence that comes from being informed. Most times people fear to stand up and speak, because they re not so sure whether they are going to say the right thing. If you re informed, then you re confident, you can say the right thing, or ask the right question at the right time. It helps you to be involved. She works in, she is, the information department of her organisation, we remark, so she must have the key {{to a lot of people}} s confidence. To some extent, she admits, I do, to their confidence and their power. I select information, and I am its gateway. In fact, I need more confidence to get more correct information. The other people working in our organisation could be the source, and I need them to appreciate the role of information more. They may be a scientist, agriculturalist, extension worker, or in marketing or credit, and when I ask them for an article, they may feel they have other, more important work. Do people really still think like that, we prompt her, in the 21 st century, in the information age, do some people resist? Not outright, we are assured, not intentionally. The thing is that most people do not appreciate information because it is not tangible, you cannot touch and feel it. An extension worker can tell a farmer about growing maize, about the spacing to use, and she shows the spacing; or about seeds, and she shows the seeds, and the farmer can appreciate. With information, it does not feel so immediate. She leans forward, wanting to sound more positive. Some people do appreciate information, though. Some farmers write into the Farmers Voice (FV) magazine. We joke, in passing, about how readers letters are at the front of her magazine and at the back in Spore, and about which is better. She tells of a farmer in the central region, whom she met at a workshop on effective communication. He told her 'I read an article about a farmer in another part of the country growing passion fruit and oranges, and I thought if my fellow farmer can do it, why not me?' Passion fruit is now his major source of income, and he is better able to survive. What he impressed on his fellow participants in the workshop was to appreciate knowledge, and to always seek it. For him, knowledge changed his life. There was another farmer I wrote about, he didn t know English, so he couldn t read it himself. He was read about even in Denmark, where UNFFE s major donor is. A Danish farmers organisation got interested, and when they sent a film crew to Uganda they visited him. Finally he was given a special course in extension work, because he was seen as a farmer who can pass on knowledge to his fellow farmers. Believe you and me, he has become very confident; when he comes to the office now, he s not the same person I met the first time on his farm. He s blossomed, he ll come and ask for this and that, knowing that he knows what other people want to know. Is everyone special like that farmer, we wonder? Not everyone: some read something, appreciate it and put it into practice, others will not do anything concrete. Is information, we chip in, a lot like seeds falling on fertile or stony ground, as in the Biblical tale? Jane develops the idea: it s not a question of stony ground. The land may well be fertile, but it may need rainfall. Some information may fall on its fertile land but it lacks rain. People s energy can do the same to information as rainfall to a seed. She talks proudly about her organisation s radio shows, its cassette libraries for farmers in six languages. About how each copy of FV is read by four people, how it reaches schools, how she wants to increase circulation above the current ceiling of 2, 000 and finance it with advertising. What has disappointed her? The printed press s scant coverage of agriculture. The attitudes of journalists wanting facilitation and editors putting in news about growing beans, but not bigger issues which affect policy. She fires herself up and talks about holding a workshop for journalists, to win their pens. Does she have a dream, a professional dream? Her eyes glitter more, her hand strokes the air firmly. I want to be in a network, helping get the right information to the farmers. There s a need for a one-stop shop but it hasn t happened yet because people she means investors, support agencies have not appreciated the value of information circulating. But, we all know, they <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> met Jane yet. Confidence personified.

40|$|Foram conduzidos dois experimentos com objetivos de avaliar o uso de ractopamina e fitase sobre o desempenho e características de carcaças de suínos em terminação. No primeiro experimento foram utilizados 354 suínos machos castrados de alto potencial genético e de única origem com peso inicial de 94, 1 ± 5, 7 kg, distribuídos em delineamento {{experimental}} de blocos ao acaso, contemplando seis tratamentos e cinco repetições, sendo quatro contendo doze e uma com onze animais por unidade experimental. Os tratamentos foram: (C) dieta controle baseada em tabela de necessidades nutricionais; (A) idem C com ajuste nutricional para uso de ractopamina; (AF) idem A com fitase sem considerar valores de liberação de cálcio e fósforo fítico pela enzima (valorização); (AR) idem A com ractopamina; (ARF) idem A com ractopamina e fitase sem valorização; e (ARFV) idem A com ractopamina e fitase com valorização. O experimento durou 21 dias e ao final os animais foram abatidos para avaliação de carcaças. Análise dos tratamentos foi avaliada através de contrastes ortogonais. O consumo de ração não foi influenciado pelas dietas. O aumento dos níveis protéico e aminoacídico da dieta piorou desempenho de 14 a 21 dias mas não alterou as carcaças. Houve efeito da ractopamina para ganho de peso e conversão alimentar ao final do período de 21 dias, além do peso pré-abate, peso de carcaça quente, rendimento de carcaça, carne magra total e índice de bonificação. Níveis maiores que a exigência da categoria animal de cálcio e fósforo disponível pela utilização de fitase não apresentaram efeito em dietas contendo ractopamina. Ractopamina melhorou desempenho e características de carcaça. Desempenho e características de carcaça foram mantidos quando se utilizaram valores de liberação de minerais fíticos pela fitase em dietas com ractopamina. No segundo experimento foram utilizados 240 suínos machos castrados com peso inicial de 100, 7 ± 3, 9 kg, distribuídos em arranjo fatorial 2 x 3, com dois níveis de ractopamina (5 e 10 ppm) e três níveis de fitase (0, 500 e 750 UF). O experimento teve duração de três semanas e ao final os animais foram abatidos para avaliação de carcaça. Não houve interação entre os níveis de ractopamina e fitase em nenhuma das variáveis. Peso corporal, consumo diário de ração, perda de peso devido ao transporte e percentual de carne magra não foram influenciados pelos tratamentos. Suínos alimentados com dieta contendo 10 ppm de ractopamina apresentam melhores resultados de ganho de peso, conversão alimentar, peso de carcaça quente, carne magra total, índice de bonificação e receita que aqueles alimentados com 5 ppm. Níveis de fitase não influenciaram desempenho e características de carcaça, exceto rendimento de carcaça em que a inclusão de 500 UF foi superior a dietas sem fitase. Concluiu-se que ractopamina melhorou desempenho e características de carcaça, dietas com ractopamina formuladas com fosfato inorgânico ou fitase com valorização não apresentam diferenças de desempenho e características de carcaça, e dietas com ractopamina contendo fitase com ou sem valorização não influenciam desempenho e características de carcaça, à exceção do índice de bonificação. Dietas com 10 ppm de ractopamina apresentam melhor desempenho e características de carcaça que dietas com 5 ppm, e a substituição de fonte inorgânica por fitase com 500 ou 750 UF não influenciou desempenho e características de carcaças de suínos alimentados com ractopamina. Two {{experiments were}} conducted to evaluate {{the effects of the}} ractopamine and phytase on the performance and carcasses characteristics of finishing pigs. In the first experiment were used 354 barrows with high genetic potential of only one origin and with initial weight of 94, 1 ± 5, 7 kg, in a randomized experimental block design, with six treatments, and five replications, four containing twelve and one with eleven animals for experimental unit. The treatments were: (C) control diet based on tables of nutritional requirements; (A) same C with nutritional adjustment for ractopamine; (AF) same A with phytase without considering values of liberation of phytic calcium and phosphorus by enzyme (valorization); (AR) same A with ractopamine; (ARF) same A wit ractopamine and phytase without valorization; and (ARFV) same A with ractopamine and phytase with valorization. After 21 days the animals were abated for evaluation of carcasses. Analysis of the treatments was realized through orthogonal contrasts. Feed intake was not influenced by the diets. The increase of the proteic and amino acidic levels of the diet harmed performance from 14 to 21 days but it didn't alter the carcasses. There was effect of the ractopamine in average daily gain and feed:gain {{at the end of the}} period of 21 days, besides the pre-slaughter weight, hot carcass weight, carcass yield, total fat-free lean and payment index. Larger levels than the requirements of the animal category of calcium and phosphorus available match by phytase inclusion didn't present effect in diets containing ractopamine. Ractopamine improved performance and carcass characteristics. Performance and carcass characteristics were maintained when values of liberation of phytic minerals were used by the fitase in diets with ractopamine. In the second experiment were used 240 barrows with initial weight of 100, 7 ± 3, 9 kg, distributed in 2 x 3 factorial arrangement, with two ractopamine levels (5 and 10 ppm) and three phytase levels (0, 500 and 750 FU). The experiment had duration of three weeks and at the end the animals were slaughter for carcass evaluation. There was not interaction between ractopamine and phytase levels in none of the variables. Corporal weight, feed intake, farm to slaughter shrink and fat free lean percentile were not influenced by the treatments. Pigs fed with diet containing 10 ppm of ractopamine present better results of daily gain, feed:gain, hot carcass weight, total fat free lean, payment index and revenue that those fed with 5 ppm. Phytase levels didn't influence performance and carcass characteristics, except better carcass yield of 500 UF that without phytase. The conclusion was that ractopamine improved performance and carcass characteristics, diets with ractopamine formulated with inorganic phosphate or fitase with valorization <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> differences in performance and carcass characteristics, diets with ractopamine containing fitase with or without valorization don't influence performance and carcass characteristics, except the payment index. Diets with 10 ppm of ractopamine present better performance and carcass characteristics that diets with 5 ppm, and the substitution of inorganic source for phytase with 500 or 750 UF didn t influence performance and characteristics of carcasses of pigs fed with ractopamine...|$|E
40|$|It s {{thanks to}} his travels that he finally meets up with Spore, which he uses a lot on his farm. We first met on a Roman {{hillside}} in Italy, where he was organising farmers encounters during the World Food Summit. A month later, on another hill, in Brussels, Belgium, {{we caught up with}} him again. He took time out from his course on globalisation to wrap up our interview. He s visibly taken aback at the question: Do you still regard yourself as a young person? 'Sorry to say so, but no. When I look at all the problems affecting youth today, especially in rural areas, I can t call myself young anymore. I am bound to look at myself as an adult, who can do something for young people. I m an adult because I feel I have to help them. If I thought I was still young myself, then I would have to wait to be an adult, and I don t want to wait. ' Has he always been so impatient? He looks back, with a room-size laugh, at 'when it all started. It was on 28 th November 1990 that I came back home to my village, Torba 1, 138 kilometres east of the capital Yaoundé. I had qualifications under the belt, and I was a parish adviser and leader of small group of just six young people. ' So where does youth stop, or is it eternal? 'As far as MIJARC is concerned, at both national and international levels, it is between the ages of 15 and 35. Of course, it varies from culture to culture. Some of our members may even be in their fifties, but we insist that office-holders are between 15 and 35. ' How about being a farmer, how do you see yourself there? He pounces back, as if being a farmer is eternal. 'Oh yes, not a shadow of doubt. I am a farmer, I shall forever be a farmer, even if I end up doing something else. Right now on my farm, we are harvesting our field of groundnuts. My wife and I have five hectares. ' He looks a tad forlorn about being away from home. 'I m not so sure she copes on her own like that. When I m in the country, I go home every weekend to work with her. And when I m away, I pay for someone to help her, to stand in for me. ' 'I have always been focused on farming. My life-long project is centred on agriculture. Nothing will please me more than if things work out well with my farm; I shall stop all the other things that I do. It s where I can do the most for my family and for others, where I can be sure to raise my family well. And it can serve as a statement for people who follow me. I shall be able to say Listen here, you d be better off trying this seed or that one. The thing is that young people don t know how to choose seeds; they re full of goodwill but a bit short on experience. When I started I didn t have any experience either. That s what I would like to put right. I want to make a practical statement. ' Statements are important to you, right? 'Very. They re what attracts people s attention, especially young kids. We should not be sitting around, not when they are wanting to get on with their lives. They can do a lot, they re full of potential, they need the chance, to build up their confidence. I also want to make a statement to those adults who could be doing something, but aren t, for young people; I want to get them to work too. ' All well and good, but isn t it the case that young people in the village have absolutely no choice but to stay? 'Absolutely, none at all. It s impossible to get a job in town; there s next to no recruitment going on, and, you know, even when a young man has got qualifications, he ll most likely have a wife and children too, so how can you expect him to live in the city? They ll stay at home, in the village. But to survive there, they ll be needing some knowledge. ' So being a farmer is just something you have to do? His eyes flash, we ve touched a raw nerve here. 'Listen, listen good. Being a farmer is a matter of pride, you have to be proud of being a farmer. Some of the kids in the village say that they ended up there by accident. They really wanted a good job in town, or in Europe or America. That s not the attitude to take. The education system has taught them to think like that. We ll only get our pride if we change the content of education. ' 'But there are other barriers too. Top of the list is the traditional one about having access to land. You may have the skills you need but you won t get very far if you <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> got the land The second issue is about being able to invest. As well as skills, you need to have real money to start off with. And then young people don t have any collateral, can t get a guarantee, and so they won t get any loans from the banks. That s really disappointing for them. ' He s gone almost sullen. Let s talk about change, what should be changed? 'We need to have a thorough review of our rural advisory services, and liberalise their management. Then we need to appoint advisors and workers with a specific focus on youth. If we stick to a service full of generalists, we re going to make all sorts of compromises to try to keep everyone happy. At the end of the day, it s the young person who s going to be left to fend for himself. If, on the other hand, we have a focused set-up, we can devote the proper attention to young people, with lots of energy and commitment, and then things will move. ' It sounds rather similar to the positive discrimination towards women that got some things rolling, gender-wise, 20 years ago. 'That s right. We should be talking of women-focused strategies in the same breath as youth-focused ones. We should even bring in child-focused issues. That should be the priority today because it helps to define the world of tomorrow. ' How about CTA, do you see it as a partner for young people? 'Easy. CTA has an important role to play in shaping attitudes, through training, as well as an information task. So it should be joining in those efforts which aim to help young people to better understand agriculture, to love it, and to get into it.

40|$|Uskonnollisissa yhteisöissä pidetään yleensä itsestään selvänä, että Raamattu puhuttelee lukijaansa. Tässä tutkimuksessa analysoidaan autenttisia raamatuntutkimistilanteita, adventistien raamatuntutkisteluja, ja eksplikoitu niitä keinoja, joilla tutkistelujen osallistujat löytävät Raamatusta kertomuksista niiden puhuttelevuuden. Ensisijaisena metodina on etnometodologinen keskustelunanalyysi, joka perustuu vuorovaikutuksen yksityiskohtaiseen analyysiin. Raamatuntutkistelu on institutionaalinen tilanne, jossa osallistujat lukevat Raamatun tekstejä, keskustelevat Raamatussa kerrotuista tapahtumista ja pyrkivät soveltamaan niitä omaan elämäänsä. Tutkimuksessa havaittiin, että Raamatun puhuttelevuutta rakennetaan sekä silloin, kun puhutaan Raamatun kertomuksista, että silloin, kun puhutaan osallistujien elämästä. Päähuomio kohdistuu siihen, miten osallistujat puhuvat Raamatun tapahtumista. Ensinnäkin he kiinnittävät kertomuksissa huomioita seikkoihin, jotka ovat heille potentiaalisesti relevantteja. Toiseksi he tekevät päätelmiä kertomusten henkilöiden tunteista, motiiveista, henkilökohtaisista ominaisuuksista ja tapahtumien olosuhteista. Kolmanneksi he tekevät yleistyksiä, esittävät kertomuksen henkilöt, heidän toimintansa, sanansa tms. yleisempien kategorioiden edustajina. Neljänneksi he käyttävät Raamatun kertomuksista puhuessaan oman elämänsä kannalta relevantteja sanoja ja ilmauksia. Omista kokemuksistaan puhuessaan raamatuntutkistelun osallistujat tekevät niistä samanlaisia kuin Raamatun henkilöiden kokemuksista. He nimeävät niitä samoin kuin Raamatun henkilöiden kokemuksia, käyttävät Raamatusta lainattuja sanoja niitä kuvatessaan, ja esittävät itsensä samanlaisissa rooleissa kuin Raamatun henkilöt. Raamatuntutkistelussa keskustelua ohjailee opettaja, ja vuorovaikutus perustuu pitkälti opettajan kysymyksiin ja tutkistelijoiden vastauksiin. Opettajan ja osallistujan mahdollisuudet osallistua keskusteluun ovatkin yhtäältä epäsymmetriset, toisaalta puhuttelevuuden löytäminen Raamatun teksteistä on kuitenkin yhteistyötä, johon sekä opettaja että tutkistelijat osallistuvat. Tutkimus on ensisijaisesti analyysi yhdestä erityisestä institutionaalisesta tilanteesta ja uskonnollisesta toiminnasta, mutta tuloksia pohditaan myös yleisempien kysymysten kannalta. Näitä ovat maallikkoeksegetiikan ja tieteellisen eksegetiikan välinen suhde, teksteistä puhuminen, opettamisen konventiot, vuorovaikutuksen ja kieliopin välinen suhde sekä kulttuuristen resurssien käyttö vuorovaikutuksessa. The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to describe}} the Seventh-day Adventist Bible study as situated action. The methodology is based on ethnomethodological conversation analysis. The data consists of audio-recordings of Bible study interaction in Tampere, Finland. The Bible study in an institution {{with a history of}} almost 150 years, and {{it is part of the}} weekly worship service in the Seventh-day Adventist church. It is based on an international study book that includes the texts that should be studied and some comments on them. It is chaired by a pre-assigned teacher. These teachers are often lay people, but they are in charge of the interaction in the Bible study. The interaction consists mainly of the reading of Bible texts, teachers monologues and question­answer­comment sequences. The turn-taking is close to that of formal classroom interaction. It is common sense in most Christian circles that the Bible speaks to the one who studies it. This study is about how this speaking is accomplished, how the participants of the Bible study make Bible stories relevant to themselves so that the Bible can speak to them. They usually do it in two phases that alternate with each other during the Bible study. First they discuss the Bible story. In this phase they implicitly apply the story to their own life in various ways. In the second phase they explicitly talk about their own life world: about personal experience, about the state of the church or the surrounding world etc. The main focus of the study is on the first phase, the implicit application of the story. Four different ways the participants use to make the Bible story speak to them have been analyzed. First, they draw attention to those aspects of the story that are potentially relevant to them. They can draw attention to a single word or expression, to an activity in the story or to recurrent tendencies in a longer stretch of the story. Second, the participants make inferences. They infer the feelings, motives, character traits etc. of the characters of the story, or causes and effects of events in the story. They place the events and the actions of the characters in a network of conventional causality. Thus they breath real life into the stories and make them relevant to themselves: even though they <b>haven</b> <b>t</b> experienced the events of the story, they might have had similar conventional feelings, motives or character traits, or events in their lives might have had similar conventional causes and effects. Third, the participants decontextualize the stories, for example by using the present tense instead of the past tense of the original story. When the story is decontextualized, the whole story or an aspect of it is made into an example of a type or a category. A character in the story can be made into an example of certain type of a person, an action in the story can be made into an example of a type of an action, words uttered in the story can be generalized so that the group of recipients is understood to be wider than in the original story. A whole event can also be made into an instance of a general type of an event. Thus the story is made relevant to the participants, if they can recognize persons, actions or events belonging to the same type in their own lives, or if they can understand themselves as recipients of words uttered in the story. Fourth, the participants use recontextualizing words and expressions when they talk about the events of the Bible story. These words and expressions are not mentioned in the Bible and they are recognizably foreign to the biblical context. Instead they point to the world of the participants, either to the secular world or the religious world. Thus, while explicitly speaking about the Bible story, they implicitly talk about their own world. In the second phase, when the participants, particularly the teacher, explicitly talk about their own world, they often make use of the ways they have talked about the Bible stories. The clearest examples of this are cases where the participants circulate the same expression when talking about the Bible story and their own world. In one example the teacher has talked about how the identity of the Israelites is lost; later he asks the participants to characterize the identity of their own church. Some sequences where the Bible stories are applied to the life of the participants have been analyzed in more detail. In these instances the teacher asks the participants to talk about their personal experiences in the context of the Bible story. In these sequences the participants answer the questions accordingly and make their experiences similar to the experiences of the biblical characters. They name their experiences according to the Bible story, as interpreted in the teacher s question, they use biblical words and expressions to describe their experiences, and they present themselves in similar roles as the characters of the Bible story. This means also that they make their experiences sharable. In their comments the teachers confirm the sharability of the experience. The participants thus orient to the relevance of the Bible story to them, to the story speaking to them, both when they talk about the Bible story and when they talk about their own lives. They talk about the Bible story in the context of their lives and about their lives in the context of the Bible story. Finding how the Bible can speak to them is a joint accomplishment of the participants. This becomes especially clear in the analysis of question­answer­comment sequences. When the teacher orients to the relevance of the story to the participants in her/his question, the answerer must display her/his understanding of the implications of the question. And in the comment the teacher has a possibility to evaluate the success of the answer. The study brings into focus the use of cultural resources, both by the participants and by the researcher. The use of cultural knowledge is especially recognizable in a context such as the Seventh-day Adventist Bible study that is situated within a partly isolated subculture. The participants draw on many secular cultural resources that can be understood by any member of the Finnish culture, but in some cases understanding the interaction is dependent on knowledge specific to the subculture. It is important to note, however, that cultural resources are used in a situated way. When a participant, for example, answers a question, it is not enough for her/him to produce a culturally right answer, he/she must produce a sequentially right answer. The main aim of the study is to describe the interaction in one specific institutional situation, but it has implications for many other issues. It is an analysis of a type of lay exegesis, and the results could be of use in discussions between lay people and professional Bible scholars. It is also relevant in discussions about the relationship of text and talk, as the Bible study is an example of a situation where the participants discuss the meaning of a text. It is also a type of a teaching situation, which can be compared with other teaching situations. It is especially interesting to see how the teacher handles the participants experiences. Some sections of the study concern the use of grammatical forms such as particles and adverbs, and the results offer some insights about the relationship between grammar and interaction. And finally, the study invites the possibility of a conversation analytic treatment of various kind of religious practices...|$|E
