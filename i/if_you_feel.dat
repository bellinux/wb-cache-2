500|$|Although Minogue {{mentioned}} that [...] "Better than Today" [...] {{would be the}} last single to be released from Aphrodite, [...] "Put Your Hands Up (<b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Feel</b> Love)" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from the album, on 29 May 2011. The single managed to reach the top 50 in Australia, peaking at number 50 on the singles chart. It peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart, thus becoming the fourth single from Aphrodite to peak atop the chart. No official music video for the single was commissioned, although a lyric video for a remixed version of the song by Pete Hammond was released.|$|E

500|$|Her {{interest}} in acting sparked from watching her brother perform {{in a school}} production of The King and I when she was six. During rehearsals, she pleaded with his teachers to let her be in the play. They let her join the chorus. While enrolled in Woldingham School as a teen, she was heavily involved in theatre. She was the student head of the drama department there, performing in plays and musicals, conducting workshops with younger students, and helping put on productions. When she was 16, she attended a production of HenryV starring Kenneth Branagh. His performance emboldened her and reinforced her belief {{that she wanted to}} pursue a career in acting. She wrote a letter to Branagh asking him for advice. [...] "I explained that my parents didn't want me to act, but that I felt it was my vocation in life," [...] she said. Branagh's sister replied: [...] "Kenneth says that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> such a strong need to be an actress, you must be an actress." ...|$|E

500|$|Four singles were {{released}} from Aphrodite. Its lead single [...] "All the Lovers" [...] was a commercial success, peaking at number {{three in the}} United Kingdom and reaching the top ten in numerous countries like France, Italy, Scotland and Spain. In Australia, it narrowly missed the top ten by peaking at number 13 on the singles chart. [...] "Get Outta My Way" [...] was released as the second single and reached the top 20 in the United Kingdom, but underperformed in Australia after failing to peak inside the top 50. Similarly, the third single [...] "Better than Today" [...] missed the top 50 in Australia, and additionally missed the top 20 in the United Kingdom. In response to their poor chart performances, Minogue expressed disappointment in her label and stated that no further singles would be released. Despite this statement, [...] "Put Your Hands Up (<b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Feel</b> Love)" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from Aphrodite and peaked at number 50 in Australia. In the United States, all four singles released from the album peaked atop the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. To further promote the album, Minogue embarked on the successful [...] in 2011.|$|E
500|$|The relegation of fighter {{units to}} what {{appeared}} to be strategically unimportant ground attack missions led to a crisis in morale that precipitated the so-called [...] "Morotai Mutiny" [...] in April 1945, when eight of Cobby's senior pilots, including Australia's leading ace in the war, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, tendered their resignations in protest. Although one of the [...] "mutineers", Group Captain Wilf Arthur, had earlier voiced his concerns to Cobby and his headquarters staff regarding the efficacy of 1st TAF's tasking, the AOC was taken aback by the resignations. He spoke to the officers individually and as a group, asking them, [...] "Is this something against me, or having a go against me in this, because if so, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that I have fallen down in my job, I will straight away ask to be recalled," [...] to which they replied, [...] "It {{has nothing to do with}} you." [...] Cobby reported the incident to his immediate superior, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, who informed the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, and the Allied Air Forces Commander, Lieutenant General George Kenney. All made their way to Morotai and interviewed the pilots involved, and all concluded that Cobby should be relieved of his command.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was filmed in Los Angeles and {{directed}} by Wendy Morgan, who Roberts described as [...] "focused and passionate". The singer continued to say that because of this, she felt comfortable with her immediately. The music video and production was featured on the Through Nicola's Eyes webisodes, in which Roberts stated that she found {{the production of the}} music video very stressful. Talking about the experience in an interview with MTV News, Roberts stated that [...] "I'm nervous and I'm dreading the night before... I know I'm going to be like losing half a stone in weight overnight, so I'm {{going to have to get}} myself into the zone." [...] Roberts attributed her stress on the set of the video to her time with Girls Aloud, as she had always recorded music videos with four other members; this was the first time she had performed on her own. This meant that critical responses would only be aimed only at her. During the video shoot, Roberts further discussed the anxiety of a solo career claiming pressure from Morgan was making her feel uncomfortable. During the production, Roberts feared that feeling uncomfortable whilst shooting could have an overall negative effect on the video, explaining [...] "You've got to be strong and be professional and get through it, obviously enjoy it, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable, you can't look uncomfortable otherwise it's not going to work".|$|E

500|$|Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters {{found the}} finale to be [...] "breathlessly paced". However, the writer was also {{dissatisfied}} with the cliffhanger, and hoped that the second season would not increase the series' focus on Veronica's relationships. Hassenger wrote, [...] "so far, the series has eschewed the relationship angst so common in other teen-centric shows; Neptune hearts get broken, yes, but the show never stoops to that will-they-or-won't-they dynamic. Veronica is that rare television character who's too interesting for love triangles." [...] Filip Vukcevic of IGN thought that while {{the resolution of the}} murder was satisfying, it could have been better; [...] "I liked the way everything played out, but I didn't get the Sixth Sense moment I was hoping for. I wanted the season finale to blow my mind, instead all it got out of me was, 'Ah, I see. That's cool.'" [...] Vukcevic wrote that the pace of the season increased exponentially, and was at its best during the final episode. Both reviewers praised Rob Thomas's use of red herrings. Vukcevic felt that [...] "as the finale approaches you are led to believe that the murderer could be any one of several different people - not any easy thing to pull off convincingly. What makes good TV is audience participation. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> for a character or are puzzling out a mystery, you're involved. And when you're involved, you're having a good time." [...] Hassenger cited Lianne, Duncan and Logan as the main red herrings.|$|E
500|$|Billed by {{her record}} label Parlophone as her {{comeback}} album, Aphrodite {{is a celebration}} of Minogue's [...] "dance-floor roots", and is primarily a dance-pop and disco album. Its title alludes to the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. [...] "All the Lovers", {{one of the last}} tracks to be recorded for the album, is a [...] "squiggly" [...] electropop-influenced disco song written by Jim Eliot and Mima Stilwell, who had previously collaborated with Minogue on [...] "2 Hearts", the lead single from X. It is similar to Minogue's 2004 single [...] "I Believe in You", but has a [...] "more danceable edge", and features a [...] "gauzy, heartbeat rhythm" [...] and 1980s-stylised synthesiser riffs. The song was met with critical acclaim from music critics and was frequently commended for its production and chorus. The second track [...] "Get Outta My Way" [...] combines electronic music and bubblegum pop with disco elements. The song focuses on a [...] "frustrated and furious" [...] Minogue delivering [...] "wispy" [...] vocals in a form of a warning to her uncaring partner, indicating that she may leave him and start [...] "grinding away with another chap". Its lyrical content is suggestive in nature. The song received generally favourable reviews from music critics and was complimented for its musical composition and subject matter. [...] "Put Your Hands Up (<b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Feel</b> Love)" [...] is a hi-NRG-influenced club song. Receiving mixed critical reviews, its lyrics were criticised for being clichéd although one critic named it a [...] "concert hit waiting to happen." [...] "Closer" [...] takes a darker and more atmospheric approach, featuring [...] "sighing background vocals and spiralling harpsichord-esque synths." [...] Critics felt {{that it was one of}} the more interesting and experimental songs of the album.|$|E
2500|$|Manson has {{commented on}} the subject of children, saying that she [...] "just missed the whole baby calling.

2500|$|Eric Zorn, {{writing for}} the Chicago Tribune, criticized Encinia for his {{handling}} of the traffic stop, calling him a [...] "petty tyrant" [...] and referring to his [...] "Are you done?" [...] as [...] "snippy condescension familiar to anyone experienced in the bickering arts". However, he also said Bland was unnecessarily argumentative. [...] "...ou must always defer meekly to the police. Even when they're acting like bullies, goading you or issuing you preposterous orders like to put out your cigarette as you sit in your own car, don't challenge their authority....Comply.

2500|$|In 2014, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer {{criticized the}} Health Department as “weak” in {{investigating}} and fixing residents' rat complaints. From fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2013, pest complaints, including rat problems, increased 10 {{percent in the}} city, and 24 {{percent of the time}} Health Department workers failed to inspect the complaints in the 10-day target period, an audit by the comptroller found.

2500|$|Jon Nelson {{also has}} criticized Morey for {{incorrect}} quotes. Nelson {{notes that in}} Morey's The New Atheism (1986) he quoted Nicholas Capaldi's book The Art of Deception {{as an example of}} atheist deception, but the [...] "problem is that Capaldi never says this (or anything like it) on this or on any other page. Morey has numerous other false quotes attributed to Capaldi, such as: 'Refuse to be convinced. Even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that he has a good argument and that your case is weaker, refuse to be convinced of your opponent's case'. Nowhere does Capaldi advocate, as Morey accuses him of doing, that atheists should 'use any invalid or deceptive argument as long as it helps him (to) win his case.'" [...] Nelson goes on to say that, [...] "However, Morey has an 'out'. There are no actual quotation marks on these alleged quotes." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Linda was {{a joy to}} work with. I {{remember}} we were doing a tracking shot, a camera car on tracks running about one hundred yards down this field. Linda and I were on this horse with no saddle, no reins, just the mane. If anybody fell, that camera truck is there to roll under. It was a very dodgey scene. You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club. Just hang on and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> you can't do it, just don't do it. It's risky. There's no question about it, it's not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell.' But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead and we did it. I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,'You're crazy. I wouldn't have done that. It's too dangerous.' And he's probably right. I thought it was very foolish to have done it. Anyway, Linda was a gutsy little gal and she did it. So she was very pleasant to work with and very nice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matilda told Maud {{she refused}} to [...] "have my {{daughter}} be a darned fool and marry an actor". [...] Maud retorted, [...] "All right, mother, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> that way about it, good bye." [...] After her mother requested clarification, she said, [...] "I'm going to marry Frank, so, naturally you don't want a darned fool around the house." [...] Upon recognizing that Maud would marry Frank {{whether or not she}} supported her, Matilda laughed and acquiesced. [...] On November 9, 1882, Maud and Frank were married by W. H. Hawley, the minister of Fayetteville Baptist Church. [...] The wedding ceremony was held in the parlor of Matilda's home, which was packed with people. [...] Many relatives and friends of Matilda attended the wedding, including Maud's three sisters and women's rights activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her husband Henry Stanton. [...] Frank's parents, Benjamin and Cynthia, and his sisters, Hattie and Mattie, also attended the wedding. [...] The parlor was so crowded that the hired string quartet had to play upstairs. [...] The local paper praised the marriage ceremony as [...] "one of equality". [...] Whereas most marriages of the era had the bride's wedding vows include a pledge to obey her husband, the local paper said [...] "the promises required of the bride [...] precisely the same as those required of the groom". [...] The couple honeymooned in Saratoga Springs, New York, whereupon they passed Thanksgiving with their relatives.|$|E
