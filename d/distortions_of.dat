5|$|Gravitational waves, {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of Einstein's theory, are <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> geometry that propagate {{at the speed}} of light, and {{can be thought of as}} ripples in spacetime.

5|$|Although {{the filmmakers}} put {{considerable}} effort into historical accuracy, particularly in details, {{the film is}} known for some key <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> history. An entirely fictional sequence was added in which Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack; anti-aircraft shells are shown bursting around the Enola Gay on its bombing run over Hiroshima; and {{it is said that}} leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima for ten days in advance of the mission warning the citizens of the forthcoming raid. The film received generally mixed reviews, and was a box office disappointment.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{a mixture}} of sand and cement {{was applied to the}} {{external}} faces of the mosque with the intention of protecting the mosque from wind and rain damage. However, this treatment resulted in substantial damage to the building as moisture became trapped in the walls built of mud and started a deterioration process of the structure, with termites infesting the wooden supports under humid conditions. This resulted in part of the mosque collapsing and during the repair work it caused some <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> the structural elements and the exterior of the mosque.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ultralow {{frequency}} vibration tables {{can easily}} be imposed external interferences when they work. These interferences result to <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> the output and can reduce the calibration precision. Closed-loop negative feedback method was put forward to reduce the output <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> an ultralow frequency vibration table. Firstly, we analyzed its structure and principle. Also the reasons <b>of</b> the output <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> the system was analyzed. The new system was based on DSP unit. And the system is more flexible, higher running speed and better interference immunity. Experiments show that the <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> the new system can be effectively improved based on negative feedback method...|$|R

Furthermore, we also provide accurate approximations for the quadratic <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> CDE-SD and CDE-PD. Numerical simulations support our proposed analytical expressions.|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} psychoactive {{drugs and alcohol}} have notable effects on consciousness. These range from a simple dulling of {{awareness}} produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, Dimethyltryptamine, and others in this group can produce major <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol, but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.|$|E
5|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{are typical}} of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|E
5|$|Photography was {{provided}} by Willy Hameister, {{who went on to}} work with Wiene on several other films. The camera does not play a large part in Caligari, and is used primarily to show the sets. The cinematography tends to alternate only between medium shots at straight-on angles and abrupt close-ups {{to create a sense of}} shock, but with few long shots or panning movement. Likewise, there is very little interscene editing. Most scenes follow the other without intercutting, which gives Caligari a more theatrical feel than a cinematic one. Heavy lighting is typically absent from the film, heightening the sense of darkness prevalent in the story. However, lighting is occasionally used to intensify the uneasiness created by the <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> the sets. For example, when Cesare first awakens at the fair, a light is shone directly on a close-up of his heavily made-up face to create an unsettling glow. Additionally, lighting is used in a then-innovative way to cast a shadow against the wall during the scene in which Cesare kills Alan, so the viewer sees only the shadow and not the figures themselves. Lighting techniques like this became frequently used in later German films.|$|E

25|$|Like {{electromagnetic}} waves, {{gravitational waves}} should exhibit shifting of wavelength {{due to the}} relative velocities of the source and observer, but also due to <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> space-time, such as cosmic expansion. This is the case even though gravity itself is a cause of <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> space-time. Redshifting of gravitational waves is different from redshifting due to gravity.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> the rhombicub{{octahedron}} that, {{while some}} of the faces are not regular polygons, are still vertex-uniform. Some of these can be made by taking a cube or octahedron and cutting off the edges, then trimming the corners, so the resulting polyhedron has six square and twelve rectangular faces. These have octahedral symmetry and form a continuous series between the cube and the octahedron, analogous to the <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> the rhombicosidodecahedron or the tetrahedral <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> the cuboctahedron. However, the rhombicuboctahedron also has a second set of distortions with six rectangular and sixteen trapezoidal faces, which do not have octahedral symmetry but rather Th symmetry, so they are invariant under the same rotations as the tetrahedron but different reflections.|$|E

25|$|Galaxy {{clusters}} {{are among}} the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe, surpassed only by superclusters, with approximately 80% of cluster content {{in the form of}} dark matter. The gravitational fields of these clusters deflect light-rays traveling near them. As seen from Earth, this effect can cause dramatic <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> a background source object detectable by eye such as multiple images, arcs, and rings (cluster strong lensing). More generally, the effect causes small, but statistically coherent, <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> background sources on the order of 10% (cluster weak lensing). Abell 1689, CL0024+17, and the Bullet Cluster {{are among the}} most prominent examples of lensing clusters.|$|E
25|$|Weak {{gravitational}} lensing investigates minute <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> galaxies, using {{statistical analyses}} from vast galaxy surveys.

40|$|The Jahn-Teller <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> {{crystals}} {{has been}} discussed mainly on the statistical viewpoint. In this paper, the author attempts to deal with problems in another aspect, and three problems are adopted to this purpose. The first is the <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> a mixed crystal: nickel-copper chromite system which cannot be understood by a simple statistics. Next article concerns with an effect <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> on a magnetic property of nickel rhodite, in which the triple degeneracy of the ground state is removed by the Jahn-Teller effect. The last problem is the Jahn-Teller <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> vanadium metal, which {{is thought to be}} a typical example of the Jahn-Teller type distortion due to band electrons...|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, Houk’s {{examination}} <b>of</b> <b>distortion</b> energies {{finds that}} nearly all <b>of</b> the <b>distortion</b> energy (92%) arises from the <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> the 1,3 dipole rather than the cyclooctyne, which has a pre-distorted ground state geometry which increases its reactivity. Fluorination decreases the distortion energy by allowing the transition state to be achieved with a lesser <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> the 1,3-dipole during reaction, resulting in a larger dipole angle.|$|R

25|$|Symptoms from {{complete}} isolation, called sensory deprivation, often include anxiety, sensory illusions, or even <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> time and perception. However, {{this is the}} case when there is no stimulation of the sensory systems at all, and not only lack of contact with people. Thus, by having other things to keep one's mind busy, this is avoided.|$|E
25|$|The JTE {{is usually}} {{associated}} with degeneracies that are well localised in space, like those occurring in a small molecule or associated to an isolated transition metal complex. However, in many periodic high-symmetry solid-state systems, like perovskites, some crystalline sites allow for electronic degeneracy giving rise under adequate compositions to lattices of JT-active centers. This can produce a cooperative JTE, where global <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> the crystal occur due to local degeneracies.|$|E
