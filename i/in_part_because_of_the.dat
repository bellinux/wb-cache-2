5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying Silverthrone's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions. But this would likely be abandoned <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcano's remoteness.|$|E

5|$|Various {{authors have}} {{proposed}} slightly different {{analyses of the}} Khmer vowel system. This may be <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wide degree of variation in pronunciation between individual speakers, even within a dialectal region. The description below follows Huffman (1970). The number of vowel nuclei and their values vary between dialects; differences exist even between the Standard Khmer system {{and that of the}} Battambang dialect on which the standard is based.|$|E

50|$|In 1810, the new University of Berlin was set up, {{designed}} along lines {{put forward}} by Wilhelm von Humboldt. Fichte was made its rector and also the first Chair of Philosophy.

500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> the Wood Memorial results, Secretariat's {{chances in}} the Kentucky Derby became {{the subject of}} much {{speculation}} in the media. Some questioned his stamina: <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his [...] "blocky" [...] build, more typical of a sprinter, and <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Bold Ruler's reputation as a sire of precocious sprinters.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took {{matters into their own hands}} by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. <b>In</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with acrylic glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the board}} (and card) game domain, 4X {{is less of}} a {{distinct}} genre, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practical constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non-player entities, it tends to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games.|$|E
5|$|Often <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{threat of}} hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse {{population}} between major ports until {{the advent of}} automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely {{limit the number of}} intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect.|$|E

The runways were not well-leveled, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> poor workmanship and <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> soft soil. The area had poor lift and was often covered in fog, {{and the area}} experienced difficult wind conditions and air pockets. Hard landings and runway overruns were commonplace.|$|R

In fact, {{were it not for the}} book's title, it undoubtedly would be read more often than it is currently. At one time, it was one of Conrad's most frequently read books. <b>In</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its brevity, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its adventure qualities, and <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its literary qualities, the novel used to attract a good deal of attention." ...|$|R

5|$|Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character was {{published}} in late 1981 and received reviews less enthusiastic than any of her earlier books. Writing in The New Republic, Godfrey Hodgson questioned both her psychoanalytic approach and her motives: “e {{are in danger of}} having the insights of psychotherapy used as a tool for character destruction, certainly for libel, potentially for revenge.” Sales of the book were disappointing, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reviews, in part because memoirs by Nixon associates such as Henry Kissinger, John Ehrlichman, and John Dean had recently flooded the market. Perhaps Brodie’s book was most influential in stimulating Oliver Stone to create his controversial 1995 movie Nixon.|$|E
5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E
5|$|The TRC {{concluded}} {{that it may be}} impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.|$|E

5|$|The new stand {{became a}} {{financial}} burden for the club. Operating costs increased after Norwegian clubs {{were allowed to}} wage players from 1984. In addition, interest rates rose quickly, making the club unable to meet its financial obligations. At the same time, the club experienced falling attendance. In 1985, the club's auditor warned that the club was heading into financial distress. In 1986, the club spent NOK1 million to build terraces between the club house and the pitch on the northern short side, and terraces on the southern short side. In 1990, Hamar Municipality gave Ham-Kam a grant of NOK1.7 million {{in an attempt to}} save the club's finances, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's debt on the venue.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, at least <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering {{in the air with}} rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E
5|$|As the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of {{decreased}} {{involvement with}} his firm. The staff {{had begun to}} shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set {{to work on his}} last major project as active partner: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of high culture as the Louvre and US National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to low culture. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. As in the past, Pei accepted the commission <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unique challenge it presented.|$|E
50|$|Between 1817 and 1825, Ranke {{worked as}} a {{schoolmaster}} teaching classics at the Friedrichs Gymnasium in Frankfurt an der Oder.

5|$|By 1944, {{by which}} time Norway was {{occupied}} by Germany {{as part of the}} Second World War, overhead wire had been installed on the Flåm Line. The locomotives at Thune and nearly completed, except for the transformers, which were at Per Kure. This was during the height of resistance sabotage, and workers at Per Kure had joined the communist resistance group Osvald. Because of the Allied bombing of Germany, Per Kure was thought to become part of a decentralized production chain and would be set to assemble aircraft engines. Osvald considered the plant a legitimate target and on 30 May 1944, the factory was blown up and the transformers severely damaged. Reconstruction of them took considerable time, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general lack of materials, and in part because the head engineer for the project disappeared during late 1944. In 1945, all three locomotives were sent to Myrdal Station for storage until the transformers were finished.|$|E
5|$|By 1993, Romney {{had begun}} {{thinking}} about entering politics, partly based upon Ann's urging and partly {{to follow in}} his father's footsteps. He decided to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, who was seeking re-election for the sixth time. Political pundits viewed Kennedy as vulnerable that year– <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unpopularity of the Democratic Congress as a whole, {{and in part because}} this was Kennedy's first election since the William Kennedy Smith trial in Florida, in which the senator's reputation for character had suffered. Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994. In addition to his leave from Bain Capital, Romney also stepped down from his church leadership role in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Callaway {{said he was}} {{surprised}} by UPN's cancellation of Mercy Point because of their strong support of the show. He felt {{the decision was made}} <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's high production costs. He also concluded that the decision to broadcast the pilot {{at the same time as}} the World Series resulted in the loss of Mercy Points target audience. To better connect with UPN's teen viewers, Callaway shifted the show's focus from medical and ethical cases to the characters' relationships. Despite these revisions, he said that UPN executives preferred to air shows like Moesha over science-fiction programs. When UPN announced the show's cancellation, the eighth episode was in the middle of production. Scenes originally written for the episode were revised and edited into the seventh episode to form a complete series finale.|$|E
