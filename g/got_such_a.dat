5|$|Dickinson played pubs with Shots on {{a regular}} basis to small audiences. One {{particular}} night, Dickinson suddenly stopped {{in the middle of a}} song and started interviewing a man in the audience, heckling for not paying enough attention. He <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> good response he started doing it every night until it became a regular routine used to catch the audience's attention. Dickinson states that this experience taught him how to be a frontman.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory against}} the British invasions brought forth great changes in the {{politics}} of Buenos Aires. The viceroy Sobremonte was discredited by his management of the conflict, and the Cabildo increased its influence; as such, it removed the viceroy and appointed Liniers as replacement, an unprecedented action. The local criollos, who had limited chances of social promotion in the system of castas, <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> chance with the increased influence of the militias. Cornelio Saavedra, head of the biggest crioolo militia, thus became a highly influential man {{in the politics of}} Buenos Aires. He resented the weak support from the Spanish monarchy to the war effort, compared with the strong one received from the cabildos of other cities in the Americas. As a result, he was loyal to the new viceroy, of French ancestry, considering him to be less subject to the internal disputes of the House of Bourbon.|$|E
25|$|During {{the month}} of June 1813, Wellington's army {{repeatedly}} turned the French army's north flank, compelling Joseph to order a long retreat. During the withdrawal, three of Reille's divisions joined Joseph, but the location of Clausel's soldiers remained a mystery. On 18 June, Reille's three divisions blundered {{into the path of}} Wellington's advance at the Battle of San Millan-Osma. Two divisions avoided serious losses, but Maucune's division <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> drubbing that Joseph thought it was only fit to guard the army's wagon train. Wellington's advance was so rapid that the French never had time to fully concentrate their forces. Late on 19 June, Joseph's army reached Vitoria where it waited vainly for Clausel to join it. On 21 June, Wellington with 88,276 Allies with 90 guns attacked Joseph's 46,000 infantry, 9,000 cavalry and 2,300 gunners in the Battle of Vitoria. The Allies sustained losses of 4,927 men, including 850 killed, 4,035 wounded and 42 captured. The French suffered 8,008 casualties, including 756 killed, 4,414 wounded and 3,215 captured and missing. The French also lost 151 guns, 415 caissons, 25 million francs and vast amounts of loot plundered from Spain.|$|E

Simmons, {{the first to}} release a freestyle over the track told Vibe, “With that freestyle, I heard the track, loved it, then got the instrumental from {{a friend of mine}} and just did it on the whim. It wasn’t really anything I planned. I wasn’t even ready for this to be a big thing because I’ve had tracks out before. I put my all into everything, but sometimes some tracks come out better than others. It <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> big buzz maybe because it came out the day after and people enjoyed it.” ...|$|E
500|$|Bart's House of Weirdness was {{developed}} by Distinctive Software and published by Konami. It was announced by Konami at the June 1991 International Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was released in 1992 solely for the DOS platform, and was available for both Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) and Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), but not Video Graphics Array (VGA). Writers for UGO Networks have commented {{that the fact that}} Bart's House of Weirdness was released exclusively for DOS [...] "more than likely tells why its critical acclaim is zilch and fan support non-existent. It's surprising it <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> limited release, seeing it was published by Konami, who usually have no problem distributing games on a variety of platforms." [...] Similarly, a 1UP.com editor wrote that the game is [...] "unknown (there's not even a single video of it on YouTube)" [...] and that it [...] "deserves a little more coverage, if only to acknowledge its existence".|$|E

500|$|... "Cherry Pop" [...] {{was written}} by Stan herself, Lukas Hällgren and Erik Lidbom, while {{production}} was handled by both Hällgren and Lidbom. It was recorded at the Fonogram Studios in Bucharest, Romania and was additionally mixed and engineered at Lidbom's Hitfire Production in Uppsala, Sweden. Further's work on the track was done during FonoCamp2013, the first Romanian international songwriting camp held in Azuga. Fellow Romanian and international singers were also present at the two-weeks event, such as Delia Matache, Mohombi, Smiley and Deepcentral. Stan described [...] "Cherry Pop" [...] as a J-pop song, noting that while she hadn't worked with the genre [...] " [...] fits my style", as she finds J-pop music [...] "very energetic, it’s <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> positive vibe to it." [...] She also noticed influences to eurodance. An administrator of IasiFun commended the recording as being influenced by house, while also describing the song's instrumentation as [...] "electric" [...] and [...] "vibrant". Anthony Easton, a writer for The Singles Jukebox, described the song as a [...] "popluxe", while Ian Mew compared it to [...] "Bubble Pop!" [...] by South Korean singer Hyuna. According to Popdust, [...] "Cherry Pop" [...] uses dubstep for its breakdown. The main idea for the song was based on Stan's first kiss which, according to her, [...] "tasted like candy".|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Human Nature" [...] was written and {{composed}} for Michael Jackson by Steve Porcaro of Toto. Porcaro recorded a rough demo of the song on a cassette. He had written the song after his first-grade daughter came home crying because a boy pushed her off the slide. He blurted out three reasons for the incident to comfort her: one, the boy liked her, two, people can be strange and three, it's human nature. Fellow Toto band member David Paich gave the demo tape, along {{with two of his}} own songs, to producer Quincy Jones, hoping they would be used by Jackson. Jones did not think Paich's songs were right for Jackson's current work, but enjoyed the rough demo of [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{at the end of the}} cassette. Jones explained, [...] "All of a sudden, at the end, there was all this silence, there was: 'why, why, dah dah da-dum dah dah, why, why'. Just a dummy lyric and a very skeletal thing—I get goosebumps talking about it. I said, 'This is where we wanna go, because it's <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> wonderful flavor'". However, Jones was dissatisfied with the original lyrics and so John Bettis, who had written lyrics for hits by the Carpenters and the Pointer Sisters, among others, was asked to add lyrics to the song. He completed the song in two days. The producer asked if the song could be included on Jackson's album, to which Porcaro and Bettis agreed. [...] "Human Nature" [...] was the last song selected for Thriller, ousting [...] "Carousel" [...] from the final track listing.|$|E
500|$|Chris Power of BBC Music {{compared}} Homework [...] "less-is-more" [...] {{approach to}} compression's use as [...] "a sonic tribute" [...] to the FM radio stations that [...] "fed Daft Punk's youthful obsessions." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "while a few tracks are more daft than deft," [...] more recent groundbreakers like The Avalanches could never exist without [...] "Da Funk". Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine noted that [...] "there's {{a core of}} unimpeachably classic work on Homework, hidden among the merely good, and when you've <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> classic debut hidden in {{the outlines of the}} epic slouch of their debut, it's hard not to get frustrated." [...] Rolling Stone awarded the album three stars out of five, commenting that [...] "the duo's essential, career-defining insight is that the problem with disco the first time around was not that it was stupid but that it was not stupid enough." [...] Rolling Stone ranked Homework at the top on their list of [...] "The 30 Greatest EDM Albums of All Time" [...] while affirming that Daft Punk's debut [...] "is pure synapse-tweaking brilliance." [...] According to Scott Woods of The Village Voice, [...] "Daft Punk [...] the lid off the [...] sewer" [...] with the release of Homework. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork awarded it 7.6 out of 10. He stated that [...] "Homework provides sixteen whole tracks of modern-day boom box bass n' drum and unlike your science project, it doesn't require a lot of intricate calculations to figure out how it works." [...] In his view, [...] "It sounds like an Atari 2600 on a killing spree." [...] By contrast, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited [...] "Da Funk" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money". Darren Gawle from Drop-D Magazine also gave a negative review, stating that [...] "Homework is the work of a couple of DJs who sound amateurish at best." ...|$|E
500|$|Director David Nutter {{was pleased}} with the {{finished}} product.

2500|$|Having {{missed out}} on the 2014 World Cup through injury, Walcott was not {{selected}} by Roy Hodgson for the 26-man provisional Euro 2016 squad announced in May 2016.

It's a tough decision but it's one you have to take." ...|$|E
2500|$|The overall {{writing for}} the record was also varied, with shifts in style and production. Foreman {{attributes}} this to Thorp's input, crediting the engineer with creating a landscape in which [...] "the darks are darker and the lights are brighter and the lows are lower and the highs are higher". The enlisting of Hip-hop/R producer Mike Elizondo late in the process brought a [...] "new synergy" [...] to the sessions, with drummer Chad Butler describing Elizondo as [...] "someone who's <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> rhythmic sensibility".|$|E
2500|$|Some sources, {{especially}} those in the United Kingdom, revere the Spice Girls as [...] "gay icons".

Halliwell was also the recipient of the Honorary Gay Award at the 2016 Attitude Awards. In a 2005 interview, Emma Bunton attributed their large gay fan base to the group's fun-loving nature, open-mindedness, and their love of fashion and dressing up, concluding that: [...] "I'm so flattered that we've <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> huge gay following, it's amazing." ...|$|E

According to an interview with Booker, Coyle had worked on song ideas using GarageBand which she then presented to Booker in England to work on together further. The producer said, [...] "She was singing her songs to loops, and then I took the loops out and rewrote the music from scratch to her ideas." [...] He described her songs as [...] "very pop". Booker also worked on songs to show off Coyle's vocals: [...] "Because she’s <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> belting voice, I tried a couple of things where she could really belt," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Gosden {{reported}} {{the horse to}} be in excellent condition after his Arc win commenting [...] "He's <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> constitution, you can hardly see a rib which is not usually the case {{at the end of}} a long campaign" [...] and the colt was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Keeneland Racecourse on 31 October. Before shipping to Kentucky he reported worked well in an exercise on the long gallop at Newmarket. In the build-up to the race, there was some concern about the state of the turf course which had been softened by heavy rain, with the track supervisor saying that the ground was likely to be [...] "good to soft" [...] by British standards. Golden Horn was attempting to become the first Arc winner to win the race, following the failures of Dancing Brave (fourth in 1986), Trempolino (second in 1987), Saumarez, (fifth in 1990), Subotica (fifth in 1992) and Dylan Thomas (fifth in 2007).|$|E
2500|$|Redford {{supports}} environmentalism, Native American rights, LGBT rights, and the arts. [...] He {{has also}} supported advocacy groups, {{such as the}} Political Action Committee of the Directors Guild of America.

Redford also supported Gary Herbert, another Republican and a friend, in Herbert's successful 2004 campaign to be elected Utah's Lieutenant Governor. Herbert later became Governor of Utah. Redford is an avid environmentalist and is a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council. He endorsed Democratic President Barack Obama for re-election in 2012. Redford is the first quote on the back cover of Donald Trump's book Crippled America saying of Trump “I'm glad he's in there, being the way he is." [...] But Redford's comment {{was intended to be}} sarcastic, {{as the rest of the}} comment follows, [...] "He's <b>got</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> big foot in his mouth I'm not sure you could get it out.” ...|$|E

Some of the original vocals, recorded in her front room, remain on the finished record. Some songs were even recorded in Nadine's en suite bathroom. According to an interview with Booker, Coyle had worked on song ideas using GarageBand which she then presented to Booker in England to work on together further.

Secondly, I hate yellowcard being tagged as an alternative rock band. It's just a great rock song.
