He spent 19 years in {{mainstream}} prisons before being diagnosed as a psychopath in November 1985 {{and sent to the}} high-security Park Lane Hospital, now Ashworth Psychiatric Hospital, in Sefton; <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that he never wanted to be released.|$|E
5|$|The Colts {{placed their}} {{franchise}} tag on Manning on February 15, 2011. On July 30, 2011, the Colts signed Manning to a 5-year, $90 million contract after negotiations in which <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> {{that he did}} not need to be the highest-paid player in the NFL.|$|E

50|$|He is {{what follows}} {{in the hole}} left behind by Iron Man once Tony Stark leaves the world stage. Tony hasn't been around to protect the regular {{interests}} {{that he might have}} during his time running Stark Industries or running S.H.I.E.L.D. And now that <b>he's</b> back, <b>he's</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> doesn't want {{to get back into the}} geo-political side of things necessarily. Detroit Steel is what happens in that absence. He is a sort of Blackwater-meets-NASCAR corporate-sponsored armored enhanced guy available for hire to the highest bidder for whatever cause around the round. Basically, Iron Man's worst nightmare of what he could become. An absolute perversion of everything he is.|$|R
5|$|In 1911, when Bauer {{again was}} asked to {{illustrate}} the book, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> to the publisher {{that he wanted to}} retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication. The publishing house had kept the original illustrations for the previous editions and considered them their property. Bauer was backed up in his request by other artists facing the same problem. The publishers did not budge from their position and without Bauer's illustrations, book sales dropped.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the many}} books written about him (Holroyd counts 80 by 1939) Shaw's autobiographical output, {{apart from his}} diaries, was {{relatively}} slight. He gave interviews to newspapers—"GBS Confesses", to The Daily Mail in 1904 is an example—and provided sketches to would-be biographers whose work was rejected by Shaw and never published. In 1939 Shaw drew on these materials to produce Shaw Gives Himself Away, a miscellany which, a year before his death, he revised and republished as Sixteen Self Sketches (there were seventeen). <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> to his publishers that this slim book was in no sense a full autobiography.|$|E
5|$|Although O'Malley was {{loyal to}} his {{employees}}, {{he did not}} take kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's request for a three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and showed up in the spring to find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E
50|$|Van der Stad was {{repeatedly}} queried by his {{officers and the}} mayor of Middelburg about when the capitulation of Walcheren would be offered to the Germans. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> perfectly <b>clear</b> that this could never be the case as long as French troops were still fighting the Germans.|$|R

5|$|In 1917, in {{response}} to the wave of anti-German feeling that surrounded the war, George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also disposed of his family's German titles and styles, so Christian, Helena and their daughters simply became Prince and Princess Christian; Princess Helena Victoria and Marie Louise with no territorial designation. Helena's surviving son, Albert, fought {{on the side of the}} Prussians, though <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that he would not fight against his mother's country. In the same year, on 8 October, Prince Christian died at Schomberg House. Her last years were spent arguing with Commissioners, who tried to turn her out of Schomberg and Cumberland Lodge because of the expense of running her households. They failed, as clear evidence of her right to live in those residences for life was shown.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Brigade {{moved up}} to the line to relieve the 2nd and Rifle Brigades and {{remained}} there until the division was withdrawn to a training area in late October, following the relief of II ANZAC Corps by the Canadian Corps. The division suffered heavy losses on 12 October: about 845 men were killed and a further 1,900 wounded in the worst defeat in New Zealand military history. Although Russell blamed himself for {{the outcome of the}} attack and wrote to politicians in New Zealand stating so, in his private correspondence <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that planning and preparation by Godley and his staff at II ANZAC Corps was inadequate and did {{not take into account the}} poor ground conditions at Passchendaele.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E

25|$|The 1948 {{election}} {{also brought}} President Harry Truman, a Missouri native, reelection to the White House. To celebrate this victory, Binaggio chartered a private railroad car for transportation to the inauguration ceremony in Washington, D.C.

50|$|Jay Tolson defended Gomaa, saying thatwhile Gomaa did {{say that}} it was un-Islamic for Muslims to own statues or to display them in their homes, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> very <b>clear</b> that the {{destruction}} of antiquities and other statues in the public sphere was unacceptable and indeed criminal. He is also on record deploring the Taliban's destruction of the great Buddhist statuary in Afghanistan.|$|R
25|$|While Luther did {{not deny}} the Pope’s right to grant pardons for penance imposed by the Church, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that preachers who claimed indulgences absolved those who {{obtained}} them from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error, in agreement with Catholic theology.|$|E
25|$|Repnin's Sejm marked {{one of the}} {{important}} milestones in increasing Polish dependence on the Russian Empire, and its devolution into a protectorate.

25|$|Gold {{resigned}} from the Communist Party on August 24, 1950, and signed the Taft-Hartley oath. However, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that he had resigned only so the Fur Workers could receive the protection of federal law. The Justice Department argued that Gold had not really resigned, and indicted him for perjury in August 1953 one day before {{the statute of limitations}} ran out.|$|E

25|$|On 5 February 2008, Romário {{announced}} his retirement both from playing and coaching, effective {{at the end of}} March. This move came somewhat unexpectedly, as fans anticipated that he would retire from playing, but not coaching. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that he will only concentrate on the FIFA Confederations Cup and helping with the 2014 FIFA World Cup. However, on 27 March, Romário denied that he had retired.|$|E

25|$|Grey set {{an example}} and a {{precedent}} for his successors. He was primus inter pares (first among equals), as Bagehot said in 1867 of the Prime Minister's status. Using his Whig victory as a mandate for reform, Grey was unrelenting {{in the pursuit of}} this goal, using every Parliamentary device to achieve it. Although respectful toward the King, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> that his constitutional duty was to acquiesce to {{the will of the people}} and Parliament.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} Church's aim {{was not merely}} to help the {{faithful}} make due satisfaction for their sins, but chiefly {{to bring them to}} greater fervour of charity. For this purpose he decreed that partial indulgences, previously granted as the equivalent of a certain number of days, months, quarantines (forty-day periods) or years of canonical penance, simply supplement, and to the same degree, the remission that those performing the indulgenced action already gain by the charity and contrition with which they do it.|$|E
