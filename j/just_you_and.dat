500|$|In 1912 Stamper {{began writing}} songs for the Ziegfeld Follies of 1913, {{contributing}} <b>Just</b> <b>You</b> <b>and</b> I and The Moon, Without You and Everybody Sometime Must Love Somebody. He is credited as [...] "additional music" [...] for the Follies of 1914 and 1915, but {{he wrote the}} majority of the music for the Follies of 1916. and was on an equal billing with Louis A. Hirsch, Jerome Kern, and Irving Berlin. The music of the Follies of 1917 was written by Stamper and Raymond Hubbell and he was described as [...] "an old hand" [...] for his work with Louis A. Hirsch by the Follies of 1918. In addition to his 1918 Follies work, he wrote all the music for Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic with Gene Buck, a series that also had editions in 1919, 1920 and 1921.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{a reality}} series {{originated}} when Doherty and Iswarienko were interested in documenting {{the weeks leading up}} to their wedding in a filming and production style similar to [...] and Deadliest Catch. Doherty had previously worked on reality television when she hosted Scare Tactics and Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty and participated on the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars. She called the project her agreement with Iswarienko to [...] "chronicle this time in our lives and let future brides and future grooms know that [...] not <b>just</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> that goes through the stress". According to Doherty, it was a way to celebrate her third marriage: [...] "Can you bring all of those qualities to reality TV? Can you be that brutally honest, that completely raw, but with the quality of those two shows where you do use different cameras and you do want it to look spectacular?" [...] Doherty planned to develop the idea with her own production company, originally partnering with an unidentified television network. However, the series was picked up by WE tv when Doherty thought that the previous network was making the material too sensational. Miller said that he approved the series after seeing its pitch, and he found Doherty an appealing person to watch on reality television.|$|E
2500|$|Nash's {{screenplay}} changed {{virtually all}} of the sung recitative to spoken dialogue, as in the 1942 stage revival. For example, in the original opera Porgy sings the line [...] "If there weren't no Crown, Bess, if there was only <b>just</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Porgy, what then?", upon which Bess launches into the duet I Loves You Porgy. In the film the line is spoken. The recitatives themselves did not have to really be rewritten, because they do not rhyme, while the words in all the songs do.|$|E

2500|$|... "Chasing Shadows" [...] is {{the second}} of three bonus tracks, an electropop song built over [...] "soaring synths". Lyrically, the song is a [...] "musical love letter:" [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> me and we chase our shadows, {{just waiting for the}} sun to go down." [...] "La La La (Brazil 2014)" [...] is {{included}} on the Latin American and Spanish deluxe edition of the album; it is a re-worked version of the song [...] "Dare (La La La)" [...] with new lyrics for the 2014 World Cup.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, West's image {{underwent}} a major metamorphosis; {{the woman who}} had once performed outfitted in conservative gingham dresses, and had originally refused to record Kris Kristofferson's [...] "Help Me Make It Through the Night" [...] because it was [...] "too sexy", began appearing in spandex-sequined Bob Mackie designs. (She had relented in late 1970 and recorded [...] "Help Me Make It Through the Night" [...] on the album Careless Hands, which was released in 1971.) As the sexual revolution peaked, so did West's career. Under United Artists, West's material changed from traditional country to up-tempo and slow-tempo Adult Contemporary-styled music. In 1977, West released her first album under United Artists, When It's <b>Just</b> <b>You</b> <b>and</b> Me. The title track peaked at No.19 on the country charts.|$|E
2500|$|... "My Baby" [...] is a mid-tempo {{love song}} {{depicting}} a sonic valentine to Jackson's fiancé. The song features gentle acoustic guitars and shuffling percussion, and guest vocals from Kanye West, over [...] "breezy" [...] and [...] "laidback" [...] production. Jackson delivers the chorus in a reassuring manner; {{described as a}} [...] "sotto voce purr". [...] "The Islands" [...] is a spoken-word segment in which Jackson confesses her admiration for the island of Anguilla, the beach, and tropical humidity. The interlude segues into [...] "Spending time With You", a contemporary [...] "slow jam." [...] Lyrically, the song captures Jackson {{in a moment of}} love. Jackson speaks about evenings relaxing in prior said location in brief interlude, [...] "Magic Hour", which transitions to [...] "Island Life." [...] In [...] "Island Life", described as [...] "pure seduction", Jackson refers to herself and a companion in an exotic paradise in a lilting vocal: [...] "Island in the sun, <b>just</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I will go/Ride into the wave [...]" [...] Its instrumentation contains throbbing bass and light concoctions of Caribbean-influenced music and ragga pop.|$|E

2500|$|After {{releasing}} Back to Basics, Aguilera considered {{launching a}} tour of small clubs like the Blue Note in New York. [...] "I think there is something really special about doing a performance like that and feeling the energy of a more intimate audience, {{and that is something}} we are definitely, definitely going to entertain in the future", she stated. However, Aguilera considered that it is [...] "a more vulnerable approach for your performance. You can't hide behind anything. It's <b>just</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> your audience is right in front of you, but I still love it. I love to perform more than anything else in the world, being on that stage and feeling the energy of the crowd enjoying your music". However, an arena tour would give her more time to work the bigger show and then strip it down to something raw and organic. Before the tour's launching, Aguilera stated that it was her my most inspired show to date. [...] " [...] lots of amazing circus elements and throwback elements to the past and the areas that I am inspired by. It's just an interesting show to watch and {{to be a part of}} and to use your imagination", she said. Aguilera gave details of the concert, saying: ...|$|E
