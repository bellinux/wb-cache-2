Gay influence in early America was primarily limited to high culture. The association {{of gay men}} with opera, ballet, couture, fine cuisine, musical theater, the Golden Age of Hollywood and interior design began with wealthy homosexual men using the straight themes of these media to send their own signals. In the <b>heterocentric</b> Marilyn Monroe film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, a musical number features Jane Russell singing [...] "Anyone Here for Love" [...] in a gym while muscled men dance around her. The men's costumes were designed by a man, the dance was choreographed by a man and the dancers (as gay screenwriter Paul Rudnick points out) [...] "seem more interested in each other than in Russell"; however, her presence gets the sequence past the censors and works it into an overall <b>heterocentric</b> theme.|$|E

These services can be improved by ensuring that the case statement of an agency unit is LGBTQ friendly, providing training services for faculty and staff at shelters, making sure that all services does not have heterosexist language, and providing opportunities for lesbians to take leadership positions in these endeavors.|$|E

50|$|Carter {{uses the}} protagonist's {{occupation}} as {{a focal point}} for analyzing the role of the media in packaging, selling, and, thus shaping history and historical truth. The reader is taken through not only the familiar slanted research and writing of a piece, but also the careful cooking of raw sense data for broadcast by a screener, the one person who experiences the camera's full sense experience, precisely so that others do not. The screeners experience high turnover because of their unfortunate tendency to identify too closely, and fall in love, with the cameras who cannot share their unidirectional intimacy. The novel begins with Maya finding herself saddled with a new and problematic screener - one who appears to her only through the net, never in person, and who is a woman, contrary to all custom in her <b>heterocentric</b> dystopia.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the representation of}} macho masculinity found in Jean Genet's novels through the framework of theories of gender performativity. While Genet's novels have been condemned by contemporary gay critics for representing homosexuality as an abject or failed masculinity, {{it is argued that}} emphasis on this aspect of his work has tended to overshadow the importance of the virile, phallic man to his work. Genet's homoeroticisation of machismo provides a focus for analysis of his representation of masculinity as a whole, and especially of the relationship between heterosexual and homosexual men found in his novels. Rather than reading Genet's representation of macho as a specifically "gay" macho that confirms the <b>heterocentric</b> privileging of heterosexual masculinity, this paper argues that, in Genet's novels, all macho is represented as inherently performative in a way that questions the logic of <b>heterocentric</b> privilege...|$|E

The straight target's expressions of discomfort were perceived as more appropriate than the gay target's, particularly among participants with strong anti-gay attitudes. Counterfactuals which undid these events also suggested implicit inequities in the perceived norms for interactions between gay and straight persons.

40|$|Although widely {{recognized}} as pivotal texts {{in the history of}} homosexual literature, Genet 2 ̆ 7 s novels occupied a largely negative position within gay criticism of the 1990 s, by which they were seen to reproduce <b>heterocentric,</b> even homophobic assumptions about same-sex desire. This article argues that Genet 2 ̆ 7 s contentious decision to articulate homoerotic desire within the space of a heteronormative language is one necessitated by the structural constraints of language itself. Metafictively drawing attention to the absence of a language in which to communicate homoerotic desire, Genet represents his narrators and characters as locked in a closet of heteronormative language. His strategic response to this silencing is to appropriate and recontextualize <b>heterocentric</b> and homophobic discourses in ways that problematize their assumed heteronormativity. In contrast to the gay critical focus on whether Genet himself has internalized heteronormative assumptions about his sexuality and subjectivity, Genet 2 ̆ 7 s texts remind us that the question is not simply an individualized one of what the author him/herself thinks, but rather how s/he might articulate expressions of desire within a language that seems designed to erase such expressions of difference...|$|E

40|$|Aim: This {{article is}} a report of a study of lesbian co-mothers' {{experiences}} of UK maternity healthcare services. Background: With the increase in fertility provision to lesbian couples, maternity healthcare services are increasingly coming into contact with lesbian co-mothers. Literature highlights the need to investigate donor-conceived lesbian families and an absence of research focusing on the unique experiences of co-mothers in the maternity process. Design: The study followed a qualitative design and interpretative phenome-nological analysis methodology. Methods: A qualitative study was carried out involving ten lesbian co-mothers, whose children were conceived via anonymous donor insemination to their partners. Data collection took place between May–September 2009. Findings: Interpretative phenomenological analysis revealed two main types of co-mothers' experiences, those connected with maternity service structures and interpersonal experiences with maternity care staff. Co-mothers felt excluded by <b>heterocentric</b> organizational service structures. However, the co-mothers' overwhelming experiences with staff were positive and inclusive. Despite this, co-mothers reported that any ambiguous or non-inclusive experiences with professionals left them questioning whether these experiences were due to homophobic attitudes or professional incompetence. Conclusion: The results indicate that these lesbian co-mothers felt predominantly included and accepted by maternity services. Ambiguous interpersonal experiences, however, evoked doubts in this regard. In addition, organizational <b>heterocentric</b> structural barriers remain. Structural service delivery changes could facilitate co-mothers' feelings of inclusion and highlight the important role practitioners have in contributing to co-mothers' experiences...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{hypothesis}} that possessing multiple subordi-nate-group identities renders a person “invisible ” relative {{to those with}} a single subordinate-group identity is developed. We propose that androcentric, ethnocentric, and <b>heterocentric</b> ideologies will cause people who have multiple subordinate-group identities to be defined as non-prototypical members of their respective identity groups. Because people with multiple subordinate-group identities (e. g., ethnic minority woman) do not fit the prototypes of their respective identity groups (e. g., ethnic minorities, women), they will experience what we have termed “intersectional invisibility. ” In this article, our model of intersectional invisibility is developed and evidence from historical narratives, cultural representations, interest-group politics, and anti-discrimination legal frameworks is used to illustrate its utility. Implications for social psychological theory and research are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 1998 The <b>heterocentric</b> discourses {{in schools}} have marginalized male {{homosexual}} students through approaches {{in the academic}} and hidden curricula and in pedagogical practices. The multiple discourses in schools have viewed a student's construction of their sexuality and gender as oppositional categories. These approaches have not positively contributed to divergent expressions of homosexuality and of alternative masculinities because schools have failed to view the relational nature of identity construction and its policing through heterosexist discourses. Extracts from five participants in the case studies illustrate the silence experienced by homosexual students through the academic curricula and the paradox of hyper-sexualization in schools. Discipline and support procedures implemented to combat heterosexist attitudes have not been effective, as the multiple discourses have created a vacuum of silence filled with heterosexist violence.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} a queer fan {{community for}} {{the television show}} Once Upon a Time (OUAT) that utilizes the social networking site Tumblr as their primary base of fan activity. The Swan Queen fan community is comprised of individuals that collectively support and celebrate a non-canon romantic relationship {{between two of the}} female lead characters of the show rather than the canonic, <b>heterocentric</b> relationships that occur between the two women and their respective male love interests. I answer two research questions in this study: First, how are members of the Swan Queen fan community developing counter narratives of love by engaging in meaning-making processes and interpretations of OUAT? And secondly, how do they talk about the purpose and importance of their narratives for themselves or the Swan Queen fan community? In order to answer my research questions, I consider how the Swan Queen fandom developed and how they convey their meaning-making strategies online. To do this, I have analyzed the Tumblr blog of one Swan Queen fan and have used their blog as a nexus between other Swan Queen fans that use the website for their fan activities. Swan Queen fans argue that the show runners of OUAT use subtextual codes within canonical storylines in an effort to queerbait the show’s queer audience members. Moreover, the show runners refute the notion that they are queerbating queer fans at all by arguing that the fans’ perceptions are baseless and that any perceived queering of the characters Emma Swan and Regina Mills is purely “unintentional. ” This response has only served to alienate the show’s queer fan base further as it led to increased complaints that the show runners were gaslighting the entire queer fandom. Additionally, Swan Queen fans maintain that the show’s introduction of canonical storylines featuring romantic relationships between Regina and Robin Hood and Emma and Captain Hook are heterosexist and dangerous. The storylines between Emma and Captain Hook, queer fans argue, often promote rape culture, thus perpetuating violence against both queer and non-queer audiences through storylines grounded in fairytale concepts of “True Love” and “Happily Ever After”. As such, Swan Queen fans push back against and reject this violence through their own interpretations and counter narratives of “True Love”. In accordance with previous research, I have found that historically marginalized groups such as the queer community continue to experience widespread and often aggressive attacks by queerphobic individuals and hate groups that are intent on preserving traditionally <b>heterocentric</b> institutions in our society, including (but not limited to) mainstream media broadcasting. Furthermore, fandom has become institutionalized in the same manner and typically operates within hegemonic, <b>heterocentric</b> standards. Conversely, queer fandoms such as the Swan Queen fandom operate outside of these standards, and fans respond to antagonistic efforts to silence them or cast them in an inaccurate manner by creating close-knit social communities to combat these actions and provide a space wherein individuals are able to counter dominant narratives that serve to further marginalize them. This study elucidates how this effort may occur and questions the effect this membership has on those who participate within a queer fandom. It is imperative that such research takes place, as there are very few accounts of how queer fans navigate the complex intersection between fandom and queerness...|$|E

The path of lesbian women choosing motherhood is fraught with challenges and often disappointments (Martin, 1993, Oswald, 2002, Perrin, 2002, Stacey, 1996). In the United States, women are still very much socialized to want to be mothers and the desire to be a mother is not contradicted by sexual orientation (DiLapi, 1989; Dalton 2 ̆ 6 Bielby, 2000). However, lesbian women receive messages that they should not want to be mothers and that they cannot be adequate mothers (DiLapi. 1989; Pies, 1990). Women who self identify as lesbian must negotiate the norms and expectations of a <b>heterocentric</b> and homophobic culture. Thus, for lesbian women, choosing motherhood requires careful consideration and much planning (Dunne, 2000). Thus, one can assume that for lesbian women, the decision making journey, wherever it leads, is challenging and unique.
