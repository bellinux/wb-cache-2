30|$|There {{are a few}} {{comparative}} studies, presumably, on identical data sets.

30|$|In this article, the {{anisotropic}} diffusion {{scheme for}} defect detection in the TFT-LCD screens is {{extended to the}} defect detection in radiographic images. These later {{are used in the}} inspection of welds in the pipelines. Until now and in several industrial applications radiographic film analysis are done exclusively by the radiograph inspector who is required to visually inspect each film and detect the presence of possible defects. Consequently the automatization of such a procedure becomes necessary. The new proposed method allows to automatically detect the possible defects through enhancing and sharpening the radiographic images. The multiple simulations carried out show good performance of the proposed detection scheme. Plots of multiple 2 D intensity profiles taken from the areas containing the defects show that the new method highlights the <b>defect</b> <b>details</b> and allows efficient distinctions between the faultless background and the <b>defect</b> <b>details.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of corrosion defects in pipework {{is an extremely}} important topic, particularly in the oil and chemical industries. The established procedures rely on the removal of any insulation material followed by localised inspection which is extremely expensive. A cheap and rapid inspection method would therefore be of great value. Researchers at Imperial College have developed a rapid testing scheme, utilising Lamb waves which propagate along the pipe. It is essentially a pulse-echo scheme: the instrumentation is located at a single position on the pipe; it excites waves in the pipe and then receives reflections which return from any corrosion <b>defects.</b> <b>Details</b> {{of the development of}} the technique and field trials have been reported elsewhere [1 – 5]...|$|R
