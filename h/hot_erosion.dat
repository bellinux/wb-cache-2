Serious erosion-corrosion problems in boilers combusting fuels with high chlorine-content have been detected frequently. A series of erosion-corrosion and corrosion tests were performed on thermal sprayed coatings and coating precursors in chlorinecontaining environments in order to evaluate possibilities to utilize thermal sprayed coatings for erosion-corrosion protection in boilers combusting chlorine-containing fuels. A series of <b>hot</b> <b>erosion</b> and erosion-corrosion tests were performed on thermal sprayed coatings at elevated temperatures with and without chlorine. Carbide-containing HVOF coatings performed well in <b>hot</b> <b>erosion</b> tests, but they were completely destroyed {{in the presence of}} chlorine due to rapid oxidation of carbides. Metallic HVOF coatings with high chromium content performed well in both conditions.

The E-C (erosion-corrosion) resistance of carbide-containing coatings in the presence of chlorides was worse than expected.

The possibilities of employing magnesia-carbon refractories were investigated through industrial testing combined with post-mortem assessments, thermodynamic calculations and mechanical considerations. Pitch bonded magnesia materials cannot {{be used in the}} slagline owing to the MgO-C reaction and extrinsic oxidation of carbon by reducible slag components (mainly CrOx), resulting in carbon removal, slag infiltration and direct MgO corrosion. Combined with turbulent slag motion this leads to <b>hot</b> <b>erosion.</b> Direct carbon burnout and the MgO reaction are the main causes for their failure in the freeboard. However, pitch bonded magnesia refractories are able to compete with magnesia-chromite bricks in the ladle bottom and in the lower metal bath region, where levels of turbulence and slag infiltration are limited. Simultaneously, both the MgO-C reaction and the extrinsic oxidation of carbon are restrained by, respectively, the inhibiting effect of a mechanical barrier and the non-wetting behaviour of steel towards the magnesia refractory component. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract - Inconels 792 are nickel-base {{superalloy}} {{material that}} has high strength and creep resistance at temperature near their melting point. This material {{is commonly used}} in aircraft gas turbine (jet) engines, where parts or components are subjected to high temperature and high stress. Not-withstanding the high- temperature capabilities of the alloys, during service the parts are often damaged by <b>hot</b> gas <b>erosion</b> {{and other types of}} mechanism. Welding is one of the repair method available nowadays. The application is typically accomplished by Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW). Unfortunately, however, these superalloys also have limited ductilities at elevated temperatures, and are consequently subject to cracking due to differential thermal strains in some temperature ranges, a phenomenon termed “strain-age” cracking. The solution proposed is Superalloy Welding at Elevated Temperature (SWET). Elevating temperature on the parts or components that are to be welded probably could reduce the thermal gradient occurred, thus creating a crack-free weldments. Also elevated temperature could reduce the amperage needed to achieve the welding temperature, hence lower electricity and cost are resulted. ...|$|R

In most mammals, the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination are directed to a subset of genomic loci (hot spots) by sequence-specific binding of the PRDM 9 protein. Rapid evolution of the DNA-binding specificity of PRDM 9 and gradual erosion of PRDM 9 -binding sites by gene conversion will alter the recombination landscape over time. To better understand the evolutionary turnover of recombination hot spots and its consequences, we mapped DSB hot spots in four major subspecies of Mus musculus with different Prdm 9 alleles and in their F 1 hybrids. We found that <b>hot</b> spot <b>erosion</b> governs the preferential usage of some Prdm 9 alleles over others in hybrid mice and increases sequence diversity specifically at hot spots that become active in the hybrids.

40|$|Beach erosion is {{a chronic}} {{problem in the}} {{southeast}} coast of the State of Florida, where Delray Beach is located. To mitigate increasing erosion problems (subsequent) beach nourishment projects were constructed along the entire sandy coast {{of the state of}} Florida. At Delray Beach, the beach was nourished 7 times since 1973 using approximately 5. 7 million m 3 of sediments along a stretch of beach of about 4 km. Sand for these beach nourishment projects was extracted from an area immediately offshore of the project site, from blanket deposits that overlay bedrock and are located just landward of offshore coral reefs. Critical evaluation of sediment data for several years was initially conducted to investigate the hypothesis raised by previous authors that higher erosion in {{the south end of the}} project is due to the occurrence of finer beach sand at this segment. Data from multiple annual monitoring reports demonstrated that alongshore grain size distribution on Delray Beach varies significantly, temporally and spatially, and that there is no persistent trend of finer grain sizes being located in the erosional hot spot segment compared to the rest of the beach; in fact, grain size differences within the project area can be considered to be minor. This data provided enough evidence to conclude that grain size differences alongshore were not the cause of increased <b>hot</b> sport <b>erosion.</b> Wave modelling and morphological modelling also suggested that the gaps in the offshore shore parallel reef system were not responsible for <b>hot</b> spot <b>erosion.</b> The effects of the barrier reefs on the nearshore waves and currents were relatively minor as evidenced by numerical model results. Strong alongshore variability in wave height and associated pronounced areas wave shadowing and focusing zones were observed along the project area in initial numerical modelling efforts, but these were attributed to wave transformation over the dredge pits located offshore of the nourished beach. Near the <b>erosion</b> <b>hot</b> spot segment on the south end of the project, however, these variations in nearshore wave heights were relatively small compared to other segments of the project. Five methods of wave climate schematization designed to reduce a full wave time-series into a representative set of conditions for coastal morphological modeling were evaluated to achieve the first task. Of all the methods of wave climate schematization tested the ´Energy Flux Method´ and ´Opti Method´ showed best results in terms of representing accurately the sediment transport of the benchmark wave climate with a reduced set of wave conditions. The Energy Flux Method was identified as the preferred technique because it was relatively easy to apply, it is not subjective since waves are selected as a function of wave energy distribution and shows satisfactory performance even when compared to more complex and time intensive methodologies such as the Opti method. The research conducted in this thesis demonstrates that some engineering solutions such as the backfilling of all the dredge pits or introduction of permeable structures at the downdrift (south) end of the Delray Beach nourishment project can improve the performance of the nourishment reducing volumetric losses with mild downdrift effects. Since the downdrift beaches are receiving sediment lost from the nourishment project “free of costs”, a 50 per cent reduction of these losses implies that the downdrift beaches will still be receiving sediments, but half the amount. Each intervention will, however, impact updrift and downdrift beaches in a different way; have its costs and its environmental impacts, therefore, before further consideration for implementation of these significant project modifications a complete engineering, economic and environmental feasibility analysis is recommended.

Advanced composite structures based on vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) and high-temperature ceramics are expected to address this grand challenge, in which ceramic serves as a shielding layer protecting the VACNTs from the oxidation and erosive environment, while the VACNTs work as a conductor. However, {{it is still a}} great challenge to fabricate VACNT/ceramic composite structures due to the limited diffusion of ceramics inside the VACNT arrays. In this work, we report on the controllable fabrication of infiltrated (and noninfiltrated) VACNT/silicon composite structures via thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [and laser-assisted CVD]. In laser-assisted CVD, low-crystalline silicon (Si) was quickly deposited at the VACNT subsurfaces/surfaces followed by the formation of high-crystalline Si layers, thus resulting in noninfiltrated composite structures. Unlike laser-assisted CVD, thermal CVD activated the precursors inside and outside the VACNTs simultaneously, which realized uniform infiltrated VACNT/Si composite structures. The growth mechanisms for infiltrated and noninfiltrated VACNT/ceramic composites, which we attributed to the different temperature distributions and gas diffusion mechanism in VACNTs, were investigated. More importantly, the as-farbicated composite structures exhibited excellent multifunctional properties, such as excellent antioxidative ability (up to 1100 °C), high thermal stability (up to 1400 °C), good high velocity <b>hot</b> gas <b>erosion</b> resistance, and good electrical conductivity (∼ 8. 95 Sm– 1 at 823 K).

Hydrodynamic modelling of wave and current behaviour as well as contemporaneous sand transport shows the east to north-east storm wave direction to be the major determinant of erosion magnitude.

40|$|Electron beam (EB) {{physical}} vapour deposited (PVD) {{thermal barrier}} coatings (TBCs) {{have been used}} in gas turbine engines for a number of years. The primary mode of failure is attributed to oxidation of the bond coat and growth of the thermally grown oxide (TGO), the alumina scale that forms on the bond coat and to which the ceramic top coat adheres. Once the TGO reaches a critical thickness, the TBC tends to spall and expose the underlying substrate to the <b>hot</b> gases. <b>Erosion</b> is commonly accepted as a secondary failure mechanism, which thins the TBC thus reducing its insulation capability and increasing the TGO growth rate. In severe conditions, erosion can completely remove the TBC over time, again resulting in the exposure of the substrate, typically Ni-based superalloys. Since engine efficiency is related to turbine entry temperature (TET), there is a constant driving force to increase this temperature. With this drive for higher TETs comes corrosion problems for the yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ) ceramic topcoat. YSZ is susceptible to attack from molten calciumÃ¢Â Â magnesiumÃ¢Â Â aluminaÃ¢Â Â silicates (CMAS) which degrades the YSZ both chemically and micro-structurally. CMAS has a melting point of around 1240 Ã Â°C and since it is common in atmospheric dust it is easily deposited onto gas turbine blades.

40|$|A {{variety of}} fluvial geomorphic {{assessment}} methods, such as TMDL development, biological habitat quality assessment, and overall channel characterization, {{have been developed}} and are being adopted by organizations for use in assessing stream conditions {{for a variety of}} purposes. This paper first summarizes available stream geomorphic assessment methods, detailing their strengths and weaknesses. Then we describe an actual project conducted by Tetra Tech in Griffin, Georgia to show how assessment methods were selected to suit a particular application and how the results were presented to maximize usefulness to the client. The stream channel stability study was conducted on Shoal Creek for the City of Griffin, Georgia, Public Works and Stormwater Department. The focus {{of the study was to}} qualitatively assess the potential availability of sediment from channel sources so that the findings could be used to address downstream sedimentation issues. Time and funding constraints led to choosing a qualitative rapid geomorphic assessment method whereby channel evolution and other easily observable field data were collected for the entire watershed. Assessed reaches were then classified by degree of channel stability with results presented as a set of correlated maps, data tables, photographs, and reach narratives. This data set enabled stormwater management decision makers for the City of Griffin to prioritize the specific <b>erosion</b> <b>hot</b> spots for mitigation.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of electron beam (EB) physical vapour deposition (PVD) thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) and their application to moving components in the <b>hot</b> gas stream, <b>erosion</b> has become a prime concern. EB PVD TBCs, due to their unique columnar microstructure are far more strain tolerant than their plasma sprayed (PS) counter parts and can thus be used under more exacting operating conditions. It is under these operating conditions that erosion of the coated components is of primary importance. The main aim of this project was {{the development of a}} computer model capable of predicting the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs under various different conditions relevant to engine operation. In order to do this it was first necessary to determine the erosion mechanisms of EB PVD TBCs as well as their mechanical properties. Steady-state erosion and single impact studies together with SEM were used to determine the erosion mechanisms. While nano-indentation techniques were used to obtain the hardness and the YoungÃ¢Â Â s modulus of the EB PVD TBC. All these findings were then used {{in the development of a}} Monte Carlo type computational erosion model capable of predicting the erosive wear rate of EB PVD TBCs under various conditions. The model which has been developed is capable of predicting the erosion rate of EB PVD TBC to within 30 %, so long as the erosion falls within the defined mechanism. This can easily be checked against an erosion map which has been developed. This paper discusses the program and reports some results from running the program under various conditio...|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion has {{tremendous}} impacts on most river systems throughout the United States. Such non-point pollution results from land-use and agricultural practices {{and leads to}} sedimentation downstream, {{a decrease in the}} transport capacity of streams, an increase in the risk of flooding, filling of reservoirs, and eutrophication. This paper uses a spatially-explicit model to identify the sediment sources and delivery paths to channels and link these sediment supply processes to in-channel sediment transport and storage. The paper analyzes hillslope erosion and deposition rates using the Unit Stream Power Erosion and Deposition model in a GIS to estimate patterns of sediment supply to rivers in order to predict which portions of the channel network are more likely to store large amounts of fine sediments and thus are most sensitive to the effects of on and off-site soil erosion. This study focuses on the Pitman Creek Basin, a predominantly agricultural sub-basin in the Upper Green River in Kentucky. Results indicate that while much of the eroded sediments are redistributed within the hillslope system, a large proportion is also delivered to the channel. Sediment delivery to the stream is estimated using buffers defined in accordance with currently implemented conservation practices. These predictions have been tested by sampling the fine sediment content of the streambed at key locations along the channel network and comparing the observed patterns to those predicted by the soil erosion model. Overall, high intensity erosion tends to occur at contact between different vegetation covers, on barren lands and croplands, and 15 - 25 % slopes poorly protected by vegetation, thus highlighting several <b>erosion</b> <b>hot</b> spots...|$|R
40|$|Coastal erosion is {{a global}} problem, {{affecting}} sandy and rocky shores worldwide, and can be triggered by several causes. Local processes can generate <b>erosion</b> <b>hot</b> spots, whereas at the global scale, the main forcing are sea level rise, changes in storm climate and human interference. Beaches along the Mediterranean sea are strongly affected by coastal erosion. Recently, the Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone Management in the Mediterranean (PAP/RAC 2007) recommended the prevention of the erosion processes by restoring the natural adaptive capacity of the coast and by improving the knowledge on the state, development and impact of coastal erosion. In order {{to achieve the objective}} of the PAP/RAC protocol, we characterized 24 sandy beaches along ~ 270 km of the western coastline of the Sardinia island (western Mediterranean). Grain size and mineralogy of the foreshore sediments were analyzed and the intertidal elevation/bathymetric profile was measured using Differential Global Positioning System. Aerial photos were used to identify the shoreline configuration, the number of bars and morphodynamic features. A digital elevation model (DEM) of the adjacent shelf was produced and acoustic backscatter, grab and box-corer sediment samples were collected in order to characterize the seafloor and to identify the substrate lithology, particularly the distribution of sandy sediments. The investigated coastline is characterized by linear, multibarred beaches and wide transgressive dune fields formed by terrigenous sand and coarse sand. These linear beaches are alternated with embayed beaches which locally show a mixed terrigenous/bioclastic carbonate composition. Large sandy bodies were found in the inner shelf, often forming dune fields uncovered by mud drape. A database was created to facilitate the characterization of the beach systems along the studied coastline and adjacent inner shelf. It is anticipated that the database will be used by policy makers in support of the implementation of coastal erosion management strategies...|$|R
