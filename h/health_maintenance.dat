5|$|In February 1971, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{health insurance}} reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, federalization of Medicaid for the poor with dependent minor children, and support for <b>health</b> <b>maintenance</b> organizations. Hearings on national health insurance were held in 1971, but no bill {{had the support of}} House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long. Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the limited <b>Health</b> <b>Maintenance</b> Organization Act of 1973. He also played a leading role, with Senator Jacob Javits, in the creation and passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Nixon {{proposed}} {{health insurance}} reform—a {{private health insurance}} employer mandate, federalization of Medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children, and support for <b>health</b> <b>maintenance</b> organizations (HMOs). A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973. In 1974, Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform—a private health insurance employer mandate and replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all, with income-based premiums and cost sharing.|$|E

5|$|President Bill Clinton {{proposed}} a healthcare reform bill in 1993 {{that included a}} mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of <b>health</b> <b>maintenance</b> organizations. Republican Senators {{proposed a}}n alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance. Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex. Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over the {{proposed}} Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, Fletcher opposed a Democratic proposal that would have allowed individuals to sue their <b>health</b> <b>maintenance</b> organizations (HMOs), favoring instead a more limited bill drafted by Republican leadership that expanded the patient's ability to appeal HMO decisions. Many doctors in the Republican legislative caucus felt their party's bill did not go far enough; Fletcher and Tennessee Senator Bill Frist were notable exceptions. Fletcher's position cost him the support of the Kentucky Medical Association (KMA). After contributing to his campaign against Scorsone in 1998, KMA backed Scotty Baesler's bid to regain his old seat from Fletcher in 2000. However, Baesler only captured 35 percent of the vote to Fletcher's 53 percent. The remaining 12 percent went to third-party candidate Gatewood Galbraith.|$|E
25|$|Beyond its direct spending, the US {{government}} is also highly involved in healthcare through regulation and legislation.

HMOs had been declining before the law; by 2002 there were 500 such plans enrolling 76 million people.|$|E

40|$|Long-term <b>health</b> {{behavior}} <b>maintenance</b> {{remains a}} challenge for patients and health behavior interventionists. Resource-intensive systems of external reinforcement and behavioral cues can support behavior maintenance; an alternative approach is to promote patient internalization and self-regulation of health behaviors. Based in part on organismic internalization theory, self-determination theory, {{and the experience of}} patients successful at maintaining health behaviors, the health behavior internalization model (HBIM) is proposed to describe motivational factors associated with internalization processes and hypothesizes that integrated internalization may be associated with long-term <b>health</b> behavior <b>maintenance.</b> The HBIM identifies four self-needs (ownership, self-determination, security, and support) and four behavior-related needs (prefer-ence, context, competence, and coping) as motivating health behavior internalization. Behavior change strategies promoting integrated internalization are identified from self-determination theory, motivational interviewing, and transtheoretical model interventions. Other health behav-ior change constructs are reviewed in relation to internalization processes, and potential limits to the model are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The {{growth of}} managed care in the U.S. was spurred by the {{enactment}} of the <b>Health</b> <b>Maintenance</b> Organization Act of 1973. While managed care techniques were pioneered by <b>health</b> <b>maintenance</b> organizations, they are now used by a variety of private health benefit programs. Managed care is now nearly ubiquitous in the U.S, but has attracted controversy because it has had mixed results in its overall goal of controlling medical costs. Proponents and critics are also sharply divided on managed care's overall impact on the quality of U.S. health care delivery.|$|E
