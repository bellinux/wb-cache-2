5000|$|The {{serial number}} {{contains}} the year, month and {{day of the}} last change followed by a two <b>digit</b> <b>counter</b> (e.g. 2017030301 = 3. March 2017, 1st change at this day) or sometimes the current time. This method is recommended in RFC 1912 2.2 ...|$|E
5000|$|Control Track Pulse: Most are {{familiar}} with the digital [...] "counters" [...] on VHS recorders and camcorders, viewed via the onscreen display (OSD) and/or a dedicated LED display. These numbers are sometimes in real time format (hours:minutes:seconds), but are often only an ambiguous 4 digit sequential counter. These numbers advance up or down based on the machine counting a tape's control track pulses. This type of display is useful only as a simple and temporary reference, as it is very inaccurate, and the counter is reset to zero when a tape is inserted. A basic 4 <b>digit</b> <b>counter</b> is almost completely worthless, as their rate of advance was never standardized by manufacturers.|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} popularity of cloud computing, clients are storing their data in cloud servers and are using “software as a service” for computing services. However, clients’ data may be sensitive, critical, and private, and processing such data with cloud servers {{may result in}} losing data privacy or compromising data confidentiality. Some cloud servers may be dishonest, while malicious entities may compromise others. In order to protect data privacy and confidentiality, clients {{need to be able}} to hide their actual data values and send the obfuscated values to cloud servers. This thesis deals with the outsourcing of computing to cloud servers, in which clients’ images can be computed and stored. This thesis proposes a technique that obfuscates images before sending them to servers, so these servers can perform computations on images without knowing the actual images. The proposed technique is expected to ensure data privacy and confidentiality. Servers will not be able to identify an individual whose images are stored and manipulated by the server. In addition, our approach employs an obfuscating technique to maintain the confidentiality of images, allowing cloud servers to compute obfuscated data accurately without knowing the actual data value, thus supporting privacy and confidentiality. The proposed approach is based on the Rabin block cipher technique, which has some weaknesses, however. The main drawback is its decryption technique, which results in four values, and only one of these values represents the actual value of plain data. Another issue is that the blocking technique requires a private key for each block that requires a high-computing effort; requiring one private key for each block of data demands that a great number of keys be stored by the client. As a result, it decreases the robustness of the Rabin block cipher. This thesis proposes additional techniques to overcome some of the weaknesses of the Rabin block cipher by introducing some new features, such as tokenization, a <b>digit</b> <b>counter,</b> and a set of blocks. The new technique increases the privacy of data and decreases the computational complexity by requiring fewer private keys. The new features have been implemented in image processing in order to demonstrate their applicability. However, in order to apply our approach to images, we must first apply some preprocessing techniques on images to make them applicable to being obfuscated by our proposed obfuscating system...|$|E
5000|$|Counter entries. An IBM tabulating machine, {{such as the}} 402 or 407 series {{would have}} several {{counters}} available in different sizes. (For example, the IBM 402/403 had four sets each of 2, 4, 6 and 8 <b>digit</b> <b>counters,</b> labeled 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 4A, 4B etc.) Each counter had two counter control entries to specify either addition (plus) or subtraction (minus). If neither were pulsed, no operation was performed. If addition was commanded, a digit impulse wired from a column to a counter entry hub started the counter wheel turning. It stopped automatically at zero time. Thus a pulse at 8 time caused the wheel to advance 8 steps, adding the value 8 to that counter position. Carries within a group were performed automatically. Carry in and carry out hubs allowed counters to be coupled, permitting longer numbers to be accumulated. Subtraction was more complicated and used nines complement arithmetic.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} no learning based neural networks for signed <b>digit</b> <b>counters.</b> We first assume radix- 2 signed digit inputs and prove that a pj([log p] + 1) {{can be implemented}} with a depth- 2 neural network with at most p + 2 [log p] + 3 neural gates and the maximum weight and fan-in values {{in the order of}} O(p). Under the same assumption we investigate 7 j 2 counters and we propose an explicit depth- 3 (implicit depth- 2) neural network for such counters. Finally we assume radix-(2 p Γ 1) signed digit input representation and we prove that a pj 2 counter can be implemented with an explicit depth- 2 neural network with the size measured in terms of neural gates in the order of O(p 2) and with the maximum weight and fan-in values both in the order of O(p 2). 1 Introduction Multiplication schemes for VLSI implementations can be divided broadly in two categories, namely array and parallel multiplication schemes [1]. Both schemes reduce a matrix of partial products to a sing [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Like in its predecessor, Donkey Kong Jr. {{features}} a kill screen at level 22. Due {{to the level}} counter only having one <b>digit,</b> the <b>counter</b> shows numbers 1 to 9 in levels 1 to 9, seven blanks in levels 10 to 16, and the letters A to F in the levels 17-22. The kill screen occurs {{the same way as}} in Donkey Kong, where an integer overflow occurs after too big a result is given after a multiplication problem in the computing. The timer counts as if there are 700 points, then kills Donkey Kong Jr. until all lives are taken.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of the 407 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable control panel and a carriage tape. Exit hubs (impulse emitting) on the control panel are wired to entry hubs (impulse accepting) for the task to be done (see Wiring of unit record equipment). There are hubs for each card column (at both reading stations), print position, <b>counter</b> <b>digit,</b> and so on. Logic tests were also available.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a novel method for {{automatic}} gas meter reading from real world images. In {{a wide range}} of countries all over the world, the existing automatic technology is not adopted, usually the reading is manually done on site, and a picture is taken through a mobile device as a proof of reading. In order to confirm the reading, a tedious work of checking the proof images is commonly done offline by an operator. With this contribution we aim to supply an effective system, able to provide a real support to the validation process reducing the human effort and the time consumed. We exploit both region-based and Maximally Stable Extremal Regions techniques, during the phase involving the localization of the meter area and to detect the meter <b>counter</b> <b>digits</b> in the detection step respectively. The evaluation has been carried out on every step of our approach, {{as well as on the}} overall assessment; although the problem is complex, the proposed method leads to good results even when applied to degraded images, it represents an effective solution to the gas meter reading problem and it can be utilized in real applications...|$|R
