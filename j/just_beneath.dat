5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E
5|$|The Royalist {{commander}} of the castle, William Edgecumbe, retreated from the castle on 19 April and the defenders blew up part of the site as they left, leaving the remains to the Parliamentary commander Colonel George Fleetwood. Some of the castle's stonework {{appears to have been}} reused {{in the construction of the}} new Cromwell's Castle by the Parliamentarians, <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> King Charles's Castle, the new fortification being sited in a much better position to defend the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Tympanal organs {{or hearing}} organs {{consist of a}} {{membrane}} (tympanum) stretched across a frame backed by an air sac and associated sensory neurons, are found in two families. Several species of the genus Cicindela (Carabidae) have hearing organs on the dorsal surfaces of their first abdominal segments beneath the wings; two tribes in the Dynastinae (within the Scarabaeidae) have hearing organs <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> their pronotal shields or neck membranes. Both families are sensitive to ultrasonic frequencies, with strong evidence indicating they function to detect the presence of bats by their ultrasonic echolocation.|$|E

5|$|Soldiers of {{the species}} Globitermes sulphureus commit suicide by autothysis– rupturing a large gland <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> the surface of their cuticles. The thick, yellow fluid in the gland becomes very sticky on contact with the air, {{entangling}} ants or other insects which are trying to invade the nest. Another termite, Neocapriterme taracua, also engages in suicidal defence. Workers physically unable to use their mandibles while in a fight form a pouch full of chemicals, then deliberately rupture themselves, releasing toxic chemicals that paralyse and kill their enemies. The soldiers of the neotropical termite family Serritermitidae have a defence strategy which involves front gland autothysis, with the body rupturing between the head and abdomen. When soldiers guarding nest entrances are attacked by intruders, they engage in autothysis, creating a block that denies entry to any attacker.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Stoa {{was built}} upon the artificially raised {{portion of the}} Temple Mount platform. Arches {{underneath}} supported the columns of the Stoa, and provided service areas for the structures above. The Huldah Gates {{at the bottom of}} the southern wall led through corridors beneath the Stoa, rising to the Temple plaza, and served as the main entrance to the Temple compound for worshipers. Additional passages led to storage areas, and possibly provided secondary access to the Stoa and the Temple beyond. An arched overpass on the eastern side of the Temple Mount led to a gate which opened into the so-called Solomon's Stables <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> the eastern end of the Stoa. It is widely assumed that at least part of this area was used as a storage area in conjunction with business conducted in the Stoa.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{convection}} zone {{extends from}} 0.7 solar radii (200,000km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense enough or {{hot enough to}} transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, {{the density of the}} plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks {{to the base of the}} convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).|$|E

5|$|The {{works of}} American author Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809– October 7, 1849) include many poems, short stories, and one novel. His fiction spans {{multiple}} genres, including horror fiction, adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, a genre he {{is credited with}} inventing. These works are generally {{considered part of the}} Dark romanticism movement, a literary reaction to Transcendentalism. Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism and allegory. Meaning in literature, he said in his criticism, should be an undercurrent <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> the surface; works whose meanings are too obvious cease to be art. Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs. He often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology and physiognomy. His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Though known as a masterly practitioner of Gothic fiction, Poe did not invent the genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.|$|E

50|$|The {{arrangement}} {{has been}} used to even out axle loading. The weight distribution of the locomotive depends on the power unit, the engine and generator. If these are not placed symmetrically, the weight distribution is also biased to one end. Placing three axles beneath the engine end and <b>just</b> two <b>beneath</b> the other, with the lighter ancillaries, gives more even loading per-axle.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} uses of magnetic pistols would be to set the torpedo's depth to <b>just</b> <b>beneath</b> the keel of the target. The explosion under the target's keel would create a detonation shock wave, which could cause a ship's hull to rupture under the concussive water pressure. In this way, even large or heavily armored ships could be sunk or disabled with a single, well-placed hit.|$|E

25|$|Allium tricoccum is a bulb-forming {{perennial}} with broad, smooth, {{light green}} leaves, often with deep purple or burgundy tints {{on the lower}} stems, and a scallion-like stalk and bulb.

25|$|Between 1982–1983 the P7 {{received}} several modifications, mainly to address American market demand and shooter preferences. These modifications {{resulted in the}} P7M8 model.

The trigger guard was equipped with a synthetic heat shield that protects the shooter from excessive heating and a lanyard attachment loop was added in place of the previous magazine heel release. The firing pin and its bushing were also changed.|$|E

The canopy of leaves, high overhead, formed a shelter from sun and rain, and the dwellers in the grove could all look past the straight tree-trunks and across the grassy slopes to the purple waters of the Nonestic Ocean.|$|R
