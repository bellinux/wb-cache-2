40|$|The {{resonance}} {{characteristics of}} a <b>driven</b> <b>damped</b> harmonic oscillator are well known. Unlike harmonic oscillators which are guided by parabolic potentials, a simple pendulum oscillates under sinusoidal potentials. The problem of an undamped pendulum has been investigated to a great extent. However, the resonance {{characteristics of a}} <b>driven</b> <b>damped</b> pendulum have not been re- ported so far due to the difficulty in solving the problem analytically. In the present work we report the resonance characteristics of a <b>driven</b> <b>damped</b> pendulum calculated numerically. The results are compared with the resonance characteristics of a <b>damped</b> <b>driven</b> harmonic oscillator. The work can be of pedagogic interest too as it reveals the richness of <b>driven</b> <b>damped</b> motion of a simple pendulum in comparison to and how strikingly it differs from the motion of a <b>driven</b> <b>damped</b> harmonic oscillator.

40|$|We {{study the}} ratchet {{effect of a}} <b>damped</b> {{relativistic}} particle <b>driven</b> by both asymmetric temporal bi-harmonic and time-periodic piecewise constant forces. This system can be formally solved for any external force, providing the ratchet velocity as a non-linear functional of the driving force. This allows us to explicitly illustrate the functional Taylor expansion formalism recently proposed {{for this kind of}} systems. The Taylor expansion reveals particularly useful to obtain the shape of the current when the force is periodic, piecewise constant. We also illustrate the somewhat counterintuitive effect that introducing damping may induce a ratchet effect. When the force is symmetric under time-reversal and the system is undamped, under symmetry principles no ratchet effect is possible. In this situation increasing damping generates a ratchet current which, upon increasing the damping coefficient eventually reaches a maximum and decreases toward zero. We argue that this effect is not specific of this example and should appear in any ratchet system with tunable <b>damping</b> <b>driven</b> by a time-reversible external force.

40|$|Chaotic {{tunneling}} in a driven double-well {{system is}} investigated in absence {{as well as}} in the presence of dissipation. As the constitutive mechanism of chaos-assisted tunneling, we focus on the dynamics in the vicinity of three-level crossings in the quasienergy spectrum. The coherent quantum dynamics near the crossing is described satisfactorily by a three-state model. It fails, however, for the corresponding dissipative dynamics, because incoherent transitions due to the interaction with the environment indirectly couple the three states in the crossing to the remaining quasienergy states. The asymptotic state of the driven dissipative quantum dynamics partially resembles the, possibly strange, attractor of the corresponding <b>damped</b> <b>driven</b> classical dynamics, but also exhibits characteristic quantum effects.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of nonlinear anisotropic <b>damping,</b> <b>driven</b> {{by the presence}} of Rashba spin-orbit coupling in thin ferromagnetic metals, are examined for the dynamics of topological magnetic solitons such as domain walls, vortices, and skyrmions. The damping is found to affect Bloch and Néel walls differently in the steady state regime below Walker breakdown and leads to a monotonic increase in the wall velocity above this transition for large values of the Rashba coefficient. For vortices and skyrmions, a generalization of the damping tensor within the Thiele formalism is presented. It is found that chiral components of the damping affect vortex- and hedgehog-like skyrmions in different ways, but the dominant effect is an overall increase in the viscous-like damping.
