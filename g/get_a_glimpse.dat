Actor Robert Baker confirmed that he is the voice of Cobra Commander in the sequel.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E

500|$|On 13 April 1919, Andranik reached Etchmiadzin, {{the seat}} of Catholicos of All Armenians and the {{religious}} center of the Armenians, who helped the troops prepare for disbanding. His 5,000-strong division had dwindled to 1,350 soldiers. As a result of Andranik's disagreements with the Dashnak government and the diplomatic machinations of the British in the Caucasus, Andranik disbanded his division and handed his belongings and weapons to the Catholicos George V. On 27 April 1919, he left Etchmiadzin accompanied by 15 officers, and went to Tiflis on a special train; according to Blackwood, [...] "news of his journey traveled before him. At every station crowds were waiting to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of their national hero."

500|$|It Takes a Church has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Tom Conroy of Media Life enjoyed the premiere episode, {{arguing that it}} may even attract a secular audience: [...] "Even secular viewers will be curious to see which one Angela picks, and they’ll <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> into a subculture that is largely invisible on TV. Members of that subculture, on the other hand, will watch It Takes a Church and say, 'Amen!'". Contrastly, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times called the series [...] "utterly frivolous," [...] and called into question the [...] "state of America's spiritual health" [...] after watching an episode. Genzlinger also argued that the show was a {{not much more than}} a [...] "desperate" [...] effort to find something the conservative Christian audience will watch. Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment added that viewers should [...] "pass" [...] on the series, calling GSN's The American Bible Challenge a better [...] "solid game format." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Sunshine Days" [...] was mixed. Aaron Kinney from Salon {{magazine was}} critical of the producers' idea to air the entry as the penultimate episode {{leading up to the}} heavily-promoted series finale. Kinney pointed out that the episode {{had little to do with}} the show's overarching storyline, but it was nevertheless touted as part of The X-Files [...] "Endgame" [...] promotion strategy. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it a [...] "C" [...] grade. She sarcastically wrote, [...] "nine years of mytharc to start to wrap up. And so the penultimate episode of The X-Files, naturally, is devoted to The Brady Bunch." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the episode [...] "is not one of Gilligan's very best stories", citing issues with its tone and its characterization of Oliver Martin. The two, however, did praise Gilligan's humanized style, writing, [...] "he gives Scully the proof of the paranormal she's been needing" [...] but shows that the most important [...] "things to care about in life" [...] are [...] "humans". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a 7 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this was a pleasant yet bittersweet episode, one that leaves the characters in relative peace. It is the first time that we <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of what the writers are thinking as the series comes to a close. Now all that's left is the mythology, which I can only hope will end on a similarly pleasant note." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, said that [...] "the central story falls a bit flat", but the episode worked well as a [...] "paean to medium of television itself" [...] and he felt it was an appropriate vehicle for the series' penultimate installment.|$|E

500|$|In {{their book}} Who is the Doctor, Graeme Burk and Robert Smith {{described}} Adam in [...] "Dalek" [...] as [...] "somewhat annoying". Burk {{referred to him}} in [...] "The Long Game" [...] as [...] "arrogant and narcissistic", which made Rose appear shallow for insisting he travel with them, but felt that Langley did [...] "a superb job" [...] conveying the character's flaws. He stated that it was [...] "a shame" [...] that the backstory of Adam's motivations were cut from the script, {{as it would have}} made his character more believable. The two found a logical flaw in the Doctor's decision to drop Adam off, as it was a possibility that someone could get their hands on the future technology. Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern gave a positive overview of Adam, describing the character as [...] "bumptious yet likeable" [...] and his departure as [...] "literary precision". He commented that Adam [...] "adds an interesting dynamic, subtly different" [...] from Mickey Smith and Captain Jack Harkness, who also worked with Rose and the Ninth Doctor. Instead of threatening the Doctor and Rose's relationship, Adam [...] "serves to strengthen it". In 2010 Mark Harrison of Den of Geek listed the character's exit from the TARDIS as the tenth greatest companion farewell scene stating that it was [...] "great to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the Doctor outright booting someone out." [...] He felt that the character [...] "struck out in spectacular fashion" [...] by attempting to steal future technology and that his eventual fate was an example of poetic justice. Charlie Jane Anders also praised the concept of Adam's story arc positioning his departure as the seventh most depressing exit from a companion in Doctor Whos history. She felt that to have [...] "a companion who flunks out" [...] was one of Davies' [...] "cleverest ideas" [...] as executive producer of the series and that Adam's human flaws made him relatable. In 2010 readers of the Radio Times voted Adam the 45th most popular companion, out of forty-eight viable options.|$|E
