50|$|The climate at {{this time}} was warm; it had reached a maximum during a series of warming events during the Early Eocene with the Princeton Chert likely {{deposited}} after the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 and during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. During this time the sea warmed approximately 4 °C and terrestrial temperatures were several degrees warmer than today, meaning little or no ice {{was present at the}} poles. The temperature difference between poles and equator was small. This long term warmth is thought to be due to increased greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 trapping more heat. The reason for this sudden increase in CO2 is unknown, but it is hypothesised that it was due to an increase in ocean floor being recycled via volcanic arcs and metamorphic <b>decarbonation</b> reactions. This happened because the ocean between India and Asia was disappearing and being replaced by the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau due to the collision of tectonic plates. Also at the time, Australia, which was joined to Antarctica, was beginning to move northwards.|$|E
50|$|A {{correlation}} {{has been}} proposed between the episodic formation of UHT granulites and the episodic assembly and disruption of supercontinents or the plume activity during various periods in Earth history. UHT granulites are generally characterized by dry mineral assemblages, the stability of which require low water activities. The direct evidence for the involvement of CO2-rich fluids in generating diagnostic UHT assemblages has been recorded from the common occurrence of pure CO2 fluid inclusions in buffering the water activity and stabilizing the anhydrous mineralogy of UHT rocks {{have come from the}} finding of abundant pure CO2 fluid inclusions in these rocks. UHT metamorphism has been recently evaluated in the plate tectonic context using modern analogues and {{it has been suggested that}} both post-collisional extension and rifting play a crucial role. The abundant CO2 liberated by subsolidus <b>decarbonation</b> along consuming plate boundaries was probably one of the factors that contributed to the greenhouse effect thereby triggering the deglaciation of snowball Earth. Based on the distributions of carbonated subcontinental mantle and crustal domains that have undergone CO2-aided dry metamorphism at extreme conditions, Santosh and Omori (2008b) speculated that the UHT rocks might represent windows for the transfer of CO2 from the mantle into the mid crust and ultimately to the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{middle to}} late Eocene marks {{not only the}} switch from warming to cooling, but also the change in carbon dioxide from {{increasing}} to decreasing. At {{the end of the}} Eocene Optimum, carbon dioxide began decreasing due to increased siliceous plankton productivity and marine carbon burial. At the beginning of the middle Eocene an event that may have triggered or helped with the draw down of carbon dioxide was the Azolla event at around 49 million years ago. With the equable climate during the early Eocene, warm temperatures in the arctic allowed for the growth of azolla, which is a floating aquatic fern, on the Arctic Ocean. Compared to current carbon dioxide levels, these azolla grew rapidly in the enhanced carbon dioxide levels found in the early Eocene. As these azolla sank into the Arctic Ocean, they became buried and sequestered their carbon into the seabed. This event could have led to a draw down of atmospheric carbon dioxide of up to 470 ppm. Assuming the carbon dioxide concentrations were at 900 ppmv prior to the Azolla Event they would have dropped to 430 ppmv, or 30 ppmv more than they are today, after the Azolla Event. Another event during the middle Eocene that was a sudden and temporary reversal of the cooling conditions was the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum. At around 41.5 million years ago, stable isotopic analysis of samples from Southern Ocean drilling sites indicated a warming event for 600 thousand years. A sharp increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide was observed with a maximum of 4000 ppm: the highest amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide detected during the Eocene. The main hypothesis for such a radical transition was due to the continental drift and collision of the India continent with the Asia continent and the resulting formation of the Himalayas. Another hypothesis involves extensive sea floor rifting and metamorphic <b>decarbonation</b> reactions releasing considerable amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.|$|E

Such work can inform models of C cycling at convergent margins, helping to constrain the efficiency of return of initially subducted C via arc volcanism and the fraction of this subducted C entering the deeper mantle beyond arcs. In the metabasaltic rocks, the preservation of finely disseminated carbonate with δ 13 C overlapping that of seafloor-altered protoliths, and the minimal mineralogical evidence of <b>decarbonation,</b> indicates large degrees of carbonate retention in this suite extending to UHP conditions similar to those beneath modern volcanic fronts. For many of the metabasalts, the δ 18 O of this carbonate can be explained by closed-system equilibration with silicate phases (e. g., garnet, clinopyroxene) during HP/UHP metamorphism. Larger volumes of carbonate preserved in interpillow regions and as breccia-filling largely escaped <b>decarbonation,</b> showing little or no evidence for reaction with adjacent metabasalt. Calculated devolatilization histories demonstrate that, in a closed-system model, carbonate in metabasaltic rocks can largely be preserved to depths approaching those beneath volcanic fronts (80 – 90 km). Modeling of open-system behavior indicates that episodic infiltration of such rocks by H 2 O-rich fluids would have greatly enhanced <b>decarbonation.</b> Trends in O–C isotope composition of carbonate in some metabasaltic suites likely reflect effects of infiltration by externally-derived fluid with or without resulting <b>decarbonation.</b> Most carbonated ultramafic rocks similarly show little mineralogical evidence for <b>decarbonation,</b> consistent with calculated reaction histories, and have δ 13 C largely overlapping that of seafloor equivalents. However, the high-grade ophicarbonates show more restricted ranges in δ 18 O consistent with some control by infiltrating fluids, likely during subduction. This combination of field, petrographic, and isotopic evidence, together with calculated <b>decarbonation</b> histories, is consistent with minimal loss of CO 2 from these rocks via <b>decarbonation</b> during forearc metamorphism. Combining our results with those of Cook-Kollars et al. (2014; Chemical Geology) for associated W.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{focuses on}} {{the control of the}} {{smoldering}} front propagating in a porous medium containing fixed carbon and carbonates (CaCO 3). The main objective is to reduce the front temperature, in situ (oil recovery or gas production from oil shale) or in process (combustion of semicoke), in order to limit the medium <b>decarbonation</b> and the resulting CO 2 emissions. The reactive porous medium retained to realize the laboratory experiments is a crushed (0. 5 to 2 mm) and pre-pyrolyed oil shale, called semicoke. The front propagates in co-current. The first technique experimentally tested is the addition to the semicoke of an inert material (sand) and/or a reactive material (CaCO 3) to vary the contents of fixed carbon and of CaCO 3, independently. We show that the increase of the CaCO 3 content enables to reduce the temperature to 800 °C, but not below; this does not allow to avoid <b>decarbonation.</b> Bringing down the fixed carbon content enables to reduce the front temperature, see even to reach extinction. In the lowest temperatures of propagation, the <b>decarbonation</b> is strongly limited. On the other hand, the front slows down because it does not use all of the fed oxygen. The second original technique consists in adding CO 2 (20 mol. %) to the oxidizer air. We show that for a hot front, the decarbonated fraction is reduced from 100 % down to 70 %, and the CO production at fixed carbon oxidation is increased; this leads to increase the LCV of the produced gas. For a cold front, the <b>decarbonation</b> which was 20 %, is totally avoided by adding CO 2. Finely, experiments are proposed in the “reaction trailing” combustion mode, little known and implemented. This mode has the major interest to avoid the reactions of “Lower Temperature Oxidation” prejudicial for oil or gas yields in in situ process. Stable and repeatable experiments are realized with different oxygen fractions in feeding gas. The front temperature is directly linked to this parameter; the <b>decarbonation</b> is clearly limited in this mode of propagation. Two types of modeling are proposed. A mass and thermal balance based on simple analytical expressions enables to evaluate the front temperature and velocity. A numerical model developed by IMFT is based on convective/diffusive heat and mass transfer equations coupled with the oxidation reactions (into CO and CO 2) and CaCO 3 <b>decarbonation</b> is proposed.

Our experiments aim to reproduce the conditions at the periphery of magma chamber where carbonate host rock is influenced by, but not readily assimilated by, magma. This permits the investigation of the natural conditions at which circulating fluids/gases promote infiltration reactions typical of metasomatic skarns that can involve large volumes of subvolcanic carbonate basements.

40|$|International audienceThe {{one-step}} {{synthesis of}} carbonated hydroxyapatite (CAP) using calcite and different orthophosphates {{was investigated in}} a closed batch reactor. Only orthophosphoric acid {{could lead to the}} complete decomposition of calcite particles, when the reaction temperature was set at 80 degrees C. On the other hand, the reaction time and the dilution of the initial calcite suspension had no significant influence on the formation of the solid products. CAP was formed as the main crystalline calcium phosphate with the carbonate content in the range of 4. 2 - 4. 6 wt. %. The thermal <b>decarbonation</b> of the synthesized CAP started at 750 degrees C but it was only significant at 1000 degrees C under air atmosphere. This thermal <b>decarbonation</b> was total at 1200 degrees C or above. All CAP samples and products following thermal treatments were found bioactive in the test using simulated body fluid (SBF) solution...|$|E

Solid reactants composed of CaO as the reactant and CaTiO 3 as the inert framework were prepared using the conventional powder method or the metal alkoxide method. Upon experiments of cyclic operation between CaO carbonation and CaCO 3 <b>decarbonation</b> at 1023 K, the reaction reversibility {{of the solid}} reactants with the inert CaTiO 3 framework was steady, whereas that of the solid reactant without the inert framework decreased with sintering of the solid particles during cyclic operation. Reaction rates for the first carbonation and the <b>decarbonation</b> of solid reactant prepared using the alkoxide method were about 1. 8 and 2. 4 times faster, respectively, than for those prepared by the powder method due to the smaller average diameter of reactant particles derived from the alkoxide method. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{sintering}} behavior of synthetic inorganic carbonates chemically identical to barytocalcite (BaCa(CO 3) (2), 8. 1 wt. % C), kutnahorite (CaMn(CO 3) (2), 11. 1 mass% C) and rhodochrosite (MnCO 3, 10. 5 wt. % C) for C- 14 immobilization. As carbonates are time temperature dependently subjected to <b>decarbonation</b> {{due to the}} loss of carbon dioxide, spark plasma sintering (SPS) appeared to be the most suitable method for the study. It was shown that densification and <b>decarbonation</b> are overlapping phenomena for kutnahorite and rhodochrosite, lowering the carbon final content, whereas barytocalcite was successfully densified without carbon loss. Barytocalcite pellets of 30 mm diameter with a relative density of 92 % and a carbon content of 7. 78 +/- 0. 28 wt. % were obtained. The study highlighted the role of sintering pressure in carbon dioxide volatilization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the mechanical behaviour and microstructural {{evolution of a}} dolomite marble from Mt. Frerone (Adamello, N-Italy) during <b>decarbonation</b> to calcite and periclase in torsion experiments. Tests were performed in a Paterson gas-medium apparatus on cylindrical samples of 10 mm diameter and 10 mm length. Experiments were conducted at 800 °C, 300 MPa confining pressure under both vented and non-vented conditions, up to a maximum bulk shear strain of about γ = 1. 8, at different strain rates (3 × 10 − 5 s − 1 up to 3 × 10 − 4 s − 1). Under hydrostatic conditions the nominal equilibrium P(CO₂) should be around 100 MPa, but in the vented experiments the CO₂ was free to escape, causing the breakdown of dolomite. During the decomposition, deformation was systematically localized {{at the ends of}} the specimens, near the porous spacers into a fine-grained mixture of calcite and periclase. Due to the low permeability of the marble, pore fluid could not escape from {{the central part of the}} sample building up CO₂ pressure which suppressed the <b>decarbonation</b> reaction. The fluid pressure embrittled the material and caused the development of en-echelon tension fractures, inclined opposite to the sense of shear. We conclude that <b>decarbonation</b> produced a weak polyphase matrix composed of submicron sized reaction products. Such a small grain size induced strain localization which was probably promoted by a switch from grain-size insensitive to grain-size sensitive deformation mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{decomposition}} of dolomite {{in the presence}} of CO 2 in a calcination environment is investigated by means of in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The in situ XRD results suggest that dolomite decomposes directly at a temperature around 700 °C into MgO and CaO. Immediate carbonation of nascent CaO crystals leads to the formation of calcite as an intermediate product of decomposition. Subsequently, <b>decarbonation</b> of this poorly crystalline calcite occurs when the reaction is thermodynamically favorable and sufficiently fast at a temperature depending on the CO 2 partial pressure in the calcination atmosphere. <b>Decarbonation</b> of this dolomitic calcite occurs at a lower temperature than limestone <b>decarbonation</b> due to the relatively low crystallinity of the former. Full {{decomposition of}} dolomite leads also to a relatively low crystalline CaO, which exhibits a high reactivity as compared to limestone derived CaO. Under CO 2 capture conditions in the Calcium-Looping (CaL) process, MgO grains remain inert yet favor the carbonation reactivity of dolomitic CaO especially in the solid-state diffusion controlled phase. The fundamental mechanism that drives the crystallographic transformation of dolomite {{in the presence of}} CO 2 is thus responsible for its fast calcination kinetics and the high carbonation reactivity of dolomitic CaO, which makes natural dolomite a potentially advantageous alternative to limestone for CO 2 capture in the CaL technology as well as SO 2 in situ removal in oxy-combustion fluidized bed reactors.

40|$|The {{humification}} {{degrees of}} humic acids extracted from calcareous and decarbonated Rendzinas under different land use were characterized upon their optical properties, {{to evaluate the}} influence of carbonate leaching (<b>decarbonation)</b> and different land uses. <b>Decarbonation</b> influenced the humification degree of humic acids positively. Base leaching and acidification of decarbonated Rendzinas led to a decrease in humification degree of humic acids. In calcareous Rendzinas, the humification degree of humic acids was in descending order: grassland>arable land>forest land, and in decarbonated Rendzinas: arable land>grassland>forest land. The humification degree of humic acids was higher in the calcareous forest and grassland Rendzinas compared to decarbonated Rendzinas, analogously in decarbonated arable land compared to calcareous arable land Rendzinas. Differences in the humification degree of humic acids among various land uses that emerged between calcareous and decarbonated Rendzinas indicate the dominant influence of soil chemical characteristics (carbonate content and pH value) compared with {{the quantity and quality}} of the organic litter input...|$|E
