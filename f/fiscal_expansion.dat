40|$|Abstract This paper conducts an {{empirical}} {{investigation of the}} effects of temporary versus persistent fiscal policy shocks. Using data from the US I show that short lived <b>fiscal</b> <b>expansions</b> {{have a positive effect on}} output and consumption; while persistent fiscal shocks generate negative effects on consumption and - to a lesser extent - on output. Persistent <b>fiscal</b> <b>expansions</b> are associated with an increase in precautionary savings, collapse in consumers' confidence and an increase the yield curve's term premium. Consistently with consumption smoothing, short-lived <b>fiscal</b> <b>expansions</b> generate a temporary deficit in the current account, while persistent fiscal shocks leave the external balance unaffected. I find evidence of non linearity in the effects of temporary and persistent fiscal shocks according to (i) the level of public debt and (ii) the state of the business cycle. Persistent fiscal shocks have larger negative effects on consumption and output if they take place at high levels of public debt, possibly due to the higher costs of fiscal stabilization. The state of the business cycle is also very relevant. Persistent fiscal shocks generate negative multipliers in times of economic boom, but these negative multipliers disappear in periods of recession when credit constraints are more likely to bind. On the other hand, temporary fiscal shocks have positive effects both in times of expansion and in times of recession, but with the multipliers being way larger in the latter case. Differently with what hypothesized by the earlier literature on non-Keynesian fiscal effects, I find little evidence that these effects are asymmetric depending on the size of the shocks...|$|R

Between 1979 and 1982, the Schmidt administration pursued such policies in an effort to reduce unemployment. These were moderately successful, as the fiscal measures introduced after 1977, with reductions in income and wealth taxes and an increase in the medium-term public investment programme, were estimated to have created 160,000 additional jobs in 1978-79, or 300,000 if additional public sector employment was included in the figure.

50|$|In the {{classical}} view, the {{expansionary fiscal policy}} also decreases net exports, which has a mitigating effect on national output and income. When government borrowing increases interest rates it attracts foreign capital from foreign investors. This is because, all other things being equal, the bonds issued from a country executing expansionary fiscal policy now offer {{a higher rate of}} return. In other words, companies wanting to finance projects must compete with their government for capital so they offer higher rates of return. To purchase bonds originating from a certain country, foreign investors must obtain that country's currency. Therefore, when foreign capital flows into the country undergoing <b>fiscal</b> <b>expansion,</b> demand for that country's currency increases. This causes the currency to appreciate, reducing the cost of imports and making exports from that country more expensive to foreigners. Consequently, exports decrease and imports increase, reducing demand from net exports.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, {{according}} to the China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the urban per capita annual income at US$2525 was approximately three {{times that of the}} rural per capita annual income. This was the widest income gap recorded since 1978. Urban-biased economic policies adopted by the government contribute to the income disparities. This is also known as the ‘artificial’ result of the rural-urban divide. In terms of the share of investments allotted by the state, urban areas had a larger proportion when compared with rural areas. In the period 1986-1992, investments to urban state-owned enterprises (SOE) accounted for more than 25% of the total government budget. On the other hand, less than 10% of the government budget was allocated to investments in the rural economy in the same period by the state despite the fact that about 73-76% of the total population lived in the rural areas. However, the burden of the inflation caused by the <b>fiscal</b> <b>expansion,</b> which at that time was at a level of approximately 8.5%, was shared by all including the rural population. Such biased allocation of government finances to the urban sector meant that the wages earned by urban workers also include these government fiscal transfers. This is not forgetting the relatively higher proportions of credit loans the government also provided to the urban SOEs in the same period. Meanwhile, the wages earned by the rural workers came mainly from growth in output only. These urban-biased policies reflect the importance of the urban minority to the government relative to the rural majority.|$|E

This paper studies the effects of fiscal policy response in 118 episodes of systemic banking crisis in advanced and emerging market countries during 1980 – 2008. It finds that timely countercyclical fiscal measures contribute to shortening the length of crisis episodes by stimulating aggregate demand. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>expansions</b> that rely mostly on measures to support government consumption are more effective in shortening the crisis duration than those based on public investment or income tax cuts. But these results do not hold for countries with limited fiscal space where <b>fiscal</b> <b>expansions</b> are prevented by funding constraints. The composition of countercyclical fiscal responses matters as well for output recovery after the crisis, with public investment yielding the strongest impact on growth.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the dynamics and determinants of inflation in the Ottoman Empire during the 1586 - 1913 period. There are two possible reasons for inflation: <b>fiscal</b> <b>expansion</b> and monetary expansion, {{which could be}} generated through the debasement of local currency (Akçe). We used a set of political and structural variables in order to explain the change in inflation dynamics. In particular, we considered the war years, periods of Ottoman history that show different characteristics (the slow-down period, the recession period and the break-up period) and the period of constitutional monarchy. Moreover, we tested whether the inflation process was the same for each sultan and whether each sultan's behavior {{during the first year}} was {{different from the rest of}} his reign. The empirical evidence reported here suggests that war accelerated inflation as expected and <b>fiscal</b> <b>expansion</b> rather than the debasement of the Akçe was the main reason for inflation. Moreover, the slow-down, the recession and the break-up periods affected inflation positively; both <b>fiscal</b> <b>expansion</b> and the debasement of the Akçe were seen in these three periods as sources of inflation. While employing different inflationary policies during his reign, each sultan accelerated inflation in the first year of his reign by the debasement of the Akçe or by <b>fiscal</b> <b>expansion.</b> Last, the constitutional monarchy period had a significant positive effect on inflation although <b>fiscal</b> <b>expansion,</b> rather than the debasement of the Akçe was the source of inflation during this period...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{panel of}} OECD {{countries}} from 1960 to 2002, this paper shows that financial markets value fiscal discipline. Interest rates, particularly those of long-term government bonds, decrease when countries' fiscal position improves and increase around periods of budget deteriorations.

In addition, the paper shows that results depend on countries' initial fiscal conditions and {{on the type of}} fiscal consolidations. Fiscal adjustments that occur in country-years with high levels of government defcit, that are implemented by cutting government spending, and that generate a permanent and substantial decrease in government debt are associated with larger reductions in interest rates and increases in stock market prices.
