40|$|This study {{examines}} the potential negative influences of <b>dry</b> midlevel <b>air</b> {{on the development}} of tropical cyclones (specifically, its role in enhancing cold downdraft activity and suppressing storm development). The Weather Research and Forecasting model is used to construct two sets of idealized simulations of hurricane development in environments with different configurations of <b>dry</b> <b>air.</b> The first set of simulations begins with <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> located north of the vortex center by distances ranging from 0 to 270 km, whereas the second set of simulations begins with <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> completely surrounding the vortex, but with moist envelopes in the vortex core ranging in size from 0 to 150 km in radius. No impact of the <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> is seen for dry layers located more than 270 km north of the initial vortex center (approximately 3 times the initial radius of maximum wind). When the <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> is initially closer to the vortex center, it suppresses convective development where it entrains into the storm circulation, leading to increasingly asymmetric convection and slower storm development. The presence of <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> throughout the domain, including the vortex center, substantially slows storm development. However, the presence of a moist envelope around the vortex center eliminates the deleterious impact on storm intensity. Instead, storm size is significantly reduced. The simulations suggest that <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> slows intensification only when it is located very close to the vortex core at early times. When it does slow storm development, it does so primarily by inducing outward- moving convective asymmetries that temporarily shift latent heating radially outward away from the high-vorticity inner core...|$|R
40|$|The {{impacts of}} <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> on {{tropical}} cyclone formation are {{examined in the}} numerical model simulations of ex-Gaston (2010) and pre-Fay (2008). The former {{can be regarded as}} a non-developing system as it failed to redevelop after being downgraded into a remnant low, and the latter developed into a tropical cyclone despite lateral <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> entrainment and transient upper-level <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> intrusion.

50|$|In-storage drying methods {{refers to}} those grain is dried {{and stored in}} the same container. Low-temperature drying, also known as near-ambient drying, is one of in-storage drying methods. There are four major factors which {{influence}} low temperature drying: the variability of weather, the harvest moisture content, the air flow in the storage bin {{and the amount of}} heated air. Most low-temperature dryers are built to dry grain as slowly as possible, while in the same time less spoilage on the grain. It is suggested that low temperature drying system is better operated when the average daily temperature is between 30 °C and 50 °C. Rather than control the <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> temperature, the low-temperature drying focuses on the relative humidity in order to achieve equilibrium moisture content (EMC) in all grain layers. Low-temperature drying process usually takes 5 days to several months depends on several important variables: weather, airflow, initial moisture content and amount of heat used. Among which, airflow is the key factor. Without appropriate airflow rate, spoilage will occur before drying is completed. By using heated air (LP heat, electric heat and solar heat), the relative humidity of the <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> is better controlled to achieve the desired moisture content. Usually, heated air dryer is used when the relative humidity larger than 70%. In electric heat dryers, an electrical resistant heater is usually placed before the fan to heat the airstream. In some case, a humidistat is employed to control the heater. In solar heat dryers, the <b>drying</b> <b>air</b> passes through the solar collector first to be heated (usually 10 to 12 °F rise), then enters the bin through the fan and motor. The advantages of in-storage low temperature drying are quick filling, high quality product, less equipment requirement; while the disadvantages are long drying time, electrical demand if using electric heat, high management skills and uncertain harvest moisture content.|$|E

40|$|Dynamics of the Madden–Julian {{oscillation}} (DYNAMO) {{was conducted}} over the equatorial Indian Ocean (IO) from October 2011 to March 2012. During mid- to late November, a strong Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) event, denoted MJO- 2, initiated {{in the western}} IO and passed through the DYNAMO observation array. <b>Dry</b> <b>air</b> intrusions associated with synoptic variability in the equatorial region {{played a key role}} in the evolution of MJO- 2. First, a sharp <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> intrusion surging from the subtropics into the equatorial region suppresses convection in the ITCZ south of the equator. This diminishes subsidence on the equator associated with the ITCZ convection, which leads to an equatorward shift of convection. It is viewed as a contributing factor for the onset of equatorial convection in MJO- 2. Once the MJO convection is established, a second type of <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> intrusion is related to synoptic gyres within the MJO convective envelope. The westward-propagating gyres draw <b>drier</b> <b>air</b> from the subtropics into the equatorial region on the west side of theMJO- 2. This <b>dry</b> <b>air</b> intrusion contributes to a 1 – 2 -day break in the rainfall during the active phase of MJO- 2.
