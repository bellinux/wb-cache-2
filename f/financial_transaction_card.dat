40|$|Abstract—Credit {{cards are}} key {{instruments}} in personal <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Credit <b>card</b> payment systems {{used in these}} transactions and operated by merchants are often targeted by hackers to steal the card data. To address this threat, the payment card industry establishes a mandatory security compliance standard for businesses that process credit cards. A central pre-requisite for this compliance procedure is to identify the credit card data flow, specifically, the stages of the <b>card</b> <b>transaction</b> processing and the server nodes that touch credit card data as they travel through the organization. In practice, this pre-requisite poses a challenge to merchants. As the payment infrastructure is implemented and later maintained, it often deviates from the original documented design. Without consistent tracking and auditing of changes, such deviations in many cases remain undocumented. Therefore building the credit card data flow for a given payment card processing infrastructure is considered a daunting task {{that at this point}} requires significant manual efforts. This paper describes a tool that is designed to automate the task of identifying the credit card data flow in commercial payment systems running on virtualized servers hosted in private cloud environments. This tool leverages virtual machine introspection technology to keep track of credit card data flows across multiple machines in real time without requiring intrusive instrumentation of the hypervisor, virtual machines, middleware or application source code. Effectiveness of this tool is demonstrated through its successful discovery of the credit card data flow of several open and closed source payment applications.

M.) charges when an access device (commonly known as a debit card or credit card) is used to make a cash withdrawal from, or to engage in any other transaction that is not subject to tax at an A. T.

Gross receipts from the retail sale of tangible personal property do not include debit card charges which the retailer may collect from the customer when all of the following apply: (1) the debit card charges are separately stated, (2) the consumer would not incur the charge if he or she did not use the debit card, (3) the fee is not calculated {{as a percentage of the}} amount of the purchase, and (4) the charge is reasonably related to the cost of the transaction to the retailer.

This doctoral thesis represents an investigation into financial fraud in online banking and card payment systems in the UK and China, involving network security, online <b>financial</b> <b>transactions,</b> internet fraud, <b>card</b> payment systems and individuals’ perception of and behaviours towards electronic environments. In contrast to previous studies, the research questions were tackled by survey questionnaires both in the UK and China, with a particular interest in fraud and attempted fraud. The main findings from the UK respondents were that those with higher IT skill and younger respondents {{are more likely to}} be defrauded on the internet. Certain types of online activities are associated with higher risks of fraud, these being internet banking; online shopping and media downloading. Furthermore, four predictors (internet banking, online education services, downloading media and length of debit card usage) provided significant effects in the logistic regression model to explain fraud occurrence in the UK. Based on the data collected in China, younger respondents were more likely to have higher general IT skill and higher educational qualifications. However, online shopping was the only online activity which was significantly correlated to fraud occurrence. Finally, two predictors (frequency of usage of online shopping and number of debit cards) were selected in the logistic regression model to explain fraud occurrence in China...|$|R

Some <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> are indeed likely to do more harm than good, especially when they contribute to the systemic risk of the financial system. However, such a <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> tax should be very small, much smaller than the negative externalities in question, because it is a blunt instrument that also drives out socially useful transactions.

Background and Problem Discussion: There are challenges associated with overly cash based societies. The use of mobile financial systems could {{address some of}} these challenges. Understanding {{the factors that influence}} people’s willingness to use mobile systems for <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> could be significant in developing strategies to transition from traditional payment systems to mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> systems. Purpose – The purpose of this is to assess contribution of customer trust and perception of customer focus to the willingness of GSM subscribers to use the mobile system for <b>financial</b> <b>transactions</b> and how the understanding derived from these factors can be used to develop strategies to promote a transition from cashed based society to mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Method- Quantitative and deductive approach was used. 300 GSM respondents who were selected with a multistage sampling method in three locations were surveyed. Interviewers were used to get data on perceived customer focus level, customer trust and willingness to engage in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Theory – Theory section looks at the concepts relating to customer trust and customer perception of customer focus and pertinent subconstructs applicable to the engagement in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Analysis – I have used correlational analysis to verify the level of association between customer trust, customer focus perception, socio demographic factors and the willingness to engage in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> In order to verify the influence of income, a non parametric test was done. Conclusions – The analysis of the data results showed that there is a strong positive association between the willingness to use mobile for <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> Also, the analysis revealed a positive correlation between the perception of customer focus by subscribers and the willingness to engage in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> There was no significant influence by demographic factors such as age and gender on the willingness to engage in mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transactions.</b> A 3 phased implementation strategy was proposed for the deployment of a mobile <b>financial</b> <b>transaction</b> system...|$|R
