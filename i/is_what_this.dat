The national consensus (albeit by a frighteningly slim margin) was that this wasn't who we, as a people, wanted to be. But now, four years later, Zero Dark Thirty comes out, and it seems that that we've become so blunted to the horror of what we did and/or are doing at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and Bagram and other places that we can accept it, provided we get a boffo movie out of it.|$|E

Shakira talked about the video, saying [...] "I decided to just do something more spontaneous, and be myself and be free and feel free about it because that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> song is about". The music video was released on 29 September 2010, and the Spanish and English versions of the video were individually released on iTunes on 11 October 2010, and 13 October 2010, respectively.|$|E

500|$|According to {{theological}} {{author and}} editor Robert Van De Weyer, this asserts that all {{love is a}} reflection of one's own soul: parents' love of their children, a love of religion or of the entire world. German Indologist and Oxford University professor Max Müller says that the love described in the Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad extends to all aspects of one's life and beyond; in verse 2.4.5, [...] "The Devas (gods) are not dear to one out of love for gods, but because one may love the Self (Atman) that the gods are dear". In the dialogue [...] "the Brahman-class, the Kshatra-class, these worlds, these gods, these beings, everything that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> Soul is", and when [...] "we see, hear, perceive and know the Self, then all is known".|$|E

[...] Lionel understood the urgency of Haiti, and in January 2010, {{it was agreed that}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] would be re-recorded to help benefit Haiti, similar to how the original recording helped famine relief in Africa. Richie commented, [...] "Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a hit record to make someone decide to save a life. I want this song to be the battle cry again. Every once in a while, you have to wake the world up. We slept right through Katrina. If we are not a socially aware culture, we're going to fail." ...|$|E
500|$|Goddard {{compared}} the romance between Lily and Cane to Lady Chatterley's Lover since both characters grew and {{learned from the}} relationship. Cane developed an attraction to Heather Stevens (portrayed by Vail Bloom) while with Lily; Goddard noted it would [...] "come down to what Cane needs" [...] when choosing between the two women. The storylines written for the lovers included a controversy with the characters' age gap, a miscarriage, and a love rectangle with Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) and Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). Within the love rectangle story, Chloe tricks Cane into thinking they conceived a child together. To make the storyline work, the writers scripted Cane as less intelligent, a strategy they used previously during his storyline with Amber. To keep the character from looking bad, Goddard said he made acting choices to justify Cane's actions. Despite the lessening of the character's intelligence, Goddard said he liked the story because of the originality of the plot. Love triangles and questioned paternity happen regularly in soap operas, but he felt that former head writer Maria Arena Bell managed to make those conventions fresh and new. Khalil stated that she [...] "loved" [...] the storyline, also saying she loved the actors involved in it. Khalil said she thought it [...] "was a possibility" [...] for Lily and Cane to have a happy ending, and that Lily [...] "can see the hope, and they can adapt and love {{each other in a}} more mature and honest way". Cane married Lily in 2009, and the following year, Global BC called Lily the love of Cane's life. In 2011, Lily divorced Cane after he continued to lie to her about his faked death. However, she eventually discovered Cane was trying to protect her, and they were remarried. Goddard commented that their relationship [...] "had come full circle" [...] and [...] "was being done well". Of Cane and Lily's second wedding, Goddard stated that Cane and Lily have [...] "certainly had a lot of ups and downs", but he thought through all of that their fans [...] "stayed true and they have expressed their desire for what they want to see". Goddard also thought their wedding of [...] "this caliber" [...] would make their fans [...] "very, very happy and that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> is about".|$|E

[...] He praised the {{gameplay}} types, writing [...] "variety <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> game's all about, and it's quite welcome." [...] However, he {{was critical of}} the lack of story integration into the variation in gameplay styles; [...] "One complaint about nearly every goal is that it often doesn't make any sense why you're doing what you're doing." [...] He concluded [...] "Haven: Call of the King is quite an ambitious title. At certain points it's great, but at others it can be either frustrating or very boring. The game ties in most of the different genres in a pretty smooth manner. Nothing seems entirely out of place [...] Overall, the game is worth playing through. You'll have to tough it out through some aggravatingly boring sections, but when the game strays from the basics a bit, it can get to be quite fun." ...|$|E
