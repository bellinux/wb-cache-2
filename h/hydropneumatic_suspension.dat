5|$|The fan car and <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> {{exploited}} loopholes in {{the sporting}} regulations. In the early 1980s, Brabham {{was accused of}} going further and breaking the regulations. During 1981, Piquet's first championship year, rumours circulated of illegal underweight Brabham chassis. Driver Jacques Laffite was among those {{to claim that the}} cars were fitted with heavily ballasted bodywork before being weighed at scrutineering. The accusation was denied by Brabham's management. No formal protest was made against the team and no action was taken against them by the sporting authorities.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} designed in 1979 as a short notice {{replacement for the}} team's Alfa Romeo-engined BT48, after Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided to end {{his relationship with the}} Italian engine manufacturer. The BT49 was created in only six weeks using elements of the BT48 chassis together with the widely used Cosworth DFV engine. It is a single seater with an open cockpit and exposed wheels. The monocoque chassis is made from aluminium alloy and carbon fibre composites. The car was fitted with controversial <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> and water-cooled brakes at different points in its life.|$|E
5|$|The team {{used the}} BT49 over four seasons. In the 1980 season Piquet scored three wins {{and the team}} took third in the Constructors' Championship with Piquet second in the Drivers' Championship. This season saw the {{introduction}} of the blue and white livery that the cars would wear through several changes of sponsor, until the team's demise in 1992. With a better understanding of ground effect, the team further developed the BT49C for the 1981 season, incorporating a <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> system to avoid ride height limitations intended to reduce downforce. Piquet, who had developed a close working relationship with Murray, took the drivers' title with three wins, albeit amid accusations of cheating. The team finished second in the Constructors' Championship, behind the Williams team.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of its operation, the BMD-1 had no analogues abroad. Its main {{armament}} was a 73mm smoothbore gun with a coaxial 7.62mm PKT machine gun. It also had a launcher rail for the 9M14 Malyutka. Additional armaments include two bow-mounted 7.62mm PKT machine guns in the front part of the vehicle, in addition to one ball joint firing port on either side and cover of the rear hatch to fire from individual weapons. The vehicle also featured a <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> system capable of changing its ground clearance. A low weight of 7.5 t allowed it to be light enough to parachute from any types of military-transport aircraft. This airborne infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) also possessed one of the highest power-to-weight ratios at 32hp/tonne. The BMD-1 was the first domestically produced vehicle equipped with aluminum armor to ensure its light weight. The engineering incorporated in the BMD-1 allowed it {{to be used as a}} base vehicle for multiple variants including the BMD-1K and the BTR-D.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{compartment}} {{is located in}} the rear of the vehicle and consists of: a 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine developing 450hp, a main clutch, a gearbox, a final drives, and brakes. The suspension of the vehicle consists of five rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear, an idler at the front, and four track-return rollers. The BMD-3 is fitted with a new hydromechanical transmission with hydrostatic steering mechanism. This adjustable suspension gives a ground clearance between 130 and 530mm with 450mm being the default. This <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> allows the BMD-3 to decrease its height to be able to board transport aircraft like the Il-76M. The ground clearance is adjusted by the driver and it takes 10 seconds to lower or raise the suspension. The maximum road speed is 70km/h and the maximum off-road speed is 45km/h. The vehicle can achieve an operational range of up to 500km on paved roads and can climb up to 60% gradient and move on a 30% side slope. The ground pressure exerted by the BMD-3 is 0.48 kg/cm2 with standard tracks and 0.32kg/cm2 with broader tracks.|$|E

500|$|In the 1960s, Brabham was the world's largest {{manufacturer}} of open-wheel racing cars {{for sale to}} customer teams; by 1970 it had built more than 500 cars. During this period, teams using Brabham cars won championships in Formula Two and Formula Three. Brabham cars also competed in the Indianapolis 500 and in Formula 5000 racing. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brabham introduced such innovations [...] as in-race refuelling, carbon brakes, and <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>suspension.</b> [...] Its unique Gordon Murray designed [...] "fan car" [...] won its only race before being withdrawn.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, Germany and the United States {{had already}} {{embarked}} on a joint tank program, known as the MBT-70. The new tank carried a three-man crew, with the driver in the turret, an automatic loader for the main gun, a [...] autocannon as secondary armament, an active <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> and spaced armour on the glacis plate and the front turret. The new tank concept also had improved armament, a [...] missile-launching main gun, designed to fire the MGM-51 Shillelagh anti-tank missile. However, the German Army was interested in a tank gun which could fire conventional ammunition. Although there were attempts to modify the [...] tank gun to do so, the process proved extremely difficult, and the Germans began development of the future Rheinmetall 120mm gun instead.|$|E

50|$|From an {{engineering}} perspective, the Xantia's biggest advance was the suspension. From launch, {{the more expensive}} models were available with an enhanced version of the XM's Hydractive, Hydractive II or H2, computer-controlled version of the <b>hydropneumatic</b> self-leveling <b>suspension.</b> This used extra suspension spheres to allow a soft ride in normal conditions, but taut body control during hard braking, acceleration or cornering.|$|R
500|$|Since 1995, BT49s have competed {{regularly}} in the FIA Historic Formula One Championship. The championship is open to cars that competed in Formula One in the DFV era, between 1967 and 1985, in several classes to allow for equal competition. The BT49 competes in class C, for post 1971 ground effects cars. In 1999, Motor Sport magazine tested a BT49D from the series featuring [...] from its developed DFV at 11,200rpm, but the championship has since introduced rules to restrict engines to 10,500rpm to keep costs down. While the cars' original skirts can be kept, they must be set up such that there is [...] clearance beneath the car, a rule that removes most of the advantage of ground effect. The <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> employed during 1981 is not permitted. The carbon-carbon brakes originally used in 1981 and 1982 are also banned and the cars must run with conventional brake pads and steel brakes. The cars use Avon slick tyres. Christian Glaesel won the 2005 FIA Historic Formula One Championship driving a BT49D and Joaquin Folch won the 2012 championship in a BT49C.|$|E
500|$|For the 1981 season, a BT49C {{specification}} {{was produced}} with a chassis lightened through {{increased use of}} carbon composite materials. Five of this variant were built {{and two of the}} previous year's cars converted to this specification. That year a minimum ride height of [...] was introduced and sliding skirts were banned, with the intention of limiting ground effect and slowing the cars. The BT49C regained its front wings to compensate in part for the downforce lost. More significantly, Murray devised a <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>suspension</b> system for the BT49C in which soft air springs supported the car at the regulation height for checks while stationary. At speed, where the ride height could not be measured, downforce compressed the air and the car settled to a much lower height, creating more downforce. Because the skirts now had to be fixed, the suspension had to be very stiff to allow them to consistently seal around the sides of the car: {{by the end of the}} 1981 season, total suspension movement was only , half of which came from the compression of the tyres. A lightweight qualifying chassis was produced, featuring a small fuel tank and lighter reinforced carbon-carbon brake discs and pads.|$|E
2500|$|The Auxiliary User Cum Reliability Trials (AUCRT) of the Arjun MBT were {{conducted}} from September 2007 to summer of 2008.

50|$|Considering the {{considerable}} commercial potentials of hydro-pneumatic technology (Corolla, 1996), interconnected <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>suspensions</b> {{have also been}} explored in some recent studies, and their potential benefits in enhancing vehicle ride and handling have been demonstrated. The control system {{can also be used}} for further improving performance of interconnected suspensions. Apart from academic research, an Australian company, Kinetic, had some success (WRC: 3 Championships, Dakar Rally: 2 Championships, Lexus GX470 2004 4×4 of the year with KDSS, 2005 PACE award) with various passive or semi-active systems, which generally decouple at least two vehicle modes (roll, warp (articulation), pitch and/or heave (bounce)) to simultaneously control each mode's stiffness and damping, by using interconnected shock absorbers, and other methods. In 1999, Kinetic was bought out by Tenneco. Later developments by a Catalan company, Creuat has devised a simpler system design based on single-acting cylinders. After some projects on competition Creuat is active in providing retrofit systems for some vehicle models.|$|R

Compared to the new Mercedes-Benz system, Citroën's was belt-driven, exactly like a conventional power steering pump; failure of the Citroën system thus might result in loss of suspension. Conversely, every unit of the 6.9 was shipped with hard rubber emergency dampers that served as temporary springs and allowed the car to be driven {{in the event of}} a hydraulic failure. The special hydraulic fluid required by the system was stored in a tank inside the engine compartment. Not only was the system totally self-adjusting, ride height could be altered by a dash-mounted push-pull knob under the speedometer that raised the car an additional two inches (50 mm) for increased ground clearance.|$|R
