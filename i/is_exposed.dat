40|$|Iron-based {{amorphous}} alloys can be {{more resistant}} to corrosion than polycrystalline materials of similar compositions. However, when the amorphous alloys <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to high temperatures they may recrystallize (or devitrify) thus losing their resistance to corrosion. Four different types of amorphous alloys melt spun ribbon specimens <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to several temperatures for short periods of time. The resulting corrosion resistance was evaluated in seawater at 90 C and compared with the as-prepared ribbons. Results show that the amorphous alloys can <b>be</b> <b>exposed</b> to 600 C for 1 -hr. without losing the corrosion resistance; however, when the ribbons <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> at 800 C for 1 -hr. their localized corrosion resistance decreased significantly...|$|R

5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that over 22 million workers <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to dangerous noise levels, and 10 million <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to solvents that could potentially cause hearing loss every year, with an unknown number exposed to other ototoxic chemicals.|$|R

5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster {{is prone}} to genetic {{abnormalities}} in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if the animal <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the acute effects, radiation exposure (both internal and external) carries a long-term risk of death from cancer of 5–10% per Sv. The general population <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> to small amounts of polonium as a radon daughter in indoor air; the isotopes 214Po and 218Po are thought to cause {{the majority of the}} estimated 15,000–22,000 lung cancer deaths in the US every year that have been attributed to indoor radon. Tobacco smoking causes additional exposure to polonium.|$|E
5|$|In general, common ravens {{live in a}} {{wide array}} of environments but prefer heavily {{contoured}} landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone is activated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone is activated when the bird <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> to stress, such as migrating great distances.|$|E
