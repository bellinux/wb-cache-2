40|$|The author {{addresses}} {{solutions to}} problems of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> utilities sector (including a substantial depreciation of fixed assets of the municipal infrastructure, a gap between domestic utilities management technologies and those employed worldwide, and the fund raising problem) through power saving actions to be facilitated by small innovative enterprises. The proposed solutions contribute to formation of new jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regions, reduction of power consumption and higher efficiency of regional economies due to reduced costs and rates (prices) set for utilities-related services, and improvement of the standard and quality of living. The principal objective {{is to develop a}} set of procedures and criteria to {{serve as the basis for}} the selection of tools of power saving innovations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> utilities sector of regions and municipalities. The above actions are to be implemented through the involvement of small innovative enterprises. The basic tools (instruments of the state social and economic (including innovation-related) policy, that are to stimulate subjects of innovative activities to implement innovative projects in this sector) stimulate energy efficiency innovations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> utilities sector. <b>The</b> proposed set of tools includes tax holidays, subsidies, grants, soft loans, concessional loans, state and municipal orders, etc. The procedure of selection of instruments of state-initiated innovations designated for the improvement of the power efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> public utilities sector to be implemented by regional and municipal authorities is proposed by the author. The author identifies several types of energy saving innovations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> utilities sector, based on their systemic effects. Upon identification of the top-priority recipients of state support, financial resources are to be distributed. Advantages of innovative energy saving projects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> utilities sector, developed and implemented on the basis of the proposed organizational structure, are considered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pape...|$|R
5|$|After {{just over}} a year in office, Cook was forced to call a new election, the first double dissolution. Labor won back its {{majority}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>and</b> Fisher returned for a third term as prime minister. He struggled with the demands of Australia's participation in World War I, and in October 1915 resigned in favour of Billy Hughes. Fisher subsequently accepted an appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, holding that position from 1916 to 1920. After a brief return to Australia, he retired to London, dying there at the age of 66. In total, Fisher served as prime minister for just under five years; Bob Hawke is {{the only member of the}} Labor Party to have served for longer.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{there was}} only one {{political}} party of any consequence in Indiana, the Democratic-Republicans. The party was, however, broken into three divisions that would later split off into their own parties. The divisions were mainly over the issue of slavery, but they would develop more differences in later years. The Jennings party, made up of abolitionists, was dominant in the beginning. The Noble party was in favor of slavery, and the Hendricks party was generally neutral, although Hendricks himself was openly anti-slavery. In 1818, the Noble party tried to impeach Governor Jennings over his role in the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's. After two months of debate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>and</b> Jennings having destroyed the evidence of his role, the House of Representatives dropped the investigation and issued a resolution that confirmed Jennings in his position as governor.|$|E
5|$|By 1826, {{economic}} prosperity {{was beginning to}} return to the state. The Old Court party augmented their majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> gained a majority in the Senate. One legislator's proposition to resolve the controversy was to call for the resignation of the governor and lieutenant governor, the entire General Assembly, as well as the justices from both the Old and New Courts, essentially allowing the state to reset its entire government. This extreme measure was rejected. Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly repealed the reorganization act, and overrode Governor Desha's veto of the measure. They also repealed the replevin law that had touched off the controversy. On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in his possession to the Old Court.|$|E

5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th {{century the}} economy of Southampton {{improved}} {{as a result of}} the Italian wool trade and the presence of many foreign merchants. The Medieval Merchant's House was acquired by a sequence of established Southampton merchants, but it remained intact as a detached dwelling, unlike many other properties in the neighbourhood that were combined to form the larger homes that became more fashionable in the late 15th century. In the middle of the 16th century, however, Southampton's economy collapsed once again as trade with Italy declined, taking with it the prosperity of FrenchStreet.
