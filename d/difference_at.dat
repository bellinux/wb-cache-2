5|$|Bolton were relegated on goal <b>difference</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of}} the 1997–98 Premiership campaign. They {{finished}} on {{the same}} number of points as Everton, whom they faced in the first competitive match at the newly built Reebok Stadium. The game finished 0–0, but a goal by Gerry Taggart for the Whites was mistakenly not given; the point swing in Bolton's favour would have kept them up. The following season they reached the 1999 Division One play-off Final but lost 2–0 to Watford.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics {{were also}} used in musical tuning and music theory. The 2nd-century-BCE Huainanzi, {{compiled}} by eight scholars under the patronage of King Liu An (179–122 BCE), outlined the use of twelve tones on a musical scale. Jing Fang (78–37 BCE), a mathematician and music theorist, expanded these to create a scale of 60 tones. While doing so, Jing Fang realized that 53 just fifths is approximate to 31 octaves. By calculating the <b>difference</b> <b>at</b> 177147⁄176776, Jing reached the same value of 53 equal temperament duly discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator (1620–1687) (i.e. 353/284, known as Mercator's comma). Later, the prince Zhu Zaiyu (1536–1611 CE) in Ming China and Simon Stevin (1548–1620 CE) of the Flemish Region in Europe would simultaneously (but separately) discover the mathematical formula for equal temperament.|$|E

We have isolated spontaneous and insertional suppressor mutants that are heterokaryon-compatible in spite of allelic <b>differences</b> <b>at</b> one or at several het loci. Some intra- and extragenic mutants tolerated allelic <b>differences</b> only <b>at</b> single het loci. Multi-tolerant spontaneous mutants were isolated by selecting simultaneously for tolerance of <b>differences</b> <b>at</b> het-c, -d and -e, or at each of these plus mating-type. Some suppressor mutants were specific for only one allele at the affected het locus; others suppressed both alleles. Insertional mutations were isolated from banks of transformants, each having a plasmid integrated into a random position in the chromosome. One mutant tolerated allelic <b>differences</b> <b>at</b> het-d. A homologous cosmid from a Neurospora genomic bank complemented the mutant phenotype. A second insertional inactivation mutant was tolerant of het-c differences. Inactivation of the wild-type locus corresponding to the integration site was accomplished by repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). The RIP progeny, like the original mutant, were tolerant of <b>differences</b> <b>at</b> het-c.

The results included a 4–0 loss to traditional rivals Malaysia at the National Stadium and Singapore exited the competition on an inferior goal <b>difference</b> <b>at</b> the group stage. Coach Jan B. Poulsen was sacked in the aftermath and after a six-month search, Avramović was appointed as coach of Singapore's senior and under-23 teams on a two-and-a-half-year contract in July 2003. The FAS tasked him with the targets of qualifying for the 2004 Asian Cup, as well as reaching the finals of the 2004 Tiger Cup and 2005 Southeast Asian Games. He took charge of his first game with a 4–1 international friendly win over Hong Kong in August. The Lions started their 2004 Asian Cup qualifying campaign with two defeats to Avramović's former team, Kuwait in September. They gained their first points with a win and a draw over Palestine. A 2–0 defeat to Qatar in November dashed their hopes of reaching the finals. In the post-mortem, Avramović stated his emphasis on developing more young players for the national squad.|$|E
25|$|Lambert et al. (2005) {{examined}} {{the possibility of}} using DNA barcoding to assess the past diversity of the Earth's biota. The COI gene of a group of extinct ratite birds, the moa, were sequenced using 26 subfossil moa bones. As with Hebert's results, each species sequenced had a unique barcode and intraspecific COI sequence variance ranged from 0 to 1.24%. To determine new species, a standard sequence threshold of 2.7% COI sequence difference was set. This value is 10 times the average intraspecies difference of North American birds, which is inconsistent with Hebert's recommendation that the threshold value be based on the group under study. Using this value, the group detected six moa species. In addition, a further standard sequence threshold of 1.24% was also used. This value resulted in 10 moa species which corresponded with the previously known species with one exception. This exception suggested a possible complex of species which was previously unidentified. Given the slow rate of growth and reproduction of moa, it is probable that the interspecies variation is rather low. On the other hand, there is no set value of molecular <b>difference</b> <b>at</b> which populations can be assumed to have irrevocably started to undergo speciation. It is safe to say, however, that the 2.7% COI sequence difference initially used was far too high.|$|E
