50|$|The goals <b>of</b> {{interactive}} <b>advertising</b> {{are usually}} {{akin to the}} traditional objectives <b>of</b> <b>advertising,</b> i.e. to sell a product. This in turn means {{that many of the}} traditional elements <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> impact and effectiveness remain relevant, even within the scope of interactive media. However, according to the <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> Interactive <b>Advertising</b> 2001, interactive advertising also has some properties that expand the range of potential objectives and that improve advertising effectiveness. Interactive advertising also has the potential to decrease the losses associated with poorly coordinated advertising, to reduce the difficulties commonly encountered in clearly communicating an advertising message and to help overcome new product hurdles.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{supporting}} evidence of advertisements published in six leading orthodontic journals. Materials and Methods: The 2012 - 2013 printed issues <b>of</b> American <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, Australian Orthodontic <b>Journal,</b> <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> Orthodontics, European <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> Orthodontics, <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> Clinical Orthodontics, and <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> Orofacial Orthopedics were screened for advertisements implying superior performance compared with competitor products. Advertisements were classified according to type of product, availability, and currency of supporting references. Results: A total of 99 unique advertisements claiming clinical benefit or superiority were identified. The {{overwhelming majority of}} the identified advertisements promoted appliance products (62. 6 %), orthodontic materials (14. 1 %), and dental operatory equipment, including imaging systems (12. 1 %). Advertisements were found to provide references or not regardless of the product type. Half of the advertisements referred to at least one peer-reviewed publication, whereas unpublished studies were cited by 25 % of the advertisements. Most of the referenced articles were published within the past 5 years. Conclusions: The scientific background of advertisements in the orthodontic literature appears limited. While surveillance <b>of</b> <b>journal</b> <b>advertising</b> needs to be regulated, clinicians are urged to critically appraise the claims being made in orthodontic print advertisements by consulting the associated existing evidence...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there have}} been several studies {{concerning}} the issue <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> standardization, few authors have proposed an integrated model of the determinants <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> standardization Even if the extent of control of Multinational Corporations (MNC) over their subsidiaries is often cited as a key element in the determination of the level <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> standardization adopted by the MNCs, there is no consistent view concerning the role of this variable. This paper attempts to clarify these points by proposing, at the MNC level, a measurement model and a structural model for the determinants of the degree <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> standardization. In this model, the mediation effect of the MNC's degree of control over the subsidiary is tested and validated. In addition, the measurement instruments used for the determinants are confirmed. © 2001 JIBS. <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> International Business Studies (2001) 32, 249 – 266...|$|R
40|$|Background: Though drug {{promotion}} regulations exist worldwide, {{low quality}} <b>of</b> <b>journal</b> drug <b>advertising</b> {{is a global}} issue. Medical journals are regarded as a leading source of information for new drugs. They may also modulate prescribing behavior of physicians without their knowledge. A comparative analysis of advertisements from different countries may provide insights regarding {{strengths and weaknesses of}} different regulating systems. Aims: Prescription drug advertisements from the Indian <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> Dermatology, Venereology, and Leprology (IJDVL) and <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD) were compared to check their compliance with criteria of World Health Organization (WHO) and International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). Methods: All the prescription drug advertisements of at least one page length appearing in all the issues of IJDVL and JAAD from January 2012 till December 2012 were included in this study. The contents of both advertisements were compared for compliance regarding different criteria of ethical codes for drug <b>advertising</b> <b>of</b> WHO and IFPMA. Statistical analysis was done using Fisher′s exact test. Results: Compared to IJDVL, more advertisements in JAAD complied with WHO and IFPMA codes. On the whole, advertisements in IJDVL had significantly less information regarding the approved usage, dosage, abbreviated prescribing information (API), summary of scientific information, safety information regarding the drug, and references to the scientific literature to support various claims. However, JAAD had more advertisements with multiple claims than IJDVL, and many advertisements interspersed between scientific articles while IJDVL had none. Conclusion: The complex issue <b>of</b> ethical drug <b>advertising</b> in dermatology journals requires constant review and discussion. Dermatologists should be cautious in assessing any advertisement or claim even if it seems evidence-based. The results from our study highlight the need for a global, proactive and effective regulatory system to ensure ethical medicinal drug advertising in medical journals...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, European {{countries}} have faced an ever increasing levels of activities by consumerists. Much {{of this activity}} is aimed at regulating and controlling advertising. This article examines the views <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> industry and corporate advertising executives toward this movement in two neighboring European countries: West Germany and Switzerland. Results show that even though these {{countries have}} different levels <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> regulation, the executives in both countries hold generally similar attitudes toward most advertising issues. Additionally, the Swiss respondents, {{more so than the}} West Germans, feel consumer organizations have more influence on advertising regulation. West German respondents, on the other hand, more strongly favor self-control as a means <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> regulation. Finally, the Swiss respondents show a more favorable view toward corrective advertising as a method of controlling misleading advertisements. © 1982 JIBS. <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> International Business Studies (1982) 13, 109 – 114...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if revenue generated from pharmaceutical advertisements in medical journals creates potential financial {{conflicts of interest}} for nonprofit physician organizations that own those journals. DESIGN: Convenience sample of six professional medical societies and their respective <b>journals.</b> Calculation <b>of</b> pharmaceutical <b>advertising</b> revenue generated by these journals for their respective professional medical societies. METHODS: Random selection <b>of</b> each <b>journal</b> for one month per quarter in calendar year 1996 and tabulation per edition of the average number <b>of</b> pharmaceutical <b>advertising</b> pages for each journal. OUTCOME MEASURES: Published advertising rates were used to estimate pharmaceutical advertising revenue for calendar year 1996 and compared with each organization's gross revenue and membership dues and assessments, based on Internal Revenue Service documents for the last available fiscal year (1995). RESULTS: Estimated pharmaceutical advertising revenue ranged from $ 715, 000 to $ 18, 630, 000. Five organizations raised more than 10 % of their gross income (range 2 % to 30 %) from a single journal's pharmaceutical advertising. Four organizations raised {{as much or more}} from pharmaceutical advertising as from members (range 17 % to 790 %). CONCLUSIONS: Potential financial conflicts of interest arising from pharmaceutical advertisements in medical journals may be substantial. The impact on professional societies' financial independence and behavior is unknown...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} role of {{language}} choice in advertising to bilinguals in global markets. Our results reveal the existence of asymmetric language effects for multinational corporations (MNCs) versus local firms when operating in a foreign domain, such that the choice <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> language affects advertising effectiveness for MNCs but not local companies. Also, different language formats (e. g., the local language vs. English or a mix of the two languages) are shown to vary in their advertising effectiveness for different types of products (luxuries vs. necessities). Our results indicate that language choice for advertisements is an important decision for MNCs. Also, MNCs cannot mimic local companies in their choice <b>of</b> <b>advertising</b> language.
