5000|$|Pin header {{connectors}} {{are thus}} [...] "male" [...] connectors ("female" [...] counterparts do exist, {{but these are}} normally just called <b>female</b> <b>header</b> (FH) or header connector, without [...] "pin") and are mostly used inside equipment, rather than {{being used as a}} connector {{on the outside of the}} device.|$|E
5000|$|Solid tips - {{are used}} to connect on/with a {{breadboard}} or <b>female</b> <b>header</b> connector. The arrangement of the elements and ease of insertion on a breadboard allows increasing the mounting density of both components and jump wires without fear of short-circuits. The jump wires vary in size and colour to distinguish the different working signals.|$|E

50|$|Most Arduino boards {{consist of}} an Atmel 8-bit AVR {{microcontroller}} (ATmega8, ATmega168, ATmega328, ATmega1280, ATmega2560) with varying amounts of flash memory, pins, and features. The 32-bit Arduino Due, {{based on the}} Atmel SAM3X8E was introduced in 2012. The boards use single or double-row pins or <b>female</b> <b>headers</b> that facilitate connections for programming and incorporation into other circuits. These may connect with add-on modules termed shields. Multiple, and possibly stacked shields may be individually addressable via an IÂ²C serial bus. Most boards include a 5 V linear regulator and a 16 MHz crystal oscillator or ceramic resonator. Some designs, such as the LilyPad, run at 8 MHz and dispense with the onboard voltage regulator due to specific form-factor restrictions.|$|R
