40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of slopes {{to failure}} during earthquakes is calculated, {{in terms of}} critical horizontal acceleration, on a subregional scale for {{the upper part of}} the Serchio River basin (Tuscany, Italy). According to the working scale (1 : 10 000) and to the availability and accuracy of the input data, the infinite slope analysis was judged to be the most appropriate method, but particular attention was devoted to the error evaluation due to spatial variability of the geotechnic, geometric, and hydrologic parameters. A geologic, geomorphologic and <b>hydrologic</b> <b>survey</b> of the area was therefore performed, and the geotechnic parameters were collected at local administrations. All the data were stored in a GIS, used as a tool to build the spatial and attribute data base and to prepare the input data layers for the stability analysis. In order to assess the variability of geotechnic parameters, a statistical analysis was performed to assign the best-fitting probability distribution to cohesion, angle of internal friction and unit weight of the soil. As hydrogeologic data were not available for the area, only surface hydrology information could be used; a map of probability of spring occurrences was derived by a bayesian method, the Weight of Evidence Modelling, and was used as groundwater indicator. A Monte Carlo procedure and a first-order second-moment method were applied and compared as error estimators in assessing the slope susceptibility to failure. The differences between the two methods are discussed, and two maps showing, respectively, the critical horizontal acceleration and the probability of failure associated with each slope are presented, together with the curve plotting the reliability index against the probability of failure...|$|E

40|$|Need and Importance of Study Utah 2 ̆ 7 s {{problems}} of water use and water supply {{are becoming increasingly}} important. They are also becoming increasingly complex as competition for our water resources becomes more keen among various types of uses. In the formulation of plans for sound and efficient use of water {{it is essential to}} know the characteristics of occurrence and use of water supplies so that requirements can be balanced most effectively and economically against supply. This ordinarily requires basic hydrologic data to determine relations among climate, water losses, and water yield from watersheds. Such data are often unavailable - especially for the smaller basins and streams which characterize many parts of Utah. With greater emphasis on small watersheds and small project development, some way of estimating quantities and characteristics of streamflow which are vital to hydraulic design is essential. In spite of increased emphasis and expenditures for development of water, the expansion of basic data programs still lags behind actual development. At present, investigations and data gathering are not completely adequate to delineate the potential water resources nor {{to determine the extent of}} possible development. Without an expanded program of surface and underground water investigations, we cannot hope to outline our potentials completely. However, a broad picture of long-time average annual runoff, developed indirectly or from data at hand, should have considerable value in first stage planning on a statewide basis. The total hydrologic picture must be outlined to evaluate better the effect of individual project development on future regional development programs. Piecemeal development frequently does not fit into an ultimate patterns for most complete and efficient use of the water resource within a region or state. To avoid this kind of development, those responsible for formulating water programs and policies need all the hydrologic information they can get. Deficiencies of such information lend great emphasis to the need for developing dependable indirect methods and techniques to speed preliminary <b>hydrologic</b> <b>surveys.</b> This study was undertaken to develop techniques useful in making was undertaken to develop techniques useful in making rapid and economical estimates of water supplies.

40|$|Layers {{covering}} aquifers {{can play}} a crucial role in protecting groundwater from infiltrating contaminants pending on their spatial distribution and hydrological properties. Non-invasive geophysical characterizations of groundwater protective layers provide important subsurface information at low cost and are highly desirable for the management of risks associated with groundwater contamination and runoff prediction. Geophysics ultimately employs measuring soil physical properties, and yields the prospect of gaining information beyond the point scale usually employed by hydrologists, therefore greatly reducing the uncertainty, especially in highly heterogenic geological settings. Soil electrical resistivity is one important soil physical property that depends primarily on structure and volume of pore space, soil water content, mineralization and clay content, thus making resistivity methods a natural choice for <b>hydrologic</b> <b>surveys.</b> Two technologies, which are applicable in the field, are High Resolution Multielectrode Geoelectrics and GeoRadar. The added value of combining the two methods offers the perspective of developing a survey technology applicable under wider conditions than any of the two methods on its own. However, a simple conversion of geophysical data into hydrological information is not commonly practicable. In order to improve the understanding of the relationships between geophysical measurements and soil physical and hydrological properties, correlation functions were derived, which effectively demanded the measurement of both hydrological and geophysical parameters. The protective potential of groundwater covering layers against contaminants is quantified by the infiltration time a contaminated volume of water would need to percolate through a unit area. In this context both the coefficient of permeability and the thickness of such layers must be identified with high accuracy. While thickness and structure determination of layers is a common application with a high expertise, the determination of soil hydrologic properties proofs to be a new ground. The rational is based on the idea that the hydraulic conductivity depends significantly on the grain size distribution and in particular on the clay content of fine-grained soils; consequently special interest was deployed in clay content variations. The results completely meet the expectations and support the field observations. A linear correlation between field measured resistivity and lab measured clay content was found, manifesting a trend of lower resistivities with an increase in clay content. Moreover, we were able to substantiate a dependence of resistivity from the lab measured saturated hydraulic conductivity. Although the uncertainty of estimating the saturated hydraulic conductivity is significant, results will be shown that support the practical use of the method established in accurately predicting variations with a precision that could be in the order of magnitude. Cost effective Geoelectric and Georadar surveys provide additional fundamental information required by hydrologists and engineers by greatly reducing the uncertainty accompanied with point scale measurements at a comparable precision, thus ultimately providing a tool for assessing ground water hampering sediments for a variety of tasks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Watersheds of the US Geological <b>Survey’s</b> <b>Hydrologic</b> Benchmark Network {{program were}} used in {{estimating}} annual yield of total nitrogen and nitrogen fractions (ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic N, particulate N) in relation to amount of runoff, elev-ation, and watershed area. Only watersheds minimally disturbed {{with respect to the}} nitrogen cycle {{were used in}} the analysis (mostly natural vegetation cover, no point sources of N, atmospheric deposition of inorganic N < 10 kg ha− 1 y− 1). Statistical analysis of the yields of total nitrogen and nitrogen fractions showed that elevation and watershed area bear no significant relationship to nitrogen yield for these watersheds. The yields of total nitrogen and nitrogen fractions are, however, strongly related to runoff (r 2 = 0. 91 for total N). Annual yield increases as runoff increases, but at a rate lower than runoff; annual discharge-weighted mean concentrations decline as annual runoff increases. Yields of total nitrogen and most nitrogen fractions bear a relationship to runoff that is nearly indistinguishable from a rela-tionship that was documented previously for minimally disturbed watersheds of the American tropics. Overall, the results suggest strong interlatitudinal convergence of yields and percent fractionation for nitrogen in relation to runoff...|$|R

40|$|In many {{countries}} around the world, increasing attention is being directed {{to the need to}} improve water rights systems. This paper is based on a recent study undertaken to investigate challenges facing optimal implementation of formal water rights systems for irrigation purposes in the Great Ruaha River Catchment in Tanzania. The study integrated social <b>survey,</b> <b>hydrologic,</b> water abstraction and water use data, and Geographical Information System techniques. The results showed that all the canals studied, except one, abstracted water throughout the year, provided there was water in the rivers irrespective of the conditions spelt out in their formal water rights. The formal water rights were also found to be problematic as the quantities to be abstracted were much higher compared to the actual water requirements and the actual river flows. This resulted in over-abstraction of water and increased water shortages for downstream users. The study concludes that although formal water rights are meant to control and regulate the use of water, they are also subject to abuse if not managed and monitored closely. The basin authorities in Tanzania therefore need to be equipped adequately and collaborate more closely with local water users in order to attain high levels of supervision and monitoring essential for optimal implementation of formal water rights systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} and discussions on nationwide scales increasingly stress {{the need for}} semantic interoperability among communities {{due to the lack}} of specific domain descriptions of the data being processed. These shortcomings are largely based on the fact that each community typically only focuses on its specific needs with little or no attention paid to making these community-specific data descriptions part of a much bigger data realm. We state that part of the problem arises because the formalizations of the available metadata schemas are general, difficult to implement and inflexible to be extended. In this paper we attempt to show that through the use of the Ontology Web Language (OWL) and the creation of domain specific ontologies some of these shortcomings can be overcome. This is demonstrated by creating two examples of knowledge inference to reason from a domain ontology. In the first one we created an ontology for the US Geological <b>Survey</b> <b>Hydrologic</b> Units, where logical inference is use to extract a list of desire watershed names that a user could select to fill a metadata element. In the second example we show the possibilities of extending a metadata element and restricting it to accept values from another distributed resource, such as the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD). We conclude that knowledge representation systems like OWL provide a more flexible platform and possibility to reuse distributed resources, simplifying the process of creating metadata schemas for the hydrologic community. ...|$|R
40|$|The loss of {{agricultural}} chemicals in runoff from agricultural land {{is a major}} cause of poor surface water quality in the United State. Scientists (Natural Resources Conservation Service) developed a technique using climatic, <b>hydrologic,</b> and soil <b>survey</b> information to estimate the impact {{of agricultural}} watersheds on natural water resources. The objective {{of this study was to}} apply this technique on the Wagon Train (WT) watershed to predict loss of alkaline earth elements (calcium [Ca], magnesium [Mg], barium [Ba], and strontium [Sr]) by runoff from soils and to estimate elements loading into WT reservoir. The predicted losses of Ca, Mg, Ba, and Sr by runoff were 67. 5, 19. 9, 0. 17, and 0. 05 kg ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively. These data give a total annual loss of 262. 1 and 77. 1 Mg of Ca and Mg, respectively, for the entire watershed and could be considered as the annual loading for WT reservoir. The total annual loss was 668 kg for Ba and 186 kg for Sr and could represent the annual loading for the reservoir. The predicted Ca, Mg, and Ba concentrations in runoff were in good agreement with those observed in water samples collected weekly from the main stream in the watershed. However, the predicted Sr concentration in runoff was much less than that observed in the stream water. Subsurface seepage into the stream might contribute to the high Sr concentration observed in the stream water. We concluded that the technique could provide a reasonable estimation of Ca, Mg, and Ba losses in runoff from agricultural watersheds and loading into surface water bodies...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that anthropogenic noise affects the marine fauna, thus {{it becomes a}} major concern in ocean management policies. In the other hand there is an increasing demand for wave energy installations that, presumably, are {{an important source of}} noise. A noise prediction tool is of crucial importance {{to assess the impact of}} a perspective installation. Contribute for the development of such a tool is one of the objectives of the WEAM project. In this context, the CALCOM’ 10 sea trial took place off the south coast of Portugal, from 22 to 24 June, 2010 with the purpose of field calibration. Field calibration is a concept used to tune the parameters of an acoustic propagation model for a region of interest. The basic idea is that one can significantly reduce the uncertainty of the predictions of acoustic propagation in a region, even with scarce environmental data (bathymetric, geoacoustic), given that relevant acoustic parameters obtained by acoustic inference (i. e. acoustic inversion) are integrated in the prediction scheme. For example, this concept can be applied to the classical problem of transmission loss predictions or, as in our case, the problem of predicting the distribution of acoustic noise due to a wave energy power plant. In such applications the accuracy of bathymetric and geoacoustic parameters estimated by acoustic means is not a concern, but only the uncertainty of the predicted acoustic field. The objective of this approach is to reduce the need for extensive <b>hydrologic</b> and geoacoustic <b>surveys,</b> and reduce the influence of modelling errors, for example due to the bathymetric discretization used. Next, it is presented the experimental setup and data acquired during the sea trial as well as preliminary results of channel characterization and acoustic forward modelling...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the relevance of hydrological classification and class differences to the characteristics of woody riparian vegetation in a subtropical landscape in Queensland, Australia. We followed classification procedures of the environmental flow framework ELOHA – Ecological Limits of <b>Hydrologic</b> Alteration. Riparian <b>surveys</b> at 44 sites distributed across five flow classes recorded 191 woody riparian species and 15, 500 individuals. There were differences among flow classes for riparian species richness, total abundance, and abundance of regenerating native trees and shrubs. There were also significant class differences in the occurrence of three common tree species, and 21 indicator species (mostly native taxa) further distinguished the vegetation characteristics of each flow class. We investigated the influence of key drivers of riparian vegetation structure (climate, depth to water table, streamspecific power, substrate type, degree of hydrologic alteration, and land use) on riparian vegetation. Patterns were explained largely by climate, particularly annual rainfall and temperature. Strong covarying drivers (hydrology and climate) prevented us from isolating the independent influences of these drivers on riparian assemblage structure. The prevalence of species considered typically rheophytic in some flow classes implies a more substantial role for flow in these classes but needs further testing. No relationships were found between land use and riparian vegetation composition and structure. This study demonstrates the relevance of flow classification to the structure of riparian vegetation in a subtropical landscape, and the influence of covarying drivers on riparian patterns. Management of environmental flows to influence riparian vegetation assemblages would likely have most potential in sites dominated by rheophytic species where hydrological influences override other controls. In contrast, where vegetation assemblages are dominated by a diverse array of typical rainforest species, and other factors including broad-scale climatic gradients and topographic variables have greater influence than hydrology, riparian vegetation is likely to be less responsive to environmental flow management...|$|R
40|$|Kentucky’s Upper Green River Basin has {{received}} significant attention {{due to the}} area’s high biodiversity and spectacular karst development. While carbonate bedrock is present throughout the watershed, it is more extensive and homogenous along the river between Greensburg and Munfordville than upstream from Greensburg where the geology is more heterogeneous. This research quantitatively evaluated how lithological {{differences between the two}} catchment areas impact hydrochemistry and inorganic carbon cycling. This first required correcting catchment boundaries on previous US Geological <b>Survey</b> <b>Hydrologic</b> Unit Maps to account for areas where the boundaries cross sinkhole plains. Basin boundaries using existing Kentucky Division of Water dye trace data differed from the earlier versions by as much as three kilometers. The river at the downstream site is more strongly influenced by carbonate mineral dissolution, reflected in higher specific conductance (SpC) and pH. The SpC at Munfordville ranges from 0. 9 to 4. 8 times that at Greensburg, averaging 2. 0 times higher. Although rainfall is impacted by sulfuric acid from coal burning, river pH is buffered at both sites. The pH is higher at Munfordville 91 % of the time, by an average of 0. 28 units. Diurnal, photosynthetic pH variations are damped out downstream suggesting interactions between geologic and biological influences on river chemistry. River temperature differences between the two sites are at least 4 oC higher at Greensburg under warm season conditions, but there is a clear trend of temperature differences diminishing as the river cools through the fall and winter. This results from a relatively stable temperature at Munfordville, impacted by large spring inputs of groundwater within the karst region downstream. Although weak statistical relationships between SpC and HCO 3 - create uncertainties in high resolution carbon flux calculations, measurement of these fluxes is more highly impacted by discharge variations than concentration variations, which resulted in average daily atmospheric flux estimates within 34 % between the two basins using weekly concentration data (3. 3 x 108 vs. 2. 2 x 108 gkm- 2 d- 1, where km 2 is the outcrop area of carbonate rocks), and within only 12 % using 15 -minute concentration data from regressions (2. 6 x 108 vs. 2. 3 x 108 gkm- 2 d- 1) for Greensburg and Munfordville, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of soil water flow paths to {{the transport of}} nutrients and contaminants has long been recognized. However, effective means of detecting concentrated subsurface flow paths in a large landscape are still lacking. The flow direction and accumulation algorithm based on single-direction flow algorithm (D 8) in GIS hydrologic modeling is a cost-effective way to simulate potential concentrated flow paths over a large area once relevant data are collected. This study tested the D 8 algorithm for simulating concentrated lateral flow paths at three interfaces in soil profiles in a 19. 5 -ha agricultural landscape in central Pennsylvania, USA. These interfaces were (1) the interface between surface plowed layers of Ap 1 and Ap 2 horizons, (2) the interface with subsoil water-restricting clay layer where clay content increased to over 40 %, and (3) the soil-bedrock interface. The simulated flow paths were validated through soil <b>hydrologic</b> monitoring, geophysical <b>surveys,</b> and observable soil morphological features. The results confirmed that concentrated subsurface lateral flow occurred at the interfaces with the clay layer and the underlying bedrock. At these two interfaces, the soils on the simulated flow paths were closer to saturation and showed more temporally unstable moisture dynamics than those off the simulated flow paths. Apparent electrical conductivity in the soil on the simulated flow paths was elevated and temporally unstable as compared to those outside the simulated paths. The soil cores collected from the simulated flow paths showed significantly higher Mn content at these interfaces than those away from the simulated paths. These results suggest that (1) the D 8 algorithm is useful in simulating possible concentrated subsurface lateral flow paths if used with appropriate threshold value of contributing area and sufficiently detailed digital elevation model (DEM); (2) repeated electromagnetic surveys can reflect the temporal change of soil water storage and thus is a useful indicator of possible subsurface flow path over a large area; and (3) observable Mn distribution in soil profiles {{can be used as}} a simple indicator of water flow paths in soils and over the landscape; however, it does require sufficient soil sampling (by excavation or augering) to possibly infer landscape-scale subsurface flow paths. In areas where subsurface interface topography varies similarly with surface topography, surface DEM can be used to simulate potential subsurface lateral flow path reasonably so the cost associated with obtaining depth to subsurface water-restricting layer can be minimized...|$|R
