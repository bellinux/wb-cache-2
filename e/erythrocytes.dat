40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of the electromagnetic field generated from the 1800 MHz radiofrequency radiation (EF) on <b>erythrocyte</b> rheological parameters and <b>erythrocyte</b> zinc levels. Material and Methods: Twenty-four male Wistar Albino rats were randomly grouped as follows: 1) two control groups and 2) study groups: i) Group A: EF exposed group (2. 5 h/day for 30 days, the phone on stand-by), and ii) Group B: EF exposed group (2. 5 min/day for 30 days, the phone ringing in silent mode). At the end of the experimental period <b>erythrocyte</b> rheological parameters such as <b>erythrocyte</b> deformability and aggregation were determined by an ectacytometer. <b>Erythrocyte</b> zinc level, which affects hemorheological parameters, was also measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results: <b>Erythrocyte</b> deformability was decreased in both study groups but the decrease in group A was not statistically significant. Exposure to EF did not have any significant effect on <b>erythrocyte</b> aggregation. On the other hand, <b>erythrocyte</b> zinc level was significantly reduced in both study groups. Conclusion: Exposure to EF may have decreased tissue oxygenation due to reduced <b>erythrocyte</b> deformability. Decrease in <b>erythrocyte</b> zinc level may have caused the impairment in <b>erythrocyte</b> deformability...|$|R

5|$|Malaria {{infection}} develops via two phases: {{one that}} involves the liver (exoerythrocytic phase), and one that involves red blood cells, or <b>erythrocytes</b> (erythrocytic phase). When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically {{for a period of}} 8–30 days.|$|E
5|$|About 10,000 years ago, malaria {{started having}} {{a major impact}} on human survival, coinciding with the start of {{agriculture}} in the Neolithic revolution. Consequences included natural selection for sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, elliptocytosis and loss of the Gerbich antigen (glycophorin C) and the Duffy antigen on the <b>erythrocytes,</b> because such blood disorders confer a selective advantage against malaria infection (balancing selection).

5|$|Other headgroups {{are also}} present {{to varying degrees}} and can include {{phosphatidylserine}} (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of <b>erythrocytes</b> is a marker of cell apoptosis, whereas PS in growth plate vesicles {{is necessary for the}} nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer.|$|E

5|$|Like chondrostean fish, {{the major}} immune tissues of bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the {{anterior}} kidney), which houses many different immune cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost <b>erythrocytes,</b> neutrophils and granulocytes {{are believed to}} reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus. In 2006, a lymphatic system {{similar to that in}} mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen.|$|E
25|$|These {{mutations}} have {{a common}} end result; they destabilise the cytoskeletal scaffold of cells. This stability is especially important in <b>erythrocytes</b> as they are constantly {{under the influence of}} deforming shear forces. As disc-shaped <b>erythrocytes</b> pass through capillaries, which can be 2-3 micrometres wide, they are forced to assume an elliptical shape in order to fit through. Normally, this deformation lasts only as long as a cell is present in a capillary, but in hereditary elliptocytosis the instability of the cytoskeleton means that <b>erythrocytes</b> deformed by passing through a capillary are forever rendered elliptical. These elliptical cells are taken up by the spleen and removed from circulation when they are younger than they would normally be, meaning that the <b>erythrocytes</b> of people with hereditary elliptocytosis have a shorter than average life-span (a normal person's <b>erythrocytes</b> average 120 days or more).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Imbalance between {{oxidative}} {{processes and}} antioxidant defenses {{has been considered}} {{to play a role}} in cataractogenesis, particularly in diabetes patients. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an important precursor for oxidative stress in the human lens, and its activity is mainly dependent on the copper and zinc levels in the body. The aim of this study was to compare <b>erythrocyte</b> SOD, <b>erythrocyte</b> zinc and total serum testosterone levels in male patients with early senile nuclear cataract and evaluate the correlations between the parameters in all subjects. METHODS A community-based study of cross-sectional design was conducted at Cilandak District Primary Health Center where 52 adult and 17 elderly men with early senile nuclear cataract were chosen as the study subjects. <b>Erythrocyte</b> SOD, <b>erythrocyte</b> zinc, serum testosterone, and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were measured in all subjects. Nuclear cataract stage was assessed with the Pentacam® instrument (Oculus, Germany). Independent Student t test and Pearson’s correlation were used to analyze the results. RESULTS <b>Erythrocyte</b> SOD level was significantly decreased in elderly men compared to adult men (p= 0. 014). <b>Erythrocyte</b> zinc, serum testosterone and FBG did not differ significantly in adult and elderly males (at p= 0. 304; p= 0. 145;and p= 0. 376, respectively). <b>Erythrocyte</b> SOD activity was significantly associated with <b>erythrocyte</b> zinc level (r= 0. 486; p= 0. 048).

25|$|Ovalocytosis is a subtype of elliptocytosis, {{and is an}} {{inherited}} condition in which <b>erythrocytes</b> have an oval instead of a round shape.

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hereditary elliptocytosis is usually made by coupling {{a family history}} of the condition with an appropriate clinical presentation and confirmation on a blood smear.
