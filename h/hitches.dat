Ben <b>hitches</b> {{a ride to}} Frenchman's Bend, Mississippi, with two young women in a convertible, Clara Varner and her sister-in-law Eula (Lee Remick). Clara's father, Will Varner, is the domineering owner {{of most of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|Stewie <b>hitches</b> a {{ride with}} a trucker and so Brian follows {{him all the way}} to Canada. On the way, Stewie accidentally causes a traffic pileup by {{discharging}} a flare pistol in the cab of the truck, which catches fire and explodes.

The pair then encounter a Canadian who gives them his snowmobile.|$|E
5|$|Between World War I and World War II, the Auxois was {{the pride}} of {{regional}} farmers. Before the advent of motorization, it was the preferred pulling animal, even for slow work, winning out over the local Charolais cattle breed used as oxen. The Auxois was bred solely for agricultural work, and used exclusively for this purpose. The strongest horses were used for multi-horse <b>hitches</b> {{in the fields and}} for logging. The Auxois competed in popularity with the Nivernais horse, and it was not uncommon for farmers in the region to have both the black-coated Nivernais and the red-coated Ardennais and Auxois to satisfy the color preferences of all potential buyers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adjustable}} loop {{forms of}} the rolling <b>hitch</b> and Magnus <b>hitch,</b> {{in addition to being}} called either of those two names, have also come to be known variously as the taut-line <b>hitch,</b> tent-line <b>hitch,</b> rigger's <b>hitch,</b> adjustable <b>hitch,</b> or midshipman's <b>hitch.</b> [...] These knots are generally shown as being based on one of three underlying hitches: two variants of the rolling <b>hitch</b> (ABOK #1734 and #1735) and the Magnus <b>hitch</b> (#1736).|$|R
50|$|One {{instance}} where a half <b>hitch</b> {{stands on}} its own without additional embellishment is when added to a timber <b>hitch</b> to help stabilize a load {{in the direction of}} pull. A timber <b>hitch</b> is tied on {{the far end of the}} load to bind it securely and a half <b>hitch</b> made at the forward end to serve as a guide for the rope. In this instance, the half <b>hitch</b> combined with a timber <b>hitch</b> is known as a killick <b>hitch</b> or kelleg <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lobster buoy <b>hitch</b> {{is similar}} to the {{buntline}} <b>hitch,</b> but made with a cow <b>hitch</b> around the standing part rather than a clove <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
5|$|Instead of {{returning}} immediately to Omaha, Ryan convinces Alex {{to accompany him}} to his younger sister's wedding. He learns that the reason the couple had him take photos of a cutout picture of them in various places was because they cannot afford a honeymoon. When the groom gets cold feet, Ryan's older sister talks Ryan into using his motivational skills to persuade the groom {{to go through with}} the wedding. Although this runs counter to Ryan's personal philosophy, he successfully argues that the important moments in life are rarely unshared. The wedding goes off without any further <b>hitches.</b>|$|E
5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight {{to make sure he}} did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these <b>hitches,</b> and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Shakira roller-skating with many fans {{surrounding}} her. After roaming about the city, including numerous scenes of dancing, she publicly changes her wardrobe and <b>hitches</b> {{a ride on}} a motorbike. Further on, she dances and jumps into a fountain. During the next verse, she is seen belly dancing with {{a man by the}} beach and, {{near the end of the}} video, she dives into the sea along with many fans and celebrates. Scenes of Shakira dancing wearing a gold triangle bikini and gold sequined pants are also interspersed throughout the video. Dizzee Rascal also makes an appearance during his part of the song.|$|E
5000|$|The killick <b>hitch</b> [...] {{is a type}} of <b>hitch</b> knot used {{to attach}} a rope to oddly shaped objects. This knot is also known as the kelleg <b>hitch.</b> It is a {{combination}} of a timber <b>hitch</b> tied in conjunction with a half <b>hitch,</b> which is added to lend support and stability when pulling or hoisting the object; the addition of a half-hitch in front of the timber <b>hitch</b> creates a timber <b>hitch</b> and a half <b>hitch,</b> known as a killick <b>hitch</b> when at sea. A killick is [...] "a small anchor or weight for mooring a boat, sometimes consisting of a stone secured by pieces of wood".|$|R
50|$|The Fast <b>Hitch</b> was IH's {{answer to}} the three-point <b>hitch</b> {{developed}} years earlier by Harry Ferguson, and featured on Ford-Ferguson tractors. The Fast <b>Hitch</b> was first offered as an option on the Super C. Fast <b>Hitch</b> was then an option on the 100, 200, 300, and 400 and some later models. However, even the Fast <b>Hitch</b> had three incompatible variants (100—single prong, 200—two small prongs, 300/400—two large prongs). IH discontinued the Fast <b>Hitch</b> in the 1960s after the three-point <b>hitch</b> was standardized and adopted by all manufacturers. There are kits available {{from a variety of}} sources that will either convert a Fast <b>Hitch</b> to a three-point, or add a three-point <b>hitch</b> to tractors that originally only had a fixed drawbar.|$|R
50|$|The running highwayman's <b>hitch,</b> mooring <b>hitch,</b> or {{sliding sheet}} bend is a <b>hitch</b> knot tied by looping {{the end of}} the rope around an object, and then fixing it to the {{standing}} part with a highwayman's <b>hitch.</b>|$|R
5|$|Knuckles' {{story begins}} in Mushroom Hill, {{where he is}} {{relaxing}} with his animal friends but is interrupted by a bomb dropped by EggRobo. This prompts Knuckles to chase after him, leading him {{through most of the}} same zones Sonic went through. The chase ends at the damaged remains of Sky Sanctuary, where a robot called Mecha Sonic attacks Knuckles but accidentally destroys EggRobo instead. After a short fight, Mecha Sonic uses the power of the Master Emerald to achieve a Super form similar to Sonic's. Knuckles manages to defeat Super Mecha Sonic, who explodes. Sonic flies in piloting the biplane Tornado and Knuckles <b>hitches</b> a ride to return the Master Emerald to Angel Island. If all the Chaos Emeralds are collected, Angel Island rises upwards, into the sky. However, if the player has not collected all the Chaos Emeralds, Knuckles cannot redeem the Master Emerald, and Angel Island plummets into the ocean.|$|E
5|$|While Annabelle sleeps, {{the same}} mysterious hand {{emerges from the}} wall behind her bed and snatches the {{diamonds}} from her neck. Once again, her sanity is questioned, but as Harry and Annabelle search the room, they discover a hidden passage in the wall and in it the corpse of Roger Crosby. Mammy Pleasant leaves to call the police, while Harry searches for the guard; Susan runs away in hysterics and <b>hitches</b> a ride with a milkman (Joe Murphy). Paul and Annabelle return to her room {{to search for the}} missing envelope, and discover that Crosby's body is missing. Paul vanishes as the secret passage closes behind him. Wandering in the hidden passages, Paul is attacked by the Cat and left for dead. He regains consciousness in time to rescue Annabelle. The police arrive and arrest the Cat, who is Charlie Wilder in disguise; the guard is his accomplice. Wilder is the person named in the second will; he hoped to drive Annabelle insane so that he could receive the inheritance.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, {{she sends}} Lauren {{a message and}} meets her outside the police station, looking rough, as she has been arrested for shoplifting. Whitney opts to live with Dot Branning (June Brown) instead of her close family, but Dot convinces her {{to move back to}} Ricky's. When Ryan returns from a holiday, he learns of Whitney's ordeal and urges her to go to the police and get tested for sexually transmitted infections. She says she is not ready to go to the police but agrees to the test, which shows she has a chlamydia infection. When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named Lee (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and <b>hitches</b> a lift to Southend-on-Sea with friends. She leaves him a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and fall {{over the edge of the}} pier. The next day, a body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob who has died. Whitney thinks Ryan may also be dead until he appears. She tells him she has told the police everything about Rob, including Ryan's fight with him, and Ryan tells Whitney he has to leave. They say an emotional farewell.|$|E
50|$|The magnus <b>hitch</b> is a knot {{similar to}} a rolling <b>hitch</b> or clove <b>hitch,</b> used to tie a rope or line to a pole, spar, or another line. It is tied {{similarly}} to a rolling <b>hitch</b> but with the final <b>hitch</b> in the opposite direction. It can be more tricky to snug up, since both lines emerge from {{the same side of}} the <b>hitch,</b> but it has less tendency to twist under load.|$|R
30|$|<b>Hitch</b> Hiker 2.0 {{expands the}} {{previous}} version of <b>Hitch</b> Hiker [14] with Ad-hoc <b>Hitch</b> Hiker, {{which does not}} rely on central meta-manager to discover the data aggregation overlay. Ad-hoc <b>Hitch</b> Hiker uses an approach inspired by AODV for route discovery.|$|R
50|$|The Slippery <b>hitch</b> and Buntline <b>hitch</b> are {{essentially}} a slipped Clove <b>hitch</b> around the main part. Slippery <b>hitch</b> has the slip {{placed under the}} last {{turn away from the}} main part, while Buntline <b>hitch</b> has the slip placed under the last turn towards the main part. Easy to tie, secure, easy to untie, Slippery <b>hitch</b> is used several in a row on square-rigged ships for securing the gaskets that bind stowed sails to the yards on top, while Buntline <b>hitch,</b> stronger but more difficult to untie, is used slipped to secure the bottom of open sail.|$|R
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the game takes place in 1995. Bond visits Monte Carlo to investigate the frigate La Fayette, where he rescues several hostages and plants a tracker bug on the Eurocopter Tiger helicopter before it is stolen by the Janus crime syndicate. Bond is then sent a second time to Severnaya, but during the mission he is captured and locked up in the bunker's cells along with Natalya Simonova, who has been betrayed to Janus. The two escape the complex seconds before it is destroyed, on the orders of Ourumov, by the GoldenEye satellite's EMP. Bond next travels to Saint Petersburg, where he arranges with ex-KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky to meet {{the chief of the}} Janus organisation. This is revealed to be Alec Trevelyan – his execution by Ourumov in the Arkhangelsk facility was faked. Bond and Natalya escape from Trevelyan, but are arrested by the Russian police and taken to the military archives for interrogation. Bond eventually manages to escape the interrogation room, rescue Natalya, and communicate with Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin, who has verified Bond's claim of Ourumov's treachery. Natalya is recaptured by General Ourumov, and Bond gives chase through the streets of St. Petersburg, eventually reaching an arms depot used by Janus. There Bond destroys its weaponry stores and then <b>hitches</b> a ride on Trevelyan's ex-Soviet missile train, where he kills Ourumov and rescues Natalya. However, Alec Trevelyan and his ally Xenia Onatopp escape to their secret base in Cuba.|$|E
25|$|An {{early use}} of the taut-line hitch name is found in Howard W. Riley's 1912 Knots, <b>Hitches,</b> and Splices, {{although}} it {{is shown in the}} rolling hitch form and suggested for use as a stopper.|$|E
25|$|The skin is held {{in place}} by being trapped between the top ring, called the crown ring, and the ring below it, called the flesh ring. A third ring (the bottom ring) is placed around the stem. The rings are {{commonly}} made from 6–8mm (¼–⅓in) rebar. A series of cow <b>hitches</b> on the crown ring and bottom ring form loops. Through these loops, a length of rope connects the crown ring and the bottom ring; tightening this rope applies tension. As the vertical rope is tensioned, the cow <b>hitches</b> on the crown ring press the skin against the flesh ring below; this attaches the skin to the flesh ring very securely and stretches the skin over the bearing edge of the drum.|$|E
50|$|The {{buntline}} <b>hitch</b> {{is simply}} a clove <b>hitch</b> tied around the standing part, with the turns of the clove <b>hitch</b> progressing towards the object.|$|R
30|$|Since {{this mode}} of <b>Hitch</b> Hiker operate with a single network manager, the {{creation}} of <b>Hitch</b> Hiker bindings require binding meta data from the entire application network. In principle, any <b>Hitch</b> Hiker node in the network can create or remove bindings. In order to increase the flexibility of <b>Hitch</b> Hiker and to allow <b>Hitch</b> Hiker to operate with either multiple managers or no managers, we extend <b>Hitch</b> Hiker with support for decentralised route discovery, which is explained in Section 5.|$|R
50|$|After {{finding out}} <b>Hitch's</b> true identity, Sara publishes an exposé, causing Allegra and Albert {{to break up}} and <b>Hitch's</b> {{reputation}} to suffer. At a speed dating cafe that <b>Hitch</b> sneaks into, Sara and Casey confront <b>Hitch</b> and cite Vance as their source. <b>Hitch</b> explains {{that not only did}} he refuse to work with him - Vance's personality type is why women protect themselves - but that same protection also unintentionally made establishing genuine relationships difficult enough to create a demand for <b>Hitch's</b> services.|$|R
25|$|The Mark Twain novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court {{features}} {{a man who}} lives on a pillar in {{the valley of the}} hermits and repeatedly bends over at the waist for his prayers. The main character <b>hitches</b> him to a sewing machine and uses the man to make linen shirts.|$|E
25|$|Yemenite Jews also wore a {{distinctive}} tallit often found to this day. The Yemenite tallit features a wide atara and large corner patches, embellished with silver or gold thread, and the fringes {{along the sides}} of the tallit are netted. According to the Baladi custom, the tzitzit are tied with seven chulyot (<b>hitches),</b> based on Maimonides' teaching.|$|E
25|$|To {{remedy the}} problem, Jeep dealerships will install a trailer hitch onto the rear bumpers of Jeep {{vehicles}} that will protect {{the fuel tank}} if the vehicle {{is involved in a}} rear impact. If an affected vehicle is not currently equipped with a trailer hitch, one will be installed onto it, and older Jeep and non-factory aftermarket trailer <b>hitches</b> will be replaced with one from Chrysler Corporation. Despite the recall, the market for these Jeep vehicles has not suffered.|$|E

5000|$|The clove <b>hitch</b> {{is a type}} of knot. Along {{with the}} bowline and the sheet bend, it is often {{considered}} one of the most important knots and is commonly referred to as a Double <b>Hitch.</b> A clove <b>hitch</b> is two successive half-hitches around an object. It is most effectively used as a crossing knot. It can be used as a binding knot, but is not particularly secure in that role. [...] A clove <b>hitch</b> made around the rope's own standing part is known as either two half-hitches or buntline <b>hitch,</b> depending on whether the turns of the clove <b>hitch</b> progress away from or towards the <b>hitched</b> object.|$|R

Early in the morning, Mother Courage sings a lullaby to her daughter's corpse, has the peasants bury it, and <b>hitches</b> herself to the cart.|$|E
25|$|A prusik, Klemheist knot, or autoblock knot {{may be used}} as safety back-up, {{commonly}} referred to as an 'autoblock,' and is used as a back-up {{in the case of the}} abseiler losing control of the abseil. One of these friction <b>hitches</b> is wrapped around the rope below the rappel device, using a short loop of smaller diameter cord or webbing, often called a 'prusik loop'. The prusik loop is then attached to the belay loop or leg loop of the harness.|$|E
25|$|Ricky visits Bianca in Manchester {{to discuss}} Liam. Bianca has been {{expelled}} from university {{and is working}} in a nightclub. Struggling to support Liam, Bianca gets {{caught up in a}} plan to steal £50,000 from her drug-dealing boss, Vince. Ricky persuades her to return the money but Vince catches them and forces them to become his drug couriers. He sets them up, the dealers turn violent, and Bianca and Ricky narrowly escape when armed police raid the establishment. Fleeing, Ricky and Bianca spend the night together in a hotel room and decide to reunite. Ricky breaks the news to his fiancée Cassie, who refuses to let him go and tries to convince Bianca that she'll be bored with Ricky and to give Ricky custody of Liam. Bianca decides that this is right, and Ricky looks on heartbroken as she <b>hitches</b> a ride in a car and departs for a destination unknown.|$|E

50|$|The highpoint <b>hitch</b> (or high post <b>hitch)</b> {{is a type}} of knot used {{to attach}} a rope to an object. The main feature of the <b>hitch</b> is that it is very secure, yet if tied as a slipped knot it can be {{released}} quickly and easily with one pull, even after heavy loading. The highpoint <b>hitch</b> is a buntline <b>hitch</b> with an extra half turn, making it more secure.|$|R
30|$|<b>Hitch</b> Hiker 2.0 {{extends the}} {{previous}} version of <b>Hitch</b> Hiker, which is reported in [14]. In <b>Hitch</b> Hiker, the bindings {{are classified as}} either high or low priority bindings. This classification allows <b>Hitch</b> Hiker to support data aggregation by appending low-priority data in the overlay network created using the unused payload space of high-priority transmissions. <b>Hitch</b> Hiker uses meta data provided by component bindings to create a multi-hop data aggregation overlay. To support end-to-end routing of low-priority traffic, <b>Hitch</b> Hiker performs route discovery on multi-hop overlay network using a central meta-manager.|$|R
