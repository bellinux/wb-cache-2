5|$|One of Smith's {{significant}} contributions to the menu was {{the addition of a}} breakfast product line as part of the 1978 product line expansion. Up until that point, breakfast was not a market Burger King had served. Other than the addition of the Croissan'Wich in 1983, the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the McDonald's offerings until a menu revamp in 1986. This expansion introduced BK's A.M. Express product line, which included <b>French</b> <b>toast</b> sticks and mini-muffins. The new breakfast line was designed to be portable, because studies had shown that an increasing percent of consumers were eating breakfast on the go. Shortly after the introduction of the <b>French</b> <b>toast</b> stick products, BK partnered with Lender's Bagels to introduce a bagel breakfast sandwich. The new product was designed to drive sales in the morning by piquing customer's curiosity with a new taste. The product was tested for several months in BK's original home territory of Miami before a national roll-out.|$|E
5|$|Deep-fried {{butter is}} a snack food {{comprising}} butter that is {{coated with a}} batter or breading and then deep-fried. The dish has been served at several fairs in the United States; among them, the State Fair of Texas in Dallas, Texas, and the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa; {{and now it is}} served worldwide.

50|$|Gruyère {{cheese is}} {{generally}} {{known as one}} of the finest cheeses for baking, having a distinctive but not overpowering taste. In quiche, Gruyère adds savoriness without overshadowing the other ingredients. It is a good melting cheese, particularly suited for fondues, along with Vacherin and Emmental. It is also traditionally used in French onion soup, as well as in croque-monsieur, a classic <b>French</b> <b>toasted</b> ham and cheese sandwich. Gruyère is also used in chicken and veal cordon bleu. It is a fine table cheese, and when grated, it is often used with salads and pastas. It is used, grated, atop le tourin, a type of garlic soup from France which is served on dried bread. White wines, such as Riesling, pair well with Gruyère. Sparkling apple cider and Bock beer are also beverage affinities.|$|R

50|$|In 2005 Compass Box {{released}} a new Blended Malt Scotch Whisky called The Spice Tree {{in which the}} blend of single malt distillates had undergone a secondary partial maturation stage in casks containing additional, flat French oak inserts (also known as ‘inner staves’). The Scotch Whisky Association, a trade organisation that represents the Scotch whisky industry, felt {{that the use of}} such inner staves in the whisky maturation process was in contravention of the Scotch Whisky Regulations prevailing at the time and threatened legal action against Compass Box to halt the production of The Spice Tree.

50|$|Lettuce is {{a primary}} ingredient, and several types of lettuce can be used, such as butter lettuce, cos lettuce, Boston lettuce, romaine lettuce, green leaf lettuce and iceberg lettuce, among others. The lettuce may be chopped, torn, {{shredded}} or sliced into ribbons. Additional ingredients may include, {{but are not limited}} to, chicken stock, beef stock, cream, milk, wine, lemon juice, egg or egg yolk, meats, rice, potato, greens, sorrel, watercress, Swiss chard, escarole, peas, parsley/dried parsley, bread crumbs, onion, shallot, garlic, salt and pepper, among others. Some preparations purée all of the ingredients together, and some preparations are strained in a sieve. Lettuce soup is sometimes served with toast or rolls, either as a side dish or with the soup poured upon it. Sometimes croutons or chopped bacon are used in the dish or to garnish it. In French cuisine, lettuce soup is usually served poured atop thin slices of lightly <b>toasted</b> <b>French</b> bread. Some versions are served cold. Total calories can vary depending on ingredients used. For example, versions that use milk may have fewer calories than those that use cream.|$|R
5000|$|In Argentina, the matambre is {{sometimes}} {{served as a}} steak, {{but this is not}} the typical serving method. The more common method is known as [...] "matambre relleno" [...] (stuffed, or filled matambre). The ingredients for this dish vary from province to province, but most common include whole carrots, hard-boiled eggs, and plenty of black pepper. These ingredients are then rolled up inside of the matambre sheet and sewn or pinned together to keep the rolled matambre from coming unrolled. It is then boiled in milk, or sometimes water, and roasted in the oven. After it is removed from the oven and cooled, it is sliced into thin pieces of lunch meat and served in <b>toasted</b> <b>French</b> roll with mayonnaise, and sometimes Argentine chimichurri, as a condiment. In Uruguay, and to a lesser extent in Argentina, matambre is marinated in milk, baked flat in the oven, and covered with the marinade, with the addition of lightly beaten eggs and cheese at the end of the cooking period. It is called [...] "matambre a la leche" [...] (matambre in milk).Another method of serving matambre is [...] "matambre a la pizza" [...] which is prepared in a similar way but instead of being rolled it is topped with pizza ingredients like tomato sauce and mozzarella.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} eff ect of ageing on the {{qualitative}} and quantitative composition of plum distillate in contact with oak wood chips. Maturation was performed with lightly <b>toasted</b> <b>French</b> oak (Quercus sessifl ora and Quercus robur) chips or oak chips made from fragments of empty barrels {{that had been used}} for ageing cognac. The eff ects of oak chip dose, process temperature, ageing system (static or circulatory) and ultrasound treatment were assessed. Maturation of plum distillate samples with oak chips resulted in higher levels of extractable organics (including tannins) and colour changes, which were correlated with the type and dose of oak chips, and the conditions of maturation. The content of sugars such as glucose, xylose and arabinose also increased, depending on the conditions and type of oak chips. Degradation of lignin resulted in liberation of sinapaldehyde, syringaldehyde, coniferaldehyde and vanillin, with intensities depending on the applied parameters. In terms of volatiles, decreases in the concentration of higher alcohols and aliphatic aldehydes were observed in the majority of maturation experiments, while concentrations of furanic aldehydes increased depending on the type and dose of oak chips, {{as well as on the}} conditions of maturation. The quantities of esters such as ethyl acetate decreased in the majority of experimental variants, whereas concentrations of ethyl caproate, ethyl caprylate and ethyl caprate increased gradually. Some phenols and lactones were detected in all matured samples, with the lowest levels found in the samples aged with oak chips made from cognac barrels...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial activity of a collection of oenological woods extracts (non-toasted and toasted American oak wood, non-toasted and <b>toasted</b> <b>French</b> oak wood, non-toasted and toasted Rumanian oak wood, chestnut, cherry and wine grape wood) isolated by pressurized liquid extraction in order to control the microbial spoilage of wines. Inhibition of the growth of six wine lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Lactobacillus hilgardii CIAL- 49, Lactobacillus casei CIAL- 52, Lactobacillus plantarum CIAL- 92, Pedioccocus pentosaceus CIAL- 85, Oenococcus oeni CIAL- 91 and CIAL- 96), two acetic acid bacteria (AAB) (Acetobacter aceti CIAL- 106 and Gluconobacter oxydans CIAL- 107) and three Brettanomyces yeast (Brettanomyces bruxellensis CIAL- 108, CIAL- 109 and CIAL- 110) by the oenological wood extracts was assessed. The antioxidant activity and the total phenol index of wood extracts were also evaluated. Results confirmed differences in bacteria and yeast susceptibility to oenological wood extracts among different genera and species. Among them, AAB were especially sensitive to the phenolic inactivation from oenological woods extracts. Contrarily, amongst LAB, L. hilgardii CIAL- 49 was the most resistant strain to the action of the wood extracts. Cherry wood was active against 9 of the 11 strains tested meanwhile French, Rumanian oak wood and chestnut show the lowest values of IC 50 for A. aceti CIAL- 106. No significant correlation was found between antimicrobial activity either with antioxidant activity or with the total phenol content, suggesting that structure-function of the phenolic extracts has a greater influence on the antimicrobial activity than the total phenol content.
