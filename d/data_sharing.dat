40|$|Dispersing a {{data object}} into {{a set of}} <b>data</b> <b>shares</b> is an {{elemental}} stage in distributed communication and storage systems. In comparison to data replication, data dispersal with redundancy saves space and bandwidth. Moreover, dispersing a data object to distinct communication links or storage sites limits adversarial access to whole data and tolerates loss of a part of <b>data</b> <b>shares.</b> Existing <b>data</b> dispersal schemes have been proposed mostly based on various mathematical transformations on the data which induce high computation overhead. This paper presents a novel data dispersal scheme where each part of a data object is replicated, without encoding, into a subset of <b>data</b> <b>shares</b> according to combinatorial design theory. Particularly, data parts are mapped to points and <b>data</b> <b>shares</b> are mapped to lines of a projective plane. Data parts are then distributed to <b>data</b> <b>shares</b> using the point and line incidence relations in the plane so that certain subsets of <b>data</b> <b>shares</b> collectively possess all data parts. The presented scheme incorporates combinatorial design theory with inseparability transformation to achieve secure data dispersal at reduced computation, communication and storage costs. Rigorous formal analysis and experimental study demonstrate significant cost-benefits of the presented scheme in comparison to existing methods...|$|R
