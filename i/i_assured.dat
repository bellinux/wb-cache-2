2500|$|A {{great deal}} of {{attention}} was paid to Palin's physical appearance during the 2008 elections. [...] According to Vogue magazine, [...] "Besides being telegenic, [...] had a tough-girl Alaskan résumé that most politicians could only dream of—the protein her family eats comes from fish she has pulled out of the ocean with her own hands and caribou she has shot." [...] Others were quick to point out striking resemblances of Palin to actress Tina Fey, who would impersonate her on Saturday Night Live, and Peggy Hill, a character on Fox Network's cartoon series King of the Hill. [...] Regarding her appearance, Palin has said, [...] "I've been taken aback by the nasty criticism about my appearance. [...] I wish they'd stick with the issues instead of discussing my black go-go boots. [...] A reporter once asked me about it during the campaign, and <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> him I was trying to be as frumpy as I could by wearing my hair on top of my head and these schoolmarm glasses." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'To {{compel the}} people {{to give up their}} goods, (General) Zarrouk put many notables in irons and locked them up; one of them was my {{grandfather}}. Their ordeal lasted I don't know how many days. Then my family took a sheet and wrapped up all their jewels and all their land titles. [...] My father had the task of taking all this to Zarrouk to obtain my grandfather's freedom. He {{made his way to the}} encampment where a number of tents stood. [...] Above one of them flew a flag. [...] This was the tent of General Zarrouk, who took all our fortune and freed his prisoners. Ten days later, my grandfather died from the appalling treatment he had suffered. My father did not escape unscathed either. He was conscripted into Zarrouk's army where he served for nineteen years, the longest and hardest years of his life. [...] He urged me to study. [...] 'I don't want you to be brought down to the level of a beast of burden one day' he said. 'I don't want to see you like me, condemned to wear a uniform all your days.' <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> him I would do my best by devoting myself completely to my studies.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, {{following}} a spell {{in a drug}} rehab clinic, which first alerted the public to her drug problem, Westbrook was reintroduced into EastEnders by executive producer Corinne Hollingworth. She has commented, [...] "the call from the producers couldn't {{have come at a}} more opportune moment for me. The soap was suffering from poor ratings and so they decided, as they normally do, to bring some familiar faces back onto the Square. The producers were aware of my addiction by now [...] but they had also read that I was now clean [...] once <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> them that I was well [...] they invited me back for another year." [...] The character's [...] "dramatic" [...] return to EastEnders aired on 25 July 1995 and began when her screen brothers traced Sam to Spain and she ended up in bed with [...] "bad boy" [...] David Wicks (Michael French). Several cast changes had occurred since Westbrook had last been in the soap, including a recast of her screen mother Peggy, who was now played by Barbara Windsor. As well as her former friends, Westbrook has revealed that she became particularly close to Windsor, who she says [...] "instantly took me under her wing", and Martine McCutcheon, who played Tiffany Raymond.|$|E
6000|$|Her younger brother, who was by, cried, 'Hold, sister, you run too fast; I am an {{exception}} to your rule. <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> you, if <b>I</b> find a woman so accomplished as you talk of, <b>I</b> say, <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> you, <b>I</b> would not trouble myself about the money.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; I {{took him}} {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned {{and told me that}} he had accepted and I understood the full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked me what he could now do to help and I sent him straight to the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, <b>I</b> <b>assured</b> him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be. I see visions and dream dreams. But as we say in Arabic countless times a day [...] "Through the presence of His Excellency the Representative of the King, and with the help of the Great Government, all please God, must be well!" ...|$|E
