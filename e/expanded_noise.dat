Noise was recoded from a range of sources, including vessel traffic which was intense at periods, noise from trains and vehicles passing over a nearby bridge, machinery noise from regular operation of the Fremantle Port, and pile driving (either vibratory pile driving, impact pile driving, or both) recorded during wharf construction over approximately 57 days, (mainly during the months of May, July, and August).

Vibratory pile and impact pile driving increased noise levels within the Inner Harbour. Biological noises were also detected in the recordings. Dominant biological sources were snapping shrimp, followed by mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) chorusing in early to mid-April, and grunts from other fish species detected throughout the recordings.

The Tennessee Eastman process is an extensive benchmark dataset for fault detection and identification, {{but it is only}} representative for continuous processes because it does not contain the inherent non- stationarity that complicates monitoring of batch processes. Nevertheless, batch processes also {{play an important role in}} many types of industry. This paper therefore presents an extensive reference dataset for benchmarking data-driven methodologies for fault detection and identification in batch processes.

40|$|In recent decades, {{anthropogenic}} noise {{has become}} recognised {{as a major}} pollutant worldwide {{and the study of}} its impacts has increased due to the potential for adverse consequences on wildlife. For marine environments, where sound is transmitted very efficiently through water, underwater noise has increased, mainly, at low and medium frequencies. Of all marine organisms, cetaceans may be the most affected, as they depend primarily on sound to communicate, navigate and find food. Accordingly, the general aims of this thesis are to identify the types of anthropogenic noise facing New Zealand’s cetaceans, the potential impacts, review current legislation, and to propose improvements to enhance current mitigation measures of impacts. My systematic review showed that 90 % of the information about impacts of noise pollution on cetacean comes from peer-review journals and, although available from 1975, studies of marine noise pollution substantially increased after 1997. In addition, I identified the limited information on this topic in important areas such as Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia, as well as regions in the Arctic and Southern Ocean. I also found that most effort has been focused on the impact of vessels, and bottlenose dolphin and harbour porpoise are, by far, the most studied species, showing a disparity in research coverage of both sources of noise and species. For New Zealand, there is a striking lack of knowledge of the range of sources of noise on cetaceans (excluding vessels). The information I compiled on New Zealand’s cetacean distributions showed that three main groups are well represented: baleen whales, delphinids and beaked whales. Nonetheless, the information available for these species varies greatly. While there are some species very well studied, for others New Zealand species, the available information is scarce, {{as in the case of}} beaked whale. Current mitigation measures can only be effective if comprehensive data are used to inform them. For example, planning surveys at different spatiotemporal scales are crucial to increase the effectiveness of mitigation measures. In particular, spatial modelling techniques can support mitigation measures by helping managers to identify areas of conflicts between marine mammal conservation and the development of activities such as dredging, drilling and seismic surveys. I used opportunistic sighting data collected from different platforms, and several environmental variables biologically important for cetaceans and/or their prey, to create maps of habitat suitability for seven species of cetaceans in New Zealand. These maps were created using maximun entropy modelling (MaxEnt), a model system that does not require absence data and performs well with small sample size. Models validations were done using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values. The models for all seven species had excellent discriminatory power (AUC > 0. 9). The environmental variables depth and sediment had the most explanatory power for the distribution of these species. Comparisons of the areas of current and designated areas for exploration activities with the marine mammal distributions generated using MaxEnt show significant and wide-ranging conflicts. Of particular concern is the designated area for exploration in the northern part of the North Island, this area overlaps with the distribution of the highly endangered Maui’s dolphin, and will add new pressures on this already diminished population. <b>Expanding</b> <b>noise</b> related research in this region (as elsewhere) will help stakeholders to support future decisions for planning when human activities enter into conflict with cetaceans. Finally, the development of effective laws that adequately regulate the anthropogenic noise impacts on marine mammals has been a task that has taken many years to advance. To assess the effectiveness of New Zealand’s legislation to mitigate impacts from seismic surveys and whale-watching activities, I described and compared methods prescribed by international associations. Strengths of The Code of New Zealand are that it presents a set of comprehensive guidelines with specific mention of biologically important aspects such as mother/calve pair priority. Nonetheless, improvements could be made regarding the enforcement of these guidelines. In addition, I suggest that New Zealand’s whale-watching guidelines, could be improved through the inclusion and implementation of an Impact Assessment, the creation of separate guidelines to protect specific species and/or areas and, as with seismic activities, ongoing enforcement of guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Airplane design {{consists}} of putting together several thousand parts to ultimately fulfill {{a set of}} requirements defined principally by airlines, manufacturers, and certification authorities. From the traditional perspective of an airline, an interesting airplane {{is one that is}} capable of generating the highest revenue with minimum operating cost - a maximum profit airplane. However, the airline industry is constantly broadening its consideration of what constitutes a nice-to-buy airplane. In recent times, not only economics, but also environmental considerations, are taking part in fleet-planning considerations. Following this trend induced by environmentally-aware passengers, and noise and pollution-related charges, airplane conceptual design methodologies are being expanded to incorporate methodologies for preliminary assessment of airplane noise and emissions. During the development of this dissertation, a group of airplane design methodologies was compiled and integrated into a design framework. This design framework was then <b>expanded</b> to incorporate <b>noise</b> and emissions estimation routines. This expanded group is then made into design functions and put through an automated design optimization process. In order to test both the design methodologies and the optimization techniques, two test cases are run: a long range, transcontinental jet and a mid-size regional jet. These test designs are initially single-objectively optimized for direct operating costs, noise and emissions. Then, the airplanes are optimized for pairs of these design objectives. Finally, they are optimized for the three objectives simultaneously. Results and suggestions for future works are presented...|$|R
30|$|In {{this paper}} we show how a path-integral {{representation}} of a stochastic hybrid neural network provides a unifying framework {{for a variety of}} asymptotic perturbation methods. The basic hybrid neural network model is described in Sect.  2, where we consider several limiting cases. In Sect.  3, we reprise the path-integral construction of Bressloff and Newby [33], highlighting certain features that were not covered in the original treatment, including the connection with large-deviation principles [34], and potential difficulties in the thermodynamic limit N→∞. In Sect.  4, we derive the basic variational principle {{that can be used to}} explore maximum-likelihood paths of escape from a metastable state, and relate the theory to the underlying Hamiltonian structure of the path-integral representation. In Sect.  5, we show how the path-integral representation provides an efficient method for deriving a diffusion approximation of a stochastic hybrid neural network. Although the diffusion approximation breaks down when considering escape problems, it provides useful insights into the effects of fluctuations within the basin of attraction of a given solution. We illustrate this by using the diffusion approximation to explore the effects of noise on neural pattern formation in a spatially structured network. In particular, we show how <b>noise</b> <b>expands</b> the parameter regime over which patterns can be observed, in an analogous fashion to stochastic PDEs. Finally, in Sect.  6, we use the path-integral representation to derive corrections to voltage-based mean-field equations, along analogous lines to the analysis of activity-based mean-field equations arising from the neural master equation [17, 20].|$|R

This year we celebrate the 40 th INTER-NOISE congress. The roles of noise immission effects and noise emission control have now been clarified. Both approaches {{to the problem of}} excessive noise have merit and can be most effective when used together. Of the major economic powers, Japan has had the most notable success in combining noise immission guidelines with noise emission regulatory requirements. The International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences (CAETS) initiated a noise policy project in 2007. The principal objective of the project is to assist the world’s policymakers in improving national and international requirements in noise policies. Emphasis is placed on the need for substantial reductions in the noise emissions of the world’s dominant noise sources. The CAETS project provides independent information about the technological options and barriers to balance the lobbying from industry. In three CAETS fora (in 2008, 2009, and 2010) the existing technology for quieter sources has been assessed.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{consider the}} temporal dynamics of two coupled spin qubits (e. g., semiconductor quantum dots) {{driven by the}} inter-qubit spin-spin coupling. The presence of environmental noise (e. g., charge traps, nuclear spins, random magnetic impurities) is accounted for by including random magnetic field and random inter-qubit coupling terms in the Hamiltonian. Both Heisenberg coupling and Ising coupling between the spin qubits are considered, corresponding respectively to exchange and capacitive gates as appropriate for single spin and singlet-triplet semiconductor qubit systems, respectively. Both exchange (Heisenberg) and capacitive (Ising) coupling situations can be solved numerically exactly even {{in the presence of}} noise, leading to the key findings that (i) the steady-state return probability to the initial state remains close to unity in the presence of strong noise for many, but not all, starting spin configurations, and (ii) the return probability as a function of time is oscillatory with a characteristic noise-controlled decay toward the steady-state value. We also provide results for the magnetization dynamics of the coupled two-qubit system. Our predicted dynamics can be directly tested in the already existing semiconductor spin qubit setups providing insight into their coherent interaction dynamics. Retention of the initial state spin memory even in the presence of strong environmental noise has important implications for quantum computation using spin qubits. Comment: 11. 5 pages, 18 figures.

40|$|Man-made noise {{can affect}} {{physiology}} and behaviour of animals of all taxa, including fish. However, {{there is not}} much known about effects of increased noise levels on anti-predator and foraging behaviour, which are both essential for survival and reproduction. In our laboratory study, we investigated effects of increased noise levels on these behaviours in two sympatric fish species, three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and European minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus), which differ in their anti-predator defences and likely in their hearing capabilities. Our study indicated that both behavioural contexts were affected by increased noise levels, but effects differed between species. Sticklebacks responded to a visual predatory stimulus sooner when exposed to additional noise playbacks than in control conditions, whereas minnows were not affected by the noise treatments. In foraging experiments, both fish species consumed fewer water fleas, but the reasons fish decreased food consumption seemed species specific: sticklebacks increased the number of foraging errors, whereas minnows tended to decrease their foraging effort by interacting socially more often and more individuals were inactive during increased noise level conditions. To allow for controlled comparative experiments, our studies were conducted in the laboratory. Complementary field experiments ensuring natural acoustic conditions will be necessary to investigate whether species differences can translate into community effects and whether these effects differ between different kinds of noise, such as drilling, pile driving and energy device operation <b>noise.</b> <b>Expanding</b> research to commercially important fish and quantification of particle motion in addition to sound pressure as most fish, and likely invertebrate species, perceive particle motion rather than sound pressure, would further deliver valuable knowledge for industry, policy makers and fisheries managers about how marine renewable energy devices may interfere with the marine environment.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of electronic technology, the power consumption of electronic devices has decreased significantly. Consequently, {{there is substantial}} interest in harvesting energy from ambient sources, such as vibration, in order to power small-scale wireless devices. To design optimal vibration harvesting systems {{it is important to}} determine the maximum power obtainable from a given vibration source. Initially, white noise base excitation of a general nonlinear energy harvester model is considered. The power input from white noise is known to be proportional both to the total oscillating mass of the system and the magnitude of the noise spectral density, regardless of the internal mechanics of the system. This power is split between undesirable mechanical damping and useful electrical dissipation, where the form of the stiffness profile and device parameters determine the relative proportion of energy dissipated by each mechanism. An upper bound on the electrical power is derived and used to guide towards optimal harvesting devices, revealing that low stiffness systems exhibit maximum performance. Many engineering applications will exhibit more complicated spectra than the flat spectrum of white <b>noise.</b> <b>Expanding</b> upon the white noise analysis, a method to investigate the power dissipation of nonlinear oscillators under non-white excitation is developed by extending the Wiener series. The relatively simple first term of the series, together with the excitation spectrum, is found to completely define the power dissipated. An important property of this first term, namely that the integral over its frequency domain representation is proportional to the oscillating mass, is derived and validated both numerically and experimentally, using a base excited cantilever beam with a nonlinear restoring force produced by magnets. Another form of excitation prevalent in many mechanical systems is a combination of deterministic and broadband random vibration. Lastly, the Duffing oscillator is used to illustrate the behaviour of a nonlinear system under this form of excitation, where the response is observed to spread around the attractor that would be seen if purely deterministic excitation was present. The ability of global weighted residual methods to produce the complex responses typical of nonlinear oscillators is assessed and found to be accurate for systems with weak nonlinearity...|$|R
40|$|In optical imaging, {{image quality}} {{is not only}} {{determined}} by the system itself {{but also by the}} media in which light traverse. Differences in the refraction index of the media encountered by a light wavefront produces phase aberrations which distort the image received from the original object. Currently, there are two main approaches for solving this problem: adaptive optics, which rely on deformable mirrors and wavefront sensors for correcting the phase aberration before it reaches the imaging sensor; and post-processing techniques, which try to estimate the object after receiving distorted images. MFBD methods are a family of algorithms that are capable of reconstructing the object by fusing the information carried by a set of differently aberrated images. These techniques are widely used in current optical systems, allowing a notable increase in image quality in most situations. However, there are cases in which they are not applicable; for example, looking at a dynamic object (e. g., a bird flying) or looking through static aberrations (e. g., in microscopy applications); but certain modifications in the optical system can be used for solving this problem. Actual optical devices have only one aperture, thus creating one full-size image on the imaging sensor but, by segmenting the pupil, several images can be retrieved at the same time with different aberrations (i. e., light follows a distinct path for each aperture). However, using a multi-aperture system implies that there is less imaging sensor area available for each aperture, thus obtaining images with less resolution. Nonetheless, MFBD algorithms can usually be extended in order to support SR, a technique that allows the increase of the object resolution by retrieving extra information from the displacement between images. This thesis is focused on the development of a functional prototype of a multi-aperture optical system that can do real-time object reconstruction. As a MFBD technique is needed, the novel TIP algorithm (developed at Delft Center for Systems and Control) is selected. In order to achieve a fast and reliable reconstruction, the algorithm is: modified for increasing its robustness against <b>noise,</b> <b>expanded</b> in order to support SR and implemented efficiently in both CPU and GPU.
