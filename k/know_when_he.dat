5|$|Though the {{producers}} knew that Macfayden {{would leave the}} series, they did not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> would do so, and so the first two episodes were initially written without him. In either case, {{the producers}} created a new character, Adam Carter. In addition, the writers heavily researched the episodes; many of the story lines are based on truth. The producers also took information from advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The series was directed in five blocks of two episodes in each. Filming started in January 2004 and took place over six to seven months. Shooting took place almost entirely in London, England, with some scenes shot in a cross-English Channel ferry in the fifth episode.|$|E
25|$|Later at Steven's memorial, once Kathy and Ian {{are walking}} away, a man leaves flowers for Kathy. The man is {{revealed}} to be Willmott-Brown and that Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner), Luke Browning (Adam Astill) and Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre) are his children. On Halloween, Michelle tells Kathy about her stalker, Tom Bailey (Daniel Casey) and she and Michelle give relationship advice to Shakil Kazemi (Shaheen Jafargholi) about Bex. When Kathy shuts up the café, she is startled when James comes in. As James acts casual, Kathy takes hold of a knife and James tells Kathy he has been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. Kathy rubbishes James' beliefs that they are alike and James says {{the reason for his}} visit is to move on from the past. Kathy wants James to explain truthfully what happened {{on the night of the}} rape, but when he refuses to do so, Kathy retells it, demanding to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> decided to rape her and she realises that James chose to rape her when he locked up The Dagmar. Kathy tells James that he has scared her that night like the night he raped her, but James, still in denial, refuses to apologise for the rape and he leaves Kathy his address. Kathy confides in Ian that James is back and Ian contacts Phil about James.|$|E
25|$|Woodwind and harp {{accompany}} a pensive {{version of}} the 'Dmitriy Motif'. The Pretender dreams of an assignation with Marina {{in the garden of}} her father's castle. However, to his annoyance, Rangoni finds him. He brings news that Marina longs for him and wishes to speak with him. The Pretender resolves to throw himself at Marina's feet, begging her to be his wife and Tsaritsa. He entreats Rangoni to lead him to Marina. Rangoni, however, first begs the Pretender to consider him a father, allowing him to follow his every step and thought. Despite his mistrust of Rangoni, the Pretender agrees not to part from him if he will only let him see Marina. Rangoni convinces the Pretender to hide as the Polish nobles emerge from the castle dancing a polonaise (Polonaise). Marina flirts, dancing with an older man. The Poles sing of taking the Muscovite throne, defeating the army of Boris, and capturing him. They return to the castle. The Pretender comes out of hiding, cursing Rangoni. He resolves to abandon wooing Marina and begin his march on Moscow. But then Marina appears and calls to him. He is lovesick. She, however, only wants to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> will be Tsar, and declares she can only be seduced by a throne and a crown. The Pretender kneels at her feet. She rejects his advances, and, attempting to spur him to action, dismisses him, calling him a lackey. Having reached his limit, he tells her he will depart the next day to lead his army to Moscow and to his father's throne. Furthermore, as Tsar he will take pleasure in watching her come crawling back looking for her own lost throne, and will command everyone to laugh at her. She quickly reverses course, tells him she adores him, and they sing a duet ("O Tsarevich, I implore you"). Rangoni observes the amorous couple from afar, and, joining them in a brief trio, cynically rejoices in his victory.|$|E

In 1988, he was {{encouraged}} to seek the Democratic nomination for President, but he declined to enter the race, saying that he would <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was ready. In 1990, a controversy over a state income tax increase—on which he refused to take a position—and his proposal on merit pay for teachers, which led the NJEA to support his opponent, turned his once-obscure rival for the Senate, Christine Todd Whitman, into a viable candidate, and Bradley won by only a slim margin. In 1995, he announced he would not run for re-election, publicly declaring American politics [...] "broken." ...|$|E
500|$|Greg Jein {{had already}} {{been working on a}} new model of the USS Excelsior for the [...] "Flashback" [...] episode of Voyager when he saw the test footage for [...] "Trials and Tribble-ations". He promised to make a new model of the Enterprise too, but warned that he didn't <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> would have time to do it. He {{actually}} started work on it immediately, and together with his colleagues he not only built a [...] long model of the Enterprise, but created a new model of Deep Space Station K7 and the Klingon cruiser as well. The Enterprise model was the first to be built of the original Star Trek starship in more than 30 years. Other props were also recreated, with around 1,400 tribbles created for the various scenes. They were purchased from Lincoln Enterprises, a company set up by Majel Barrett, widow of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry. The rest of the era-specific props were newly created, and were made by Steve Horsch.|$|E

500|$|... "Fermín" [...] {{describes}} a mentally ill character in an institution. The song changes {{a line from}} the French folk song, [...] "Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre", from [...] "Mambrú se fue a la guerra, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Mambrú left for the war; I do not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> will return") to [...] "Fermín se fue a la vida, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Fermín left for life; I do not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> will return"). According to Spinetta, [...] "life for the insane is like war for the sane." [...] Reflecting on the track, Spinetta said: [...] "In front of my house lived an incredible character called Carlitos, a retarded boy, who is in part the personification of Fermín for me. With Carlitos we shared moments of joy when we were kids. Although he could not play ball with everyone, he felt accompanied in his tremendous problem when we were with him. It is also an apology, because I remember that his mother punished him a lot, even {{in front of the other}} boys. I do not know if the degree of illness of the song's Fermín is as actue as that of Carlitos, but serves to define the situation of the alienated as a propitious cell to receive the most aberrant injustices. [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] urges not to wake a poor child up, letting him be happy in his dreams. The criticism of society's injustice is, in Spinetta's words, [...] "a complaint made with tenderness." [...] He called it [...] "the symbol of a Christian ideology: neighborliness, solidarity." [...] "A estos hombres tristes" [...] was inspired by the melancholy of Sundays in Argentina, with Spinetta saying: [...] "Sunday was always a sad day, I do not know why. At the same time it was happy because there was football, the family gathered, there was good food. The importance that was given to the weekend in our country in those years was tremendous. But the personal solitude at that time was very clear." [...] The album ends with [...] "Laura va", a baroque pop song which took Spinetta a year and a half to write; Spinetta described it as an attempt to emulate the Beatles' [...] "She's Leaving Home".|$|E
500|$|Lost writer Elizabeth Sarnoff {{explained}} that Michael's storyline in season two is about [...] "what a father {{will do to}} save his son"; she noted [...] "there's nothing worse than what he does". The second episode of season two was originally going to be Sawyer centric, however this was rewritten [...] "at the proverbial last minute" [...] and changed to a Michael centric episode. Perrineau received swimming lessons in preparation for this episode. Perrineau was unaware that his character had been captured by the Others until he was told Michael {{was going to kill}} Ana Lucia and Libby. Perrineau described shooting the scenes in [...] "Two for the Road" [...] where Michael murders Ana Lucia and Libby as a [...] "tough day". The last scene shot of season two was Michael and Walt sailing away from the Island. As it was a long camera shot, Perrineau had to sail the boat so far from the pier, that by the time he returned, all the equipment had already been packed away. He said, [...] "It felt fitting, actually. Like; that's it". Perrineau knew he would be back one day, but as the producers did not reveal any details to him, he did not <b>know</b> <b>when.</b> <b>He</b> was the first actor that left the show as [...] "part of a grander design to come back", and the only one until Emilie de Ravin.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 April 1801, Nelson began to advance into Copenhagen harbour. The battle began badly for the British, with , [...] and [...] running aground, {{and the rest of}} the fleet encountering heavier fire from the Danish shore {{batteries}} than had been anticipated. Parker sent the signal for Nelson to withdraw, reasoning:I will make the signal for recall for Nelson's sake. If he is in a condition to continue the action he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat and no blame can be attached to him. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: [...] "I told you to look out on the Danish commodore and let me <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> surrendered. Keep your eyes fixed on him." [...] He then turned to his flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said [...] "You know, Foley, I have only one eye. I have a right to be blind sometimes." [...] He raised the telescope to his blind eye, and said [...] "I really do not see the signal." [...] The battle lasted three hours, leaving both Danish and British fleets heavily damaged. At length Nelson dispatched a letter to the Danish commander, Crown Prince Frederick, calling for a truce, which the Prince accepted. Parker approved of Nelson's actions in retrospect, and Nelson was given the honour of going into Copenhagen the next day to open formal negotiations. At a banquet that evening, he told Prince Frederick that the battle had been the most severe he had ever been in. The outcome of the battle and several weeks of ensuing negotiations was a 14-week armistice, and on Parker's recall in May, Nelson became commander-in-chief in the Baltic Sea. As a reward for the victory, he was created Viscount Nelson of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, on 19 May 1801. In addition, on 4 August 1801, he was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk, this time with a special remainder to his father and sisters. Nelson had sailed to the Russian naval base at Reval (now Tallinn) in May, and there learned that the pact of armed neutrality was to be disbanded. Satisfied with the outcome of the expedition, he returned to England, arriving on 1 July.|$|E

2500|$|Paar {{came back}} to {{television}} {{on a regular basis}} beginning in January 1973, with Jack Paar Tonite which aired monthly as one of several rotating shows on ABC's Wide World of Entertainment.

Paar's announcer for this series was comic actress Peggy Cass, and perhaps its most notable aspect was the national television debut of comic Freddie Prinze. Paar stayed on the show, which was in direct competition with Tonight, for one year before he quit. Dissatisfied with the one-week-per-month formula, he complained that even his own mother did not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was on.
