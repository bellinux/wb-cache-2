5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab</b> at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Nuttin {{designed}} {{experiments to}} test the hypothesis that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name. It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.|$|E
5|$|Americium often enters {{landfills}} from discarded smoke detectors. The rules {{associated with}} the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors {{in an attempt to}} build a breeder nuclear reactor. There have been a few cases of exposure to americium, the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 {{as a result of an}} explosion <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab.</b> McCluskey died at the age of 75 of unrelated pre-existing disease.|$|E

He was then {{taken into custody}} by Project: Pegasus, but Spidercide {{replaced}} a helicopter pilot, and escaped with Helix. The Jackal further experimented on a helpless Rafael, mutating him further. The Jackal was unable to discover how Helix developed Adaptoid powers, and during a clone revolt <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>labs,</b> Helix escaped.|$|R

Carlos sacrifices himself by plowing his truck into the zombie mob and blowing them all up, giving Alice and Claire time to load survivors into the helicopter. Alice decides to stay behind. Ordered by Wesker to terminate Isaacs, Slater arrives {{with a group of}} commandos and finds the scientist locked <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab,</b> injecting himself with massive doses of anti-virus in an attempt to counteract the infection. Slater reveals that his employment is terminated and shoots him, triggering his mutation into a monstrous Tyrant. Despite retaining his intelligence and thought, Isaacs kills Slater and all the facility employees, but is confined to the lab's lower levels.|$|E
5|$|The agents find Banton at {{the train}} station, but he runs to a poorly lit area. He {{declares}} that walking into his shadow will kill the agents, so Mulder shoots out the overhead lights. Banton allows himself {{to be taken to}} a mental hospital, where he is put in a room with soft light per his own request. He tells the agents that the accident <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab</b> caused his shadow to behave like a black hole, splitting atoms into component particles and reducing matter into pure energy. Banton claims that the deaths were all accidents, and that the government wants to exploit him. Detective Ryan and her superior officer stop the questioning, declaring the case closed, despite Mulder's objections. Mulder contacts X (Steven Williams), who assures him that the government has no interest in Banton. However, X and two associates later attempt to remove Banton from the hospital by cutting the power. In the process, the two attendants are killed when the emergency lights turn on and Banton's shadow falls upon them. Banton flees from the hospital.|$|E
25|$|Nan's {{separation}} from Ricketts in 1932 {{was the first}} of many separations. In 1936 Ricketts and Nan separated for good, and he took up residence <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab.</b> On 25 November 1936, a fire spread from the adjacent cannery, destroying the lab. Ricketts lost nearly everything, including an extraordinary amount of correspondence, research notes, manuscripts, and his prized library, which had held everything from invaluable scientific resources to his beloved collection of poetry. However, the manuscript of Ricketts' textbook (with Jack Calvin) Between Pacific Tides had already been sent to the publisher. John Steinbeck would become a silent 50% partner in the lab, after funding its reconstruction costs.|$|E

50|$|<b>His</b> <b>lab</b> {{specifically}} {{looks at}} the manipulation of stress response pathways, such as the heat shock response and the unfolded protein response of the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. <b>In</b> particular, <b>his</b> <b>lab</b> found a cell non-autonomous mitochondrial stress response that can be transmitted to very distal cells.|$|R
25|$|The {{neurotoxicity}} of MPTP {{was first}} hinted at in 1976 after Barry Kidston, a 23-year-old chemistry {{graduate student in}} Maryland, synthesized MPPP (a synthetic opiate related to pethidine and the prodines) with MPTP as a major impurity, and self-injected the result. Within three days he began exhibiting symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The National Institute of Mental Health found traces of MPPP, MPTP, and other pethidine analogues <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab.</b> They tested the substances on rats, but due to rodents' tolerance {{for this type of}} neurotoxin nothing was observed. Kidston's parkinsonism was successfully treated with levodopa but he died 18 months later from a cocaine overdose. Upon autopsy, destruction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra was discovered.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{the chief}} of the Bacteriology Division at the Army laboratory, Patricia Worsham, said it lacked the {{facilities}} in 2001 to make the kind of spores in the letters. In 2011, the government conceded that the equipment required was not available in the lab calling into question a key pillar of the FBI's case, that Ivins had produced the anthrax <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab.</b> According to Worsham, the lab's equipment for drying spores, a machine the size of a refrigerator, was not in containment so that it would be expected that non-immunized personnel in that area would have become ill. Colleagues of Ivins at the lab have asserted that he couldn't have grown the quantity of anthrax used in the letters without their noticing it.|$|E
25|$|Morgan was a {{supporter}} of de Vries's mutation theory and was hoping to gather evidence {{in favor of it}} when he started working with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab</b> in 1907. However, it was a researcher in that lab, Hermann Joseph Muller, who determined in 1918 that the new varieties de Vries had observed while breeding Oenothera were the result of polyploid hybrids rather than rapid genetic mutation. While they were doubtful of the importance of natural selection, the work of geneticists like Morgan, Bateson, de Vries and others from 1900 to 1915 established Mendelian genetics linked to chromosomal inheritance, which validated August Weismann's criticism of neo-Lamarckian evolution by discounting the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The work in Morgan's lab with Drosophila also undermined the concept of orthogenesis by demonstrating the random nature of mutation.|$|E

25|$|An {{oncogene}} is a {{gene that}} is mutated or expressed at high levels, and thus helps turn a normal cell into a tumor cell. In the late 1970s, Robert Weinberg {{and his team of}} researchers began the search for a human oncogene. Using gene transfer techniques, researchers <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab</b> inserted DNA from human bladder tumor cells into normal animal cells. When the animal cells turned cancerous, Dr. Weinberg's associates began inserting smaller pieces of DNA into the normal cell. By 1980, they found a single fragment that turned the normal cell cancerous. This gene was found to belong to a sub-family of related genes, called ras, that was later discovered {{to play a role in}} causing bladder, lung, and colon cancer in both rats and humans. More results emerged in 1982 when Dr. Weinberg's laboratory discovered that a single, subtle genetic glitch in this oncogene topples the delicate balance between a bladder cell's normal and cancerous states.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} he joins the Legion, Superboy's life is {{threatened}} when a Green Kryptonite meteor falls to Earth, but his life is saved by a Smallville farm boy named Lex Luthor, {{who also happens to}} be a science prodigy. The two boys become fast friends, and Superboy builds Lex a fully stocked laboratory to allow him to conduct his experiments. Lex uses the lab to search for a cure for Superboy's weakness to Kryptonite. Just after Lex discovers the cure, a fire breaks out <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab.</b> When Superboy puts out the fire, the antidote is destroyed, along with a protoplasmic life form that Lex created, and Lex also loses all his hair. Lex blames Superboy for destroying his experiment and his hair loss, accusing the Boy of Steel of jealousy over his brilliance. Lex swears that he will prove to the world that he is superior to Superboy. Lex does this by trying to implement a series of scientific quality-of-life improvements for Smallville's residents; however, each invention of Lex's winds up backfiring, requiring Superboy to intervene. This series of setbacks results in Lex dedicating his life to destroying Superboy. In the years that follow, Lex becomes Superboy's (and then Superman's) archfoe. Superboy soon acquires a small rogues gallery of recurring villains, including Lex.|$|E

Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife.|$|E
500|$|In 1857 Maxwell befriended the Reverend Daniel Dewar, who {{was then}} the Principal of Marischal. Through him Maxwell met Dewar's daughter, Katherine Mary Dewar. They were engaged in February 1858 and married in Aberdeen on 2 June 1858. On the {{marriage}} record, Maxwell is listed as Professor of Natural Philosophy in Marischal College, Aberdeen. Seven years Maxwell's senior, comparatively little is known of Katherine, although it is known that she helped <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab</b> and worked on experiments in viscosity.

Jameson, exhibiting the same jitters as Earl Jenkins, attempts to kill Chloe and Pete to hide what he has been doing, but his jitters become uncontrollable and he kills himself <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab.</b> As Chloe and Pete leave the lab they come across Lionel Luthor, leading Chloe to realize that Lionel was funding Jameson's efforts.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, a primate {{researcher}} at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shut down the experiments <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lab</b> after threats from animal rights activists. The researcher had received a grant to use 30 macaque monkeys for vision experiments; each monkey was anesthetized for a single physiological experiment lasting up to 120 hours, and then euthanized. The researcher's name, phone number, and address were posted on the website of the Primate Freedom Project. Demonstrations were held {{in front of his}} home. A Molotov cocktail was placed on the porch of what was believed to be the home of another UCLA primate researcher; instead, it was accidentally left on the porch of an elderly woman unrelated to the university. The Animal Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the attack. As a result of the campaign, the researcher sent an email to the Primate Freedom Project stating [...] "you win", and [...] "please don't bother my family anymore". In another incident at UCLA in June 2007, the Animal Liberation Brigade placed a bomb under the car of a UCLA children's ophthalmologist who experiments on cats and rhesus monkeys; the bomb had a faulty fuse and did not detonate.|$|E
