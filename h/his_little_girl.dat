5|$|The Restoration is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Hugh Logan, a single father who leaves <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> May, at home when he goes on a business trip. On {{the way to the}} city he is attacked by robbers and left in the road. He is found and taken in, but he suffers from amnesia. He falls in love with Maud Neals and proposes to her. Due to the prolonged absence of her father, May is taken to an orphan asylum, but she escapes. May goes to the city and ends up stopping to sleep on the doorstep of the Neals' home. Maud finds her and takes her in, where Logan recognizes his daughter and his memory comes back. Little is known of the production credits, but the film does feature Marie Eline as the little girl. It was released on August 5, 1910 and was met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
500|$|Coghill has {{explained}} that Tony began grooming Whitney {{as soon as}} he met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's [...] "hero figure" [...] and [...] "saviour". Coghill elucidated: [...] "The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life. But Tony's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children. Whitney is beginning to pass her sell-by date with him. [...] He feels like he's losing <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out." [...] As Tony began to lose interest in Whitney, he started grooming her 14-year-old school-friend Lauren Branning. A show-insider commented that Tony had been getting away with abusing Whitney for years, but was escalating as one young girl was no longer enough to satisfy him.|$|E
500|$|A {{surviving}} {{description of}} this lost film {{was published in}} The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Two men playing cards, the argument, flash of a revolver, and one lay dead. The murderer homeward fled, hurried <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> baby into a west-bound train and was heard of no more. The years passed and boyish Jim Conway grew to manhood with {{the sole purpose of}} seeking out his father's murderer to deal justice to him. He went West and was one day lost in the mountains. He called for help and help {{came in the form of}} a sweet-faced woman who led him to her home. He spent the flying weeks with her and the aged father, learned to love the mountain nymph for her beauty of soul and fair face. One day she asked him his reasons for being in the hill country, and he, lover-like, confided his secret. Behind the door, sat the white-haired father. He rose, shook himself like a leaf as be invited the young man into the house. And there he confessed the deed, baring his chest for the expected blow. But none fell for love had sweetened the poison of his thought." [...] This summary of the film was provided by the American Film Manufacturing Company.|$|E

60|$|They {{left him}} alone, and Trent, with a groan, plucked from his heart the one strong, sweet hope which {{had changed his}} life so wonderfully. Upstairs, Monty was sobbing, with <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl's</b> arms about him.|$|R
50|$|The story {{concerns}} {{a newspaper reporter}} indebted to a gangster for raising the money to save <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl's</b> life. The source material was remade into a 1942 film of the same name. Helen Parrish appeared in both versions.|$|R
500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by film critics {{and even the}} passing mentions in The Moving Picture World remarked {{that it was a}} good offering with good photography. Jack Harvey's debut film as a director was well received by the public due to its [...] "universally appealing" [...] theme. Thanhouser writes that the [...] "loyal dog's attachment to <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> playmate is treated with pictorial beauty and simple, honest sentiment", and notes that when it was released on October 4, 1914, reviewers praised the [...] "double-exposure passages for their dramatic effectiveness". Louis Reeves Harrison of The Moving Picture World review of the film stated, [...] "This play becomes one of delicate pathos toward the end through some remarkable feats of double exposure, and it is one of beauty throughout because of the acting of a four-year-old tot, Baby Helen, a veritable star in her class. Shep contributes with exceptional intelligence - he is not eternally looking at his master out of scope for a word of command. ... I do not know what director handled this subject, but I suggest he apply his thought visualizations to the human characters of future stories. It is the exhibition of what passes in the minds and hearts of characters that brings an audience into closer sympathy with them and makes tense interest possible when melodrama merely brings a laugh. The double exposures are timed with such skill in this instance that all concerned in their production deserve high praise. They give beauty and dignity to a very simple story." ...|$|E
500|$|Chris Coghill {{was cast}} as Whitney's abuser Tony on 20 June 2008. Upon {{accepting}} the role, he commented: [...] "Shona doesn't act, or look, {{like a little}} child. Which helps." [...] He has added of their off-screen relationship: [...] "Shona's fantastic to work with. She's very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress. There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008. Coghill has explained that Tony began grooming Whitney {{as soon as he}} met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's [...] "hero figure" [...] and [...] "saviour". Discussing his character's relationship with Whitney, Coghill explained that: [...] "The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life. But Tony's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children. Whitney is beginning to pass her sell-by date with him. [...] He feels like he's losing <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out." [...] Coghill stated that: [...] "This is the most challenging role I have had to play. But I hope by EastEnders tackling the sensitive issue of child abuse it can raise awareness." [...] When asked how she felt about the abuse storyline, Palmer commented: [...] "It would be brilliant if it helped somebody. If one person out there who's been abused saw [...] {{go out of their way}} to make it easier on the victim – Whitney's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 10, 1910. It states: [...] "Rip Van Winkle, although a loving father to <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> Meenie and a hail-fellow-well-met {{with all of his}} fellow townsmen, is being constantly scolded by his wife for leading an idle and profitless existence. Rip is also fond of the bottle and spends a greater part of his time and money at the village tavern. Catching him entering the house late one night after a day's carousing, his wife Gretchen becomes thoroughly angry with him and drives him from the house. In the face of a terrible storm with only his dog Schneider and his faithful rifle to protect him, Rip wanders toward the mountains. Here he comes across a band of gnomes who are supposed to be the spirits of Heinrich Hudson [...] and his merry men who disappeared near the Catskill Mountains hundreds of years before, and had never been heard of since. The gnomes give Rip some magic schnapps to drink, and under its influence he goes to sleep for 20 years. When he awakes, he is an old man and in ragged clothes. His dog is dead, and his rifle has rusted away. He makes his way as best he can back to the village, and his own home. But there no one knows him. He finds his wife married to another man, his daughter grown to womanhood, and most of his old friends dead and gone. Rip, however, finally manages to prove his identity, and also to lay claim to his property, which has greatly increased in value during his sleep, in which he is just in time to save from being unlawfully confiscated by his old-time enemy. Happily reunited to his family, Rip looks forward to his declining years with a spirit born of peace and solace." ...|$|E
50|$|Some of Funt's pieces did {{not involve}} pranks but {{consisted}} simply of interviews with ordinary people. There were bizarre sequences in which people, sometimes children, gave one-of-a-kind interpretations of works of art. A <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> once told Funt that The Discus Thrower by Praxiteles showed a man throwing <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl's</b> allowance to her while {{she stood in the}} back yard.|$|R
50|$|Later, Michael is {{dressing}} with <b>little</b> {{success for}} <b>his</b> daughter's wedding. He is not pleased with <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl's</b> choice of husband ("The Father of the Bride"). Agnes enters, crying. The stained glass window appears again, and Michael and Agnes watch the ceremony. They wave to the departing couple {{and go home}} to face an empty nest.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; but I do {{not think}} this is the same family. This is a retired general, living in a house of Lord Rotherwood's. I once met one of <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls,</b> who came to Castle Towers with the Rotherwood party, and though she had a brother of the name, he was evidently not the same person." ...|$|R
2500|$|Again {{he falls}} asleep. [...] But this time his {{awakening}} will be better. [...] The nightmare has disappeared; it lingers {{only as a}} light headache that the first smile of <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> will dissipate when Pierrot, fully recovered to himself, runs {{to give her the}} newly found doll.|$|E
2500|$|Pierrot enters {{carrying}} {{newspapers and}} a doll. [...] The newspapers for himself, the doll for <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> who is {{sleeping in the}} next room. [...] Having checked on her sleep, he doesn't want to disturb it, so plunges into the reading of his newspapers, which, after filling him with horror, end up by putting him to sleep, too. [...] A dream arrives. [...] Pierrot, now a sleepwalker, gets up, seizes the carafe in which his hallucinated gaze sees some excellent Tokay, and drinks bumper after bumper. [...] A little tipsy, {{he picks up the}} doll, believing it to be his daughter; he rocks it to put it back to sleep, smooths its little face and hair, and, growing annoyed over his exertions in undressing it for bed, he throws it on the floor.|$|E
2500|$|Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), a Viennese {{neurologist}} {{who studied}} with Charcot in 1885, relinquished spellbinding {{with the expectation}} of complimentary affiliation and the elucidation of dreams, as a method for achieving [...] "purification" [...] and comprehension manifestations. The other ingredients of his 'models', which changed throughout the years, included {{the part of the}} oblivious, juvenile sexuality, restraint (created from Pierre Janet) and other 'safeguard components' (later recorded methodically by <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> Anna Freud), distinguishing proof with the lost [...] "protest" [...] in grieving, and the vacillation of emotions. He likewise portrayed the perils and the restorative capability of [...] "transference"; the emotions coordinated towards the specialist by a patient reinstituting experiences from prior persuasive connections. A considerable lot of his thoughts were too broad to be in any way amiable to trial testing and conceivable invalidation, and he was reprimanded for this by Jaspers. Different examiners who gave bits of knowledge into the advancement of mental indications included Melanie Klein ('the neurotic schizoid position') and Donald Winnicott, who worked in London (1935), predominantly with kids. Since the 1960s, however, the utilization of analysis for the treatment of extreme emotional sickness has been logically dissolved. Different types of psychotherapy have been created, chiefly for non-maniacal conditions, with firmer establishments regarding evidence of adequacy and practicability. These incorporate subjective treatments (after Beck), behavioral treatments (after Skinner and Wolpe) and additional time-constrained and centered structures, for example, interpersonal psychotherapy. In youth issue and in schizophrenia, the systems of family treatment hold esteem. A portion of the thoughts emerging from therapy are presently pervasive and some are a piece of the armamentarium of ordinary clinical practice. They are not just medications, they additionally help to understand complex conduct.|$|E
60|$|Arthur quitted London the {{day after}} <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl's</b> christening, talking of being absent only a fortnight, before taking his wife to Windsor; and {{promising}} to return at once, if she should find herself in the least unwell or dispirited. She was delighted to be well enough not to spoil his sport, and Theodora was too anxious to have him {{at a distance from}} Mr. Gardner to venture on any remonstrance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So {{did your}} Papa and I,' said Lady Merton; 'but you must excuse him, {{when you think}} of <b>his</b> three <b>little</b> <b>girls,</b> Elizabeth especially, {{requiring}} such anxious care of body and mind.' ...|$|R
50|$|Kathy meets back up {{with the}} Cat in the Hat, who tells her the story about him. The story is acted out by a father reading the story to <b>his</b> two <b>little</b> <b>girls.</b>|$|R
60|$|He seems {{trying to}} understand. Then a thought strikes him, and he sends away <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> with a needless message to her mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no. The wind {{sounds a}} little lonesome to-night, that's all." [...] But he took <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> {{into his arms and}} held her close.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly Mr. St. Clare and <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> heard a great noise {{coming from}} Miss Ophelia's room. A minute later she appeared, {{dragging}} Topsy behind her.|$|E
50|$|Rosalie's {{father was}} a General in the French Army but was away just then and unaware of <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl's</b> fate. He heard of it at last and sent for her, and the person he {{commissioned}} to fetch her arrived three days only three days before she {{was to have been}} sent to the :fr:Hôpital Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, the Foundling Hospital of Paris. She was released after the Thermidorian Reaction (9 Thermidor, Year 11, 27 July 1794) and the death of Maximilien Robespierre the following day.|$|R
60|$|And so the Parson, having {{completed}} his domestic embassy {{for the benefit}} of <b>his</b> sick <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> followed the others, keen for the hunt; and the three ladies were left alone, to see the plate and china put away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hassan come again," [...] {{the chief}} said, {{and left the}} hut with his followers. The lads poured calabashes of water over each other, and felt wonderfully {{refreshed}} by their wash, which was accomplished without damage to the floor, which was of bamboos raised two feet above the ground. When they were dressed they fell to at their breakfast, and then went out of doors. Hassan had evidently been watching for them, for {{he came out of}} his house, which was next to that which they occupied, holding <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl's</b> hand. She at once ran up to them, saluting them by their names.|$|R
60|$|Yes; <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> that {{he spoke}} of so carelessly, that he lied to so easily, that he meant to marry so cruelly, was my Dora.|$|E
6000|$|And her mother, who {{had heard}} what the sailor had said to <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> knew at once what Mary meant; so she kissed her {{daughter}} and replied, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] {{interrupted}} the sailor, [...] "that's not the luck I'm thinkin' of. Havin' overhauled Roarin' Bull an' <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> {{in time to}} help rescue them, that's what I call luck--d'ee see?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{his heart}} grew red--hot with passionate {{feeling for the}} child. She was {{not much more than}} a year old when the second baby was born. Then he took Ursula for his own. She <b>his</b> first <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> He had set his heart on her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, {{not like}} you, may boy,' said Sir Marmaduke, {{sufficiently}} aware of Berenger's belief to {{be glad to}} keep it up, and yet obliged {{to walk to the}} window to hide his diversion at the notion of <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls</b> catching the contagion of sword-gashes and bullet-wounds. Dame Annora prattled on, 'But they have sent you their Christmas gifts by me. Poor children, they have long been busied with them, and I fancy Lucy did half herself. See, this kerchief is hemmed by little Dolly, and here are a pair of bands and cuffs to match, that Nanny and Bessy have been broidering with their choicest stitchery.' ...|$|R
60|$|P.S. Mr. Crawley's brother, the baronet, {{with whom}} we are not, alas! upon those terms of UNITY in which it BECOMES BRETHREN TO DWELL, has a governess for <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls,</b> who, I am told, {{had the good fortune}} to be educated at Chiswick.

60|$|It {{struggled}} hard, {{and tried}} to peck the hands that held it; {{but it was too}} young to hurt any one, so Twinkle's father decided he would carry it home to <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b>|$|E

60|$|Arriving at the house, James {{answered}} for <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl's</b> {{absence of}} shyness, {{and she was}} turned over to the Miss Calcotts, while the Squire conducted him to the study, and began with hesitation and something of apology--'It had struck him--it was not worth much--he hardly liked to propose it, and yet till something better should turn up--anything was better than doing nothing.' To which poor James heartily agreed. The board of guardians, where Mr. Calcott presided, were about to elect a chaplain to the union workhouse; the salary would be only fifty pounds, but if Mr. Frost would be willing to offer himself, {{it would be a great}} blessing to the inmates, and there would be no opposition.|$|R
