40|$|ABSTRACT. Cyclone {{separators}} {{are widely}} used in agricultural processing industries as air pollution abatement devices. The Texas A&M Cyclone Design (TCD) method is a simple method for designing cyclones based on an <b>inlet</b> design <b>velocity.</b> The TCD method specifies “ideal ” <b>inlet</b> <b>velocities</b> of 975 120 m/min (3200 400 fpm) and 914 120 m/min (3000 400 fpm) for 1 D 3 D and 2 D 2 D cyclones, respectively. There is evidence that higher dust collection efficiencies may be obtained from cyclones using different <b>inlet</b> <b>velocities</b> than those specified as the “ideal ” velocity. This article quantifies the <b>inlet</b> <b>velocities</b> at which maximum collection efficiencies are obtained for 1 D 3 D and 2 D 2 D cyclones and the marginal pressure drop associated with reaching these collection efficiencies. It is demonstrated that for large particles, the collection efficiency of six inch diameter 1 D 3 D and 2 D 2 D cyclones is similar for <b>inlet</b> <b>velocities</b> from 10. 16 standard m/s (2000 fpm) up to the design velocity, with significantly lower pressure drop at lower <b>inlet</b> <b>velocities...</b>|$|R

Data from these tests were used in developing a mathematical computer model capable of predicting outlet dust emissions given the following input variables: dust type and inlet concentration. <b>inlet</b> air <b>velocity,</b> and cyclone type. The model was developed based on the observation that a cyclone fractional efficiency curve (FEC) resembled a normal distribution's cumulative distribution function (CDF). The cut-point and sharpness-of-cut of the FEC were correlated to the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution's CDF, respectively. The model also estimated cyclone pressure drops based on given <b>inlet</b> <b>velocities.</b> Results showed that the correlation of parameters was indeed acceptable.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to use the energy in cotton gin trash (CGT) to fuel an internal combustion engine (ICE) driving a generator to produce electricity for a cotton gin. CGT is a fuel that has char that melts at low temperatures. This characteristic is referred to as char having a low eutectic point. Biomasses with low eutectic points cannot be used in a combustion process because the char will result in slagging and fouling. We have used fluidized bed gasification (FBG) to control the reaction temperatures and capture the energy in the biomass. CGT has an approximant 16, 300 kJ/kg (7, 000 Btu/lb) of energy. The resulting synthetic gas (syngas) can have an energy content as high as 7, 450 kJ/m^(3) (200 Btu/dscf) and can be fed directly into an internal combustion engine (ICE) which can drive a generator to produce electricity. The syngas conveys the char from the bed to the gas cleanup system consisting of specially designed cyclones. The cyclones were used to reduce particulate matter (PM) concentrations in the syngas prior to delivery to the ICE. Cyclones are capable of reducing the concentrations of particulate matter from syngas streams. The temperatures of the syngas leaving the gasification bed ranges from 371 to 760 ?C (700 to 1400 ?F). These high temperatures impact the cyclone <b>inlet</b> <b>velocities</b> {{as a consequence of the}} reduced gas densities. Changes in gas densities will influence the cyclone design. It was hypothesized that changes in cyclone performances as a consequence lower gas densities could be approximated by increasing the cyclones <b>inlet</b> <b>velocities</b> of air at standard temperature and pressure (STP) to correspond to the anticipated cyclone?s <b>inlet</b> <b>velocities</b> of syngas at the higher temperatures. Multiple tests of cyclone performances in simulated high temperature gas streams were conducted using bio-char. Preliminary cyclone testing results indicate that the location of the vortex inverter in the cyclone relative to the natural length can significantly impact the cyclone performance and design. Tests were conducted at <b>inlet</b> <b>velocities</b> of 16. 3, 30. 5, and 45. 7 m/s (3, 000, 6, 000 and 9, 000 fpm).

In general, a diffuser performance is affected by the relative location of the low velocity core-flow region in the <b>inlet</b> <b>velocity</b> profile. For the wide-angle diffuser with wake-type inlet shear flows, the favorable effects of mixing result in velocity profile flattening and hence the pressure-recovery performance is increased relative to the performance obtained for diffusers with uniform inlet core velocity profiles.

One type is the widely used uniform <b>inlet</b> <b>velocity</b> profile while {{the other is a}} realistic <b>inlet</b> <b>velocity</b> profile extracted from the external environment that is influenced by facial features. The latter type of <b>inlet</b> <b>velocity</b> profiles were obtained through CFD computations of indoor gas-particle flows around a human head geometry containing detailed facial features in an enclosed space. Comparisons were made between the predicted results of airflow field, particle tracks and particle deposition efficiency in the nasal cavity. It was revealed that although the effects of facial features exist only in a small region (10 - 20 mm) in front of the face, they lead to complicated, and non-uniform velocity profiles at the nostril openings. This discrepancy leads to different predictions of airflow fields and local particle deposition efficiency in the nasal cavity, especially in the anterior regions such as the vestibule and nasal valve. The results may further lead to discrepant health-risk assessments associated with particle inhalation.
