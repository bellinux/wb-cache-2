The stability of the intermediate relates inversely to the reactivity of the catalyst, which forms the basis of a catalyst-screening protocol in which less-abundant species represent the most-active catalysts, ‘the survival of the weakest’.

The environmental catalysis has made a step forward {{and it is a}} more challenging pathway for innovation in science relying on many disciplines. New catalytic process can produce clean up as well as cleaner technologies. The challenges for catalysis research in the 21 st century are identified, based on the current knowledge of catalysis researchers, recent fundamental and applied developments and current long-term objectives of the global energy and environmental protection processes. Any process efficiency now assigns economic values to eliminate waste and avoiding the use of hazardous chemicals and there are many exciting new developments in the application of organic synthesis work. Also catalysis is likely to become a key element in the conversion of liquid and or gaseous fuels into hydrogen for fuel cells application. Several catalyst systems are likely to emerge for different fuel cell types and on different fuel processors. The present catalyst technology need further progress <b>in</b> <b>catalyst</b> <b>development</b> and integration, cost reduction and successful field test program for fuel-to-fuel cell processor to eventually gain general customer acceptance. This presentation briefly discusses the R & D work currently under exploration at IICT that illustrates the catalytic technologies for solving environmental issues to provide sustainable development.

40|$|Kempe et al. and Milstein et al. have {{recently}} advanced the dehydrogenative coupling methodology to synthesize pyrroles from secondary alcohols (e. g., 3) and β-amino alcohols (e. g., 4), using PNP-Ir (1) and PNN-Ru (2) pincer complexes, respectively. We herein present a DFT study {{to characterize the}} catalytic mechanism of these reactions. After precatalyst activation to give active 1 A/ 2 A, the transformation proceeds via four stages: 1 A/ 2 A-catalyzed alcohol (3) dehydrogenation to give ketone (11), base-facilitated C-N coupling of 11 and 4 to form an imine-alcohol intermediate (18), base-promoted cyclization of 18, and catalyst regeneration via H 2 release from 1 R/ 2 R. For alcohol dehydrogenations, the bifunctional double hydrogen-transfer pathway is more favorable than that via β-hydride elimination. Generally, proton-transfer (H-transfer) shuttles facilitate various H-transfer processes in both systems. Notwithstanding, H-transfer shuttles play a much more {{crucial role in the}} PNP-Ir system than in the PNN-Ru system. Without H-transfer shuttles, the key barriers up to 45. 9 kcal/mol in PNP-Ir system are too high to be accessible, while the corresponding barriers (< 32. 0 kcal/mol) in PNN-Ru system are not unreachable. Another significant difference between the two systems is that the addition of alcohol to 1 A giving an alkoxo complex is endergonic by 8. 1 kcal/mol, whereas the addition to 2 A is exergonic by 8. 9 kcal/mol. The thermodynamic difference could be the main reason for PNP-Ir system requiring lower catalyst loading than the PNN-Ru system.

40|$|Our {{research}} program is broadly focused on activating CO{sub 2 } {{through the use}} of organic and organometallic based catalysts. Some of our methods have centered on annulation reactions of unsaturated hydrocarbons (and carbonyl substrates) to provide a diverse array of carbocycles and heterocycles. We use a combination of catalyst discovery and optimization in conjunction with classical physical organic chemistry to elucidate the key mechanistic features of the cycloaddition reactions such that the next big advances <b>in</b> <b>catalyst</b> <b>development</b> can be made. Key to all of our cycloaddition reactions is the use of a sterically hindered, electron donating N heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand, namely IPr (or SIPr), in conjunction with a low valent nickel pre-catalyst. The efficacy of this ligand is two-fold: (1) the high {delta}-donating ability of the NHC increases the nucleophilicity of the metal center which thereby facilitates interaction with the electrophilic carbonyl and (2) the steric hindrance prevents an otherwise competitive side reaction involving only the alkyne substrate. Such a system has allowed for the facile cycloaddition to prepare highly functionalized pyrones, pyridones, pyrans, as well as novel carbocycles. Importantly, all reactions proceed under extremely mild conditions (room temperature, atmospheric pressures, and short reaction times), require only catalytic amounts of Ni/NHC and readily available starting materials, and afford annulated products in excellent yields. Our current focus revolves around understanding the fundamental processes that govern these cycloadditions such that the next big advance in the cyclization chemistry of CO{sub 2 } can be made. Concurrent to our annulation chemistry is our investigation of the potential for imidazolylidenes to function as thermally-actuated CO{sub 2 } sequestering and delivery agents...|$|R

40|$|In this {{critical}} review, we present the current technological advances in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell catalysis, {{with a focus}} on strategies for developing nanostructured Pt-alloys as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The achievements are reviewed and the major challenges, including high cost, insufficient activity and low stability, are addressed and discussed. The nanostructured Pt-alloy catalysts can be grouped into different clusters: (i) Pt-alloy nanoparticles, (ii) Pt-alloy nanotextures such as Pt-skins/monolayers on top of base metals, and (iii) branched or anisotropic elongated Pt or Pt-alloy nanostructures. Although some Pt-alloy catalysts with advanced nanostructures have shown remarkable activity levels, the dissolution of metals, including Pt and alloyed base metals, in a fuel cell operating environment could cause catalyst degradation, and still remains an issue.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{bottlenecks}} <b>in</b> <b>catalyst</b> <b>development</b> for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) {{is the lack of}} fast high-throughput testing methods. Fast screening techniques enable a large number of catalysts to be tested in a relatively short time under the same conditions. This project was focused on developing systems for screening catalysts used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode of PEMFCs. The first system developed was the 64 channel pin electrode array, using liquid electrolyte. The developed method improved both the quality and reproducibility of the data and has been used to rank catalyst samples, as well as to optimize loadings and the preparative methods of inks. The second system developed was a 25 channel array fuel cell, which operated under conditions analogous to real fuel cell environments. Both methods allowed trends in characteristics and activities of a series of catalysts to be established more rapidly than individual single-electrode methods such as half cell, rotating disc electrode (RDE) or fuel cell. The results from the two high-throughput methods are compared to those of the single channel systems. The mass and specific activities towards reduction of oxygen were studied using a series of Pt/C and PtCo/C catalysts. The catalytic properties of the Pt based carbon-supported catalysts were related to their structure e. g. particle size and lattice parameter, which were obtained mainly using Xray diffraction (XRD). It was found that the results acquired sing parallel screening methods were similar to those collected with a RDE and a fuel cell. The thesis concludes with suggestions regarding the future improvement/development of high-throughput techniques. For the 64 channel array system the problem associated with the corrosion of the components should be solved. Similarly, the major changes for the array fuel cell would be to modify a heating system and further development of the anode flow field...|$|R

More than 95 % sulfur yield was achieved at reaction temperatures about 450 {degrees}C or higher with the feed gas of stoichiometric composition. Reaction of SO{sub 2 } and CO over these catalysts demonstrated a strong correlation of catalytic activity with the catalyst oxygen mobility. Furthermore, the catalytic activity and resistance to H{sub 2 }O and CO{sub 2 } poisoning of these catalysts were significantly enhanced by adding small amounts of transition metals, such as Co, Ni, Co, etc. The resulting transition metal-fluorite oxide composite catalyst has superior activity and stability, and shows promise in long use for the development of a greatly simplified single-step sulfur recovery process to treat variable and dilute SO{sub 2 } concentration gas streams. Among various active composite catalyst systems the Cu-CeO{sub 2 } system has been extensively studied. XRD, XPS, and STEM analyses of the used Cu-CeO{sub 2 } catalyst found that the fluorite crystal structure of ceria was stable at the present reaction conditions, small amounts of copper was dispersed and stabilized on the ceria matrix, and excess copper oxide particles formed copper sulfide crystals of little contribution to catalytic activity.
