The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct <b>in</b> <b>being</b> very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure.
