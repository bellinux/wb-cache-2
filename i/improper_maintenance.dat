5|$|While {{maintenance}} {{issues and}} not the actual design of the aircraft were ultimately found responsible for the crash, the accident and subsequent grounding of all DC-10s by the Federal Aviation Administration added to an already unfavorable reputation of the DC-10 aircraft {{in the eyes of}} the public, caused by several other incidents and accidents involving the type. The investigation also revealed other DC-10s with damage caused by the same faulty maintenance procedure. The faulty procedure was banned, and the aircraft type went on to have a long career as a passenger and cargo aircraft.

5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by <b>improper</b> <b>maintenance</b> procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Energy is {{considered}} a prime agent in the generation of wealth and {{a significant factor in}} economic development. Limited fossil resources and environmental problems associated with them have emphasized the need for new sustainable energy supply options that use renewable energies. Among available technologies for energy production from solar source, photovoltaic system could give a significant contribution to develop a more sustainable energy system. Solar Panel has its wide use starting from a simple 5 W diode lamp to a few kW ac drives. A solar panel with a battery and a charge controller and other auxiliary devices like dc to ac converters constitute a Solar Home System (SHS). Solar home system (SHS) is becoming popular day by day and even poor households are now becoming interested to purchase solar home system due to its various advantages. Solar home systems (SHS) have a major problem that is low efficiency. It also decreases output day by day because of <b>improper</b> <b>maintenances,</b> effect of dust and shadow. Accumulation of dust on solar panel of solar photovoltaic (PV) system is a natural process. It was found from the study that the accumulated dust on the surface of photovoltaic solar panel can reduce the system‟s efficiency by up to 35 % in one month. In this paper we show that the effect of dust accumulation on the solar panel naturally and how it is possible to overcome this problem...|$|R

Similarly, public hospital building needs an effective maintenance management as this type of building in nature {{is one of the}} most complex issues in the field of <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Improper</b> building <b>maintenance</b> management adopted by the organization significantly will interrupt the overall operation of the building. Therefore, this paper is aim to identifying the key performance indicator (KPI) of effectiveness of maintenance management for the public hospital building. A total of 32 set of questionnaires were distributed to the maintenance manager for each hospital in the northern region of peninsular Malaysia by using self-administration strategy. The survey answer was analyzed by performing descriptive analysis in SPSS. Overall, the result of descriptive analysis shows that all the ten factors of effectiveness of maintenance management are accepted as KPI since the mean value is at least 3. 93 which classified as important and significant. The most significant factor of effectiveness of maintenance management is task planning and scheduling with the mean score of 4. 35. While less significant factor is identify as maintenance approach with the value of mean score is 3. 93. The both results indicates that the management need to have well-structured planning for the maintenance works and also need to embrace the exact strategy of maintenance approach in order to achieved better overall performance of maintenance management.

[...] Based on this hypothesis of in-service damage, the NTSB also faulted the airline for <b>improper</b> <b>maintenance</b> and inspection due to its failure to identify the damaged locking mechanism.

Established Brca 2 mouse knockout models show embryonic lethality, but those with a truncating mu-tation at the C-terminus survive to birth and develop thymic lymphoma at an early age. To overcome early le-thality and investigate the function of BRCA 2, we used T cell-specific conditional Brca 2 knockout mice, which were previously shown to develop thymic lymphoma at a low penetrance.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry {{is one of}} the most dynamic and competitive segments of the international economy and it has invested considerable resources into the research and development of new components and the improvement of existent pieces. Nonetheless, failures continue to occur, often because of defects in a component. Failure analysis uses several techniques to investigate causes of the defect which led to the failure of a component, equipment, or structure. Usually, these causes are related to the use of inadequate materials, the presence of defects which appear during fabrication or design errors, or <b>improper</b> assembly, <b>maintenance</b> and use. Knowledge about these causes and the correction of such anomalies allow the improvement of the performance of components regarding both efficiency and safety. In this study, the results of the failure analysis of the drive bar of a police car are presented and light optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results are used to show that the presence of an already existent defect and an unfavorable microstructure led to the occurrence of brittle fracture which caused the premature and catastrophic failure of this component...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{strengths}} and weaknesses of available data and proposes specific expansions to aid studies of Human and Organizational Error (HOE) in the marine environment. It is suggested that analysis of this data will greatly aid spill prevention and mitigation by informing industry and regulators of potential HOE. Although this paper is closely targeted to the marine oil transportation industry and oil spills, it should be considered relevant to all marine activities involving hazardous materials. Applicability of data to the current research in petroleum tanker Loading and Discharge Operations (LDO) is noted; However absence of LDO information does not necessarily imply that the data is not useful for HOE in other operations. Preface Approximately one billion barrels of crude oil and products are transported in California waters each year. Based on statistics provided by the California State Lands Commission, tanker discharge and loading operations are the predominate source of industrial oil and chemical spills into California waters. These operations account for a spill frequency that is a factor of 10 more than that associated with offshore platforms, pipelines, and storage tanks. Spill reports indicate that a significant number of the spills are the result of Human and Organization Factors (HOF) such as poor communications, inadequate training, <b>improper</b> monitoring, inadequate <b>maintenance,</b> <b>improper</b> emergency provisions, and under-staffing resulting in fatigue and excessive stress. The objective of this project has been to further develop engineering procedures to assist in the definition and evaluation of alternatives to minimize the occurrence an...|$|R
