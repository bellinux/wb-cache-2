Most notable among these were James Keiller's and Sons, established in 1795, which pioneered commercial marmalade production, and the publishing firm DC Thomson, {{which was founded in}} the city in 1905. Dundee was said to be built on the 'three Js': Jute, Jam and Journalism.|$|E
25|$|The <b>jute</b> <b>industry</b> {{fell into}} {{decline in the}} early 20th century, partly due to reduced demand for jute {{products}} and partly due to an inability {{to compete with the}} emerging industry in Calcutta. This gave rise to unemployment levels far in excess of the national average, peaking in the inter-war period, but major recovery was seen in the post-war period, thanks to the arrival first of American light engineering companies like Timex and NCR, and subsequent expansion into microelectronics.|$|E
25|$|By the 1960s, NCR {{had become}} the {{principal}} employer of the city producing cash registers, and later ATMs, at several of its Dundee plants. The firm developed magnetic-strip readers for cash registers and produced early computers. Astral, a Dundee-based firm that manufactured and sold refrigerators and spin dryers was merged into Morphy Richards and rapidly expanded to employ over 1,000 people. The development in Dundee of a Michelin tyre-production facility helped to absorb the unemployment caused by {{the decline of the}} <b>jute</b> <b>industry,</b> particularly with the abolition of the jute control by the Board of Trade on 30 April 1969.|$|E

In 1920 the firm became a part of a new Dundee-based company <b>Jute</b> <b>Industries</b> Ltd. This was a new venture which acquired several of Dundee's jute works.

25|$|Working class housing spread {{rapidly and}} without control {{throughout}} the Victorian era, {{particularly in the}} Hawkhill, Blackness Road, Dens Road and Hilltown areas. Despite the comparative wealth of Victorian Dundee as a whole, living standards for the working classes were very poor. A general lack of town planning coupled with the influx of labour during {{the expansion of the}} <b>jute</b> <b>industry</b> resulted in insanitary, squalid and cramped housing for much of the population. While gradual improvements and slum clearance began in the late 19th century, the building of the groundbreaking Logie housing estate marked the beginning of Dundee's expansion through the building of planned housing estates, under the vision of city architect James Thomson, whose legacy also includes the housing estate of Craigiebank and the beginnings of an improved transport infrastructure by planning the Kingsway bypass.|$|E
25|$|The {{phasing out}} of the linen export bounty between 1825 and 1832 stimulated demand for cheaper textiles, {{particularly}} for cheaper, tough fabrics. The discovery that the dry fibres of jute could be lubricated with whale oil (of which Dundee had a surfeit, following the opening of its gasworks) {{to allow it to}} be processed in mechanised mills resulted in the Dundee mills rapidly converting from linen to jute, which sold at a quarter of the price of flax. Interruption of Prussian flax imports during the Crimean War and of cotton during the American Civil War resulted in a period of inflated prosperity for Dundee and the <b>jute</b> <b>industry</b> dominated Dundee throughout {{the latter half of the}} 19th century. Unprecedented immigration, notably of Irish workers, led to accelerated urban expansion, and at the height of the industry's success, Dundee supported 62 jute mills, employing some 50,000 workers. Cox Brothers, who owned the massive Camperdown Works in Lochee, were one of the largest jute manufacturers in Europe and employed more than 5,000 workers.|$|E
25|$|With a {{population}} of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the war, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded. Scottish urban centres, with their poverty and unemployment were favourite recruiting grounds of the regular British army, and Dundee, where the female dominated <b>jute</b> <b>industry</b> limited male employment {{had one of the}} highest proportion of reservists and serving soldiers than almost any other British city. Concern for their families' standard of living made men hesitate to enlist; voluntary enlistment rates went up after the government guaranteed a weekly stipend for life to the survivors of men who were killed or disabled. After the introduction of conscription from January 1916 every part of the country was affected. Occasionally Scottish troops made up large proportions of the active combatants, and suffered corresponding loses, as at the Battle of Loos, where there were three full Scots divisions and other Scottish units. Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead. Some areas, like the thinly populated Island of Lewis and Harris suffered some of the highest proportional losses of any part of Britain. Clydeside shipyards and the nearby engineering shops were the major centres of war industry in Scotland. In Glasgow, radical agitation led to industrial and political unrest that continued after the war ended. After {{the end of the war}} in June 1919 the German fleet interned in Scapa Flow was scuttled by its German crews, to avoid its ships being taken over by the victorious allies.|$|E
5000|$|Dundee {{had several}} large jute works, with Camperdown Works in Lochee being the world's largest jute works. It {{was owned by}} Cox Brothers, whose family had been {{involved}} in the linen trade in Lochee since the early eighteenth century, and was constructed from 1850 onwards. By 1878 it had its own railway branch and employed 4,500 workers, a total which had risen to 5,000 by 1900. Like several of Dundee's jute works Cox Brothers was taken over by <b>Jute</b> <b>Industries</b> Ltd in 1920. J Ernest Cox, the grandson of {{one of the founders of}} the firm, became chairman of <b>Jute</b> <b>Industries</b> in 1920 and would hold this position until 1948. Camperdown works closed in 1981.
