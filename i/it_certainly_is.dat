5|$|It {{has been}} noted that the feather, the first {{specimen}} of Archaeopteryx described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of Archaeopteryx. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a flight feather of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of feathered theropod, of which only this feather is known so far. As the feather had been designated the type specimen, the name Archaeopteryx should then no longer {{be applied to the}} skeletons, thus creating significant nomenclatorial confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or neotype. This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.|$|E

25|$|Also {{much like}} Williams is the {{theological}} and philosophical subtext. Ms. Carl takes {{the ideas of}} good vs. evil quite seriously and probes deeply into the idea of redemption. She does not, however, take her themes lightly, instead giving them a vigorous shaking down before she's done, resulting in a gripping spiritual thriller. One could easily call this 'in the tradition of Charles Williams' — which <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> — but it more importantly moves beyond that master of the spiritual thriller.|$|E

25|$|Is it {{necessary}} for sisters to be set apart to officiate in the sacred ordinances of washing, anointing, and laying on of hands in administering to the sick? <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not. Any and all sisters who honor their holy endowments, not only have right, but should feel it a duty, whenever called upon to administer to our sisters in these ordinances, which God has graciously committed to His daughters {{as well as to}} His sons; and we testify that when administered and received in faith and humility they are accompanied with almighty power.|$|E
25|$|The {{library was}} a major {{reference}} and research resource, but there were detractors. An editorial in The New York Times complained, “Popular <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not, and, so greatly is it lacking in the essentials of a public library, that its stores might almost as well be under lock and key, for any access the masses of the people can get thereto.” An article in The Sun of March 4, 1873, reported problems with the mutilation {{of some of the}} library's volumes. This was apparently done mostly for convenience: Instead of writing down extracts, readers cut out the sections with the information they needed.|$|E
25|$|We assume in {{accordance}} with that case that the corrective process supplied by the State may be so adequate that interference by habeas corpus {{ought not to be}} allowed. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> true that mere mistakes of law {{in the course of a}} trial are not to be corrected in that way. But if the case is that the whole proceeding is a mask—that counsel, jury and judge were swept to the fatal end by an irresistible wave of public passion, and that the State Courts failed to correct the wrong, neither perfection in the machinery for correction nor the possibility that the trial court and counsel saw no other way of avoiding an immediate outbreak of the mob can prevent this Court from securing to the petitioners their constitutional rights.|$|E

Drowned In Sound writer Pieter Macmillan commented positively on their use of vocals on the album saying [...] "having male and female vocals {{and the ability to}} switch from singing to screaming and back again immediately creates a rich and textured sonic world if it’s done well, as <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> here." ...|$|E

[...] Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called the episode [...] "among the best holiday TV specials ever produced." [...] Other reviews applauded the episode for its treatment of Judaism. Authors Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin, in their book Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim praised the episode for celebrating [...] "secular Jewishness in the wisest and most entertaining fashionGrandpa Boris regales the kids with an epic, albeit abridged, Exodus story." [...] Halley Blair of Forward Magazine called the episode [...] "a comical primer for getting children ready for upcoming seders," [...] and Danny Goldberg, in How The Left Lost Teen Spirit, noted that the episode's Jewish themes were [...] "clearly expressed {{in the context of a}} mass appeal entertainment." [...] Among many positive reviews of the episode in Jewish community publications, Gila Wertheimer of the Chicago Jewish Star said that the episode [...] "will entertain children of all ages – and their parents." ...|$|E

500|$|The show debuted on August 29, 2005 to an {{estimated}} audience of 10.5 million viewers. Fox had not seen such success for summertime Monday numbers since Melrose Place and Ally McBeal aired in September 1998. The premiere was ranked first in both the 18–49 and 18–34 demographics. The strong debut performance was also matched by various positive reviews. According to The New York Times, Prison Break was [...] "more intriguing {{than most of the}} new network series, and <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> one of the most original", complimenting its ability to create a [...] "suspenseful thriller" [...] and its [...] "authentic look". Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly dubbed it {{as one of the best}} new shows of 2005. On the other hand, The Washington Post criticized the show for its [...] "somber pretentiousness" [...] and [...] "uniformly overwrought" [...] performances. Due to its ratings success, Fox decided to extend Prison Break by an extra nine episodes, making it the first new series in the 2005–2006 television season to receive a full season order of 22 episodes. The series averaged 9.2 million viewers per week in its first season.|$|E
500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by someone we knew... It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. But I guess I could maybe have switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E
