500|$|In March 2000, Van Morrison {{told the}} Irish rock {{magazine}} Hot Press {{about the impact}} that Freewheelin made on him: [...] "I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street. And I {{just thought it was}} incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> the time. The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up ... Dylan put it into the mainstream that this could be done." ...|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{its initial}} reception, Illmatic {{has been viewed}} by music writers {{as one of the}} quintessential hip hop {{recordings}} of the 1990s, while its rankings near the top of many publications' [...] "best album" [...] lists in disparate genres have given it {{a reputation as one of}} the greatest hip hop albums of all time. Jon Pareles of The New York Times cited Illmatic as a [...] "milestone in trying to capture the 'street ghetto essence'". The album has been described by a number of writers and critics as [...] "classic". Chris Ryan, writing in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), called Illmatic [...] "a portrait of an artist as a hood, loner, tortured soul, juvenile delinquent, and fledgling social critic," [...] and wrote that it [...] "still stands as one of rap's crowning achievements". Similar to The Sources initial sentiment, XXL later gave the album a classic [...] "XXL" [...] rating in a retrospective review. In a retrospective review for MSN Music, Christgau said the record was [...] "better than <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> the time for sure—as happens with aesthetes sometimes, the purists heard subtleties principled vulgarians like me were disinclined to enjoy", although he still found it inferior to The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut album Ready to Die (1994). [...] In 2002, Prefix Mags Matthew Gasteier re-examined Illmatic and its musical significance, stating: ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> the time {{he was trying to get}} cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E
2500|$|Pupa. Suspended by {{the tail}} and a band that encircles it much nearer the head than is usual with Papilio pupae. In form stout, flattened, dilated in the middle, with head and thorax thrown back. Head {{somewhat}} angular and tuberculated; two of the abdominal segments each with a prominent dorsal pair of pointed tubercles. Colour usually light brown, with a strongly contrasting saddle of old gold. (After Davidson & Aitken) - Mr T. A. Sealy (Proc. Ent Soc. 1875 p.9) states- [...] "The pupa possesses the power of making a curious noise like pha-pha!, and makes it very loudly when touched; the noise is accompanied (perhaps produced) by a short contraction of the abdominal segments. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> first it was merely produced by the rubbing of one ring of the pupa-case against the next, but the sound did not resemble a mere frictional sound, {{it was more like}} the sound of a rush of air through small holes. I tried to produce it with a dead chrysalis but failed: the pupa sometimes contracted on being touched without making the noise, and appeared unable to make the noise until some time was given to allow it to recover its vigour." [...] Messrs. Davidson and Aitken have also noticed this power in the pupa, but they speak of it [...] "as a husky squeaking noise, produced apparently by friction of the abdominal rings." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or œconomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>at</b> some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall have plenty of time to think of better words".|$|E
