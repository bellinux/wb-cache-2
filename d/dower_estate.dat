50|$|On 30 October 1968, {{he married}} Marian Ferguson (née Montagu Douglas Scott), widow of Colonel Andrew Henry Ferguson. Marian was the {{daughter}} of Lord Herbert Montagu Douglas Scott and Marie Josephine Edwards and the granddaughter of William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch and Lady Louisa Hamilton. From Marian's first marriage, she was the paternal grandmother of Sarah, Duchess of York, and maternal great-grandmother of HRH Princess Beatrice of York and HRH Princess Eugenie of York. Together they lived at Dummer Down House, at Dummer in Basingstoke, Hants, her <b>dower</b> <b>estate</b> from her first marriage.|$|E
50|$|On 26 November 1575 at Nancy, {{she married}} Eric II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, {{an old friend}} of her family and a recent widower from an unfortunate {{marriage}} with Sidonie of Saxony. In 1578, she joined Eric on his war expedition to support Juan d'Austria in Namur. The same year, Eric was employed by Philip of Spain in his attempt to conquer Portugal. Dorothea lived at the Spanish court, and became a personal friend of the King. He made instructions that certain amounts of her spouse's salary be given to her rather than to him, granted her personal gifts, a patent for working certain gold-mines, and the succession of her spouse to Tortona, the <b>dower</b> <b>estate</b> of her mother in Italy, upon her mother's death.|$|E
50|$|The Veldenzes {{seem to have}} {{bestowed}} their lordly allodial seat upon somebody else, for in 1432, Einöllen was a <b>dower</b> <b>estate</b> held by Sofie von Eich, who was Wilhelm Wolf von Sponheim’s wife. He, in turn, was one of {{the owners}} of Castle Alt-Wolfstein (near Wolfstein). In 1595, according to records from Disibodenberg, tithing rights in Einöllen belonged to the Order of Saint John. In the 15th century, the Amt seat was moved and there then appeared the Amt or Gericht (court region) of Einöllen, which also took in Hohenöllen, Sulzbach (now Sulzhof, an outlying homestead of Hohenöllen), Oberweiler, Tiefenbach, Rossbach, Stahlhausen and Immetshausen. In 1768, Einöllen passed by way of the Selz-Hagenbach Exchange from the Oberamt of Meisenheim and the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken (to which the County of Veldenz had passed in 1444) to the Electorate of the Palatinate’s Amt of Wolfstein and Oberamt of Kaiserslautern.|$|E
50|$|When {{she became}} a widow, in 1647, she was granted Lolland-Falster as her fief and the {{position}} of royal sheriff of Nykøbing county with the two shires of Falster and the county of Ålholm. She had specifically asked for these fiefs. She withdrew to her <b>dower</b> <b>estates</b> {{in the south of}} Denmark.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the death}} of her husband in 1771, she retired to the countryside. Mariedal and Lindholmen estates served as her <b>dower</b> <b>estates,</b> the former being her {{personal}} residence. She initially also kept control of her son's estate Stola, he being also absent from his estates like his father because of his career.|$|R
50|$|A patroness of troubadours such as Giraud de Calanson and Peire Raymond, {{the queen}} became {{involved}} in a legal dispute with her husband concerning properties which formed part of her <b>dower</b> <b>estates.</b> In 1177 she entered the county of Ribagorza and took forcible possession of various castles and fortresses which had belonged to the crown there.|$|R
5000|$|Euphemia {{was married}} in Rostock on April 10, 1336, to her distant kinsman, Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg (1318 - 2 February 1379), a North-German lord deeply {{interested}} in obtaining some power in Scandinavia, e.g. fiefs or income. Later, Albert was {{to gain the}} nickname [...] "Fox of Mecklenburg", to reflect his intrigues as well as avarice. Later the same year, the couple returned to Sweden with Rudolf of Saxony and Henry of Holstein to be present at the coronation of her brother and sister-in-law Blanche of Namur. In Germany, Euphemia's life as a Duchess consort of Mecklenburg {{does not appear to}} have affected her status in Sweden, as she was still a political factor there and her name was still placed on various documents. She was the mistress of a very expensive ducal court. In 1340-41, she convinced Magnus to grant renewed trading privileges in Norway to the Hanseatic cities of Mecklenburg, Rostock and Wismar. On 15 April 1357, she granted her inheritance after her brothers Håkan and Knut, the estates Hammar and Farthses, to Skänninge Abbey. It is not known if she was involved in the succession of her son to the throne of Sweden in 1363. She is last confirmed alive 27 October 1363, when she gave up the ownership of her <b>dower</b> <b>estate</b> Hagenow. Her death year is not known, but she is confirmed dead 16 June 1370, when her widower made a vicaria to her memory.|$|E
50|$|Francis died on 12 June 1545, leaving Christina as Regent of Lorraine and the {{guardian}} of her minor son. His will was contested by a party headed by Jean de Salm, who regarded Christina as a puppet of the emperor, and so wished to place her brother-in-law as her co-regent. Christina, being pregnant at the time, postponed the funeral, withdrew to her <b>dower</b> <b>estate,</b> and sent word to Charles V. On 6 August, after mediation from the emperor, Christina and her brother-in-law were declared co-regents during the minority, with both of their seals necessary to issue orders, but with Christina as the main regent with sole custody of the minor monarch. In October 1546, she hosted the French king at Bar, who tried to convince her to marry the Count of Aumale. However, she refused to marry again. Christina {{was present at the}} Diet of Augsburg in 1547 with her aunt Mary of Hungary and dowager princess Anne of Orange. A marriage was discussed between Christina and king Sigismund of Poland during the diet. She was also courted by Marquis Albert of Brandenburg, Lord of Culmbach and Burgrave of Nuremberg, whose infatuation with her attracted attention. She opposed the marriage of her brother-in-law Nicolas of Vaudemont and Margaret of Egmont, because she feared it would displease France. In March 1549, she made an official visit to Brussels to be present at the welcome of Prince Philip of Spain to the Netherlands. On this occasion, Philip gave her so much attention that it caused discontent, and she left for Lorraine to avoid any complications. In Lorraine, Christina was careful to maintain good relations to the Guise family, who were closely affiliated with the French court, and she had Stenay, Nancy and several other strongholds fortified against an expected French attack. In September 1550, she had Charles the Bold reburied in Lorraine. The same year, she attended the Diet of Augsburg for the second time, and was much celebrated as a hostess for the attending princes. In May 1551, she hosted her sister and brother-in-law in Lorraine.|$|E
25|$|Matilda {{had a small}} dower but it did {{incorporate}} some lordship rights. Most of her <b>dower</b> <b>estates</b> {{were granted}} from lands previously held by Edith of Wessex. Additionally, Henry made numerous grants on his wife including substantial property in London. Generosity aside, this was a political move {{in order to win}} over the unruly Londoners who were vehement supporters of the Wessex kings.|$|R
5000|$|John Mowbray's wealth was {{adversely}} affected by his service in France. The Agincourt campaign, for example, cost him £2,000 (and he paid even down {{to the cost of}} his personal privy seat). In spite of his years of fighting there, however, he had never received any lands or titles based on conquest. Equally affecting his English estates was the fact that substantial dowers were stuill in the hands of his mother and sister-in-law, Constance Holland (1387-1437) (his brother's widow, and daughter of John Holland, Duke of Exeter). On his mother's death, however, in 1425, Mowbray received her <b>dower</b> <b>estates,</b> concentrated in East Anglia, centred around Framlingham Castle, which he took over. Although he seems never to have been a particularly active councillor to the King, he nevertheless received 300 marks payment a year for the office, and, indeed, even on his death bed, he was still owed a portion of £1,300 arrears from the governement. He had, however, been the first Mowbray to gain possession of the Brotherton and Seagrave estates that had been in possession of his grandmother Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, who had died in 1399.|$|R
5000|$|Upon his 1759 {{marriage}} to Martha, George Washington became the legal {{manager of the}} Custis estate, under court oversight. At {{the time of her}} marriage, Martha's dower share included more than 80 slaves; she also would control any children they had, as they would become part of the <b>dower.</b> [...] <b>Estate</b> records indicate that Martha Washington continued to purchase supplies, manage paid staff, and make many other decisions. Although the Washingtons wielded managerial control over the whole estate, they received income only from Martha's [...] "dower" [...] third. The remainder of the income went to a trust held for Jacky Custis until Jacky reached maturity.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the order}} of King Edward III, Elizabeth's father-in-law, the Earl of Mortimer was hanged in November 1330 for having assumed royal power, along with other crimes. His estates were {{forfeited}} to the Crown, therefore Elizabeth's husband did not succeed to the earldom and died a year later. Elizabeth's <b>dower</b> included the <b>estates</b> of Maelienydd and Comot Deuddwr in the Welsh Marches.|$|R
5000|$|The grade-II-listed Field's Farmhouse (...) dates {{originally}} from 1648 and was restored in 1903. A three-bay farmhouse with timber framing and brick infilling, it features jetties and close studding with a middle rail. Higginsfield House (...) was formerly the Cholmondeley <b>Estate's</b> <b>dower</b> house; a five-bay, two-storey, white-painted brick {{house with a}} projecting porch, it dates from the early 19th century and is listed at grade II.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{cannot be}} helped," [...] she said quietly. [...] "It {{is but a}} small place. It {{was part of my}} mother's <b>dower.</b> Our <b>estates,</b> you know, are in Provence. My father thought I should be safer, here, than {{remaining}} there alone while he was away. We have always been on good terms with the townspeople here, and they did not interfere with those of our religion during the last war; so we thought that it would be the same now. But of late some people have been here, stirring up the townsmen; and some travelling friars preached in the marketplace, not long since, upbraiding the people with their slackness in not rooting us out altogether.|$|R
50|$|When Martha died on May 22, 1802, her dower share {{reverted to}} the Custis estate. Because of Martha Washington's <b>dower</b> share, the <b>estate</b> {{could not be}} {{liquidated}} for more than 45 years. Martha's dower share was eventually divided between John Parke Custis's widow, Eleanor Calvert Custis Stuart, and their four children. Martha also bequeathed Elisha, the one slave that she owned herself, to her grandson George Washington Parke Custis.|$|R
50|$|Little Cassiobury (Grade II* listed), the Cassiobury <b>Estate</b> <b>dower</b> house, {{still exists}} in Hempstead Road, Watford. It was sold {{separately}} {{from the rest of}} the estate. While it was in private ownership it was extended and renovated, in 1937, by the Portmeirion architect Clough Williams-Ellis. Soon after that it was compulsorily purchased by Hertfordshire County Council, who built Watford College (latterly West Herts College) on part of the site. Herts County Council used Little Cassiobury as an education office for most of the 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|In 1816 {{he married}} Harriet Catherine Smyth; {{they had no}} children. In her diary {{published}} by Hertfordshire Record Publications Lady Adela Caroline Harriett Capel (Daughter of Arthur Algernon later Capell, 6th Earl of Essex, and Admiral Bladen Capel's great niece) calls him [...] "uncle Bladen, and refers to times spent {{with him and his}} wife at Little Cassiobury. She lived at Cassiobury House and they lived in Little Cassiobury. Designed by Lady Elizabeth Wilbraham in the late 17th century it was built as the Cassiobury <b>Estate's</b> <b>dower</b> house, which still exists in Hempstead Road, Watford.|$|R
60|$|I {{got good}} advice at Paris from an eminent lawyer, a {{counsellor}} of the Parliament there, and laying my case before him, he directed {{me to make}} a process in <b>dower</b> upon the <b>estate,</b> for making good my new fortune upon matrimony, which accordingly I did; and, upon the whole, the manager went back to England well satisfied that he had gotten the unaccepted bill of exchange, which was for two thousand five hundred pounds, with some other things, which together amounted to seventeen thousand livres; and thus I got rid of him.|$|R
5000|$|Margaret de Quincy, 2nd Countess of Lincoln suo jure (c. 1206 - March 1266) was {{a wealthy}} English noblewoman and heiress having {{inherited}} {{in her own}} right the Earldom of Lincoln and honours of Bolingbroke from her mother Hawise of Chester, received a <b>dower</b> from the <b>estates</b> of her first husband, and acquired a dower third from the extensive earldom of Pembroke following the death of her second husband, Walter Marshal, 5th Earl of Pembroke. Her first husband was John de Lacy, 2nd Earl of Lincoln, by whom she had two children. He was created 2nd Earl of Lincoln by right of his marriage to Margaret. Margaret has been described as [...] "one of the two towering female figures of the mid-13th century".|$|R
50|$|Sir John Basset (1462-31 January 1528), KB, of Tehidy in Cornwall and Umberleigh in Devon was Sheriff of Cornwall in 1497, 1517 and 1522 and Sheriff of Devon in 1524. Although {{himself an}} {{important}} {{figure in the}} Westcountry gentry, he is chiefly remembered for his connection with the life of his second wife and widow Honor Grenville (d. 1566), who moved into the highest society when she remarried to Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle KG (d. 1542), an illegitimate son of King Edward IV, and an important figure at the court of King Henry VIII, his nephew. The survival of the Lisle Letters, a large collection of letters to Lisle and his wife Honor, makes their lives two of the best-documented of the period. Honor retained for life as her widow's <b>dower</b> several Basset <b>estates</b> including Umberleigh and Tehidy, and the Lisle Letters include {{a great deal of}} correspondence to Honor from her stewards concerning their detailed management. They also include much correspondence to her from her children by Sir John Basset.|$|R
5000|$|Ulrika Eleonora also quickly {{made herself}} popular by {{immediately}} dispatching almost her entire Danish entourage back to Denmark, stating that {{she no longer}} needed anything from Denmark and that her spouse and his ministers would provide for her. Charles XI had provided her with her own court and a large allowance from her <b>dower</b> <b>estates.</b> The Danish ambassador Jens Juel (diplomat), who {{had been sent to}} secure her personal interests, protested against her insistence to refuse anything which could be to her advantage. She did accept being given her own court, though she commented that she would have been happy to merely share the household of the King, but she herself took the initiative to give up the right to control her own economy, giving up the administration of her dower to the officials of the monarch. When Juel protested that she went much to far in her eagerness to show herself submissive, and that she was giving away her own right to independence, she answered: [...] "As I wish for nothing else than what is right and proper, the King and his officials {{would never be able to}} refuse what I ask of them without damaging their own name. Further more I hope, that this indulgence of mine would ease the further negotiations with Denmark", [...] and to this, Juel could not protest.At the royal court, Ulrika Eleonora was placed in the shadow of her mother-in-law. While distrust between Denmark and Sweden caused by the Scanian War lingered, Hedvig Eleonora and the government of Sweden were not receptive to the son's idea to marry a Danish princess. Though her marriage are described as happy, Charles XI continued to place his mother before his wife. The mother-in-law of Ulrika Eleonora never quite surrendered the position of queen to her daughter-in-law. Upon the arrival of Ulrika Eleonora in Helsingborg, her mother-in-law offered her the most prominent place in the carriage on their departure from the harbor, but Ulrika Eleonora had instead insisted upon taking the most humble place. After this, her mother-in-law continued to monopolize the foremost place in rank at all occasions, such as placing herself by the side of King Charles XI at the table and at receptions and walking by his side in procession, leaving the second best place to Ulrika Eleonora.The King himself, being accustomed always to treat his mother with obedience and respect, adjusted himself to this. [...] The King always referred to Ulrika Eleonora as [...] "My Wife" [...] and to his mother as [...] "The Queen"; he paid his respect to his mother first and to his wife secondly. [...] Mindful of this, the foreign ambassadors, always visited Hedvig Eleonora first, and then Ulrika Eleonora, when paying their respects to the royal family. This was nurtured by the circles at court who favored the alliance between Sweden and Holstein-Gottorp against Denmark, and pointed to the fact that in Denmark, the mother of Ulrika Eleonora, also placed herself before that of her daughter-in-law, and also that Hedvig Eleonora was not only Queen Dowager but also formerly regent. This created some tension between her and her mother-in-law, but there was never an open conflict. [...] However, in July 1686, Ulrika Eleonora left Stockholm when Charles XI was visiting the country, and took residence on Uppsala Castle in Uppsala with the royal children and her own court, stating that she would be there not only for the summer. The reason was in fact to have been her displeasure over the relationship between her husband and mother-in-law. [...] Meanwhile, her husband traveled around the country with his mother. In August, they visited her and unsuccessfully tried to convince her to return to Stockholm. [...] After a visit by her mother-in-law alone in September, she finally returned. Later that year, she contacted the bishop Samuel Wiraenius, and asked him to act as a mediator, and to make the king state officially what mistakes she could have made. [...] Nothing more is known about this conflict, however. Ulrika Eleonora did accept that the rank of her mother-in-law was placed before her, but stated that she disliked that this meant that also her courtiers were ranked beneath those of her mother-in-law. [...] Her private family life with her spouse and children were described as happy. Her consort was never unfaithful to her. Upon his own deathbed in 1697, he told his mother that he had not been happy since his wife died. During her lifetime, however, Ulrika Eleonora never developed good terms with her mother-in-law, whom she once referred to as [...] "The Devil of my marriage".Her frail health and her many pregnancies often prevented her from participating in representation. In 1688, she had plans to visit her family in Denmark, but her weak health forced her to abandon the idea. At the summer residence Karlberg Palace, she enjoyed a happy family life away from the court and developed an interest in painting. She was interested in theater and dance and acted as patron of the amateur theatre at court. In the winter of 1683-84, a group of female courtiers performed the Swedish premier of Iphigénie by Racine at court upon her request. In the play, Johanna Eleonora De la Gardie acted in the part of Iphigenie, Amalia Königsmarck as Achilles, Aurora Königsmarck as Clitemnestre, Augusta Wrangel as Agamemnon, and Ebba Maria De la Gardie as Eriphile. This is regarded as a significant event as the first play performed by an all female cast in Sweden, as an introduction of French Classicism in Sweden. Apparently, Ulrika Eleonora herself had wished to participate, but her pregnancy at the time had made it impossible. Her personal circle of intimate friends are counted as her personal confessor Johan Carlberg, her Mistress of the Robes countess Maria Elisabeth Stenbock, her Danish lady-in-waiting Sophia Amalia Marschalk and Anna Maria Clodt. She also enjoined the visits of her brother-in-law and sister the duke and duchess of Holstein-Gottorp.|$|R
