5|$|Early {{decompression}} theory generally {{assumed that}} inert <b>gas</b> <b>bubble</b> {{formation in the}} tissues could be avoided during decompression, and {{the aim of the}} decompression tables and algorithms was to prevent bubble formation while minimising decompression time. Most dissolved phase models are perfusion limited, and differ mainly by the number of compartments, the range of half-times, and supersaturation tolerances assumed. These models are commonly referred to as Haldanean.|$|E
5|$|According to the varying-permeability model, <b>gas</b> <b>bubble</b> nuclei {{are simply}} stable microbubbles. The {{stability}} of these microbubbles {{is due to}} elastic skins or membranes consisting of surface-active molecules. These skins are normally permeable to gas, and collapse is prevented by their compression strength. These skins can become stiff and effectively impermeable to gas when they are subjected to large compressions, typically exceeding 8atm, at which stage the pressure inside increases during further compression as predicted by Boyle's law.|$|E

25|$|Global {{shortages}} of technetium-99m {{emerged in the}} late 2000s because two aging nuclear reactors (NRU and HFR) that provided {{about two-thirds of the}} world’s supply of molybdenum-99, which itself has a half-life of only 66 hours, were shut down repeatedly for extended maintenance periods. In May 2009 the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited announced the detection of a small leak of heavy water in the NRU reactor that remained out of service until completion of the repairs in August 2010. After the observation of <b>gas</b> <b>bubble</b> jets released from one of the deformations of primary cooling water circuits in August 2008, the HFR reactor was stopped for a thorough safety investigation. NRG received in February 2009 a temporary license to operate HFR only when necessary for medical radioisotope production. HFR stopped for repairs at the beginning of 2010 and was restarted in September 2010.|$|E
25|$|Vitrectomy is an {{increasingly}} used treatment for retinal detachment. It involves {{the removal of}} the vitreous gel and is usually combined with filling the eye with either a <b>gas</b> <b>bubble</b> (SF6 or C3F8 gas) or silicone oil (PDMS). An advantage of using gas in this operation {{is that there is no}} myopic shift after the operation and gas is absorbed within a few weeks. PDMS, if used, needs to be removed after a period of 2–8 months depending on surgeon's preference. Silicone oil is more commonly used in cases associated with proliferative vitreo-retinopathy (PVR). A disadvantage is that a vitrectomy always leads to more rapid progression of a cataract in the operated eye. In many places vitrectomy is the most commonly performed operation for the treatment of retinal detachment. A recent Cochrane Review assessing various tamponade agents for patients with retinal detachment associated with PVR found that patients treated with C3F8 gas and standard silicone oil had visual and anatomic advantages over patients using SF6. Heavy silicone oil did not show any advantages over regular silicone oil.|$|E

However, it is not certain whether this is practically possible: some of the decompression models assume that stable bubble micronuclei always exist.

30|$|Peat {{is a kind}} {{of special}} {{material}} rich in organic matter. Because of the high content of organic matter, it shows different deformation behaviors from conventional geotechnical materials. Peat grain has a non-negligible compressibility due to the presence of organic matter. Biogas can generate from peat and can be trapped in form of <b>gas</b> <b>bubbles.</b> Considering the natural properties of peat, a special three-phase composition of peat is described which indicates the existence of organic matter and <b>gas</b> <b>bubbles</b> in peat. A stress–strain–time model is proposed for the compression of organic matter, and the surface tension effect is considered in the compression model of <b>gas</b> <b>bubbles.</b> Finally, a mathematical model has been developed to simulate the deformation behavior of peat considering the compressibility of organic matter and entrapped <b>gas</b> <b>bubbles.</b> The deformation process is the coupling of volume variation of organic matter, <b>gas</b> <b>bubbles</b> and water drainage. The proposed model is used to simulate a series of peat laboratory oedometer tests, and the model can well capture the test results with reasonable model parameters. Effects of model parameters on deformation of peat are also analyzed.|$|R
2500|$|This {{operation}} is generally {{performed in the}} doctor's office under local anesthesia. It is another method of repairing a retinal detachment in which a <b>gas</b> <b>bubble</b> (SF6 or C3F8 gas) is injected into the eye after which laser or freezing treatment {{is applied to the}} retinal hole. [...] The patient's head is then positioned so that the bubble rests against the retinal hole. Patients may have to keep their heads tilted for several days to keep the <b>gas</b> <b>bubble</b> in contact with the retinal hole. The surface tension of the gas/water interface seals the hole in the retina, and allows the retinal pigment epithelium to pump the subretinal space dry and [...] "suck the retina back into place". This strict positioning requirement makes the treatment of the retinal holes and detachments that occurs in {{the lower part of the}} eyeball impractical. This procedure is usually combined with cryopexy or laser photocoagulation. Pneumatic retinopexy has significantly lower success rates compared to scleral buckle surgery and vitrectomy. Some initially successful cases will fail during the weeks and months after surgery. In some of the failed cases, an area of the retina which was healthy and attached prior to the initial pneumatic retinopexy repair procedure develops new tears and/or becomes detached. A recent Cochrane Review compared outcomes [...] from patients receiving retinal reattachment from pneumatic retinopexy versus scleral buckle. Though the quality of evidence from two randomized controlled trials was low, eyes having received the pneumatic retinopexy procedure were more likely to have a recurrence of retinal detachment by follow-up, and were 11% less likely to achieve retinal reattachment, compared to scleral buckle.|$|E
2500|$|Equilibrium {{of forces}} on the surface is {{required}} for a bubble to exist. The sum of the Ambient pressure and pressure due to tissue distortion, exerted {{on the outside of}} the surface, with surface tension of the liquid at the interface between the bubble and the surroundings must be balanced by the pressure on the inside of the bubble. This is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases inside due to the net diffusion of gas to and from the bubble. The force balance on the bubble may be modified by a layer of surface active molecules which can stabilise a microbubble at a size where surface tension on a clean bubble would cause it to collapse rapidly, and this surface layer may vary in permeability, so that if the bubble is sufficiently compressed it may become impermeable to diffusion. If the solvent outside the bubble is saturated or unsaturated, the partial pressure will be less than in the bubble, and the surface tension will be increasing the internal pressure in direct proportion to surface curvature, providing a pressure gradient to increase diffusion out of the bubble, effectively [...] "squeezing the gas out of the bubble", and the smaller the bubble the faster it will get squeezed out. A <b>gas</b> <b>bubble</b> can only grow at constant pressure if the surrounding solvent is sufficiently supersaturated to overcome the surface tension or if the surface layer provides sufficient reaction to overcome surface tension. Clean bubbles that are sufficiently small will collapse due to surface tension if the supersaturation is low. Bubbles with semipermeable surfaces will either stabilise at a specific radius depending on the pressure, the composition of the surface layer, and the supersaturation, or continue to grow indefinitely, if larger than the critical radius. Bubble formation can occur in the blood or other tissues.|$|E
