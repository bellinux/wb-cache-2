40|$|This {{experimental}} study {{focuses on the}} links that exist between the mechanical pull-out behaviour of multi-filament yarns embedded in concrete and the impregnation of the yarn by the concrete. To this aim, 5 <b>glass</b> <b>yarns</b> have been embedded in concrete (AR and E <b>glass</b> <b>yarns</b> from assembled or direct roving). A pre-treatment {{was applied to the}} yarn before the casting, and was chosen in the following three: wetting, drying or pre-impregnation with a cement slurry. By this way, 15 yarn / pre-treatment combinations were obtained that generate 15 conditions of impregnation of the yarn by the cementitious matrix. In each case, the mechanical properties were determined from a classical pull-out test and the yarns impregnation properties were characterized by two dedicated tests: yarns porosity measurements and along yarn water flow measurements. By studying the relationship between the mechanical behaviour and the physical properties of the impregnated yarns, it is shown that the pre- and post-peak behaviour are mainly connected to the flow rate measured during the water flow measurements, which suggest a specific influence of the connected pores parallel to the filaments and of the penetration depth of the matrix into the yarn. The postpeak and the residual behaviour are moreover linked to the yarn pore volume associated to the disorder induced in the filaments assembly by the penetration of the matrix.

40|$|The {{presence}} of hollow glass fibers in laminates used in today's printed circuit boards, chip carrier substrates, and plastic {{ball grid arrays}} can {{have a significant impact}} on reliability. In the manufacture of laminates used for the electronic industry, glass fibers are used for reinforcement. Laminates are composed of several plies of glass fabrics encapsulated with a polymeric resin. The most common fabric fiber material used today in laminate manufacture is E-glass, a continuous filament <b>glass</b> <b>yarn</b> with a chemical composition by weight of mostly SiO 2, but also containing various amounts of CaO, Al 2 O 3 and other materials. Advantages of E-glass lie in its high tensile strength, water resistance, bond stability with resins, and relatively low cost. The dielectric constant (6. 3 at 23 oC and 1 MHz) is high, but acceptable for most low frequency applications. The manufacture of glass fiber begins with the dry mixing of silicas, limestone, clay, and boric acid in appropriate proportions. In the direct-melt process, the mixture is melted in a refractory furnace at temperatures between 2600 and 2800 oF and fed directly into bushings, which are platinum alloy plates with nozzles. Alternatively, the melt can be formed into marbles, cooled to room temperature and stored for future use. Additional information about this process is supplied by Loewenstein [1983].
