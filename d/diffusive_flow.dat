40|$|An {{enhanced}} solution {{strategy for}} the SIMPLER algorithm is presented for low pressure heat and mass transport calculations with applications in material processing. The accurate solution of highly <b>diffusive</b> <b>flows</b> requires an inflow boundary condition that preserves chemical species mass fluxes. The flux-preserving inflow boundary condition contains a scaling problem that causes the species equations to converge very slowly when using the standard SIMPLER algorithm. A gradient algorithm, coupled to a line-relaxation method, accelerates the convergence of the linear problem. Reformulation of the pressure-correction boundary conditions ensures that continuity is preserved in each finite volume at each iteration. The boundary condition scaling problem is demonstrated with a simple linear model problem. The enhanced solution strategy is implemented in a baseline computer code {{that is used to}} solve the multicomponent Navier-Stokes equations on a generalized, multiple-block grid system.

The purpose is to analyse the influence of both sampling interval delta and sampling length L, on the determination of surface roughness parameters, contact areas and viscous and <b>diffusive</b> <b>flow</b> through the aperture field resulting from the contact under load. To accomplish this analysis, fractal surfaces used in this work are obtained from numerical simulations.

40|$|Effective {{recovery}} of residual methane from coal seams after major extraction operations {{is an important}} but difficult task due to the small driving forces and low mass transfer coefficients. An obvious option to achieve nearly complete methane recovery is the depressurization technique. In this communication, we develop {{a model for the}} prediction of mass transfer dynamics between coal matrix and fractures under depressurization conditions. The fluid flow in fractures is modeled using Darcy 2 ̆ 7 s law described by partial differential equations, whereas the variations of gas and adsorbed phase concentrations within the coal matrix are represented by a lumped parameter model represented by ordinary differential equations. Key parameters are estimated using well-established methods from the general literature. The model is validated using a true tri-axial stress coal permeameter (TTSCP), which provides accurate dynamic measurements of system properties under a series of controlled pressure reductions. The model provides physical insights into the observed behavior. The relative importance of the convective and <b>diffusive</b> <b>flows</b> is quantified through numerical simulations, which is essential to the design of depressurization operations.

The method enables accurate resolution of diffusive processes within reaction zones. The approach combines time-split reactive source terms with a high-order, shock-capturing scheme specifically designed for <b>diffusive</b> <b>flows.</b> A description of the order-optimized, symmetric, finite difference, flux-based, hybrid WENO/centered-difference scheme is given, along with its implementation in a high-order SAMR framework. The implementation of new techniques for discontinuity flagging, scheme-switching, and high-order prolongation and restriction is described. In particular, the refined methodology does not require upwinded WENO at grid refinement interfaces for stability, allowing high-order prolongation and thereby eliminating {{a significant source of}} numerical diffusion within the overall code performance. A series of one-and two-dimensional test problems is used to verify the implementation, specifically the high-order accuracy of the diffusion terms. One-dimensional benchmarks include a viscous shock wave and a laminar flame. In two-space dimensions, a Lamb–Oseen vortex and an unstable diffusive detonation are considered, for which quantitative convergence is demonstrated. Further, a two-dimensional high-resolution simulation of a reactive Mach reflection phenomenon with diffusive multi-species mixing is presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Interpretation of {{data from}} a 1989 {{multichannel}} seismic (MCS) survey of the central Oregon Margin indicates that pore fluids escaping from the accretionary prism follow paths that are largely fracture controlled and fault guided. MCS evidence of this control includes reversed-polarity, fault-plane reflections, P-wave-velocity reversals, and upward deflection of gas hydrate reflections where they cross fault traces on some seismic sections. Site 891 was located on the frontal thrust of the accretionary prism. At this site the thrust dips 8 ° landward and produces a high-amplitude, reversed-polarity reflection that suggests the thrust may be a conduit for fluids from the décollement. Site 892 is situated on an out-of-sequence thrust within the prism that {{is known to be}} hydrogeologically active. The thrust dips 14 ° landward. Upward deflection of the gas hydrate reflection is present where it crosses the fault trace. In Cascadia Basin, west of the Leg 146 Oregon drill sites, velocity measurements increase within all strata in a landward direction, suggesting that <b>diffusive</b> <b>flow</b> is the dominant dewatering process.

In order to adapt existing CFD tools for the modelling of the compressible coolant flow through porous CMC micro structures, their anisotropic flow and heat transfer properties (permeability, area porosity, tortuosity, mean hydraulic pore diameter, thermal conductivity, convective heat transfer coefficient, inner pore surface) must be entered in the software.

40|$|An advection-diffusion {{model has}} been set up to {{describe}} normal grain growth. In this model grains are divided into different groups according to their topological classes (number of sides of a grain). Topological transformations are modelled by advective and <b>diffusive</b> <b>flows</b> governed by advective and diffusive coefficients respectively, which are assumed to be proportional to topological classes. The ordinary differential equations governing self-similar time-independent grain size distribution can be derived analytically from continuity equations. It is proved that the time-independent distributions obtained by solving the ordinary differential equations have the same form as the time-dependent distributions obtained by solving the continuity equations. The advection-diffusion model is extended to describe the stagnation of normal grain growth in thin films. Grain boundary grooving prevents grain boundaries from moving, and the correlation between neighbouring grains accelerates the stagnation of normal grain growth. After introducing grain boundary grooving and the correlation between neighbouring grains into the model, the grain size distribution is close to a lognormal distribution, which is usually found in experiments. A vertex computer simulation of normal grain growth has also been carried out to make a cross comparison with the advection-diffusion model. The result from the simulation did not verify the assumption that the advective and diffusive coefficients are proportional to topological classes. Instead, we have observed that topological transformations usually occur on certain topological classes. This suggests that the advection-diffusion model can be improved by making a more realistic assumption on topological transformations.
