5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling {{was essential to}} the process of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct <b>heat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that would make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the flavor and the heating time of rice (Koshihikari and Reimei) was examined by sensory evaluation. The rice was <b>heated</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oil bath as reported previously. Volatile components in the head space vapor (HSV) of cooked rice were investigated by GLC. Further, valatile carbonyl compounds from unheated and heated rice were converted into 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives, which were determined by TLC, UV spectrophotometry and GLC. The {{relationship between}} these analyses and sensory evaluation was discussed. The following results were obtained: after heating the rice for 20 min, volatile components in the HSV ware the largest in quantity, but the flavor of rice heated for 30 min was the most desirable in the sensory test. The results of GLC in the HSV indecated the existence of paraffins (C_),n-aldehydes (C_),branched aldehydes (C_), n-alcohols (C_), acetone, ethanethiol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanethiol and dimethyl sulfide. The volatile carbonyl cfompounds of the rice were identified as follows: n-aldehydes(C_),branched aldehydes (C_), 2 -ketones(C_), furfural and benzaldehyde. The quantity of volatile carbonyl compounds of the rice <b>heated</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> closed container was about {{twice as much as}} the unheated rice and 42. 9 % of that the rice <b>heated</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open container moved into distillate. In the sensory test, the flavor of rice <b>heated</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open container was significantly more desirable than that of rice <b>heated</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> closed container, because the undesirable volatile components, such as pentanal and hexanal, decreased durning cooking <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open container...|$|R

5|$|In 1986, J.Scott Turner and C.Richard Tracy {{proposed}} that {{the evolution of a}} sail in Dimetrodon was related to the evolution of warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors. They thought that the sail of Dimetrodon enabled it to be homeothermic, maintaining a constant, albeit low, body temperature. Mammals are also homeothermic, although they differ from Dimetrodon in being endothermic, controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism. Turner and Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release <b>heat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manner {{similar to that of the}} sail of Dimetrodon. The homeothermy that developed in animals like Dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape, which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.|$|E

He improved his time by 0.1s in the final to finish sixth in 2min 0.9s. Wenden won both events. After the 200m final, Wenden lost consciousness due to exhaustion and sank underwater.

The fastest Australian in the corresponding individual event, he was rested in the qualifying round; Australia came third in their heat and ninth overall to miss the final by 1.88s after Peter Dawson swam his split in a time four seconds slower than Kerry's effort in the individual event. Had Kerry repeated his individual time in the relay in place of Dawson, Australia would have qualified fifth.|$|E

After graduating, he was selected by his home team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. James led Cleveland to the franchise's first Finals appearance in 2007, ultimately losing to the San Antonio Spurs. In 2010, he left the Cavaliers for the Miami <b>Heat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> highly publicized ESPN special titled The Decision. James spent four seasons with the Heat, reaching the Finals all four years and winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. In 2013, he led Miami on a 27-game winning streak, the third longest in league history. Following his final season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. From 2015 to 2017, he led the Cavaliers to three consecutive Finals, winning his third championship in 2016 to end Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought.|$|E

Windle's first event was the 4×100m freestyle relay, where he combined with Dickson, Peter Doak, and John Ryan to win Australia's <b>heat</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time of 3min 40.6s, which lagged behind the United States' winning heat time by 1.8s.

However, the United States improved their time by a further 5.6s in the final, but Australia could only improve their time to 3min 39.1s, leaving them third behind the Americans and Germans. Australia were in second place {{for the first two}} legs, until Germany moved into the silver medal position at the last change by 0.1s.
