The Journey Continues, {{a sequel to}} Solo Journey, features Joseph on solo piano. [...] Debbage writes, [...] "The magical world of movies <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> exploring sequels. There is the beauty and beast effect when taking this pathway. The creative beauty allows the viewers to see the continued growth of its characters. The beastly aspect of this exploration is the Hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns. Bradley Joseph has decided to walk this tightrope by following up with Solo Journey that was released back in 2000. I am glad to report that The Journey Continues is entrenched in beauty, holding up well to its predecessor." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, a Daytime Emmy Awards [...] "final push" [...] by Canyon News {{suggested}} that Case's performance needed more Emmy attention. Soap Opera Digest praised Phyllis finding {{the evidence that}} freed Sharon from prison in 2011, writing: [...] "The twist that Phyl hijacked the glory from both Adam and estranged sister Avery was downright delicious—and made Sharon beholden her worst enemy. The cherry on top? Sharon giving Adam an overdue verbal beatdown. Justice has finally been served." [...] Case's performance in 2012, described as a [...] "whirlwind year", was met with critical acclaim due to writing by Bell (which, in turn, was criticized). On-Air On-Soaps commented, [...] "Surviving {{probably one of the}} worst on-screen character assassinations in soap opera history, which virtually left viewers wondering, what the heck are the writers doing to the integrity of Sharon Newman, the once befallen heroine of Genoa City?, Case rebounded by making her performances noteworthy, no matter what the creative teams decided to do to her character." [...] This led Soap Opera Uncensored to name her Entertainer of the Year in January 2013. In December 2015, Soap Opera Digest praised her portrayal of the character's [...] "emotional roller coaster" [...] and remarked, [...] "Sharon Case <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> bringing emotional depth and reality to even the most outrageously soapy situations".|$|E
2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Like Gaston pointed out, Belle <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> finding monsters.

2500|$|GameSpy's Sterling McGarvey {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 2.5 out of 5, writing Luxoflux have [...] "turned a {{slightly}} above-par GTA clone into a sub-par franchise." [...] He {{was critical of}} the recreation of New York; [...] "textures look rather drab and plain, and the draw distance looks blurry and uninteresting [...] it really feels as though the development team failed to capture one of New York's most distinctive traits: the raw humanity of it all." [...] Of the graphics, he wrote, [...] "the frame rate <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>knack</b> <b>for</b> chugging. Considering it's a console and not a five year-old PC running this game, it's unacceptable. Out of nowhere, the frame rate will completely bottom out while Marcus patrols the streets."

2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper was {{impressed}} with New York City, praising [...] "how well your general duties as a cop are tied into the game, working very well alongside your own personal investigations," [...] and finding the gameplay and game mechanics superior to Streets of LA. Eurogamer's Jim Rossignol was critical of the AI; [...] "the perps you take down never suggest that they are anything other than mindless automata ready to be slain, and exhibit an artificiality that could never be described as 'intelligence'."

[...] the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too." [...] He concluded [...] "the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like before it goes through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try." ...|$|E
