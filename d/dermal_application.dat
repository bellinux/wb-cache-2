Some medications {{seem to be}} more effective (or are more efficient) using the dermal route of administration. Some ingested drugs are heavily metabolized by the liver and may be inactivated, but using a <b>dermal</b> <b>application</b> bypasses this metabolism step allowing more parent compound to enter the peripheral circulation. If a drug is absorbed well through the skin it may be used as a means of systemic medication. Dermal dosage forms include: liniments, braces, lotions, ointments, creams, dusting powders, aerosols, and transdermal patches. [...] Specially designed patches are currently used to deliver fentanyl, nicotine and other compounds. Slower skin absorption versus oral or injectable may allow patches to provide medication for 1 to 7 days.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the analysis of phospholipids in the tear film and with the synthesis of phospholipids analogous to hydrogels. The work consists of two areas. The first area is the study of the phospholipids in the tear film, their nature and fate. The use of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry determined that the concentration of phospholipids in the tear film was less than previously thought. The analysis of the tear film phospholipids continued with thin layer chromatography. This showed the presence of diacylglycerides (DAGs) in the tear film at relatively high concentrations. The activity of an enzyme, phospholipase C, was found in the tear film. It was hypothesised that the low concentration of phospholipids and high concentrations of DAG in the tear film was due to the action of this enzyme. The second area of study was the synthesis of phospholipids analogous materials for use in ocular and <b>dermal</b> <b>applications</b> for use in ocular and <b>dermal</b> <b>applications.</b> For ocular applications the synthesis involved the use of the monomer N,N-dimethyl-N-(2 -acryloylethyl) -N-(3 -sulfopropyl) ammonium betaine (SPDA) in combination with 2 -hdyroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). Charge-balanced membranes were also synthesised using potentially anionic monomers in conjunction with cationic monomers in stoichiometrically equivalent ratios also with HEMA as a commoner. Membranes of SPDA copolymers and charge-balanced copolymers proved to have some properties suitable for ocular <b>applications.</b> The <b>dermal</b> materials consisted of one family of partially hydrated hydrogels synthesised from SPDA in combination with ionic monomers: sodium 2 -(acrylamido) - 2 -methyl propane sulfonate and acrylic acid-bis(3 -sulfopropyl) -ester, potassium salt.

Resveratrol (RSV) is a potent antioxidant. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) can ensure close contact and {{increase the amount of}} drug absorbed into the skin. In this study, RSV was loaded into SLN and NLC for <b>dermal</b> <b>applications.</b> Methods: Nanoparticles were prepared by high shear homogenization using Compritol 888 ATO, Myglyol, Poloxamer 188, and Tween 80. Particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PI), zeta potential (ZP), drug entrapment efficiency (EE), and production yield were determined. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis and morphological transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination were conducted. RSV concentration was optimized with cytotoxicity studies, and net intracellular accumulation of ROS was monitored with cytofluorimetry. The amount of RSV was determined from different layers of rat abdominal skin. Results: PS of uniform RSV-SLN and RSV-NLC were determined as 287. 2 nm &plusmn; 5. 1 and 110. 5 nm &plusmn; 1. 3, respectively. ZP was &ndash; 15. 3 mV &plusmn; 0. 4 and &ndash; 13. 8 mV &plusmn; 0. 1 in the same order. The drug EE was 18 % higher in NLC systems. TEM studies showed that the drug in the shell model was relevant for SLN, and that the melting point of the lipid in NLC was slightly lower. Concentrations below 50 &micro;M were determined as suitable RSV concentrations for both SLN and NLC in cell culture studies. RSV-NLC showed less fluorescence, indicating less ROS production in cytofluorometric studies. Ex vivo skin studies revealed that NLC are more efficient in carrying RSV to the epidermis. Conclusion: This study suggests that both of the lipid nanoparticles had antioxidant properties at a concentration of 50 &micro;M.

40|$|Aim: In recent years, it {{has been}} shown that whey and its {{components}} have a number of health-promoting effects. We aimed to isolate fractions containing whey proteins using chromatography and then to prepare antioxidant liposomes in order to obtain a gel suitable for cosmetic preparations. Methods: Fractionation of whey proteins was achieved by extraction, filtration and centrifugation followed by liquid chromatography. The antioxidant activities of the fractions was determined by their copper ion reducing capacity. Gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the proteins. Liposomes were made by the thin film hydration method. Results and Conclusion: Using Sephadex G- 50 chromatography, two fractions were obtained. The first fraction contained major whey proteins, while the second fraction had small peptides. We have then determined the antioxidant activities of these fractions. The first fraction had the highest antioxidant activity. We prepared liposomes containing whey protein fractions and analyzed their sizes.

50|$|This {{group of}} {{structurally}} related mycotoxins {{has a strong}} impact {{on the health of}} animals and humans. Trichothecenes are powerful inhibitors of protein synthesis. They do this by reacting with components of the ribosomes: the structure within the cell where proteins are made. The specific site of action of T-2 toxin, which is a reaction with a critical site on the ribosomal RNA (rRNA), is known. Protein synthesis is an essential function in all tissues, but tissues where cells are actively and rapidly growing and dividing are very susceptible to the toxins.Trichothecenes are different from most other potential weapons toxins because they can act through the skin. Compared with some of the other mycotoxins such as aflatoxin, the trichothecenes do not appear to require metabolic activation to exert their biological activity. After direct <b>dermal</b> <b>application</b> or oral ingestion, the trichothecene mycotoxins can cause rapid irritation to the skin or intestinal mucosa. In cell-free systems or single cells in culture, these mycotoxins cause a rapid inhibition of protein synthesis and polyribosomal disaggregation. Thus, we can postulate that the trichothecene mycotoxins have molecular capability of direct reaction with cellular components. Despite this direct effect, it is possible to measure the toxicokinetics and the metabolism of the trichothecene mycotoxins.|$|E

The {{chemicals}} undertest are usually administered {{in the food}} and in the drinking water, but sometimes by <b>dermal</b> <b>application,</b> by gavage, or by inhalation, and carried out over the {{major part of the}} life span for rodents. In tests that check for carcinogens, maximum tolerated dosage is first determined, then a range of doses are given to around 50 animals throughout the notional lifespan of the animal of two years. After death the animals are examined for sign of tumours. Differences in metabolism between rat and human however means that human may not respond {{in exactly the same way}} to mutagen, and dosages that produce tumours on the animal test may also be unreasonably high for a human, i.e. the equivalent amount required to produce tumours in human may far exceed what a person might encounter in real life. Mice with recessive mutations for a visible phenotype may also be used to check for mutagens. Females with recessive mutation crossed with wild-type males would yield the same phenotype as the wild-type, and any observable change to the phenotype would indicate that a mutation induced by the mutagen has occurred. Mice may also be used for dominant lethal assays where early embryonic deaths are monitored. Male mice are treated with chemicals under test, mated with females, and the females are then sacrificed before parturition and early fetal deaths are counted in the uterine horns. Transgenic Mouse Assay using a mouse strain infected with a viral shuttle vector is another method for testing mutagens. Animals are first treated with suspected mutagen, the mouse DNA is then isolated and the phage segment recovered and used to infect E. coli. Using similar method as the blue-white screen, the plaque formed with DNA containing mutation are white, while those without are blue.|$|E

METHODS: The fur of BALB/c mice in the area around the ears was cut with scissors 1 day prior to topical exposure to ENPs (0. 4, 4 or 40 mg mL(- 1)), paint particles containing ENPs (4 mg mL(- 1)) or vehicle (day 0).

However, it elevates serum IgE levels and Thelper 2 cytokines at relatively low doses in test animals, suggesting that it has also respiratory allergenic potential. The lack of human data on respiratory allergenic potential of OXA may be due to lack of significant inhalation exposure. Here, female Brown Norway rats (BN) were sensitized by two or five <b>dermal</b> <b>applications</b> of OXA at the same total dose of 3. 75 mg. Controls received vehicle. All animals were challenged by inhalation to 45 mg/m 3 OXA on day 21 and necropsy was performed on day 22. All sensitized animals had increased serum IgE. OXA challenge decreased breathing frequency, and induced apnoeic breathing in the sensitized animals - a hallmark of respiratory allergy in our model. An exudative, granulocytic inflammation was observed primarily in the larynx of the sensitized and challenged rats. Microarray analysis of lung tissue, sampled 24 h after challenge, revealed upregulation of several genes and activation of Gene Ontology (GO) pathways, which resembled more closely those found previously in lung tissue of rats sensitized and challenged by the respiratory allergen trimellitic anhydride than by the contact allergen dinitrochlorobenzene.

40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} to microorganisms {{is one of}} the major problems faced in the field of wound care in burns patients. Silver nanoparticles have come up as potent antimicrobial agent and are being evaluated in diverse medical applications ranging from silver based dressings to silver coated medical devices. We aimed in present study to test the release of nanosilver from nanosilver wound dressing and compare the dermal and systemic toxicity of nanosilver dressings in a repeated dose (21 days) model. Under general anesthesia, a limited standard 2 nd degree burns were provided on the back of each rat in all treatment, negative control (simple dressing) and 5 % silver nitrate groups, each contained 5 male wistar rats. According to the analysis made by atomic absorption spectrometry, the wound dressings released 0. 599 ± 0. 083 ppm of nanosilver during first 24 hrs of study. Daily observations were recoded and wounds were covered with new dressings each 24 hrs. Burn healing was observed in nanosilver wound dressing group in shorter time periods than the control groups. In toxicity assessment, this dressing didn't cause any hematological and histopathological abnormalities in treatment group but biochemical studies showed significant rise of plasma transaminase (ALT) at the endpoint (21 days) of the study (P= 0. 027). Portal mononuclear lymphoid and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltrations in three to four adjacent foci were recognized around the central hepatic vein in treatment group. Mild hepatotoxic effects of nanosilver wound dressing in wistar rat emphasize the necessity of more studies on toxicity potentials of low dose nanosilver by <b>dermal</b> <b>applications...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Years after {{removal from}} exposure, workers with {{occupational}} asthma still show respiratory symptoms and airway hyperresponsiveness on re-exposure to the offending agent. OBJECTIVE: We investigated {{the persistence of}} the respiratory responsiveness to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in a mouse model. METHODS: BALB/C mice received <b>dermal</b> <b>applications</b> of TDI on days 1 and 8, and a single intranasal instillation of TDI on day 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 90. After instillation, early (1 hour) changes in ventilatory function and methacholine responsiveness (22 hours) were assessed. Cell counts and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage. Total serum IgE, IgG(1), and IgG(2 a) were quantified. Lymphocyte subpopulations were assessed in auricular and cervical lymph nodes, and release of IL- 4 and IFN-gamma by these lymph node cells was measured. RESULTS: Toluene diisocyanate-treated mice showed immediate ventilatory changes, increased methacholine reactivity, and an influx of neutrophils and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 in bronchoalveolar lavage as long as 50 days after initial treatment. These mice also showed a relative increase in CD 19 (+) cells and a decrease in CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) cells in auricular lymph nodes. Increased release of IL- 4 and IFN-gamma in auricular lymph node cells was observed only until 20 days after sensitization. Total serum IgE, IgG(1), and IgG(2 a) remained significantly elevated in TDI-sensitized mice until 90 days after dermal sensitization. CONCLUSION: Ventilatory and lung inflammatory responses decrease with increasing delay between sensitization and challenge, despite persistent humoral signs of sensitization. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study confirms the dissociation between humoral evidence of allergy to TDI and respiratory responsiveness to TDI. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Diisocyanates are an {{important}} cause of chemical-induced occupational asthma. This type of immunologically mediated asthma is often characterized by a predominant granulocytic inflammation in the airways, rather than an infiltration by lymphocytes. We sought to determine the contribution of granulocytes {{in the outcome of}} chemical-induced asthma using general and specific leukocyte depletion strategies in an established mouse model of isocyanate asthma. On days 1 and 8, BALB/c mice received <b>dermal</b> <b>applications</b> with toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate (TDI) or vehicle (acetone olive oil), followed by two ip injections of cyclophosphamide (CP, days 11 and 13), or one iv injection of antigranulocyte receptor 1 (aGR 1, day 13) monoclonal antibody (mAb), or two ip injections of Ly 6 G-specific mAb (1 A 8, days 13 and 14). On day 15, the mice were challenged (oropharyngeal administration) with TDI or vehicle. The next day, we assessed methacholine airway hyperreactivity (AHR); bronchoalveolar lavage differential cell count; histopathology and total serum IgE; and auricular lymphocyte subpopulations and release of interleukin (IL) - 2, IL- 4, IL- 10, IL- 13, and gamma interferon by these lymphocytes. CP depleted all leukocyte types and completely prevented AHR and airway inflammation. aGR 1 depleted granulocytes and CD 8 (+) lymphocytes, which resulted in a partial prevention in AHR but no decrease in airway inflammation. Depletion of Ly 6 G-positive granulocytes, i. e., both neutrophils and eosinophils, prevented AHR and lung epithelial damage and significantly reduced airway inflammation. Injection of aGR 1 or 1 A 8 led to significantly changed cytokine release patterns in TDI-treated mice. Granulocytes, both neutrophils and eosinophils, are key cellular players in this model of chemical-induced asthma. status: publishe...|$|R
