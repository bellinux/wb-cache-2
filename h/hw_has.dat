Fluorescence anisotropy and time-resolved fluorescence decay measurements of the interaction between anti-oncomodulin antibodies and the 5 HW-incorporated oncomodulin conveniently provide evidence of complex formation and epitope identification that could not be obtained with the natural amino acid.

Mast cell-like RBL- 2 H 3 cells were treated with quince HW and late-phase reaction was then induced by stimulation with IgE + Antigen. Quince HW reduced the elevation of interleukin- 13 and tumor necrosis factor-α expression level. Furthermore, quince HW suppressed these cytokine expressions of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs), a normal mast cell model. Leukotriene C 4 and prostaglandin D 2 production in BMMCs after 1 and 6  h of stimulation, respectively, were also reduced by treating the cells with quince HW. We found that the induction of intracellular cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 expression but not COX- 1 expression in BMMCs was reduced by quince HW.

Two trapped exons, from pools of chromosome 21 -specific cosmids, showed homology to the Drosophila white (w) gene. We subsequently cloned the corresponding cDNA for a human homologue of the Drosophila w gene (hW) from human retina and fetal brain cDNA libraries. The gene belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene family and is homologous to Drosophila w (and to w genes from other species) {{and to a lesser extent}} to Drosophila brown (bw) and scarlet (st) genes that are all involved in the transport of eye pigment precursor molecules.

40|$|A {{water-soluble}} cubic coordination cage (<b>Hw)</b> <b>has</b> been prepared, {{which is}} isostructural with a previously reported organic-soluble cage (H) {{apart from the}} hydroxy groups on the external surface which render it water-soluble. These two cages act as hosts for small organic molecules which bind via a combination of (i) hydrogen-bonding interactions with specific sites on the internal surface of the cages; (ii) non-polar interactions such as aromatic and van der Waals interactions between aromatic rings in the guest and the cage internal surface; and (iii) solvophobic interactions. By comparing ΔG° values for guest binding in water (using Hw) and MeCN (using H), and using pairs of related guests that differ in {{the presence or absence}} of an aromatic ring substituent, it is possible to construct thermodynamic cycles that allow quantification of the solvophobic contribution to binding. Specifically, this is the difference between the solvophobic contributions to ΔG° in water and MeCN associated with desolvation of both guest and the internal surface of the cage when complexation occurs. A highly consistent value of ca. − 10 kJ mol− 1 is determined for this solvophobic contribution to ΔG° associated with the aromatic ring in water compared to MeCN, which correlates very well with what would be expected based on the free energy changes associated with transfer of toluene from MeCN to water. Thus, all three contributions to guest binding listed above can be separately quantified. The ability to prepare related pairs of guests with {{the presence or absence of}} a wide range of substituents provides a potentially general way to quantify the solvophobic contributions to guest binding of these substituents...|$|E
40|$|Background: The heart size has {{traditionally}} been assessed using absolute reference weights. But the heart weight (<b>HW)</b> <b>has</b> been shown to depend on one’s body size hence a better measure is {{the ratio of the}} HW to the body weight (BW) – the HW-BW coefficient. Initially noted to be 0. 43 % and 0. 40 % in males and females respectively, recent studies have shown an increase of up to 0. 51 %. Objective: To determine the HW-BW coefficient in Kenyans aged 14 years and above. Methods: One hundred and four deceased Kenyans aged 14 years and above, with no heart or chronic lung disease, were recruited into the prospective cross-sectional study. Their ages, body lengths (BLs), BW and HW were recorded. Their body mass indices (BMI) and body surface areas (BSA) were also calculated. Results: There were 88 males and 16 females, all of African descent. Males had larger HW. The HW-BW ratio was 0. 48 % and 0. 42 % in males and females respectively. The difference in the value between the sexes was statistically significant. Among the males, there was a significant positive correlation between HW and all body indices as well as with age. Among the females, there was a significant positive correlation between HW and BSA and between HW and age. Recently generated HW-vs-BW and HW-vs-BSA charts from the UK were found unsuitable for the Kenyan context.

Its light curve exhibits a slower decline rate than normal SNeIbc, with a peak absolute magnitude of - 19. 5 (unfiltered) and a secondary peak of - 18. 3 mag (R). Spectra of SN 2011 hw are unusual compared to normal SN types, most closely resembling the spectra of SNeIbn. We center our analysis on comparing SN 2011 hw to the well-studied TypeIbn SN 2006 jc. While the two SNe have many important similarities, {{the differences are}} quite telling: compared to SN 2006 jc, SN 2011 <b>hw</b> <b>has</b> weaker HeI and CaII lines and relatively stronger H lines, its light curve has a higher luminosity and slower decline rate, and emission lines associated with the progenitor's CSM are narrower. One can reproduce the unusual continuum shape of SN 2011 hw with equal contributions of a 6000 K blackbody and a spectrum of SN 2006 jc. We attribute this emission component and many other {{differences between the two}} SNe to extra opacity from a small amount of additional H in SN 2011 hw, analogous to the small H mass that makes SNeIIb differ from SNeIb. Slower speeds in the CSM and elevated H content suggest a connection between the progenitor of SN 2011 hw and the class of Ofpe/WN 9 stars, which have been associated with LBVs in their hot quiescent phases between outbursts, and are H-poor - but not H-free like classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars.

40|$|Background: Guinea-Bissau {{is one of}} {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s poorest and least {{developed}} countries. Amid poverty, political turmoil and state withdrawal, its health workforce (<b>HW)</b> <b>has</b> been swamped for the last four decades in a deepening crisis of under-resourcing, poor performance and laissez-faire. Methods: The present study aimed at analysing the human resources for health (HRH) situation in Guinea-Bissau in light of the recent literature on distressed health systems, with the objective of contributing to understanding the ways health workers react to protracted turmoil, the resulting distortions and the counter-measures that might be considered. Through document analysis, focus group discussions, 14 semi-structured and 5 in-depth interviews, we explored patterns as they became visible on the ground. Results: Since independence, Guinea-Bissau experienced political events that have reflected on the healthcare arena and on the evolution of its health workforce, such as different coup attempts, waves of diaspora and shifting external assistance. The chronic scarcity of funds and a 2 ̆ 7 stable political instability 2 ̆ 7 have lead to the commercialisation of public health services and to flawed mechanisms for training and deploying health personnel. In absence of any form of governance, health workers have come to own and run the health system. We show that the HRH crisis in Guinea-Bissau can only be understood by looking at its historical evolution and at the wider socio-economic context. There are no quick fixes for the deterioration of HRH in undergoverned states; however, the recognition of the ingrained distortions and an understanding of the forces determining the behaviour of key actors are essential premises for the identification of solutions. Conclusions: Guinea-Bissau 2 ̆ 7 s case study suggests that any policy that does not factor in the limited clout of health authorities over a effectively privatised healthcare arena is doomed from the start. Improving health system governance and quality of training should take precedence over expanding HRH. A bloated and ineffective workforce must be managed through incentives rather than administrative orders, in order to improve skills and productivity against higher remuneration and better working conditions.

40|$|Sir, An {{abnormal}} peak {{of mortality}} attributed to an unusually persisting heat wave (<b>HW)</b> <b>has</b> been recorded throughout Italy by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) {{during the summer}} of 2015. During this time frame a group of patients with an initial diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock-related multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) were admitted to our ICU and treated accordingly; however, the subsequent clinical course indicated the MODS could have been ascribed more appropriately to a classic heat stroke (cHS). Regardless of the cause(s), any sustained increase of the body tempera-ture (BT) not matched by a concomitant heat loss can {{set the stage for the}} occurrence of cHS; the responsible mechanisms of both sepsis and cHS are similar and include the production and release of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines in association with the activation of leuko-cytes and of the coagulative cascade. Despite these similitudes, the distinction between sepsis and cHS is of paramount importance as the therapeutic approaches of these conditionsdiffer substantially: whereas the prompt administration of broad-spectrum and not the abatement of fever is the cornerstone of the treatment of sepsis, in patients with cHS the rapid cooling of patients represents the main therapeutic goal. Overall, eight patients (4 M and 4 F, age 76 years, IQR 49 – 81 years) were diagnosed suffering from cHS in the considered period (Table 1). According to the information obtained from the next of kins, no patient had access to air conditioning in their homes. The diagnosis of cHS was established according to the criteria proposed by Bouchama et al., which include the alteration of mental status, the BT ≥ 40 °C and the presence of hot and dry skin. The neurologic impairment was evaluated with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) both at hospital and at ICU admission and the severity of clinical conditions at ICU admission was measured with the SAPS II score; the individual burden of the concomitant chronic condition(s) and of the underlying frailties were evaluated with the Charlson's index and the CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale, respectively; this latter can be considered as an expression of theoverall functional reserve, and ranges from 1 (very fit) to 9 (approaching to the end of life which is expected within 6 months), with the intermediate scores indicating a progressive limitation of the everyday activities...|$|E

Mann-Whitney U-test and Pearson’s correlation coefficient were used to calculate differences between groups and correlations. Results: The proportion of women being exposed to male violence during life for the studied group was 91 % (72 of 79 women; WwH 29; HW 43). It was found that the WwH had physical health problems but compared to the HW, significantly less frequent. Regarding psychological health problems, both groups were suffering from self-reported problems, most notably in variables measuring stress susceptibility and embitterment, where both WwH and <b>HW</b> <b>had</b> scores markedly above norm mean scores. The <b>HW</b> <b>had</b> overall a poorer mental health profile as compared to the WwH. The WwH still maintained a foundation in the society compared to the HW regarding housing (100 / 0 %), and custody over their children (91 / 0 %). Conclusion: The study indicated that women with substance dependence and those who are victims of male violence have major problems with both their psychological and physical health. Particularly vulnerable are the HW. Past experiences of violence that have not been processed can further aggravate the women’s health. Thus, we suggest initiating the process of asking women if they have experienced violence in order to then be able to provide appropriate treatment interventions.

40|$|Introduction. The {{assessment}} of body composition, specifically percent body fat (PBF), {{is important in}} the establishment of normal weight, excessive weight, and obesity. Excessive body weight and obesity are risk factors for many chronic conditions that currently afflict most adults in the U. S. and most developed countries throughout the world. Several methods are used to determine body composition and PBF. Hydrostatic weighing (<b>HW)</b> <b>has</b> been the “gold standard” to determine PBF in exercise physiology laboratories the last few decades. A relatively new technique to assess PBF is the air-displacement plethysmography (ADP) technique, commonly determined through the use of the Bod Pod unit. While the validity of the Bod Pod has been reported in the literature, the results are conflicting. Preliminary data collected on the campus of Boise State University seemed to question the validity of the ADP technique in the {{assessment of}} PBF. Purpose. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if there is a significant difference between PBF as determined through ADP and HW. Research Design. Eighty (n = 80) healthy male- and female-Caucasian subjects between the ages of 18 and 40 years were tested in the Human Performance Laboratory for PBF according to ADP and HW. The subjects were divided according to gender and body mass index (BMI) into six groups: normal weight (NW), overweight (OW), and obese (OB) groups. Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation was used to determine the relationship between ADP and HW and Repeated Measures ANOVA was used to determine whether there were statistically {{significant differences between the two}} estimates of PBF. Results. PBF results for NW, OW, and OB men respectively according to ADP and HW were: 16. 3 vs. 11. 4, 21. 7 vs. 17. 7, and 34. 2 vs. 30. 7. For NW, OW, and OB women the respective results according to ADP and HW were: 26. 9 vs. 20. 5, 33. 2 vs. 30. 4, and 37. 4 vs. 34. 2. Strong positive correlations were found between ADP and HW for all groups in the assessment of PBF (r =. 829 to. 990). Significant differences (p 3 ̆c. 05), however, were found between ADP and HW in every group except in the obese women group. The latter result may be due to the low number of subjects in this group (n = 3). Conclusion. Based on these results, the ADP technology is not an accurate technique to assess PBF, specially in research conditions. Further technical work needs to be conducted to make ADP an acceptable technique for body composition assessment...|$|E

40|$|Background: Dedicated and {{motivated}} health workers (HWs) {{play a major}} role in delivering efficient and effective health services that improve patients’ experience of health care. Growing interest in <b>HW</b> motivation <b>has</b> led to a global focus on pay for performance strategies, but less attention has been paid to nurturing intrinsic motivation. Workplace trust relationships involve fair treatment and respectful interactions between individuals. Such relationships enable cooperation among HWs and their colleagues, supervisors, managers and patients and may act as a source of intrinsic motivation. This paper presents findings from a qualitative systematic review of empirical studies providing evidence on HW motivation, to consider what these studies suggest about the possible influence of workplace trust relationships over motivation. Methods: Five electronic databases were searched for articles reporting research findings about HW motivation for various cadres published in the 10 -year period 2003 to 2013 and with available full free text in the English language. Data extraction involved consideration of the links between trust relationships and motivation, by identifying how studies directly or indirectly mention and discuss relevant factors. Results: Twenty-three articles from low- and middle-income countries and eight from high-income countries that met predetermined quality and inclusion criteria were appraised and subjected to thematic synthesis. Workplace trust relationships with colleagues, supervisors and managers, employing organisation and patients directly and indirectly influence HW motivation. Motivational factors identified as linked to trust include respect; recognition, appreciation and rewards; supervision; teamwork; management support; autonomy; communication, feedback and openness; and staff shortages and resource inadequacy. Conclusion: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic review on trust and motivation in the health sector. Evidence indicates that workplace trust relationships encourage social interactions and cooperation among <b>HWs,</b> <b>have</b> impact on the intrinsic motivation of <b>HWs</b> and <b>have</b> consequences for retention, performance and quality of care. Human resource management and organisational practices are critical in sustaining workplace trust and HW motivation. Research and assessment of the levels of motivation and factors that encourage workplace trust relationships should include how trust and motivation interact and operate for retention, performance and quality of care...|$|R

30|$|Less {{polar solvent}} HX and DM, which should reach only the lumen, removed small and {{comparable}} amounts (1.6 and 1.7 %) when used independently on powder. Their yields were much smaller in solid wood. When DM was used after HX, its yield was very low, suggesting that HX had already removed most of extractives accessible to apolar solvents. Similarly, AC had a smaller yield when used after HX and DM, suggesting that when used independently, it also removed compounds from lumens. Although AC and ME {{are thought to}} be able to solubilize similar types of compounds, ME caused the most exhaustive extraction from solid wood: 6.2 % when used independently. Its efficiency was even increased when used after AC (7.14 % from solid wood). On the contrary, in powder, <b>HW</b> <b>had</b> the highest yield (8.31 %) when used independently, while it had a much smaller yield on solid. This suggests that in solid wood, polar extractives are more easily removed by ME than by HW, as the final cumulated yields were, however, similar between powder and solid.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundAngola's malaria case-management policy {{recommends}} {{treatment with}} artemether-lumefantrine (AL). In 2006, AL implementation began in Huambo Province, which involved training health workers (HWs), supervision, delivering AL to health facilities, and improving malaria testing with microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Implementation was complicated by {{a policy that}} was sometimes ambiguous. MethodsFourteen months after implementation began, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 33 outpatient facilities in Huambo Province to assess their readiness to manage malaria {{and the quality of}} malaria case-management for patients of all ages. Consultations were observed, patients were interviewed and re-examined, and HWs were interviewed. ResultsNinety-three HWs and 177 consultations were evaluated, although many sampled consultations were missed. All facilities had AL in-stock and at least one HW trained to use AL and RDTs. However, anti-malarial stock-outs in the previous three months were common, clinical supervision was infrequent, and <b>HWs</b> <b>had</b> important knowledge gaps. Except for fever history, clinical assessments were often incomplete. Although testing was recommended for all patients with suspected malaria, only 30. 7...|$|R
40|$|In late November 1991, 1883 {{clinics in}} Canada were sent a {{questionnaire}} {{to assess the}} status of Dirofilaria immitis in dogs in 1991 {{and there was a}} 60. 0 % response. There were 344, 031 dogs tested for heart-worm (HW), 627 were found infected and the prevalence of HW infection was 0. 18 %. There were 417 dogs with HW in Ontario, 116 in Manitoba, 38 in Quebec, 53 in British Columbia, three in Alberta, and one in Nova Scotia. In British Columbia, all of the infected dogs but one were from the Okanagan valley which, as from 1991, is a new focus of infection in Canada. Most dogs with <b>HW</b> <b>had</b> not been on preventive medication in 1990, and the prevalence among dogs tested and unprotected was 0. 59 %. That prevalence was considerably higher in endemic areas. Companion dogs, over three years of age and maintained primarily outdoors in rural areas, were most frequently infected.

40|$|Background. Ebola {{virus disease}} (EVD) in health workers (<b>HWs)</b> <b>has</b> {{been a major}} {{challenge}} during the 2014 - 2015 outbreak. We examined factors associated with Ebola virus exposure and mortality in HWs in Kenema District, Sierra Leone. Methods. We analyzed data from the Sierra Leone National Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Database, contact tracing records, Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) staff and Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) rosters, and burial logs. Results. From May 2014 through January 2015, 600 cases of EVD originated in Kenema District, including 92 (15 %) HWs, 66 (72 %) of whom worked at KGH. Among KGH medical staff and international volunteers, 18 of 62 (29 %) {{who worked in the}} ETU developed EVD, compared with 48 of 83 (58 %) who worked elsewhere in the hospital. Thirteen percent of HWs with EVD reported contact with EVD patients, while 27 % reported contact with other infected HWs. The number of HW EVD cases at KGH declined roughly 1 month after implementation of a new triage system at KGH and the opening of a second ETU within the district. The case fatality ratio for HWs and non-HWs with EVD was 69 % and 74 %, respectively. Conclusions. The cluster of HW EVD cases in Kenema District {{is one of the largest}} ever reported. Most <b>HWs</b> with EVD <b>had</b> potential virus exposure both inside and outside of hospitals. Prevention measures for HWs must address a spectrum of infection risks in both formal and informal care settings as well as in the community. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
