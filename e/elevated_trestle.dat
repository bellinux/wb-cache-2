50|$|While {{this station}} is {{underground}} and Fourth Avenue {{is on an}} <b>elevated</b> <b>trestle,</b> this station is actually at a higher elevation than Fourth Avenue. The is because Brooklyn's topography slopes downwards towards the west (hence the neighborhood name of Park Slope), allowing the line {{to enter into the}} hillside between the two stations.|$|E
50|$|On December 28, 1942 {{the tunnel}} was {{completed}} and opened {{with the two}} remaining at-grade tracks pulled out of service. Around this time Atlantic Avenue was raised over the East New York station via a viaduct that separated {{the road and the}} railroad. The <b>elevated</b> <b>trestle</b> from East New York to Atkins Avenue was also demolished as it had been included in the new tunnel to Jamaica. Only one station was included in the new tunnel: Woodhaven Junction, where the Atlantic Branch crossed under the Rockaway Beach Branch. An interlocking and track connection was built just west of the Woodhaven Junction station to connect the two lines, but these closed after the abandonment of the Rockaway Beach Branch between 1955 and 1962.|$|E

50|$|Many flumes {{took the}} form of wooden troughs <b>elevated</b> on <b>trestles,</b> often {{following}} the natural contours of the land. Originating {{as a part of a}} mill race, they were later used in the transportation of logs in the logging industry, known as a log flume. They were also extensively used in hydraulic mining and working placer deposits for gold, tin and other heavy minerals.|$|R

5000|$|This shuttle, {{assigned}} the label SS in 1960, last ran on May 10, 1975. The <b>elevated</b> <b>trestle</b> {{along with the}} 13th Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway stations stood abandoned until finally being demolished in the mid-1980s. The only remnants of the Culver Shuttle are the lower platforms and tracks at Ninth Avenue and {{a section of the}} trestle that is attached to the Coney Island bound platform at Ditmas Avenue on the Culver Line. The right of way has been sold, as houses have been built on the old right of way near the Ditmas Avenue station. After the shuttle was discontinued, new signs were hung stating what passengers had to do since the shuttle stopped running. A sign like this may have read: ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. During {{the years}} of evolvement {{traditional}} modes of transport actually have depleted reserves intended for their further development. However, the growing population in major cities, massive migration, economic and social processes bring forward absolutely new passenger transportation requirements, which can’t be satisfied to the fullest extent nowadays, and in the nearest future they {{will serve as a}} powerful factor in its development. Fundamentally new technical solutions, which would tackle the whole complex of problems (security, a distance range, travel time, cost of transport; one-time investment, etc) more efficiently, are required. The use of separate track structures solves these problems most effectively. Having analyzed various options of passenger transport complexes with separate track structures, the authors concluded that the track structure {{in the form of the}} <b>elevated</b> <b>trestle</b> of a pipeline type is the most rational for urban conditions...|$|E

Trolley car tracks {{can be seen}} in the unpaved street which runs into the distance at center, above which a wooden bicycle pass can be seen, <b>elevated</b> on <b>trestles.</b> In the background, two buildings are visible to the right: one with what appear to be minnarets, the other bearing the words "Pasadena Grand [ [...] . ]".; A caption below the image reads "Even in 1900, people dreamt of avoiding traffic! Planned to connect Pasadena with Los Angeles but never completed, this elevated bicycle path is shown as it looked in Pasadena"...|$|R

[...] Because the land near the river was subject to annual flooding, the northernmost 8000 ft of the line was <b>elevated</b> on <b>trestles.</b> In 1892 the line was sold to the Portland Consolidated Street Railway Company, which switched to a bigger gauge to match its other tracks and began to electrify the railway for trolleys.|$|R
50|$|The Hoboken Elevated {{was a long}} <b>elevated</b> railway <b>trestle</b> {{that ran}} from Hudson Place near the Lackawanna Terminal, up to Jersey City Heights next to the wagon lift at Pohlmann's Hall. The line {{continued}} west over private property to Central Avenue and then south over that avenue to the Hudson County Courthouse at Newark Avenue near Journal Square. The portion from Hoboken Terminal to Palisade Avenue opened January 25, 1886, under cable power. The extension to Newark Ave opened June 19, 1892, with electric cars, passengers changing at Palisade Avenue. Through electric service began in December 1892. Within {{the next few years}} North Hudson's streetcar lines were converted to electric trolley operation, and ramps were constructed at Palisade Avenue and Newark Avenue so that trolleys could go up onto the elevated railway. It was then operated by trolleys until it closed in 1949.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a member}} of the Assembly Committee on Corporations, Authorities and Commissions, which oversees the MTA, {{transportation}} has been principle policy issue for Goldfeder. One of his major initiatives is the reactivation of the Rockaway Beach Rail Line. The Rockaway Beach Rail Line was operated by the Long Island Rail Road until a track fire, route truncation, and decreasing ridership lead to its shuttering in 1962. To show his support for this initiative, Goldfeder gathered more than 2,500 signatures in favor of reactivation and submitted them to the MTA, and Governor Andrew Cuomo. [...] When the MTA convened a Transportation Reinvention Commission in 2014, Goldfeder testified before the MTA commission advocating for the reactivation of the Rockaway Beach Rail Line during a public hearing. When the commission’s report was released, it highlighted the need to use existing rights of way, including the Rockaway Beach Rail Line, to expand subway and light rail service across the New York City metropolitan area. Most recently, at Goldfeder’s request, Queens College’s Department of Urban Studies initiated a study in November 2013 to poll the opinions of local residents on the best use of the abandoned rail line. When the survey was completed, it showed residents’ preference for expanded transportation over a proposed plan to convert the <b>elevated</b> train <b>trestle</b> into a park similar to the High Line. It also showed that the proposed transportation link would serve up to 500,000 trips per day.|$|R
50|$|John Anderson was {{prominent}} in the establishment in February 1861 of the “Farmers Joint Stock Flour Mill” by Smeaton farmers. Plans to build a mill fell through, but the Andersons determined that they would build their own flour and oat mill in June 1861. The five-story bluestone mill was completed and opened on 29 April 1862, with the oat milling section being completed by the following harvest season. The water wheel follows designs developed by John Smeaton, incorporating wrought iron spokes and cast iron hub and gears. The foundry patterns remained on site, with the original components having been cast by Hunt and Opies Victoria Foundry in Ballarat. The water supply for the water wheel comes from Hepburn Lagoon, located about 5 km from the mill, and delivered via Birch Creek and a water race, with the last section in an wrought iron trough <b>elevated</b> on timber <b>trestles.</b> It is likely that John Anderson {{was responsible for the}} design of the mill, and the drafting of the drawings in the Latrobe Library, as he had been apprenticed in Scotland to a millwright.|$|R
50|$|By 1860, {{the volume}} of ore shipped through the Soo Locks had {{increased}} to 114,401 tons, only to fall again to 49,909 tons in 1861 after the American Civil War broke out. However, by 1862, an additional wooden dock had been constructed at Marquette, this time featuring an <b>elevated</b> railway <b>trestle</b> for ore jennies to discharge ore into pockets. In 1911 another iron ore loading dock was built, where the wooden frame work was replaced with a concrete and steel frame work. The new iron ore loading dock at Marquette, was 1200 feet long; 75 feet high; and 60 feet wide. Four railroad tracks ran across the top and there was storage space inside the bottom concrete part for 60,000 tons of iron ore. The new iron ore loading dock incorporated a concrete bottom half with and a light steel frame work on top; doing away with the wooden supports used in previous iron ore docks. While more expensive than previous iron ore loading docks, that used both iron and wood frame works, the builders claimed the new construction would hold up far longer than the old construction method. Schooners now started to feature regularly spaced hatch covers, speeding up loading. However steamers of the day were not well adapted for bulk cargoes such as iron ore. They did not have hatches through their decks. Instead they had gangways through the sides. So ore shipments were loaded via wheelbarrows through the gangways. The docks had provisions for this by having a flat surface {{on one side and}} moorings directly under the pockets for schooners to receive the ore directly, while steamers moored {{on the opposite side of}} the dock. However, unloading was still a laborious hand-powered affair.|$|R
