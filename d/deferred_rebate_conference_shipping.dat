40|$|Brand {{loyalty and}} the more modern topics of {{computing}} customer lifetime value and structuring loyalty programs remain the focal point for a remarkable number of research articles. At first, this research appears consistent with firm practices. However, close scrutiny reveals disaffirming evidence. Many current so-called loyalty programs appear unrelated to the cultivation of customer brand loyalty {{and the creation of}} customer assets. True investments are up-front expenditures that produce much greater future returns. In contrast, many socalled loyalty programs are shams because they produce liabilities (e. g., promises of future rewards or <b>deferred</b> <b>rebates)</b> rather than assets. These programs produce short-term revenue from customers while producing substantial future obligations to those customers. Rather than showing trust by committing to the customer, the firm asks the customer to trust the firm—that is, trust that future rewards are indeed forthcoming. The entire idea is antithetical to the concept of a customer asset. Many modern loyalty programs resemble old-fashioned trading stamps or <b>deferred</b> <b>rebates</b> that promise future benefits for current patronage. A true loyalty program invests in the customer (e. g., provides free up-front training, allows familiarization or customization) with the expectation of greater future revenue. Alternative motives for extant programs are discussed. Key words: so-called loyalty programs; reward programs; customer assets; customer liabilities; deferred rebates; customer lifetime valu...|$|R
40|$|Liner {{shipping}} is {{the business}} of offering common carrier ocean shipping services in international trade. Since it became an important industry in the 1870 s, it has been characterized by various agreements between firms. Historically, since the formation in 1875 of the Calcutta Conference, the conference system was the primary form of agreement in liner shipping. Variously called liner <b>conferences,</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>conferences,</b> and ocean <b>shipping</b> <b>conferences,</b> they are formal agreements between liner shipping lines on a route, always setting (possibly discriminatory) prices, and sometimes pooling profits or revenues, managing capacity, allocating routes, and offering loyalty discounts. Conferences agreements were quite successful {{and in many cases}} have lasted for years. In the last two decades, conferences have begun to be supplanted by alliances (particularly in the American and European trades, where legislative changes have been unfavourable to them), which are less complete (they do not, for example, set prices) but encompass more broadly defined trade routes...|$|R

40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the application of}} Community principles of freedom to provide services and of free competition in international shipping lines in relation to unilateral and bilateral measures implemented by various countries to defend the interests of their flag shipping companies and in relation to agreements between shipowners (<b>conferences,</b> <b>shipping</b> consortia, strategic alliances) {{in order to reduce}} competition. With regard to the latter aspect is taken into account the question of the compatibility between agreements in liner shipping and EU antitrust rules (article 101 and article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) with particular attention to liner conferences. In 1986 a block exemption from the application of the European antitrust law had been justified on the assumption that liner conferences brought stability, ensuring shippers reliable services that could not be achieved by less restrictive means. The block exemption had been in place for two decades. More recently a study conducted by the European Commission determined that liner conferences operating in EU trades were not producing the anticipated benefits that had justified the original block exemption. So, in 2006 the European Union decided to repeal the block exemption from competition law for liner <b>shipping</b> <b>conferences.</b> After a two years transition period, the repeal went into effect in October 2008. It is therefore examined the impact of the repeal of the conference block exemption on the shipowners, on the shippers and in general on the international liner trades. The importance and actuality of the subject taken into account in this book are, inter alia, confirmed {{by the fact that the}} Federal Maritime Commission, in a recent study, published in 2012, compares US and EU liner trades in order to identify the effects of the UE repeal of the block exemption...|$|R
