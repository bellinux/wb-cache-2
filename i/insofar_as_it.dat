5|$|The Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral was {{originally}} the Registrar of the Order. In 1890, {{on the death}} of the Dean who had held the post in at the time of disestablishment, the office was attached to that of the King of Arms of the Order. This position was held by Ulster King of Arms, Ireland's chief heraldic official, a post which had been created in 1552. In 1943, this post was in effect divided in two, reflecting the partition of Ireland in the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The position, <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> related to Northern Ireland, was combined with that of Norroy King of Arms (who had heraldic jurisdiction in the north of England). The post of Norroy and Ulster King of Arms still exists, and thus continues to hold the offices of Registrar and King of Arms of the Order of St Patrick. The office of Ulster King of Arms, <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> related to the Irish Free State (now officially called Ireland), became the position of Chief Herald of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In Marbury, the Supreme Court {{held that}} Madison's failure {{to deliver the}} {{commission}} to Marbury was illegal, but did not grant Marbury a writ of mandamus {{on the ground that}} § 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was unconstitutional <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> authorized the Court to issue such writs under its original jurisdiction. Stuart v. Lairdinvolving a civil judgment rendered by a circuit court constituted under the Midnight Judges Act and enforced by a circuit court constituted under the Judiciary Act of 1802challenged the constitutionality both of abolishing the circuit judgeships and of requiring the Supreme Court justices to ride circuit. In a brief opinion, the Court rejected both challenges.|$|E

The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.|$|E

40|$|Assertions about metaphysical {{modality}} (hereafter modality) play central {{roles in}} philosophical theorizing. For example, when philosophers propose hypothetical counterexamples, {{they often are}} making a claim {{to the effect that}} some state of affairs is possible. Getting the epistemology of modality right is thus important. Debates have been preoccupied with assessing whether imaginability—or conceivability, <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> <b>it’s</b> different—is a guide to possibility, or whether it is rather intuitions of possibility—and modal intuitions more generally—that are evidence for possibility (modal) claims. The dissertation argues that the imagination plays a subtler role than the first view recognizes, and a more central one than the second view does. In particular, it defends an epistemology of metaphysical modality on which someone can acquire modal knowledge in virtue of having performed certain complex imaginative exercises...|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{the appellate}} {{provision}} of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the appellate {{provision of the}} act of February 27, 1801 was not explicitly limited to civil cases (except <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> incorporated the former by reference). Further, because the D.C. circuit court was not constituted {{within the framework of}} the Judiciary Act of 1802, appeals to the Supreme Court by way of certificates of division could not issue.

He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations. His main focus was always on the people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In A Voyage Round the World he even presented the songs sung by the people of Polynesia, complete with lyrics and notation.

5000|$|The root {{metaphor of}} contextualism is the [...] "act in context", whereby any event is {{interpreted}} as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context. The truth criterion of contextualism is often dubbed [...] "successful working", whereby the truth and meaning of an idea lies in its function or utility, not in how well {{it is said to}} mirror reality. In contextualism, an analysis is said to be true or valid <b>insofar</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> leads to effective action, or achievement of some goal. Contextualism is Pepper's term for the philosophical pragmatism developed by Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey, and others.|$|R
500|$|Descartes, in {{developing}} his First Law of Nature, also invokes {{the idea of}} a conatus se movendi, or [...] "conatus of self-preservation". This law is a generalization of the principle of inertia, which was developed and experimentally demonstrated earlier by Galileo. The principle was formalized by Isaac Newton and made into the first of his three Laws of Motion fifty years after the death of Descartes.

5|$|Palmer {{does not}} {{explicitly}} connect Environmental Ethics and Process Thought to Animal Ethics in Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> offers {{an attempt to}} bridge environmental ethics and animal ethics. In contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on the ethics of harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal Ethics in Context, about the ethics of aiding animals, {{with a focus on}} the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E
5|$|Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} writs {{of error}} from the circuit courts only in civil cases. The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal districtdid not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases, except <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> required an amount in controversy. Although the Court reached {{the merits of}} a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms (1803), without any discussion of the jurisdictional issue, in United States v. More (1805), the Court held {{that it had no}} such jurisdiction.

5|$|Several signal {{events from}} the 4th to 6th centuries mark {{the period of}} {{transition}} during which the Roman Empire's Greek East and Latin West divided. Constantine I (r. 324–337) reorganised the empire, made Constantinople the new capital, and legalised Christianity. Under Theodosius I (r. 379–395), Christianity became the Empire's official state religion and other religious practices were proscribed. Finally, under the reign of Heraclius (r. 610–641), the Empire's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin. Thus, although the Roman state continued and Roman state traditions were maintained, modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was centred on Constantinople, oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture, and characterised by Orthodox Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Some argue on {{religious}} or philosophical {{grounds that it}} is blameworthy to act against conscience, even if the judgement of conscience {{is likely to be}} erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms). Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, <b>insofar</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole. Langston argues that philosophers of virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected conscience for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom of will to use such powers arbitrarily, or with violence, this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.|$|E
