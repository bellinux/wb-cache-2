25|$|After {{leaving the}} library, Harris and Klebold entered the science area, where they threw {{a small fire}} bomb into an empty storage closet. It caused a fire, which was put out by a teacher hidden in an {{adjacent}} room. The duo proceeded toward the south hallway, where they shot into an empty science room. At approximately 11:44a.m., Harris and Klebold were captured on the school security cameras as they re-entered the cafeteria. The recording shows Harris kneeling on the landing and firing a single shot {{toward one of the}} propane bombs he and Klebold had earlier left in the cafeteria, in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate it. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> from one of the drinks left behind as Klebold approached the propane bomb and examined it. Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the propane bomb. As the two left the cafeteria, the Molotov cocktail exploded, partially detonating one of the propane bombs at 11:46a.m. Two minutes later, approximately one gallon of fuel ignited in the same vicinity, causing a fire that was extinguished by the fire sprinklers.|$|E

After finding the shoe again, he drops the body into a hole before {{emptying}} a bag of quicklime into the hole. He starts walking back towards his car only to realize it is no longer there. Kretzer makes a call to the police station, telling the dispatcher his radio is down and he can be reached on his cell.|$|R

5000|$|Cutty Sark {{makes an}} {{appearance}} in many novels by Haruki Murakami, most notably The Wind Up Bird Chronicle, 1Q84, and Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage. It is a character's favourite {{drink in the}} 1978 novel The Human Factor by Graham Greene. In Charles Bukowski's novel Women, there is a scene where the protagonist Henry Chinaski fights over a bottle of Cutty Sark with his girlfriend. Eventually the bottle is broken and <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> from what's left at the bottom. Also Cutty Sark is one time favourite drink of Clive Cussler's hero Dirk Pitt and also of Clive Cussler who is featured as a bit part character in most of his novels. A bottle of Cutty Sark vintage 1985 is mentioned to be worth a fortune in science fiction novel Lies, Inc. by Philip K. Dick. In Yukio Mishima's 1971 novel [...] "The Decay of the Angel", Cutty Sark is the whiskey of choice for Honda, the main character.|$|R

25|$|The race saw him break Indianapolis victory lane {{tradition}} when {{he drank}} a celebratory bottle {{of orange juice}} instead of the traditional bottle of milk. He was only the second driver to not drink milk at Indianapolis since the tradition was founded in 1936 (and firmly established in 1956). Fittipaldi owned several orange groves in his native Brazil, and wanted to promote the citrus industry. He was widely criticized and ridiculed for the action, even though <b>he</b> later <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of milk after the television cameras were off.|$|R

No doubt with the same amiable desire, he immediately resumed his knife and fork, as a practical assurance that the beer had wrought no bad effect upon his appetite.|$|E
60|$|Half an hour passed. The {{captain had}} smoked one pipe and was half through another.

60|$|With much {{reluctance}} the Rector {{accompanied him}} to the private sitting room that the Squire had engaged. He sat down almost mechanically in an easy chair. The Squire poured out the wine, and handed him a glass.

60|$|Confronted by this fixed regard, Mr. Topes looked away. What {{thoughtful}} eyes! He couldn't {{remember ever}} to have seen eyes so full of thought. There were certain Madonnas of Montagna, he reflected, very like hen mild little blonde Madonnas with slightly snub noses and very, very young. But he was old; it would be many years, in spite of Buzzacott, before the vines grew up into a green tunnel. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of wine; then, mechanically, sucked his drooping grey moustache.|$|E

But whenever the new-comer came within his immediate circle of vision he shot a glance at the latter's elegant attire--the well-cut coat, the striped waistcoat, the boots of fine leather--the glance was quick and comprehensive and full of scorn, a flash that lasted only an instant and was at once veiled again by the droop of the flaccid lids which hid the pale, keen eyes.|$|E

60|$|The {{little man}} did as <b>he</b> was bid, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of claret, and began:--"About {{ten years ago}} I was hunting up in the far {{interior}} of Africa, {{at a place called}} Gatgarra, not a great way from the Chobe River. I had with me four native servants, namely, a driver and voorlooper, or leader, who were natives of Matabeleland, a Hottentot named Hans, who had once been the slave of a Transvaal Boer, and a Zulu hunter, who for five years had accompanied me upon my trips, and whose name was Mashune. Now near Gatgarra I found a fine piece of healthy, park-like country, where the grass was very good, considering the time of year; and here I made a little camp or head-quarter settlement, from whence I went expeditions on all sides in search of game, especially elephant. My luck, however, was bad; I got but little ivory. I was therefore very glad when some natives brought me news that a large herd of elephants were feeding in a valley about thirty miles away. At first I thought of trekking down to the valley, waggon and all, but gave up the idea on hearing that it was infested with the deadly 'tsetse' fly, which is certain death to all animals, except men, donkeys, and wild game. So I reluctantly determined to leave the waggon in the charge of the Matabele leader and driver, and to start on a trip into the thorn country, accompanied only by the Hottentot Hans, and Mashune.|$|R
6000|$|... 'In the {{establishment}} where we sat one {{could get a}} variety of foreign drinks which were kept for the visiting naval officers, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of the dark medical-looking stuff, which probably was nothing more nasty than cassis a l'eau, and glancing with one eye into the tumbler, shook his head slightly. [...] "Impossible de comprendre--vous concevez," [...] he said, with a curious mixture of unconcern and thoughtfulness. I could very easily conceive how impossible {{it had been for}} them to understand. Nobody in the gunboat knew enough English to get hold of the story as told by the serang. There was a good deal of noise, too, round the two officers. [...] "They crowded upon us. There was a circle round that dead man (autour de ce mort)," [...] he described. [...] "One had to attend to the most pressing. These people were beginning to agitate themselves--Parbleu! A mob like that--don't you see?" [...] he interjected with philosophic indulgence. As to the bulkhead, he had advised his commander that the safest thing was to leave it alone, it was so villainous to look at. They got two hawsers on board promptly (en toute hale) and took the Patna in tow--stern foremost at that--which, under the circumstances, was not so foolish, since the rudder was too much out of the water to be of any great use for steering, and this manoeuvre eased the strain on the bulkhead, whose state, he expounded with stolid glibness, demanded the greatest care (exigeait les plus grands menagements). I could not help thinking that my new acquaintance must have had a voice in most of these arrangements: he looked a reliable officer, no longer very active, and he was seamanlike too, in a way, though as he sat there, with his thick fingers clasped lightly on his stomach, he reminded you of one of those snuffy, quiet village priests, into whose ears are poured the sins, the sufferings, the remorse of peasant generations, on whose faces the placid and simple expression is like a veil thrown over the mystery of pain and distress. He ought to have had a threadbare black soutane buttoned smoothly up to his ample chin, instead of a frock-coat with shoulder-straps and brass buttons. His broad bosom heaved regularly while he went on telling me that it had been the very devil of a job, as doubtless (sans doute) I could figure to myself in my quality of a seaman (en votre qualite de marin). At the end of the period he inclined his body slightly towards me, and, pursing his shaved lips, allowed the air to escape with a gentle hiss. [...] "Luckily," [...] he continued, [...] "the sea was level like this table, and there was no more wind than there is here." [...] . The place struck me as indeed intolerably stuffy, and very hot; my face burned as though I had been young enough to be embarrassed and blushing. They had directed their course, he pursued, to the nearest English port [...] "naturellement," [...] where their responsibility ceased, [...] "Dieu merci." [...] . He blew out his flat cheeks a little. [...] "Because, mind you (notez bien), all the time of towing we had two quartermasters stationed with axes by the hawsers, to cut us clear of our tow in case she [...] ." [...] He fluttered downwards his heavy eyelids, making his meaning as plain as possible. [...] "What would you! One does what one can (on fait ce qu'on peut)," [...] {{and for a moment he}} managed to invest his ponderous immobility with an air of resignation. [...] "Two quartermasters--thirty hours--always there. Two!" [...] he repeated, lifting up his right hand a little, and exhibiting two fingers. This was absolutely the first gesture I saw him make. It gave me the opportunity to [...] "note" [...] a starred scar on the back of his hand--effect of a gunshot clearly; and, as if my sight had been made more acute by this discovery, I perceived also the seam of an old wound, beginning a little below the temple and going out of sight under the short grey hair at the side of his head--the graze of a spear or the cut of a sabre. He clasped his hands on his stomach again. [...] "I remained on board that--that--my memory is going (s'en va). Ah! Patt-na. C'est bien ca. Patt-na. Merci. It is droll how one forgets. I stayed on that ship thirty hours. [...] ." ...|$|E

5000|$|By 1956, {{the milk}} {{returned}} as a ritual as milk companies became {{sponsors of the}} race purse and handed a bottle of milk to the winner to promote their product. A sponsorship of currently $10,000 now paid out by the American Dairy Association if the winner sips the milk in victory lane. In 1993, Emerson Fittipaldi drank orange juice instead of milk after his victory. The snub drew considerable ire from fans. Later <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> of milk, {{at the urging of}} his car owner Roger Penske. Fittipaldi owned citrus farms in Brazil, and wished to promote his industry. As a result, he was booed in driver's introductions the following week by the crowd in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the heart of [...] "America's Dairyland."

40|$|Ah! My favorite! ” Leroy exclaimed as {{he opened}} the door to the aroma of lentil soup wafting through the house. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> off his jacket and hurried to the table, where a bowl of the soup awaited him. <b>He</b> eagerly <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip,</b> and then paused as he noticed a subtle but unusual taste. “How is the soup? ” Mona asked. “Delicious! I taste {{something}} different though. It seems from the color that you added saffron to the soup,” Leroy observed. “Not saffron; I added some turmeric. ” “Did you say turmeric? ” Leroy asked with a puzzled look. “Yes, I added a pinch of turmeric. I read that it is good for you. In fact, I added more than a pinch. I read that turmeric contains a chemical called curcumin, which is believed to provide many health benefits. It may be beneficial in treating Alzheimer’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis and in preventing some forms of cancer and even in controlling diabetes, ” Mona explained. Leroy nodded appreciatively as he continued eating. Then, looking up from the bowl, he said: “Honey, you did say that you added turmeric, right? I thought that turmeric has a yellow color. I know that it is used in both curry and mustard, and it’s what gives them both their characteristic yellow color. But this lentil soup has an orange tinge, not a yellow color, ” Leroy observed. “Well, let me explain what happened. I started making the soup in the traditional way. I added all the ingredients and a good sprinkling of turmeric. The boiling mixture became yellow. But the baby started crying, and so I turned the stove off and attended to her. After a while, she went to sleep and I turned the stove back on and continued boiling the lentils. But then I looked at the clock and realized you would be home in about 15 minutes and that the soup would probably not be done by then. The lentils were still uncooked! So I added some baking soda. I had read somewhere that baking soda speeds up the cooking of food. As I added the baking soda, I noticed that the soup changed color from yellow to orange, ” Mona explained. “Strange. I wonder if the health promoting chemical in turmeric was destroyed by the baking soda. It doesn’t matter though, the soup is lovely! ” Leroy blurted out between spoonfuls of soup...|$|R

But Boycie goes to see her instead, and she makes it clear that she is not interested in Tyler, she only likes older men - so she is about to seduce Boycie (thus showing a female weakness to Boycie that was not shown in Only Fools and Horses) when her father Llewellyn stumbles in on the two of them. We have changed the description in the photo to Tyler's teacher, as this was a slight blunder. Tyler's girlfriend was actually Beth. Straight after being turned down by his teacher he asked Beth on a date and Beth accepted. He even claimed he bought the present for her, which he had actually bought it for his teacher.Meanwhile, Elgin, Bryan, Jed and Mrs Cakeworthy concoct a potion for Rocky the bull, to make him more attracted to the female sex.
