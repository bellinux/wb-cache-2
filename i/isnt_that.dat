60|$|HOTCHKISS [rising {{and leaning}} {{on the back of}} the chair left vacant by the General] I really must point out to you, Father Anthony, that the early Christian rules of life were not made to last, because the early Christians did not believe that the world itself was going to last. Now we know that we shall have to go through with it. We have found that there are {{millions}} of years behind us; and we know that that there are millions before us. Mrs Bridgenorth's question remains unanswered. How is the world to go on? You say that that is our business--that it is the business of Providence. But the modern Christian view is that we are here to do the business of Providence and nothing else. The question is, how. Am I not to use my reason to find out why? <b>Isnt</b> <b>that</b> what my reason is for? Well, all my reason tells me at present is that you are an impracticable lunatic.|$|E

He tries to save both, so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose. The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea." [...] Stylistically, there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblins costume, which led IGNs Richard George to comment years later, [...] "Were not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from Spider-Man is almost comically bad...

5000|$|Kid A {{received}} a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw Kid A as a [...] "commercial suicide note", labelling it [...] "intentionally difficult" [...] and {{longing for a}} return to the bands earlier style. Radioheads fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the bands best work. Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying: [...] "I was really, really amazed at how badly A was being viewed ... because the musics not that hard to grasp. Were not trying to be difficult ... Were actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people ... What were doing <b>isnt</b> <b>that</b> radical." [...] The album has since been ranked one of the best of all time by publications including Time and Rolling Stone; Pitchfork, the Times and Rolling Stone named it the best album of the decade.|$|E

[...] Odd Eye also gets praise, which is written and composed by member Jonghyun, Benjamin states the group [...] "return to the R&B side of SHINee with feathery vocals, tight harmonies and member Onews falsetto howls acting a centerpiece to this grooving opener." [...] But he also criticized some of the songs of the album like An Ode to You, saying the [...] "unnecessary electric guitar riffs {{are added to the}} mix that soils the pure production." [...] Black Hole is also criticized stating [...] "its not only the shortest song of the album, but {{also one of the most}} forgettable." [...] Overall he gives the album 3.5 stars out of 5.

5000|$|Business Insiders Kevin Lincoln {{commented that}} Lana was {{manufactured}} by her label and used [...] "Video Games" [...] {{as a form}} of advertising.

Ignore accusations of cynical marketing and inauthenticity, or speculation about surgery and daddys money - thats not important. And dont get distracted by YouTube statistics or the hyperbole, this isnt about new media. Its about something older and more mysterious than that; the extraordinary, resilient power of pop music". Sasha Frere Jones of The New Yorker came out in defense of the artist as well, writing: [...] "The weirder strain of criticism concerns authenticity ... Detractors cite a variety of presumed conspiracies, some involving the influence of her father, Rob Grant ... The rumor of manipulative managers guiding her; the reality of professional songwriters working for her ... and how Grants top lip got so big so fast ... Surely no equivalent male star would be subject of the same level of examination." [...] Sharing a similar view, Ann Lee wrote in Metro: [...] "I know its fun to slate Lana but shes got a great voice - thats a fact". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also proved to be in favor of Del Rey, declaring: [...] "I was initially puzzled by the accusations of inauthenticity that were hurled with such vehemence and frequency at Lana Del Rey in the wake of her meteoric rise to it girl status last year ... And I guess were supposed to lament the fact that, unlike Amy Winehouse, she doesnt appear to have a predilection for dope or booze to back up her supposed bad-girl bona fides. But since when exactly has authenticity ever been a criterion in pop music?".|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to find out whether nitrosative stress (via peroxynitrite(ONOO-)) plays a role or even causes various {{neurological}} diseases in children. In literature there have been several examples of neurological diseases which seem to caused or at least influenced by nitrosative stress, such as Alzheimers disease, ALS, inflammations, multiple sclerosis etc. Therefore cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) of 40 children and 3 adults (= 43 patients) with various neurological diseases and CSF of 18 children out of a controll group was tested. The 43 patients suffered from diseases which in one way or the other could have been influenced by increased production of peroxynitrite. To show the excess of peroxynitrite production, 3 -nitrotyrosine (3 -NT) was measured, since peroxynitrite itself is a very instable product. 3 -NT can be seen as an indicator of nitrosative stress (and peroxynitrite), since it is a stable product out of the reaction of tyrosine und peroxynitrite. High performance liquid chromotography (HPLC) combined with electrochemical detection was used to determine the amount of 3 -NT. It seemed to be the method of choice because using this method even very small amounts of 3 -NT could be detected. Furthermore this method <b>isnt</b> <b>that</b> expensive compared to other methods such as mass-spectroscopy, which is an important factor in routine 3 -NT-investigation. At first, several experiments were made to show that our used machine worked exact and linear, and to show the influences of various parameters such as pH of mobile phase. This was followed by the investigation of CSF of patients and controll-group. But only eight out of the 43 patients had increased levels of 3 -NT. In addition one child out of the cotroll group showed increased rates. The average concentration of 3 -NT in the " 3 -NT-positive" probes was 4. 73 nM. In the other probes no 3 -NT could be determined, that means the concentration was 0 nM. Now theres the question why only in eight out of the 43 patients an increased level of 3 -NT could be detected. Three out of these eight patients were adults suffering from multiple sclerosis. All of the detected increased rates werent as high they were expected to be, compared to literature. One reason could be that never before children had been tested for 3 -NT, so there is no direct comparison in literature. Mayby no 3 -NT is produced in childrens brains at all, so no 3 -NT could be shown in the controll group. Compared to this, the average rate of 4. 73 nM 3 -NT in "positive" probes could be an excessive increased level. Furthermore only free, not protein-bound 3 -NT was measured. All of the in literature described 3 -NT-increases were found in CSF probes, which proteins had been hydolysated before. Therefore, protein-bound- 3 -NT was as well detected. Protein-bound 3 -NT wasnt detected in this study, so of course the detected rates were lower. Another thing is that one cant tell for sure that the detected substance really is 3 -NT or another substance which has the same retention time and coelutes with 3 -NT. To make sure that it is indeed 3 -NT,one could gather the eluted substance and investigates it mass spectroscopidly. Finally one can say that there are many open questions,which need further studys. The CSF probes of the examined children should once more be tested for 3 -NT hydrolysatinproteins. The found substanz should furthermore be definitly be identified as 3 - NT. Only then the results can really be compared to results in literature. Therefore this study shall only be looked upon as a beginning of investigation in nitrosative stress causing neurological diseases in children, which has to followed by many other studys. It should be rather be looked upon as establishing a new method showing investigation starts...|$|E
40|$|Water {{rights in}} the Sahara Desert? CUE: What {{does it mean to}} have the right to water? Can a {{statement}} on water rights in a constitution achieve anything? And is it meaningful to tell people living in a dry area that they have a right to, for example, 20 litres of water per day, when that water may simply not exist? Virginia Roaf works for WaterAid, an international NGO that aims to improve the access of poor people to water and sanitation. Mike Davison went to the WaterAid office in London, and started by asking how useful she thought it was to give someone a right to water. IN: 		?The question of the right? OUT:		?coming from the local communities? DUR?N	 5 ? 08 BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Virginia Roaf of WaterAid describing some of the key issues raised by the right to water. Transcript Roaf	The question of the right to water is actually not as simple as it sounds. Everyone would agree that the right to water is a good right, it should be in the UN Declaration of Human Rights. But you also have to look at what is meant by the right to water, how much water, for whom, how clean is that water going to be? One of the problems of introducing a right to water is setting the standards that go with that. For example they might decide that everyone has a right to 20 litres per person per day. Now that?s obviously not going to be accessible to those people living in villages in rural areas, in the middle of the Sahara Desert for example, because that water is just not accessible; there <b>isn?t</b> <b>that</b> water in the ground. So setting a right to water which has unrealistic standards, you may actually find that the right to water works against the needs of the poorest. Maybe I can explain this best by looking at the right to housing. In South Africa the right to housing is enshrined in the constitution but along with that right to housing is also a long list of standards that are required to be met by that housing. For example they are to do with what the walls are to be made of, what the roof is to be made of. Now that?s obviously unaffordable to the poor who are presently living in shacks and in over crowded conditions. So while it?s a very good thing for the right to housing to be enshrined in the constitution it?s actually not accessible. Davison	So having that right to housing you would say is meaningless? Roaf	I think often it can be meaningless unless you?ve got a government that?s committed to creating the framework or the policies that will actually be able to deliver that housing. Davison	And if we were to carry that on to the example of the village in the Sahara Desert having a right to water, would you regard it in the same way? Roaf	Yes, I would say that rather than setting the standards for the right to water here in Britain or through the UN, I think it?s important to include local communities from poor areas, from developing countries, to ensure that the standards are not inaccessible. Davison	Do you think that if a country adds a statement on the right to water to its constitution, that is likely to help the poorer people who currently don?t have access to water? Roaf	I think that in some cases that will strengthen the poor community?s hand. I think it depends on whether the poor community is well organised and whether they know that they have the right to water. I think however that generally these rights that stand in the constitution become just words on a piece of paper and that they are actually more likely to protect the rights of the middle income people or the people in power than they are to protect the rights of the poor. Davison	Can you explain what you mean by that? Roaf	In Dhaka in Bangladesh a vast proportion of the population live in illegal settlements which they don?t have the rights to. It could be because it?s along the river bank or it?s on pavements or it?s on land which is ear-marked for other purposes, and the government is not willing to give land rights. There?s a community in an area called Tejganj where the people are living on a pavement adjacent to the factory where they are working. And they?ve been living there for maybe 25 or 30 years without access to adequate water and sanitation and the reason for that is the government is not prepared to provide water and sanitation to that community because they lack land title. So what WaterAid has done is actually to work with the community and they have negotiated with the local council, for the local council to give the community a 5 year, a short term lease, which will then allow the municipal supplier to actually provide water and sanitation. Interestingly this has caused a problem with the middle income community which lives opposite. The middle class community has decided that this is a threat to them and persuaded the local municipality to evict the community. Within a week the community were back living in that area because they had nowhere else to go. So they are actually now living in that area again and they are still obviously working in the factory. Davison	So that suggests that often when you get water rights you may well have a situation of conflict between two different groups? Roaf	There?s always going to be conflict over resources which are limited. The water supply in Dhaka probably reaches maybe 25 % of the population but obviously that?s going to be going to the richer parts of that community. And so if the middle class community see that the water is now being accessed by poorer communities obviously there?s going to be less water to go around. Davison	To me water rights would seem to be quite a western concept. To what extent do you think that the communities that WaterAid is working with feel that they have a right to water? Roaf	I think that the people living in Dhaka in Bangladesh through the work that they?ve been doing in accessing their right to land has actually introduced ideas of rights of water to those communities. Davison	So the increasing awareness of water rights has come through increasing awareness and interest in land rights? Roaf	I would say that there is more interest now in water rights, yes, because there?s been interest in land rights and the demand is coming from the local communities. End of tape.
