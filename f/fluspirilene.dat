5000|$|Penfluridol (Semap, Micefal, Longoperidol) is {{a highly}} potent, first {{generation}} diphenylbutylpiperidine antipsychotic. It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1968. Related to other diphenylbutylpiperidine antipsychotics, pimozide and <b>fluspirilene,</b> penfluridol has an extremely long elimination half-life and its effects last for many days after single oral dose. Its antipsychotic potency, in terms of dose needed to produce comparable effects, is similar to both haloperidol and pimozide. It is only slightly sedative, but often causes extrapyramidal side-effects, such as akathisia, dyskinesiae and pseudo-Parkinsonism. Penfluridol is indicated for antipsychotic treatment of chronic schizophrenia and similar psychotic disorders, it is, however, like most typical antipsychotics, being increasingly replaced by the atypical antipsychotics. Due to its extremely long-lasting effects, it is often prescribed to be taken orally as tablets only once a week (q 7 days). The once-weekly dose is usually 10-60 mg.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that <b>fluspirilene,</b> a {{dopamine}} D 2 receptor antagonist which is a long-acting neuroleptic useful in the maintenance therapy of schizophrenic patients, also displays Ca 2 + channel blocking activity. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of <b>fluspirilene</b> on synaptic transmission and epileptiform activity induced in slices of hippocampus and amygdala. <b>Fluspirilene</b> reversibly suppressed the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (f-e. p. s. p) in a concentration-dependent manner in the area CAl of the hippocampus without affecting {{the size and shape of}} fibre volley. <b>Fluspirilene</b> also inhibited the intracellularly recorded e. p. s. p. in amygdala neurones without affecting the resting membrane potential or neuronal input resistance. <b>Fluspirilene</b> increased the ratio of paired-pulse facilitation suggesting a presynaptic mode of action. Epileptiform activity induced in the disinhibited slices was suppessed by <b>fluspirilene</b> in a concentration-dependent manner. This antiepileptic effect was occluded in slices pretreated with the adenosine A 1 receptor agonist, N 6 -cyclopentyladenosine (CPA). It is concluded that fluspirilene-induced synaptic inhibition is probably due to a reduction in presynaptic Ca 2 + currents. In clinical trials, the low incidence of seizures provoked by <b>fluspirilene</b> might be related to its intrinsic ability to inhibit synaptic transmission and epileptiform activity...|$|E
40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Surgical resection and conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy ultimately fail due to tumor recurrence and HCC's resistance. The development of novel therapies against HCC is thus urgently required. The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) pathways are important and well-established targets for cancer treatment. In particular, CDK 2 is a key factor regulating the cell cycle G 1 to S transition and a hallmark for cancers. In this study, we utilized our free and open-source protein-ligand docking software, idock, prospectively to identify potential CDK 2 inhibitors from 4, 311 FDA-approved small molecule drugs using a repurposing strategy and an ensemble docking methodology. Sorted by average idock score, nine compounds were purchased and tested in vitro. Among them, the anti-psychotic drug <b>fluspirilene</b> exhibited the highest anti-proliferative effect in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG 2 and Huh 7 cells. We demonstrated for the first time that <b>fluspirilene</b> treatment significantly increased the percentage of cells in G 1 phase, and decreased the expressions of CDK 2, cyclin E and Rb, as well as the phosphorylations of CDK 2 on Thr 160 and Rb on Ser 795. We also examined the anti-cancer effect of <b>fluspirilene</b> in vivo in BALB/C nude mice subcutaneously xenografted with human hepatocellular carcinoma Huh 7 cells. Our results showed that oral <b>fluspirilene</b> treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth. <b>Fluspirilene</b> (15 mg/kg) exhibited strong anti-tumor activity, comparable to that of the leading cancer drug 5 -fluorouracil (10 mg/kg). Moreover, the cocktail treatment with <b>fluspirilene</b> and 5 -fluorouracil exhibited the highest therapeutic effect. These results suggested for the first time that <b>fluspirilene</b> is a potential CDK 2 inhibitor and a candidate anti-cancer drug for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma. In view of the fact that <b>fluspirilene</b> has a long history of safe human use, our discovery of <b>fluspirilene</b> as a potential anti-HCC drug may present an immediately applicable clinical therapy...|$|E
40|$|Different {{classes of}} calcium {{antagonist}} were defined in vitro using radioligand binding {{studies and the}} efficacy of the classes as neuroprotective agents was assessed in vivo using a novel model of cerebral ischaemia. Radioligand binding studies indicated that the interactions of both class I (dihydropyridines) and class II (verapamil and diltiazem) calcium antagonists was temperature-, ligand- and tissue-dependent. Specific binding sites for class III antagonists (flunarizine, <b>fluspirilene,</b> etc.), labelled by [3 H] <b>fluspirilene</b> in skeletal muscle, were not identified in brain membranes, although these compounds allosterically regulated [3 H] dihydropyridine binding in brain. All class III compounds displayed high affinity for the [3 H] <b>fluspirilene</b> site in skeletal muscle membranes and thus <b>fluspirilene</b> appeared to be prototypical of this class of compound. The calcium antagonist SR 33557 identified a novel high affinity binding site in brain membranes. This putatative fourth site for a calcium antagonist appeared to be tightly coupled to the dihydropyridine site. Class III calcium antagonists displayed a range of affinities for other receptor and ion channel sites but all class III calcium antagonists showed high affinity for rat brain sodium channels labelled by [3 H] batrachotoxinin-A- 20 -a-benzoate. In the Mongolian gerbil, forebrain ischaemia (10 min but not 5 min) with 7 days recovery produced a significant {{reduction in the number of}} [3 H] PN 200 - 110 binding sites in hippocampal membranes. However, an w 3 ligand, [3 H] PK 11195 was shown to be a better marker of ischaemic damage. Binding experiments and autoradiographic analysis demonstrated a significant ischaemia-induced increase in the density of w 3 sites after 5 min forebrain ischaemia and 7 days recovery in the gerbil. The distribution and pharmacology of w 3 sites was very species dependent. [3 H] PK 11195 was successfully used to establish a model of focal ischaemia in the mouse, in which a variety of class III calcium antagonists were found to be neuroprotective. The anticonvulsant phenytoin was active in the mouse focal ischaemia model and in an in vitro model of ischaemia (using the rat hippocampal slice). The interaction of calcium antagonists with both Na+ and Ca 2 + channels is proposed to be important as a mechanism whereby these agents confer neuroprotection...|$|E
40|$|Risperidone and its active {{metabolite}} 9 -OH-risperidone {{were compared}} to reference antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol, pipamperone, <b>fluspirilene,</b> clozapine, zotepine) and compounds under development (olanzapine, seroquel, sertindole, ORG- 5222, ziprasidone) for in vitro binding to neurotransmitter receptors in brain tissue and on membranes of recombinant cells expressing cloned human receptors and for in vivo occupancy of neurotransmitter receptors in rat and guinea-pig brain following acute treatment (2 h., s. c.). An ex vivo autoradiography technique was applied to determine the receptor occupancy by the drugs administered in vivo. Of particular interest are the central 5 HT 2 A receptors and D 2 -type receptors. Predominant 5 HT 2 A receptor antagonism is supposed to add to an atypical profile of the antipsychotics (treatment of the negative symptoms, low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects). D 2 antagonism is required the treatment of positive symptoms. A contribution of the new dopamine receptor subtypes D 3 and in particular D 4 receptors has been proposed. In vitro, all compounds, except the 'typical' antipsychotics haloperidol and <b>fluspirilene,</b> showed higher affinity for 5 HT 2 A than for D 2 receptors. Subnanomolar affinity for human 5 HT 2 A receptors was observed for ORG- 5222, sertindole, risperidone, 9 -OH-risperidone and ziprasidone. <b>Fluspirilene,</b> ORG- 5222, haloperidol, ziprasidone, risperidone, 9 -OH-risperidone and zotepine displayed nanomolar affinity for human D 2 receptors. Sertindole and olanzapine were slightly less potent. Pipamperone, clozapine and seroquel showed 2 orders of magnitude lower D 2 affinity in vitro. Clozapine, but even more so pipamperone, displayed higher affinity for D 4 than for D 2 receptors. For most other compounds, D 4 affinity was only slightly lower than their D 2 affinity. Seroquel was totally devoid of D 4 affinity. None of the compounds had nanomolar affinity for D 1 receptors; their affinity for D 3 receptors was usually slightly lower than for D 2 receptors. In vivo, ORG- 5222, risperidone, pipamperone, 9 -OH-risperidone, sertindole, olanzapine, zotepine and clozapine maintained a higher potency for occupying 5 HT 2 A than D 2 receptors. Risperidone and ORG- 5222 had 5 HT 2 A versus D 2 potency ratio of about 20. Highest potency for 5 HT 2 A receptor occupancy was observed for ORG- 5222 followed by risperidone and olanzapine. Ziprasidone exclusively occupied 5 HT 2 A receptors. ORG- 5222, haloperidol, <b>fluspirilene</b> and olanzapine showed the highest potency for occupying D 2 receptors. No regional selectivity for D 2 receptor occupancy in mesolimbic versus nigrostriatal areas was detected {{for any of the}} test compounds. Risperidone was conspicuous because of its more gradual occupancy of D 2 receptors; none of the other compounds showed this property. The various compounds also displayed high to moderate occupancy of adrenergic alpha 1 receptors, except <b>fluspirilene</b> and ziprasidone. Clozapine, zotepine, ORG- 5222 and sertindole occupied even more alpha 1 than D 2 receptors. Clozapine showed predominant occupancy of H 1 receptors and occupied cholinergic receptors with equivalent potency to D 2 receptors. A stronger predominance of 5 HT 2 A versus D 2 receptor occupancy combined with a more gradual occupancy of D 2 receptors differentiates risperidone and its 9 -OH-metabolite from the other antipsychotic compounds in this study. The predominant 5 HT 2 A receptor occupancy probably plays a role in the beneficial action of risperidone on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas maintenance of a moderate occupancy of D 2 receptors seems adequate for treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. A combined 5 HT 2 A and D 2 occupancy and the avoidance of D 2 receptor overblockade are believed to reduce the risk for extrapyrastatus: publishe...|$|E

This interference is not seen with the EMIT d. a. u. polyclonal amphetamine assay. These observa-tions were confirmed recently (1). Urine samples from patients being prescribed other antipsychotic drugs were tested for amphetamine by both mono- and polyclonal amphetamine EMiT d. a. u. assays. The findings are shown in Table 1, as are the normal doses of the drugs studied. All the urine samples were examined by our amphet-amine confirmatory method, i. e., gas chromatography on an Apiezon/KOH column, and found to be negative.

40|$|Antischizophrenic {{neuroleptic}} drugs of the diphenylbutylpiperidine class, {{which includes}} pimozide, <b>fluspirilene,</b> penfluridol, and clopimozide, inhibit [3 H]nitrendipine binding with IC 50 values of 13 - 30 nM. This inhibition involves receptors for the verapamil/prenylamine class of calcium channel antagonists. These diphenylbutylpiperidines also inhibit potassium-induced calcium-dependent contractions of rat vas deferens at concentrations of 40 - 350 nM. Other phenothiazine and butyrophenone neuroleptics lack such potent calcium-antagonist actions. Diphenylbutylpiperidines also differ from other neuroleptics {{in their ability}} to relieve negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as emotional withdrawal, as well as the positive symptoms which respond to all neuroleptics. We suggest that these unique antischizophrenic actions are related to a blockade by diphenylbutylpiperidines of voltage-operated calcium channels...|$|E

40|$|Background Antipsychotic {{agents are}} often used to treat neuropsychiatric {{symptoms}} (NPS) in dementia, although the literature is sceptical about their long-termuse for this indication. Their effectiveness is limited and there is concern about adverse effects, including higher mortality with long-term use. When behavioural strategies have failed and drug therapy is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw these drugs are recommended. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia are often reluctant {{to try to stop}} antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. Strategies to reduce antipsychotic use have been proposed, but a systematic review of interventions aimed at withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia has not yet been performed. Objectives : To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia in community or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on behaviour. Search methods : ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources were searched on 23 November 2012. The search included the following terms: antipsychotic* or neuroleptic* or phenothiazines or butyrophenones or risperidone or olanzapine or haloperidol or prothipendyl or methotrimeprazine or clopenthixol or flupenthixol or clothiapine or metylperon or droperidol or pipamperone or benperidol or bromperidol or <b>fluspirilene</b> or pimozide or penfluridol or sulpiride or veralipride or levosulpiride or sultopride or aripiprazole or clozapine or quetiapine or thioridazine combined wither terms such as discontinu* or withdraw* or cessat* or reduce* or reducing or reduct* or taper* or stop*. ALOIS contains records from all major healthcare databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria : Randomised, placebo-controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia. Data collection and analysis : Review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, rated their risk of bias and extracted data. Main results : We included nine trials with 606 randomised participants. Seven trials were conducted in nursing homes, one trial in an outpatient setting and one in both settings. In these trials, different types of antipsychotics prescribed at different doses were withdrawn. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low regarding blinding and outcome reporting and unclear for randomisation procedures and recruitment of participants. There was a wide variety of outcome measures. Our primary efficacy outcomes were success of withdrawal (i. e. remaining in study off antipsychotics) and NPS. Eight of nine trials reported no overall significant difference between groups on the primary outcomes, although in one pilot study of people with psychosis and agitation that had responded to haloperidol, time to relapse was significantly shorter in the discontinuation group (Chi(2) = 4. 1, P value = 0. 04). The ninth trial included people with psychosis or agitation who had responded well to risperidone therapy for four to eight months and reported that discontinuation led to an increased risk of relapse, that is, increase in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) -core score of 30 % or greater (P value = 0. 004, hazard ratio (HR) 1. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 09 to 3. 45 at four months). The only outcome that could be pooled was the full NPI-score, used in two studies. For this outcome {{there was no significant difference}} between people withdrawn from and those continuing on antipsychotics at three months (mean difference (MD) - 1. 49, 95 % CI - 5. 39 to 2. 40). These two studies reported subgroup analyses according to baseline NPI-score (14 or less versus > 14). In one study, those with milder symptoms at baseline were significantly less agitated at three months in the discontinuation group (NPI-agitation, Mann-Whitney U test z = 2. 4, P value = 0. 018). In both studies, there was evidence of significant behavioural deterioration in people with more severe baseline NPS who were withdrawn from antipsychotics (Chi(2) = 6. 8; P value = 0. 009 for the marked symptom score in one study). Individual studies did not report significant differences between groups on any other outcome except one trial that found a significant difference in a measure of verbal fluency, favouring discontinuation. Most trials lacked power to detect clinically important differences between groups. Adverse events were not systematically assessed. In one trial there was a non-significant increase in mortality in people who continued antipsychotic treatment (5 % to 8 % greater than placebo, depending on the population analysed, measured at 12 months). This trend became significant three years after randomisation, but due to dropout and uncertainty about the use of antipsychotics in this follow-up period this result should be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions : Our findings suggest that many older people with Alzheimer's dementia and NPS can be withdrawn from chronic antipsychotic medication without detrimental effects on their behaviour. It remains uncertain whether withdrawal is beneficial for cognition or psychomotor status, but the results of this review suggest that discontinuation programmes could be incorporated into routine practice. However, two studies of people whose agitation or psychosis had previously responded well to antipsychotic treatment found an increased risk of relapse or shorter time to relapse after discontinuation. Two other studies suggest that people with more severe NPS at baseline could benefit from continuing their antipsychotic medication. In these people, withdrawal might not be recommended...|$|E
