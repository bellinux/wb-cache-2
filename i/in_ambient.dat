5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid.

5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of {{the transfer of the}} inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations <b>in</b> <b>ambient</b> pressure. In the case of underwater diving and compressed air work, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure—but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and occupants of unpressurized aircraft, are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within {{a relatively short period of}} hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of ambient pressure.|$|E
5|$|If the {{concentration}} of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that {{of any of the}} tissues, there is a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as out-gassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction <b>in</b> <b>ambient</b> pressure reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs. This process may be complicated by the formation of gas bubbles, and the modeling is more complex and varied.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible <b>in</b> <b>ambient</b> pressure diving.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>ambient</b> {{pressure}} diving, the diver {{is directly}} {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The ambient pressure diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E
5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation <b>in</b> <b>ambient</b> pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly {{because of the}} diving reflex in breath-hold diving. Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and {{resistance to air flow}} in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume. There appears to be a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.|$|E
5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>ambient</b> temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{the origin}} of red {{emission}} in chemically obtained ZnO nanotubes has been investigated by EL spectra. The as-grown samples were annealed <b>in</b> different <b>ambient</b> (argon, air, oxygen, and nitrogen). It was observed that the post-growth annealing in nitrogen and oxygen ambients strongly affected the green, yellow, orange, and red emissions of ZnO nanotubes. The EL intensities of the green, the yellow, the orange, and the red emissions were gradually increased after annealing <b>in</b> air, oxygen <b>ambients,</b> and decrease <b>in</b> argon <b>ambient.</b> However, <b>in</b> nitrogen <b>ambient,</b> the EL emission of the red peak {{in the range of}} 690 -- 750 nm was increased, and in the range of 620 - 690 nm, it was decreased as compared with the as-grown samples.

5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction <b>in</b> <b>ambient</b> pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E
