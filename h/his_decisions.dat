5|$|Frank Calder {{was elected}} President and Secretary-Treasurer at {{a salary of}} $800 (Eight Hundred Dollars) on the {{understanding}} {{that there could be}} no appeal from <b>his</b> <b>decisions....</b>|$|E
5|$|A new note in Coutances' {{administration}} was his custom of issuing writs {{not in his}} own name, as had previously been the practice, but in the king's name. The archbishop also stressed that <b>his</b> <b>decisions</b> were made with the advice and consent {{of many of the}} leading nobles of the realm, as well as the barons of the Exchequer. This was a reaction against Longchamp's authoritarian method of government.|$|E
5|$|As president-elect, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the {{months following the}} election formulating his cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about <b>his</b> <b>decisions,</b> to the frustration of his fellow Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he endured a flurry of advances from office-seekers looking {{to play a role}} in his administration.|$|E
50|$|The book {{provides}} {{a biography of}} Harry Truman in chronological fashion from his birth to his rise to U.S. senator, vice-president, president, following his activities until death, exploring many of the major decisions he made as president, including <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to drop the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, his meetings and confrontation with Joseph Stalin during the end of World War II, <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to create the Marshall Plan, <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to send troops to the Korean War, <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to recognize the state of Israel, and <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to desegregate the United States armed forces.|$|R

60|$|It {{sounded so}} odd and mean {{for such a}} being! But it was <b>his</b> <b>decision,</b> and we said nothing; <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> was sufficient.|$|R
5|$|Bethune's episcopal acta, or <b>his</b> <b>decisions</b> {{and other}} {{documents}} relating to his episcopal career, {{have been published in}} the English Episcopal Acta series, in the volume relating to the diocese of Hereford. A medieval catalogue of works at Llanthony Priory also recorded that they owned a collection of letters by Bethune, but this has not survived.|$|E
5|$|Hall of Fame left-handed pitcher Steve Carlton has {{the most}} Opening Day starts for the Phillies, with 14, {{compiling}} a record of 3–9–2. He is followed by Robin Roberts (twelve starts; 5–6–1), Chris Short (six starts; 3–1–2), and Curt Schilling (five starts; 2–0–3). Grover Cleveland Alexander also made five Opening Day starts for the Phillies, equal to Schilling; however, no information on <b>his</b> <b>decisions</b> in those games is available. The team's record in his five Opening Day starts is 4–1.|$|E
5|$|His {{thinking}} threw {{light in}} a very introspective way on the entire process of the judicial function. <b>His</b> <b>decisions,</b> beyond just the vote they represented, were sufficiently philosophical to be of enduring interest. He decided the case before him with that respect for its particulars, its special features, that marks alike the honest artist and the just judge.|$|E
50|$|Harvey was {{met with}} {{backlash}} from some in the African-American community for <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to meet with then-President-elect Trump. He defended <b>his</b> <b>decision,</b> citing that it would help spark positive changes.|$|R
50|$|The {{prominent}} {{educator and}} activist, Booker T. Washington, got involved and asked President Roosevelt to reconsider <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> in the affair. Roosevelt instead dismissed Washington's plea and allowed <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to stand.|$|R
5000|$|Romero {{attributes}} <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> {{to become}} a scientist the day the press announced the launch of Sputnik. <b>His</b> <b>decision</b> to study biology {{was inspired by the}} Jacques-Yves Cousteau movie [...] "The Silent World".|$|R
5|$|In the Common Pleas, Blackstone {{operated}} under a civil jurisdiction {{rather than a}} mixed civil and criminal one. This played to his strengths, and many of <b>his</b> <b>decisions</b> are considered farsighted; the principle in Blaney v Hendricks, for example, that interest is due on an account where money was lent, which anticipated Section 3 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934. Blackstone's decision in Goldswain's Case was later repeated by Lord Denning in Falmouth Boat Construction Co v Howell in 1950.|$|E
5|$|In the {{extended}} edition of The Two Towers, Jackson included an invented flashback scene showing that Denethor had neglected him {{in favour of}} Boromir when sending him to Rivendell, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. (The relationship is similarly strained in the book, but his father's favouritism {{does not seem to}} affect <b>his</b> <b>decisions</b> in Ithilien.) Reviewers have opined that {{the extended}} edition presents Faramir in a more favourable light.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{after being}} {{rejected}} by Elise, Nemo resolves {{to marry the}} first girl who will dance {{with him at the}} school prom. That night, he dances with Jeanne. While taking her home, Nemo pledges to marry her and be successful. Despite being successful and have two children, Nemo is unhappy and bored with his life. Nemo writes over all his possessions to Jeanne and leaves his family. Now making all of <b>his</b> <b>decisions</b> randomly via coin toss, he goes to the airport, and pretends to be a passenger named Daniel Jones and is taken to a hotel by a waiting chauffeur. At Jones' hotel room, Nemo is murdered while taking a bath, and his body is dumped in the woods.|$|E
50|$|As a last result, Rush {{filed for}} a {{judicial}} review of Rowling's decision, with Wild CJ later ruling that Rowling had no legal right to consider reversion to New Zealand ownership in <b>his</b> <b>decision,</b> directing Rowling to reconsider <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> again.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{well-known}} socialists deplored <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> publicly or privately; a few, {{notably the}} Spanish anarchist Anselmo Lorenzo, {{who had been}} a major political rival of Lafargue during his Spanish period, accepted <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> with understanding. Lorenzo wrote after Lafargue's death: ...|$|R
50|$|On July 18, 2007, James Likeness {{announced}} <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to {{no longer}} be a part of Copeland. He cited pursuing a career as a graphic designer (a field in which he has a college degree) as a chief reason in <b>his</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although loaned {{to friends}} and family, and {{therefore}} in slight public circulation, Coke's Reports were never formally used during his lifetime. Select cases were published in 1600, containing {{the most famous of}} <b>his</b> <b>decisions</b> and pleadings, while a second volume in 1602 was more chronological in nature. The third part, published in the same year, was also chronological, while the fourth, published in 1604, was arranged by subject. The fifth part, published in 1605, is arranged similarly, as is the sixth, published in 1607. Five more volumes were published until 1615, but Coke died before he could publish a single bound copy. No trace has been found of the draft manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Before Lucas {{had started}} writing, his {{producing}} partner Rick McCallum {{was preparing for}} the film. McCallum stated that his experience with The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles led to many of <b>his</b> <b>decisions</b> on The Phantom Menace, such as long-term deals with actors and soundstages, the employment of recent graduates with no film experience, {{and the creation of}} sets and landscapes with digital technology. In April 1994, McCallum started searching for artists in art, architecture and design schools, and in mid-year he began location scouting with production designer Gavin Bocquet. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) art director Doug Chiang impressed McCallum the most and was hired as the design director.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} McCudden was {{suffering}} from combat fatigue. It manifested itself in <b>his</b> <b>decisions,</b> of late, to seek a victory at any price, which was alien to his normal, calculated approach to combat. Knowing he was to soon be sent home, he was obsessed with catching up to von Richthofen's score. His contribution to 56 Squadron at this time was impressive; the unit had claimed 175 enemy aircraft while reporting 14 pilots killed and missing and seven captured. As Flight Commander, B Flight, McCudden's pilots had shot down 77–52 of which were his—while losing four pilots. To celebrate his success he dined with Brigadier General John Higgins and the following evening was invited to the headquarters of General Julian Byng, General Officer Commanding the British Third Army, to be personally congratulated.|$|E
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 February 2009, the {{chairman}} of the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), Gary McGann, announced <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to step down from the board, stating that <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> had been influenced by his former non-executive directorship of Anglo Irish Bank.|$|R
5000|$|In the boardroom, Trump {{questioned}} whether Chris regretted <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to remove Craig and Tana from the team, considering {{they were most}} responsible for Magna's success. Chris stood by <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> however, and accused them of disrupting the team's harmony in the prior tasks.|$|R
5000|$|On December 15, 2008 Curran {{announced}} that he was switching from the Democratic to Republican Party, calling <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> a [...] "matter of conscience." [...] Curran stated that the scandals of Democratic Governor Rod Blagojevich played a role in <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to switch parties ...|$|R
5|$|Despite his equestrian background, Macrinus was {{accepted}} by the Senate for two reasons: {{for the removal of}} Caracalla, and for having received the loyalty of the army. The senators were less concerned by Macrinus' Mauretanian ancestry than by his equestrian social background and scrutinized his actions as emperor. Their opinion of him was reduced by <b>his</b> <b>decisions</b> to appoint men to high offices who were of similarly undistinguished background. Only the Senate had the constitutional power to choose the emperor from among the senators and Macrinus, not being a senator and having become emperor through force rather than through traditional means, was looked down upon.|$|E
5|$|He {{served on}} the boards of the Electricity Trust and the Housing Trust, among others. Here, unused to not being in {{absolute}} control, and having little specific scientific knowledge, he occasionally stumbled in <b>his</b> <b>decisions.</b> This also created difficulties with the other board members, who were reluctant to disagree with their former boss, regardless of their expertise. But his thrift, a theme throughout his Premiership, did not abate; he was constantly forcing the trusts to use cost-saving methods and old vehicles for their work. This extended to his family property; he vigorously opposed his son's desire to install a new irrigation system in the orchard.|$|E
5|$|However the Golden Path's newfound {{momentum}} {{is threatened by}} deep divisions between its commanders, Sabal, who favors traditional values, and Amita (Janina Gavankar), who argues for progress, which includes relying heavily on drug trade. Ajay is forced to intervene on several occasions, with <b>his</b> <b>decisions</b> influencing the direction the Golden Path takes. The first governor to fall is De Pleur after Noore helps Ajay {{find a way to}} infiltrate De Pleur's stronghold, allowing the rebellion to capture him. Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.|$|E
50|$|There was no appeal from <b>his</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dong-joo {{then said}} that such matters {{were not for}} him to {{influence}} <b>his</b> <b>decision,</b> and Gi-tae replied that his medical treatment is not for Dong-joo to influence <b>his</b> <b>decision.</b> When Dong-joo requested {{to discuss the matter}} with him, Gi-tae reinforced that there is nothing to discuss about.|$|R
5000|$|The {{petition}} {{was brought}} before Judge Donald S. Voorhees. In June 1985, Judge Voorhees {{presided over a}} two-week evidentiary hearing on the case, and on February 10, 1986, he delivered <b>his</b> <b>decision.</b> Judge Voorhees based <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> upon the factual record developed before him and determined: ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} sequel, Devil May Cry 2, Dante {{is shown to}} have a habit of {{flipping}} a coin to make <b>his</b> <b>decisions,</b> although it is revealed {{at the end of}} the game that both sides of the coin are heads. Set some time after the first game, Devil May Cry 2 focuses on aiding the character Lucia in defeating Arius, an international businessman who uses demonic power and seeks to conquer the world. At the end of the game, Dante must go into the demon world to stop a demon lord from escaping, but the gate closes behind him and he is trapped. With no way back to the human world, Dante heads even deeper into the demon world on his motorcycle.|$|E
5|$|In theory, the emperor's {{political}} power was absolute, but {{even during the}} Han dynasty, he shared executive powers with civilian officials and normally based <b>his</b> <b>decisions</b> on the advice and formal consensus of his ministers. During the Song dynasty, a national examination system (Civil Service Exam) managed by scholar-bureaucrats was used to recruit officials; those who passed the palace examination – the highest-level examination in the empire – were appointed directly by the emperor to the highest central government positions. Like commoners, these senior officials had to obey his edicts as law or be punished. However, senior officials not only challenged the emperor over policy, but restrained him by invoking the ideal Confucian mores {{and values of the}} literati gentry class from which they came.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{was annoyed}} {{at the way}} that Royle, a Royal Navy officer, communicated {{directly}} with the Admiralty; he was also aware that Royle had been critical of SWPA's command arrangements, and of some of <b>his</b> <b>decisions.</b> MacArthur proposed that an Australian officer, Captain John Collins, replace Royle as CNS, an appointment that Carpender also supported. Over the Admiralty's objections, Curtin appointed Collins to replace Crutchley as Commander, Task Force 44, in June 1944, at the rank of commodore, with the intention that Collins would replace Royle when his term expired. This did not occur, because Collins was seriously wounded in Leyte Gulf on 21 October 1944.|$|E
50|$|After announcing <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> to {{transfer}} from Drake, Rice narrowed down his options between Illinois, Xavier, Memphis, and Marquette. Rice said of <b>his</b> <b>decision</b> {{to sign with}} Illinois, that John Groce had previously recruited him while Groce was still coach at Ohio University which contributed to his commitment.|$|R
