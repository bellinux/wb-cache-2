Against the literature and the linguistic atlases according to which the <b>form</b> <b>o</b> is general in Moldavia, our corpus study has revealed that the forms a and au are also used alongside the <b>form</b> <b>o,</b> {{under the influence of the}} standard language; moreover, the <b>form</b> <b>o</b> shows a tendency towards specialization for contexts with multiple cliticization. Our analysis—which contributes to the understanding of the phonology-morphology interface—can be extended to the study of other regional varieties of Romanian...|$|R

40|$|This study focus {{reliability}} and validity of a Japanese version of the "attitudes towards the physicvlly challenged" (ATPC) <b>Form</b> <b>O.</b> <b>Form</b> <b>O</b> measures the affective attitude component of the views towards the physically challenged and contains 20 statements to be responded to in a six-point range. A convenience sample of 154 physiotherapists in Fukui Prefecture participated in this mailed survey. The reliability of <b>Form</b> <b>O</b> was assessed as homogeneity; and its validity as construct validity. The rate of return was 47. 5 %. All but 1 of the 20 items were found to have significant item-total correlations. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for <b>Form</b> <b>O</b> was 0. 76 with some evidence for construct validity, which explained 30. 9 % of the variance. The obtained factors were labelled as "prejudice", "differing view" and "self-concept" with the rate of contribution (Cronbach's alpha) being 20. 27 % (0. 73), 6. 41 % (0. 66), and 4. 25 % (0. 69), respectively. Evidence for construct validity was demonstrated in <b>Form</b> <b>O's</b> ability to differentiate between genders and also between physiotherapists who preferred treating clients with conditions or diseases that would lead to permanent disability and those who preferred treating clients with conditions or diseases that would lead to a full recovery. Convergent validity, as a form of construct validity, was also supported for <b>Form</b> <b>O.</b> The results show that <b>Form</b> <b>O</b> can be considered a reliable and valid measure of documenting trends of importance in regards to the physically challenged.
