30|$|Movement of the {{permeant}} substrate ions {{through a}} channel {{is driven by}} (and thus consumes) the transmembrane electrochemical potential of the substrates, including components of the membrane potential ∆ΨM (≡Ψin[*]−Ψout) and/or concentration gradient of the substrate ions. The concentration gradient is commonly represented as the Nernst potential, VN (≡(RT/zF)·ln([S]in/[S]out), where z is the charge valent of the substrate ion, and RT/F[*]≈[*] 25  mV at 20  °C). Therefore, the overall effective transmembrane voltage, ∆Ψ′ (≡∆ΨM[*]+[*]VN), represents the sole energy source <b>driving</b> <b>substrate</b> movement in nearly all ion channels.|$|E
30|$|In the {{currently}} prevailing “switch model” of transport action (Fig.  1) (Jones et al., 2009), the NBDs form a compact dimer upon ATP binding. Through a tweezer-like movement, {{formation of the}} ATP-bound NBD dimer drives a “clothes peg”-like movement of the TMD dimer, switching from the CIn state to the COut state. This “clothes peg”-like movement of the TMD dimer is conceptually similar to the rocker-switch mechanism of MFS transporters. The bound ATP molecules are then hydrolyzed, resulting in (partial) dissociation of the NBD dimer and release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). In this model, binding of ATP provides the “power stroke” <b>driving</b> <b>substrate</b> transport, while ATP hydrolysis is required to reset the transport cycle to CIn (often {{referred to as a}} resting state). Despite an established consensus on the sequence of these conformational changes, the precise mechanisms responsible for the coupling of energy to the actual substrate transport remain elusive at best.|$|E
40|$|Iso{{penicillin}} N synthase (IPNS) is a nonheme iron(II) -dependent oxidase that catalyses {{the central}} step in penicillin biosynthesis, {{conversion of the}} tripeptide delta-L-alpha-aminoadipoyl-L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) to isopenicillin N (IPN). This report describes mechanistic studies using the analogue delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipoyl) -(3 S-methyl) -L-cysteine D-alpha-hydroxyisovaleryl ester (A(S) mCOV), designed to intercept the catalytic cycle at an early stage. A(S) mCOV incorporates two modifications from the natural substrate: {{the second and third}} residues are joined by an ester, so this analogue lacks the key amide of ACV and cannot form a beta-lactam; and the cysteinyl residue is substituted at its beta-carbon, bearing a (3 S) -methyl group. It was anticipated that this methyl group will impinge directly on the site in which the co-substrate dioxygen binds. The novel depsipeptide A(S) mCOV was prepared in 13 steps and crystallised with IPNS anaerobically. The 1. 65 A structure of the IPNS-Fe(II) -A(S) mCOV complex reveals that the additional beta-methyl group is not oriented directly into the oxygen binding site, but does increase steric demand in the active site and increases disorder in the position of the isovaleryl side chain. Crystals of IPNS-Fe(II) -A(S) mCOV were incubated with high-pressure oxygen gas, <b>driving</b> <b>substrate</b> turnover to a single product, an ene-thiol/C-hydroxylated depsipeptide. A mechanism is proposed for the reaction of A(S) mCOV with IPNS, linking this result to previous crystallographic studies with related depsipeptides and solution-phase experiments with cysteine-methylated tripeptides. This result demonstrates that a (3 S) -methyl group at the substrate cysteinyl beta-carbon is not in itself a block to IPNS activity as previously proposed, and sheds further light on the steric complexities of IPNS catalysis...|$|E

These injected drugs block ATP synthase, uncouple the oxygen consumption from ATP synthesis, and block mitochondrial complexes I and III, respectively.

40|$|Clostridium botulinum {{neurotoxins}} are {{the most}} potent toxins to humans. The recognition and cleavage of SNAREs are prime evente in exhibiting their toxicity. We report here the crystal structure of the catalytically active full-length botulinum serotype E catalytic domain (BoNT E) in complex with SNAP- 25 (a SNARE protein) substrate peptide Arg 180 -Ile 181 -Met 182 -Glu 183 (P 1 –P 3 ′). It is remarkable that the peptide spanning the scissile bond binds to but bypasses cleavage by the enzyme and inhibits the catalysis fairly with Ki ∼ 69 μm. The inhibitory peptide occupies the active site of BoNT E and shows well defined electron density. The catalytic zinc and the conserved key residue Tyr 350 of the enzyme facilitate the docking of Arg 180 (P 1) by interacting with its carbonyl oxygen that displaces the nucleophilic water. The general base Glu 212 side chain interacts with the main chain amino group of P 1 and P 1 ′. Conserved Arg 347 of BoNT E stabilizes the proper docking of the Ile 181 (P 1 ′) main chain, whereas the hydrophobic pockets stabilize the side chains of Ile 181 (P 1 ′) and Met 182 (P 2 ′), and the 250 loop stabilizes Glu 183 (P 3 ′). Structural and functional analysis revealed an important role for the P 1 ′ residue and S 1 ′ pocket in <b>driving</b> <b>substrate</b> recognition and docking at the active site. This study {{is the first of}} its kind and rationalizes the substrate cleavage strategy of BoNT E. Also, our complex structure opens up an excellent opportunity of structure-based drug design for this fast acting and extremely toxic high priority BoNT E...|$|E

The protonmotive force in respiring cells was estimated at 211 mV for S. aureus and 230 mV for E. coli at external pH values of approximately 6. 5.

50|$|The first crystal {{structure}} of the PTP1B catalytic domain revealed that the catalytic site exists within a deep cleft of the protein formed by three loops including the WPD loop with the Asp181 residue, a pTyr loop with the Tyr46 residue and a Q loop with the Gln262 residue. The pTyr loop and Tyr46 residue are located {{on the surface of}} the protein, and thus help to determine the depth a substrate can obtain within the cleft. This acts as a means of <b>driving</b> selectivity, as <b>substrates</b> containing smaller phosphoresidues cannot reach the site of catalytic activity at the base of the cleft. Upon substrate binding, PTP1B undergoes a structural modification in which the WPD loop closes around the substrate, introducing stabilizing pi stacking interactions between the aromatic rings of the phosphotyrosine (pTyr) substrate residue and the Phe182 residue on the WPD loop.|$|R
40|$|A dataset of 21 study {{reaches in}} the Porter and Kowai rivers (eastern {{side of the}} South Island), and 13 study reaches in Camp Creek and {{adjacent}} catchments (western side of the South Island) {{was used to examine}} downstream hydraulic geometry of mountain streams in New Zealand. Streams in the eastern and western regions both exhibit well-developed downstream hydraulic geometry, as indicated by strong correlations between channel top width, bankfull depth, mean velocity, and bankfull discharge. Exponents for the hydraulic geometry relations are similar to average values for rivers worldwide. Factors such as colluvial sediment input to the channels, colluvial processes along the channels, tectonic uplift, and discontinuous bedrock exposure along the channels might be expected to complicate adjustment of channel geometry to downstream increases in discharge. The presence of well-developed downstream hydraulic geometry relations despite these complicating factors is interpreted to indicate that the ratio of hydraulic <b>driving</b> forces to <b>substrate</b> resisting forces is sufficiently large to permit channel adjustment to relatively frequent discharges...|$|R
40|$|Nature uses thioredoxin-like folds {{in several}} {{disulfide}} bond oxidoreductases. Each {{of them has}} a typical active site Cys-X-X-Cys sequence motif, the hallmark of thioredoxin being Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys. The intriguing role of the highly conserved proline in the ubiquitous reducing agent thioredoxin was studied by site-specific mutagenesis of Staphylococcus aureus thioredoxin (Sa_Trx). We present X-ray structures, redox potential, pK(a), steady-state kinetic parameters, and thermodynamic stabilities. By replacing the central proline to a threonine/serine, no extra hydrogen bonds with the sulphur of the nucleophilic cysteine are introduced. The only structural {{difference is that the}} immediate chemical surrounding of the nucleophilic cysteine becomes more hydrophilic. The pK(a) value of the nucleophilic cysteine decreases with approximately one pH unit and its redox potential increases with 30 mV. Thioredoxin becomes more oxidizing and the efficiency to catalyse substrate reduction (k(cat) /K(M)) decreases sevenfold relative to wild-type Sa_Trx. The oxidized form of wild-type Sa_Trx is far more stable than the reduced form over the whole temperature range. The driving force to reduce substrate proteins is the relative stability of the oxidized versus the reduced form Delta(T(1 / 2)) (ox/red). This driving force is decreased in the Sa_Trx P 31 T mutant. Delta(T(1 / 2)) (ox/red) drops from 15. 5 degrees C (wild-type) to 5. 8 degrees C (P 31 T mutant).

While phasic activity is a characteristic feature of REMS, the neural <b>substrates</b> <b>driving</b> this activity remain unresolved. Here we investigated the neural circuits underlying masseter (jaw) phasic activity during REMS. The trigeminal motor nucleus (Mo 5), which controls masseter motor function, receives glutamatergic inputs mainly from the parvocellular reticular formation (PCRt), but also from the adjacent paramedian reticular area (PMnR). On the other hand, the Mo 5 and PCRt do not receive direct input from the sublaterodorsal (SLD) nucleus, a brainstem region critical for REMS atonia of postural muscles. We hypothesized that the PCRt-PMnR, but not the SLD, regulates masseter phasic activity during REMS. Methodology/Principal Findings: To test our hypothesis, we measured masseter electromyogram (EMG), neck muscle EMG, electrooculogram (EOG) and EEG in rats with cell-body specific lesions of the SLD, PMnR, and PCRt. Bilateral lesions of the PMnR and rostral PCRt (rPCRt), but not the caudal PCRt or SLD, reduced and eliminated REMS phasic activity of the masseter, respectively.

40|$|AbstractCross-talk between hormone {{signaling}} pathways provides {{mechanisms to}} facilitate {{flexibility in the}} cellular response to extracellular conditions. One function of insulin is to signal high extracellular glucose, while leptin may signal the abundance of extracellular lipid, both energy sources being readily utilized by muscle. The present study reports early signaling events in the insulin and leptin cascades in primary bovine myogenic cells (BMC). BMC were treated with insulin, or leptin for 1, 10, 30 and 120 min, or pretreated with leptin for 10 min followed by insulin for 1, 10, 30 and 120 min. BMC were insulin resistant, showing a significant inhibition of IRS- 1 association with the insulin receptor (IR) following insulin stimulation, a corresponding increase in PI 3 -kinase association with the IR, and a slow and modest increase in GLUT 4 recruitment to the plasma membrane. Pretreatment of BMC for 10 min leptin, followed by insulin time-course, caused IRS- 1 recruitment to be unresponsive, but evoked a rapid, phasic response of PI 3 -kinase recruitment to the IR and abrogated the response of GLUT 4 translocation to the plasma membrane evoked by insulin alone. The lack of insulin response was independent of IR abundance or affinity. JAK- 2 association with the ObR and JAK- 2 tyrosine phosphorylation were responsive to all three treatments. Insulin alone down-regulated the leptin signaling pathway, JAK- 2 association with ObR decreased at all time-points, and JAK- 2 phosphorylation decreased similarly. Leptin alone also appeared to down-regulate JAK- 2 association with the ObR, but stimulated the down-regulated pathway to signal, JAK- 2 tyrosine phosphorylation being increased at later time-points. Pretreatment with leptin followed by insulin time-course showed marked up-regulation of the early leptin signaling pathway, JAK- 2 association with the ObR being increased by insulin while JAK- 2 tyrosine phosphorylation was also increased. The contrasting responses of BMC to insulin alone, leptin alone and the sequential leptin–insulin treatment may point {{to the ability of}} these cells to respond to energy substrate availability, as bovine muscle has evolved to utilize lipids and fatty acids in response to a metabolism which provides only limited glucose. This cross-talk between insulin and leptin signaling pathways points {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms <b>driving</b> energy <b>substrate</b> utilization in ruminant muscle and may provide a useful model for greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes in man...|$|R

40|$|Drug {{addiction}} {{is a major}} global health problem, persisting {{due to a lack}} of effective treatments. This is largely due to insufficient understanding of the pathophysiology and neural circuitry underlying the progression of a healthy individual into drug addiction. Rodent models of cocaine addiction implicate the activity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the progression to addiction. MSNs of the NAc can be classified as dopamine receptor D 1 or D 2 expressing neurons, and cocaine exposure has previously been shown to induce many changes in these two cells types, including differential modifications of dendritic spine densities. While the neural <b>substrates</b> <b>driving</b> these changes remains unknown, these changes are likely due to synaptic changes driven by the neural adaptation in the regions upstream of the NAc in response to cocaine administration. Therefore, we seek to determine whether major excitatory projections to the NAc MSNs exhibit changes during the progression to addiction. In particular, previous work has shown the basolateral amygdala (BLA), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the ventral hippocampus (VH) projections to the NAc as facilitating behavioral aspects of addiction. We utilized a method of monosynaptic retrograde tracing using an EnvA pseudotyped rabies virus that would allow us to label neurons in these areas that directly project to MSNs. The effect of cocaine on spine density was measured in multiple stages: initial use (5 days of cocaine exposure), withdrawal (5 days of cocaine followed by 2 week withdrawal period without cocaine), and relapse (5 days of cocaine followed by a single cocaine reinstatement shot at the end of 2 week withdrawal). Here, we characterize the distinct effects of cocaine exposure on dendritic modifications in a projection-, cell type-, and stage-specific manner. Our findings suggest cocaine differentially alters spine densities on neurons in brain areas that send excitatory projections to NAc MSNs. These neuroanatomical results establish a framework to further understand the circuit-basis of progression to drug addiction...|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} the decay stage of coarse woody debris (CWD) a five decay-class {{system has been}} introduced and it is currently the most commonly applied. This system is based on visual, geometric and tactile features of the wood in the field; however, a detailed chemical characterization is often missing. Furthermore, the <b>driving</b> mechanisms (particularly <b>substrate</b> quality vs. environmental conditions) of deadwood decay are controversially discussed. Consequently, we investigated how typical major and minor chemical parameters of wood were correlated with the decay stage. The decomposition patterns of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) and European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) CWD of an Alpine setting were analyzed, and how the chemical and physical parameters were affected by the substrate and environmental conditions was checked. Two altitudinal sequences, having a different exposure (north- vs. south-facing sites), were sampled. We measured main biochemical compounds (lignin and cellulose), physical properties (density and water content), element concentrations (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn), and the carbon isotopic signature (δ 13 C) of living trees and CWD at five decomposition stages (decay classes). Most investigated wood physico-chemical parameters such as wood density, water content, lignin and cellulose and even minor constituents (N, Ca, Mg, P, Fe, Mn) correlated well to the five decay-class system. Some important components, such as the carbon concentration and δ 13 C, did not vary with increasing decomposition. Our hypothesis that the different substrate should be traceable during CWD decay had to be rejected, although some statistically significant chemical differences between larch and spruce were measured in the living trees. The chosen tree species were probably not different enough to be chemically traceable in the CWD. Already in decay class 1, these differences were zeroed.

Cell transplantation therapies are promising alternatives to conventional auto-, allo-, and xenograft therapies. Successfully delivering stem and progenitor cells to the defect site requires biomaterials that support and guide reconstruction. Biomaterial functionalization with extracellular matrix derivatives to improve adhesion and guide tissue regeneration lacks specificity towards particular regenerative cell populations. In order to direct cell specific adhesion to specific biomaterial surface chemistries, we used a combinatorial phage display strategy to identify 2 sequences, 1 with high affinity towards apatite (VTK) and a second with high affinity to clonally derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from human bone marrow stroma (DPI) and combined the two sequences into a dual-functioning peptide (DPI-VTK). Dual-functioning peptide DPI-VTK exhibited greater apatite binding compared to single peptide controls (p < 0. 01). Mesenchymal stem cells on DPI-VTK coated apatite substrates exhibited greater adhesion strength compared to pre-osteoblasts and fibroblasts (p < 0. 01). DPI-VTK also increased MSC spreading (p < 0. 001) and proliferation (p < 0. 001) compared to apatite controls while supporting differentiation on apatite substrates. Competitive inhibition revealed RGD-binding integrin involvement in MSC attachment to DPI-VTK. MSC driven bone formation, cellularity and vascularization in a subcutaneous mouse model were greater on DPI-VTK coated PLGA-mineral composite scaffolds compared to VTK (p < 0. 017) and uncoated controls (p < 0. 001) and acellular peptide-coated controls (p < 0. 002).
