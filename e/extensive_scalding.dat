40|$|Soil {{profiles}} in 10 persistently bare areas (i. e. scalds), mainly located in coastal backswamps of New South Wales, Australia, were examined for chromium-reducible sulfur content and selected chemical properties. At 5 of the sites, the adjacent paddocks with vegetation cover were also examined. All of the tested sites had {{been affected by}} the extensive drainage of the surrounding acid sulfate soil (ASS) landscapes and the consequent oxidation of pyrite. All sites had low pH values in the surface soil layers and these low pH values extended for up to 150 cm into the underlying unoxidised blue/grey pyritic estuarine gels. This {{can be attributed to the}} downward diffusion of acidity, either produced in the overlying oxidised zones of these soils or transported laterally across the landscape to these low-lying areas. Acidified unoxidised pyritic zones 120 cm thick can evidently form within several decades after drainage disturbance. At the scalded sites the depth from the soil surface to the main pyritic zone varied from the surface to 3 ̆e 200 cm depth, indicating that this variable is not critical to ASS scald formation. For most of the sites examined, the chromium-reducible sulfur contents in the surface soil layers were appreciably higher than those in the immediately underlying soil layers. In most of the vegetated sites the chromium-reducible sulfur content in the surface layers was considerably higher than for the adjacent scalded site. The conditions necessary for pyrite formation (i. e. adequate supplies of organic matter, soluble iron, sulfate, and waterlogging) were found to exist at all sites, and the pyrite accumulations in these surface soil layers are considered to be neo-formed. The vegetated soil-profile pyrite and pH results were very similar to their scalded counterparts except that they had an extra 20 – 40 cm layer of vegetation and mulch that was missing from the scalded profiles. This indicates that there is considerable potential for more <b>extensive</b> <b>scalding</b> in these ASS areas...|$|E
