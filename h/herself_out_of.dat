5|$|Alfre Woodard {{was cast}} as Lily Sloane, Cochrane's assistant. When Frakes {{first moved to}} Los Angeles, Woodard {{was one of the}} first people he met. During a {{conversation}} at a barbecue, Woodard said she would become Frakes' godmother, as he did not have one. Through this relationship, Frakes was able to cast Woodard in the film; he considered it a coup to land an Academy Award-nominated actress. Woodard considered Lily to be the character most like <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all the roles she has played.|$|E
5|$|The Judy Garland Show was an American musical variety {{television}} series that aired on CBS on Sunday nights during the 1963-1964 television season. Despite a sometimes stormy relationship with Judy Garland, CBS had found success with several television specials featuring the star. Garland, {{who for years}} had been reluctant to commit to a weekly series, saw the show as her best chance to pull <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> severe financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E

5|$|On May 3, Helen Reed {{is seen by}} the Phantom {{leaving a}} grocery store. At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks through the screen door and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house and into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe, but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E
5|$|Lexie {{continues}} to harbor romantic feelings for George, {{oblivious to the}} fact that he doesn't see her in the same way. Their relationship is a mirror foil of George's previous infatuation with the oblivious Meredith. She prioritizes helping George study over taking part in a surgery with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), but feels betrayed when George doesn't request that she become one of his interns after passing his exam. Finally realizing that he doesn't feel the same way, Lexie gives up on her feelings for George and the pair's friendship begins to fizzle out. She later begins a flirtation with Mark, and the pair begin an unlikely romantic relationship, though they are forced to keep it a secret when Meredith and Derek warn Mark away from Lexie. Lexie discovers that some of her fellow interns have secretly been performing simple procedures on each other and begins taking part to prove she's hardcore. Sadie Harris (Melissa George) joins the society, and seeking a more daring procedure, suggests removing her appendix. Though Lexie agrees, she quickly finds <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her depth, resulting in Meredith and Cristina having to intervene to save Sadie's life. Lexie and the other interns are put on probation. Derek finds Lexie distraught at the day's events, and allows her to move into the attic at his and Meredith's house. Mark comes clean to Derek about his relationship with Lexie, resulting in the two men getting into a fist fight. The pair continue to feud, resulting in Lexie beginning to stress eat until they eventually reconcile. Lexie is delighted when Meredith asks her to be a bridesmaid at her and Derek's wedding, though they eventually give the ceremony to Alex and cancer-stricken Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl). Mark decides to purchase a house and invites Lexie to move in with him, however she declines, concerned about how fast their relationship is progressing.|$|E

25|$|Ally is a tactless {{woman with}} good {{intentions}} who unfortunately {{is a perfect example}} of someone with foot-in-mouth syndrome.

25|$|Ashleigh nearly talked <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{being named}} the winner {{when she gave}} an unfocused answer as to what she {{intended}} {{to do with the}} prize fund. By contrast, Lucy told Lord Sugar that she wanted to develop her existing part-time catering business. Ultimately though, this was not enough to prevent Ashleigh's victory.|$|E
25|$|In a {{surprising}} and unexpected decision, Majida {{announced that she}} has pulled <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the project. She said that the producer, Quincy Jones, did not meet her conditions and the team supervising and overlooking the project is not professional. Majida already put her voice on the operate, but when they asked her to record again in Qatar, she announced her withdrawal and waived her authorship rights when she {{backed out of the}} project.|$|E

25|$|Beginning with My Name Is Barbra, {{her early}} albums were often medley-filled keepsakes of her {{television}} specials. Starting in 1969, she began attempting more contemporary material, {{but like many}} talented singers of the day, she found <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her element with rock. Her vocal talents prevailed, and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented Richard Perry-produced album Stoney End in 1971. The title track, written by Laura Nyro, was a major hit for Streisand.|$|E
25|$|Relativity and {{ambiguity}} {{are prominent}} {{ideas in the}} play, and the audience is challenged to come to conclusions about the ambivalent nature {{of many of the}} characters. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra can easily be read as one of love or lust; their passion can be construed as being wholly destructive but also showing elements of transcendence. Cleopatra might be said to kill <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> love for Antony, or because she has lost political power. Octavius can be seen as either a noble and good ruler, only wanting what is right for Rome, or as a cruel and ruthless politician.|$|E
25|$|In October, Loos and {{her brother}} Clifford checked Emerson into a very {{expensive}} sanatorium, where {{he was diagnosed with}} schizophrenia. Loos, who had always left the finances to Emerson, soon discovered that most of her money was no longer in joint accounts but in his own private accounts. Overworked at the studio and under stress from Emerson, she became more and more depressed. After 17 years of his nonsense, she finally asked Emerson for a divorce, and he agreed. Loos promptly bought <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her United Artists contract and re-signed with MGM, and bought a beach-front house in Santa Monica. Emerson would continue to find ways to stave off any talk of divorce plans, making finalization impossible. When Emerson was deemed well enough to leave the sanatorium, she paid for a nurse to care for him in an apartment of his own.|$|E

Justine is building a powerful deck of Tarot cards which will allow her to control the fate of the world {{with the help of the}} goddess Kali, who, in return, wants ultimate peace on Earth.

Buffy must figure out how her friends are being controlled and find a way to fight <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the power of Justine's Tarot cards.|$|E

In the secondary story, Mongul frees himself of Mother Mercy's vines after being imprisoned in Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, issue #26 (September 2008). Ravenous after his imprisonment, he destroys a space craft belonging to newlyweds Kered and Miri Riam (on their way to their honeymoon) in order to ransack it for food. Kered approaches Mongul to ask him to spare their jet packs and enough food for them to find help. In response, Mongul cracks the face plate of Kered's pressure suit, killing him. After Mongul leaves, Miri drifts in space alone for two days before deciding to kill <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> grief. Before she is able to complete her suicide, a violet power ring finds her and offers to fill the hole in her heart with violet light.

500|$|Dugdale, who {{had joined}} the Labour Party in 2004 {{after graduating from the}} University of Aberdeen, was elected as an MSP for the Lothian region in 2011 and later {{appointed}} to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Health Minister. She quickly ruled <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> running for the leadership, but told the Edinburgh Evening News that she would consider entering a deputy leadership contest, describing herself as a [...] "sidekick, not a superhero". She also spoke of her intention to serve no more than three terms in Parliament. Like Murphy, she secured the backing of the Community trade union. She was also endorsed by the Scottish Co-Operative Party.|$|E

500|$|Following Obama's {{victory in}} the 2008 presidential election, CNN {{reported}} that Pritzker was president-elect Obama's top choice for Commerce Secretary. However, Pritzker took <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the running. According to the Chicago Tribune, she withdrew her name from consideration [...] "due to obligations to her family, for whom she was still overseeing billions in assets, and the financial crisis, which was putting some of those assets at risk". As {{a result of her}} public support for President Obama, Pritzker found herself the target of labor groups for Hayatt Hotels' practices. The president of Unite Here cited her connection to Obama as a reason why the group expected her to use better labor practices as the group staged demonstrations against Pritzker.|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{successful}} media blitz, she quickly became a household name. In 1960, Mansfield topped press polls for more words in print {{than anyone else in}} the world, made more personal appearances than a political candidate, and was regarded as the world's most-photographed Hollywood celebrity. She made news on a regular basis, from dresses falling off, to clothing that burst strategically at the seams, to low cut dresses worn without a bra. Things started to get over the top, even by her standards, when she took charge of her own publicity without advice. According to Shiffrin, [...] "She became a freak." [...] James Bacon wrote in the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner in 1973, [...] "Here was a girl with real comedy talent, spectacular figure and looks and yet ridiculed <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business by outlandish publicity." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics, which discuss escapism, are {{constructed}} {{in a way}} resemblant of nursery rhymes. During the chorus, Ellis-Bextor sings [...] "It's just my imagination / Running away / Girl's gotta have a little daydream / It's a secret escape / It's just my imagination / Running away / Don't worry baby, I'm here to stay". Considine highlighted [...] "I could tie up the bed sheets and slide down the house / Be gone before the morning comes" [...] as lyrics exemplificative of Ellis-Bextor's [...] "artistic freedom" [...] in Wanderlust. Reviewing the song for Loud and Quiet, Stuart Stubbs wrote that it [...] "sees our protagonist pull <b>herself</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> squalor and onto a road of self discovery." [...] The song concludes with a short outro where Ellis-Bextor repeats the line [...] "Don't worry baby, I'm here to stay" [...] twice.|$|E
