5|$|The neck of Tyrannosaurus rex {{formed a}} natural S-shaped curve {{like that of}} other theropods, but was short and muscular to support the massive head. The forelimbs had only two clawed <b>fingers,</b> <b>along</b> with an {{additional}} small metacarpal representing the remnant of a third digit. In contrast the hind limbs were among the longest in proportion to body size of any theropod. The tail was heavy and long, sometimes containing over forty vertebrae, in order to balance the massive head and torso. To compensate for the immense bulk of the animal, many bones throughout the skeleton were hollow, reducing its weight without significant loss of strength.|$|E
500|$|Suddenly embarrassed, the Tramp {{starts to}} shuffle away, {{but the girl}} steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes hold {{of his hand and}} presses the coin into it. As she closes his palm she stops abruptly; her smile turns to a look of puzzlement. She runs her <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then catches her breath: [...] "You?" [...] The Tramp nods with an {{uncertain}} smile and asks, [...] "You can see now?" [...] The girl replies, [...] "Yes, I can see now" [...] and tearfully pulls his hand to her bosom. The uncertainty on the Tramp's face turns to joy as the film fades to black.|$|E
500|$|There are two {{shooting}} modes: Precision and Slingshot. In Precision, players {{control the}} shot by sliding their <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> {{the bottom of}} the screen, which calculates the arc and direction of the shot. In Slingshot, like Angry Birds, players draw back their shots like slingshots. The shot grows in power the longer the screen is held, and the shot is fired when the player lets go. Weak shots will also arc down with gravity, and strong shots will decrease in power if held too long. There are no power-ups, no gamified micropayments, and no pause function, but there are achievements such as living to see the end of the universe. It also integrates [...] "pro-social" [...] features like GameCenter and Twitter.|$|E

2500|$|Since Braille {{is one of}} the few writing systems where tactile {{perception}} is used, as opposed to visual perception, a braille reader must develop new skills. [...] One skill important for Braille readers is the ability to create smooth and even pressures when running one's <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> the words. [...] There are many different styles and techniques used for the understanding and development of braille, even though a study by B. F. Holland suggests that there is no specific technique that is superior to any other.|$|E

60|$|The {{scientific}} manager {{got up on}} {{his feet}} rather awkwardly. He ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> his collar thoughtfully, and moved his head to and fro several times.|$|E
60|$|Having {{taken his}} leave {{of the friends}} who had flocked about him with the {{observation}} {{that he had a}} long journey before him, he called for the axe, and, when presented to him, ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> the edge, and smiled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurt me? no," [...] said Tom, {{putting up}} the hooks again, {{taking out a}} large pocket-knife, and slowly opening the largest blade, which he looked at meditatively as he rubbed his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> it. Then he added,-- ...|$|R
50|$|It {{arises from}} the {{convexity}} of the hamulus of the hamate bone, and contiguous portion of the transverse carpal ligament; it is inserted into the whole length of the metacarpal bone of the little <b>finger,</b> <b>along</b> its ulnar margin.|$|R
50|$|Moving the crossed {{index and}} middle <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> an edge evokes the {{perception}} of two parallel edges. Similarly, if a person crosses their index and middle finger and then rolls a marble between {{the tips of the}} fingers, two marbles are perceived.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here it is," [...] {{she whispered}} joyously, [...] "here {{it has been}} all the time." [...] Running her <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> the molding until she found a little hidden spring, she pushed it, {{and one of the}} great panels swung slowly in, {{revealing}} the yawning mouth of a black opening behind.|$|E

60|$|The next {{instant he}} was {{kneeling}} {{on the floor and}} his hands were wandering over the small, irregular flagstones immediately underneath the table. Marguerite had risen to her feet; she watched her husband with intent and puzzled eyes; she saw him suddenly pass his slender <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> a crevice between two flagstones, then raise one of these slightly and from beneath it extract a small bundle of papers, each carefully folded and sealed. Then he replaced the stone and once more rose to his knees.|$|E
6000|$|... "For awhile. Until {{they get}} {{reinforcements}} {{from some other}} area." [...] Tasso began to clean {{the interior of the}} gun with a bit of rag. She finished and pushed the mechanism back into place. She closed the gun, running her <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> the barrel.|$|R
6000|$|Helen ran {{the point}} of her slim <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> the sketch until it reached a tiny dormer window in the {{left-hand}} corner, half-hidden by an irregular chimney-stack. The curtains were closely drawn. Keeping her finger upon the spot, she said, interrogatively, [...] "And you saw THAT window?" ...|$|R
60|$|Crossing to the {{obviously}} tight window, {{he ran his}} <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> {{the edge}} of the sash with infinite care. He trembled. In a second, now, he had to turn and make light of the lips which he would fain have approached with ceremony pompous and lingering.|$|R
60|$|What strange {{business}} had he here {{among the dead}} that demanded such caution in its pursuit? Presently he advanced toward the pile of corpses. Quickly he tore open coats and searched pockets. He ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> the fingers of the dead. Two rings had rewarded his search and he was busy with a third that encircled the finger of a body that lay beneath three others. It would not come off. He pulled and tugged, and then he drew a knife from his pocket.|$|E
60|$|A lane, {{turning out}} of the highroad, {{a quarter of a}} mile this side of Gavrillac, led down to that ferry. By this lane some twenty minutes later came Andre-Louis with {{dragging}} feet. He avoided the little cottage of the ferryman, whose window was alight, and in the dark crept down to the boat, intending if possible to put himself across. He felt for the chain by which the boat was moored, and ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> this to the point where it was fastened. Here to his dismay he found a padlock.|$|E
60|$|He rose briskly {{from his}} chair, {{and went to}} the shelves, running his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> the books with that subtlety of touch by which the student knows a given book in the dark. He had heard Mrs. Ewbert {{stirring}} about in the rooms beyond with an activity in which he divined a menacing impatience; and he would have been glad to get rid of old Hilbrook before her impatience burst in an irruption upon them. Perhaps because of this distraction he could not find the book, but he remained on foot, talking with an implication in his tone that they were both preparing to part, and were now merely finishing off some odds and ends of discourse before they said good-night.|$|E
60|$|He feverishly ran a <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> {{the upper}} rim {{of his left}} ear, sprang up, stooped to take her hand, glared into her eyes till she shrank--and then a nail-cleaner, a common, ten-cent file, fell out of his inner pocket and clinked on the stone step.|$|R

6000|$|... "'For at dawn you die!'" [...] he {{repeated}} to himself, still smiling broadly. Then he crossed {{quickly to the}} fireplace, running his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> the edge {{of one of the}} large tiled panels that hid the entrance to the well-like shaft that rose from the cellars beneath to the towers above and which opened through similar concealed exits upon each floor. If the floor above should be untenanted {{he might be able to}} reach it as he and Joseph had done two years ago when they opened the secret panel in the fireplace and climbed a hidden ladder to the room overhead; and then by vacant corridors reached the far end of the castle above the suite in which the princess had been confined and near which Barney had every reason to believe she was now imprisoned.|$|E
60|$|Elsie, in the meantime, {{had left}} the house and crept round it on the grass until she reached a {{greenhouse}} built against {{one side of the}} drawing-room. The door was open, as she had expected, and, feeling for the edge of a flower-stand, she followed it up until she could crouch down beside the steps leading to a French window. It was closed but not latched, for when she ran her <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> the joint, she felt an aperture; but she dared not try to pull it open. Still, she could see in. The lamps had not been lighted, but an electric torch lay on the table and threw a ring of light on the opposite wall, two or three feet from the ground. The rest of the room was in darkness, but a dim illumination which spread beyond the bright beam showed two figures faintly.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was there}} that I saw him first, in a long low room taken upon the space {{of that sort of}} coach-house. It was bare and whitewashed, with a small square {{aperture}} glazed with one cracked, dusty pane at its further end. He was lying on his back upon a straw pallet; they had given him a couple of horse-blankets, and he seemed to have spent the remainder of his strength in the exertion of cleaning himself. He was almost speechless; his quick breathing under the blankets pulled up to his chin, his glittering, restless black eyes reminded me of a wild bird caught in a snare. While I was examining him, old Swaffer stood silently by the door, passing the tips of his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> his shaven upper lip. I gave some directions, promised to send a bottle of medicine, and naturally made some inquiries.|$|E
