40|$|Grain {{coarsening}} of alloys in the semi-solid {{state is}} important in controlling grain sizes in spray forming and in other processes in which an alloy is formed or cast in the semi-solid state. Until now, this coarsening has been analysed in terms of classic LSW theory or {{in terms of the}} migration of grain boundary liquid films. These analyses suggest that the coarsening rate should increase with increasing solid fraction, <b>f</b> <b>S,</b> but this suggestion conflicts with previous experimental results which show that coarsening rate decreases with increasing <b>f</b> <b>S</b> for <b>f</b> <b>S</b> > 0. 7. This paper shows, for the first time, that coarsening rate does increase with <b>f</b> <b>S</b> for <b>f</b> <b>S</b> less than approximately 0. 75 in agreement with the liquid film migration model, and then decreases again with further increasing <b>f</b> <b>S</b> for <b>f</b> <b>S</b> greater than approximately 0. 75. A modified model of liquid film migration is proposed which takes into account the reducing area of the liquid film as <b>f</b> <b>S</b> increases for high <b>f</b> <b>S.</b> The formation of intragranular liquid droplets, and the pinning of grain boundary liquid films by dispersoids during coarsening are also discussed. © 2002 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|To fully {{understand}} the carbon (C) cycle impacts of forest fires, both C emissions during the fire and post-disturbance fluxes need to be considered. The latter are dominated by soil surface CO 2 flux (<b>F</b> <b>s),</b> which is still subject to large uncertainties. Fire is generally regarded {{as the most important}} factor influencing succession in the boreal forest biome and fire dependant species such as jack pine are widespread. In May 2007, we took concurrent <b>F</b> <b>s</b> and soil temperature (T s) measurements in boreal jack pine fire scars aged between 0 and 59 years since fire. To allow comparisons between scars, we adjusted <b>F</b> <b>s</b> for T <b>s</b> (<b>F</b> <b>s</b> T) using a Q 10 of 2. Mean <b>F</b> <b>s</b> T ranged from 0. 56 (± 0. 30 sd) to 1. 94 (± 0. 74 sd) μmol CO 2 m − 2 s − 1. Our results indicate a difference in mean <b>F</b> <b>s</b> T between recently burned (4 to 8 days post fire) and non-burned mature (59 years since fire) forest (P < 0. 001), though no difference was detected between recently burned (4 to 8 days post fire) and non-burned young (16 years since fire) forest (P = 0. 785). There was a difference in mean <b>F</b> <b>s</b> T between previously young (16 years since fire) and intermediate aged (32 years since fire) scars that were both subject to fire in 2007 (P < 0. 001). However, {{there was no difference in}} mean <b>F</b> <b>s</b> T between mature (59 years since fire) and intermediate aged (32 years since fire) scars that were both subjected to fire in 2007 (P = 0. 226).

40|$|The recent {{advent of}} very high {{spectral}} resolution measurements by the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) on board the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) platform has made possible the retrieval of sun-induced terrestrial chlorophyll fluorescence (<b>F</b> <b>s)</b> on a global scale. The basis for this retrieval is the modeling of the in-filling of solar Fraunhofer lines by fluorescence. This contribution {{to the field of}} space-based carbon cycle science presents an alternative method for the retrieval of <b>F</b> <b>s</b> from the Fraunhofer lines resolved by GOSAT-FTS measurements. The method is based on a linear forward model derived by a singular vector decomposition technique, which enables a fast and robust inversion of top-of-atmosphere radiance spectra. Retrievals are performed in two spectral micro-windows (~ 2 - 3 nm width) containing several strong Fraunhofer lines. The statistical nature of this approach allows to avoid potential retrieval errors associated with the modeling of the instrument line shape or with a given extraterrestrial solar irradiance data set. The method has been tested on 22 consecutive months of global GOSAT-FTS measurements. The fundamental basis of this <b>F</b> <b>s</b> retrieval approach and the results from the analysis of the global <b>F</b> <b>s</b> data set produced with it are described in this work. Among other findings, the data analysis has shown (i) a very good comparison of <b>F</b> <b>s</b> intensity levels and spatial patterns with the state-of-the-art physically-based <b>F</b> <b>s</b> retrieval approach described in Frankenberg et al. (2011 a), (ii) the overall good agreement between <b>F</b> <b>s</b> annual and seasonal patterns and other space-based vegetation parameters, (iii) the need for a biome-dependent scaling from <b>F</b> <b>s</b> to gross primary production, and (iv) the apparent existence of strong directional effects in the <b>F</b> <b>s</b> emission from forest canopies.

40|$|Sediment {{transferring}} function (<b>F</b> <b>s)</b> {{of rivers}} is defined and indexed in this study, {{based on the}} concept of sediment budget at river reach scales. Then, study is made on the <b>F</b> <b>s</b> of the lower reaches of the Yellow River in relation to natural and human factors in the drainage basin, such as the annual precipitation in different water and sediment source areas, proportion of > 0. 05 mm sediment of the total sediment load to the lower reaches of Yellow River, the regulated degree of the "clear" baseflow from the drainage area above Lanzhou, frequency of hyperconcentrated flows, area of soil and water conservation measures in the drainage basin. As a result, a multiple regression equation has been established between <b>F</b> <b>s</b> and 7 influencing factors, with multiple correlation coefficient r = 0. 90. The reduction in annual precipitation in different water and sediment source areas has different effects on <b>F</b> <b>s.</b> The reduction in annual precipitation in the area above Hekou Town and the area between Longmen and Sanmenxia results in a reduction in <b>F</b> <b>s,</b> but the reduction in annual precipitation in the area between Hekou Town and Longmen results in an increase in <b>F</b> <b>s.</b> The grain size composition of sediment load strongly affects the F s; the larger the proportion of > 0. 05 mm sediment in the suspended sediment load entering the lower reaches of the Yellow River is, the lower the <b>F</b> <b>s</b> will be. Thus, if the Xiaolangdi Reservoir traps coarse sediment and releases fine sediment, <b>F</b> <b>s</b> will be enhanced. This study also shows that the lower the proportion of high-flow season river flow to the annual total river flow at Lanzhou Station is, the lower the <b>F</b> <b>s</b> will be.

40|$|The world 2 ̆ 7 s {{domestic}} cats carry {{patterns of}} sequence variation in their genome that reflect {{a history of}} domestication and breed development. A genetic assessment of 979 domestic cats and their wild progenitors- Felis silvestris silvestris (European wildcat), <b>F.</b> <b>s.</b> lybica (Near Eastern wildcat), <b>F.</b> <b>s.</b> ornata (central Asian wildcat), <b>F.</b> <b>s.</b> cafra (southern African wildcat), and <b>F.</b> <b>s.</b> bieti (Chinese desert cat) - indicated that each wild group represents a distinctive subspecies of Felis silvestris. Further analysis revealed that cats were domesticated in the Near East, probably coincident with agricultural village development in the Fertile Crescent. Domestic cats derive from at least five founders from across this region, whose descendants were transported across the world by human assistance...|$|R

We prove in particular that the complement of the <b>f.</b> <b>s.</b> set is context free, and consequently neither the class of <b>f.</b> <b>s.</b> sets (according to some definition) nor Szilard languages are closed {{with respect to the}} complement. After introducing new normal forms for Petri nets, we prove that the reachability problem is equivalent to the emptiness problem for the intersection of Szilard languages...|$|R
