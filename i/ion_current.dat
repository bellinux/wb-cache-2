Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions {{that had already been}} counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of silver/silver chloride sensors operation is {{the conversion of}} <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> at the surface of human tissues to electron current to be delivered through the lead wire to the instrument to read. An {{important part of the}} operation is electrolyte gel which is applied between the electrode and tissues. The gel contains free chloride ions such that the charge can be carried through the electrolyte, therefore the electrolyte can be considered as conductive for <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> as the human tissues. When the <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> exists, the silver atoms in the electrode oxidize and discharge cations to the electrolyte and the electrons carry charge through the lead wire. At the same time, the chloride ions which are anions in the electrolyte travel toward the electrode and they are reduced as they bond with silver of the electrode resulting in silver chloride and free electrons to deliver to the lead wire. The reaction allows current to pass from electrolyte to electrode and the electron current passes through the lead wire for the instrument to read.|$|E

If it is possible to do this with <b>ion</b> <b>currents</b> this can be used to detect if the sensor is broken, and then estimate the ethanol content until the sensor gets fixed. The benefit of using <b>ion</b> <b>currents</b> is that the signal is measured directly from the spark plug and therefore no extra hardware is needed. To be able to see how the ethanol ratio affects the <b>ion</b> <b>currents,</b> the dependencies of the operating point have been investigated. This has been done by a literature review and by measurements in a Saab 9 - 3. Engine speed, load, ignition timing, lambda and spark plugs effects on the <b>ion</b> <b>currents</b> are especially studied. A black box model for the <b>ion</b> <b>currents</b> dependence on operating point is developed.

25|$|Americium-241 is {{an alpha}} emitter with a {{half-life}} of 432.6 years. Alpha particle radiation, {{as opposed to}} beta (electron) and gamma (electromagnetic) radiation, is used for two additional reasons: alpha particles have high ionization, so sufficient air particles will be ionized for the current to exist, and they have low penetrative power, meaning they will be stopped, safely, by the plastic of the smoke detector or the air. About {{one percent of the}} emitted radioactive energy of 241Am is gamma radiation. The amount of elemental americium-241 is small enough to be exempt from the regulations applied to larger sources. It includes about 37kBq or 1µCi of radioactive element americium-241 (241Am), corresponding to about 0.3µg of the isotope.

2500|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) is {{an analytical}} technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of charged particles (ions). [...] Although {{there are many}} different kinds of mass spectrometers, all of them make use of electric or magnetic fields to manipulate the motion of ions produced from an analyte of interest and determine their m/z. The basic components of a mass spectrometer are the ion source, the mass analyzer, the detector, and the data and vacuum systems.The ion source is where the components of a sample introduced in a MS system are ionized by means of electron beams, photon beams (UV lights), laser beams or corona discharge. In the case of electrospray ionization, the ion source moves ions that exist in liquid solution into the gas phase. The ion source converts and fragments the neutral sample molecules into gas-phase ions that are sent to the mass analyzer. While the mass analyzer applies the electric and magnetic fields to sort the ions by their masses, the detector measures and amplifies the <b>ion</b> <b>current</b> [...] to calculate the abundances of each mass-resolved ion.

"December 2011 "Compact neutron interrogation systems are a good candidate for use in active interrogation systems when large scale active or passive interrogation systems are not ideal. Field emitter arrays and plasma ion sources could produce ion beams of deuterium or deuterium and tritium which strike a target doped with deuterium or deuterium and tritium, thus producing and interrogating neutron flux. Ion sources for accelerator neutron generators are being studied. Field emitters are simulated using different aspect ratios, cone angles, and base-to-base spacing to determine the changes in field enhancement factor and theoretical <b>ion</b> <b>currents.</b> The plasma <b>ion</b> source is tested to determine the most appropriate gas pressures, extraction voltages, aperture sizes and gap distances for extraction of the highest <b>ion</b> <b>currents</b> from the plasma.

40|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>currents</b> {{through three}} types of {{rectifying}} nanoporous structures are studied and compared for the first time: conically shaped polymer nanopores, glass nanopipettes, and silicon nitride nanopores. Time signals of <b>ion</b> <b>currents</b> are analyzed by power spectrum. We focus on the low-frequency range where the power spectrum magnitude scales with frequency, f, as 1 /f. Glass nanopipettes and polymer nanopores exhibit non-equilibrium 1 /f noise, thus the normalized power spectrum depends on the voltage polarity and magnitude. In contrast, 1 /f noise in rectifying silicon nitride nanopores is of equilibrium character. Various mechanisms underlying the voltage-dependent 1 /f noise are explored and discussed, including intrinsic pore wall dynamics, and formation of vortices and non-linear flow patterns in the pore. Experimental data are supported by modeling of <b>ion</b> <b>currents</b> based on the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier Stokes equations. We conclude that the voltage-dependent 1 /f noise observed in polymer and glass asymmetric nanopores might result from high and asymmetric electric fields inducing secondary effects in the pore such as enhanced water dissociation...|$|R
40|$|The {{thruster}} {{is designed}} so that <b>ion</b> <b>currents</b> to various internal surfaces can be measured directly; these measurements facilitate calculations {{of the distribution of}} <b>ion</b> <b>currents</b> inside the discharge chamber. Experiments are described suggesting that the distribution of <b>ion</b> <b>currents</b> inside the discharge chamber is strongly dependent on the shape and strength of the magnetic field but independent of the discharge current, discharge voltage, and neutral flow rate. Measurements of the energy cost per plasma ion suggest that this cost decreases with increasing magnetic field strength as a consequence of increased anode shielding from the primary electrons. Energy costs per argon plasma ion as low as 50 eV are measured. The energy cost per beam ion is found to be a function of the energy cost per plasma ion, extracted ion fraction, and discharge voltage. Part of the energy cost per beam ion has to do with creating many ions in the plasma and then extracting only a fraction of them into the beam. The balance of the energy goes into accelerating the remaining plasma ions into the walls of the discharge chamber...|$|R
