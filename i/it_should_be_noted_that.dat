5|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{the figure}} above for Chongqing's Administrative Area {{includes}} the entire Municipality of Chongqing whereas the City Population only counts the urbanized districts making up Chongqing city.

5|$|As with FreeBSD and OpenBSD, the {{developers}} of DragonFly BSD are slowly replacing K style C code with more modern, ANSI equivalents. Similar to other operating systems, DragonFly's {{version of the}} GNU Compiler Collection has an enhancement called the Stack-Smashing Protector (ProPolice) enabled by default, providing some additional protection against buffer overflow based attacks. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> , the kernel is no longer built with this protection by default.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> in the {{original}} Akkadian, Ú-a-a-te is {{used to refer to}} the first names of both Yauta ibn Hazail (son of Hazael) and Uayte ben Birdadda (son of Birdadda). The latter is also sometimes referred to as Ia-u-ta- and in the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, the two spellings were confused, with both written Ú-a-a-te. The transliteration of {{the original}} Akkadian into English is highly unstable and only some of the alternate spellings appear in this article.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the city}} is the most {{populated}} of Extremadura, it has a relatively low population density (102.30 hab/km²), due to the extension of its municipality, {{one of the largest}} in Spain, with an area of 1,470km². <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> in addition to the metropolitan centre the population includes districts, neighborhoods and towns with small populations, the most populous of which is Guadiana del Caudillo, which had 2,524 people as of 2012, but gained independence on 17 February 2012.|$|E
5|$|Camuston {{no longer}} exists as a village, but for {{location}} see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E

5|$|Individual {{contributions}} made up {{the most}} of the campaign cash that Tancredo received, making up about 97% of his total pocketbook. PAC contributions were comparably low, producing only around $75,500, of the $1,311,869. He granted himself $200 for the campaign and received no federal funding. $88,457 of his money came from interest from the campaign's bank accounts and loans from outside sources. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the majority of Tancredo's funds were not disclosed during the campaign As of September 30, 2007 the campaign raised $3,538,244 and spent $3,458,130, leaving only $110,079 cash on hand.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the {{relative}} atomic mass of the electron Ar(e) is measured relative to the mass of a carbon-12 atom (divided by 12). When the Avogadro constant {{is set in the}} new SI, atomic masses might be measured in dalton (by fixing the Avogadro constant), instead of atomic mass units (by fixing the mass of carbon-12), thus resulting in a difference between the values of {{the relative}} atomic mass and the atomic mass in units of dalton.|$|E
5|$|King's {{was ranked}} joint 14th overall in The Sunday Times 10-year (1998–2007) average ranking of British {{universities}} based on consistent league table performance. In recent years, however, {{the university has}} performed less well in domestic league tables, being placed outside of the top 20 in all three major tables for 2016. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the methodologies of these tables include student satisfaction scores with teaching and feedback as a significant input. In common with most other London institutions, King's performs less well on the National Student Survey (NSS), ranking 133rd for student satisfaction (out of 160 institutes) in the 2015 survey.|$|E

5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> unless {{a high quality}} source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E
5|$|The {{albatross}} diet {{is predominantly}} cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal (organ meat), although {{they will also}} scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season, when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible. The importance {{of each of these}} food sources varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.|$|E
5|$|The video had {{its world}} premiere on MTV during prime time on March 31, 1983 though <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> neither Beat It nor Billie Jean was, {{as is often}} claimed, the first music video by an African-American artist to be played on MTV. Soon after its premiere the video was also running on other video {{programs}} including BET's Video Soul, SuperStation WTBS's Night Tracks, and NBC's Friday Night Videos. In fact, Beat It was the first video shown on the latter's first ever telecast on July 29, 1983.|$|E

5|$|To the Muslims, Hajj is {{associated}} with religious {{as well as social}} significance. Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the obligation for performing this pilgrimage is only fulfilled if it is done on the eighth to twelfth day of the last month of the Islamic calendar. If in a given year, an adult Muslim is in good health and his life and wealth is safe, they must perform the Hajj in the same year. Delaying it is considered sinful unless the delay is caused by reasons beyond his/her control.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E
5|$|Older storms have {{incomplete}} pressure readings, {{since there}} were no satellite-based estimates; the only observations were taken by ships, land-based observations, or reconnaissance aircraft when available. Ava's minimum known pressure was measured {{when it was a}} Category4 hurricane, for example. John and Gilma have incomplete pressures because the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, in general, did not publish pressure on systems in the central Pacific (140°W to the dateline) at the time. However, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> this list is not identical to the list of most intense Pacific hurricanes. The most intense known Category4 storm in the eastern Pacific was 2014's Odile. The lowest pressure of this storm was 918 millibars, lower than that of some Category 5's, such as Guillermo.|$|E
