5000|$|In 2005, {{based on}} the S-197 Mustang, Roush {{introduced}} the Sport, Stage 1, and Stage 2 editions. In 2006, the [...] "Stage 3" [...] edition was introduced. The Sport package was the Roush base model, and came with a body kit and high-performance exhaust systems. The Stage 1 came with 18 in chrome wheels and aggressive tires, a high-performance exhaust system, a body kit, and a vast option menu of visual upgrades. The Stage 2 enhanced the Stage 1 by upgrading the stock suspension with high-performance front struts, rear shocks, front and rear springs, front and rear sway bars, and Pinion snubbers. The Stage 3 came with 18 in, forged chrome wheels and high-performance tires, and 14 in rotors with four-piston Stop-Tech produced calipers, in addition to numerous [...] "Stage 3" [...] plaques, custom embroidered leather upholstery, and a custom dash instrument cluster. The Eaton M90 supercharged 4.6 L V8 now had the output of 415 hp (268.4 kW) and 385 ft·lb (521 Nm) with a Roush supercharger and an air-to-water intercooler. The {{top of the line}} was the Stage 3 Mustang, but Roush recognized that many buyers did not want all the features (particularly cosmetic) that the Stage 3 offered, so beginning in 2007, Roush introduced the 427R. The 427R featured the same suspension, power-train, and most of the body-kit of the Stage 3, but it lacked the rear fascia and rectangular exhaust tips of the Stage 1-3 models. It produced an additional 20-horsepower (14.91 kW) and [...] of torque over the Stage 3 Mustang, due to an upgraded <b>ECM</b> (<b>Electronic</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Module).</b> In addition, it was equipped with a [...] "hockey stick stripe" [...] appearance package in lieu of the two racing stripes found on the Sport through Stage 3 models. In 2008, Roush produced the limited edition 428R Mustang (followed by the limited edition 429R Mustang in 2009), which was the same concept as the previous year's 427R, but featured a horizontal nine-bar grille, Sparco captive hood pins, and a chrome supercharger. Four and six-piston brakes were an option on both cars, but not standard. Also, in 2007 and 2008, Roush produced 100 per year of the all-black Blackjack Mustang, and the top shelf P-51A and P-51B mustangs. These cars featured a Vapor Silver / green paint scheme, accented with Satin Silver hood scoop, chin spoiler and rear wing (in a tribute to the P-51 Mustang fighter plane of WW-II). The engine internals were upgraded to a forged rotating assembly, allowing a larger Eaton TVS R2300 Roots supercharger. This produced 510 crank horsepower and 510 foot pounds of torque. The difference between the A and B models is the belt drive for the supercharger - the A series uses a single belt, the B series uses a dual-belt system Front-End Accessory Drive (FEAD). Other Roush cars produced in this era were the 2008-only Roush 427R TrakPak, with upgraded suspension components, forged wheels and large APC carbon fiber wing, Roush Drag-Pak Mustangs, and various one-offs for Cooper Tires and certain dealers of Roush products.|$|E

5000|$|A vital {{component}} of all diesel engines is a mechanical or electronic governor which regulates the idling speed and maximum {{speed of the}} engine by controlling the rate of fuel delivery. Unlike Otto-cycle engines, incoming air is not throttled and a diesel engine without a governor cannot have a stable idling speed and can easily overspeed, resulting in its destruction. Mechanically governed fuel injection systems are driven by the engine's gear train. [...] These systems {{use a combination of}} springs and weights to control fuel delivery relative to both load and speed. [...] Modern electronically controlled diesel engines control fuel delivery by use of an <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>module</b> (<b>ECM)</b> or <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> unit (ECU). The ECM/ECU receives an engine speed signal, as well as other operating parameters such as intake manifold pressure and fuel temperature, from a sensor and controls the amount of fuel and start of injection timing through actuators to maximise power and efficiency and minimise emissions. Controlling the timing of the start of injection of fuel into the cylinder is a key to minimizing emissions, and maximizing fuel economy (efficiency), of the engine. The timing is measured in degrees of crank angle of the piston before top dead centre. For example, if the ECM/ECU initiates fuel injection when the piston is 10° before TDC, the start of injection, or timing, is said to be 10° BTDC. Optimal timing will depend on the engine design as well as its speed and load, and is usually 4° BTDC in 1,350-6,000 HP, net, [...] "medium speed" [...] locomotive, marine and stationary diesel engines.|$|R

50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{may also}} use electrically heated resistive elements {{embedded in a}} rubber sheet cemented to the leading edges of wings and tail surfaces, propeller leading edges, and helicopter rotor blade leading edges. This de-icing system was developed by United States Rubber Company in 1943. Such systems usually operate continuously. When ice is detected, they first function as de-icing systems, then as anti-icing systems for continued flight in icing conditions. Some aircraft use chemical de-icing systems which pump antifreeze such as alcohol or propylene glycol through small holes in the wing surfaces and at the roots of propeller blades, melting the ice, and making the surface inhospitable to ice formation. A fourth system, developed by NASA, detects ice on the surface by sensing a change in resonance frequency.

50|$|Fully {{automatic}} systems {{allow the}} ability of the machine's implements to be controlled by the GPS guidance system. This is typically used in the fine grading applications where precise levels of material need to be moved on a predetermined design or grade. The advantages to this system is due to the accuracy that can be achieved with GPS and RTK, but requires an onsite base station. These systems can use either one or two GPS receivers and are mounted on the machine's blade. The more advanced systems use two receivers since it allows the machine to be controlled in a three-dimensional design. Fully automatic systems require the GPS guidance system to be integrated in the machine's implement controls. Some manufacturers sell the machine with these controls already integrated into the machine as an option. Aftermarket kits are available that can retrofit your existing machine to fully automatic control, but requires the GPS system to interface with the machine's implement controls. This is typically done one of two ways. If the machine's implements are controlled using electric over hydraulic (EH), the GPS system can input lever commands in parallel with the machine's implement lever. The output from the GPS system is interpreted by the machine's <b>electronic</b> <b>control</b> <b>module</b> as a lever command given by the operator and moves the implements accordingly. The second method for integrating GPS in the machine's implement controls is by adding a second pilot hydraulic valve in parallel with the machine's pilot hydraulic valve. This second valve is controlled by the GPS system and moves the implement valve according to the system design and blade location. Types of machines that use fully automatic GPS systems include TTT and MG.|$|R
