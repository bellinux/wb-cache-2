5|$|His {{thinking}} threw {{light in}} a very introspective way on the entire process of the judicial function. His decisions, beyond just the vote they represented, were sufficiently philosophical to be of enduring interest. He decided the case before <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> respect for its particulars, its special features, that marks alike the honest artist and the just judge.|$|E
500|$|In 1892, Saint-Gaudens {{was asked}} to design the {{official}} medal of the [...] World Columbian Exposition in Chicago; it would be presented to prizewinning exhibitors. [...] The obverse of Saint-Gaudens's design, showing Columbus coming ashore, was noncontroversial; his reverse, which featured a torch-bearing naked youth carrying wreaths to crown the victors, was attacked by the censoring postal agent, Anthony Comstock, as obscene. [...] The exposition directors hastily withdrew the reverse design {{and replaced it with}} one created by Barber which, according to numismatic historian Walter Breen, was [...] "notable only for banality". [...] A furious Saint-Gaudens swore to have nothing {{more to do with the}} Mint or its employees, and for the next decade refused all commissions which might involve <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> bureau.|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{has been}} {{described}} as having a meticulous appearance. [...] Long-time mentor Percy Sutton recalled, “In the beginning I called him Pretty Boy Rangel, to denigrate him, because {{he was one of those}} handsome types, hair pushed down and that mustache. But he had a way about <b>him,</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> great humor, an ability to influence people.” [...] Later, The New York Times described him thusly: [...] "After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who is very much the Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally." [...] In contrast, Rangel and his office have long been disorganized, with criticism even from supporters for taking on more things than he can keep track of. [...] The congressman's life has been dominated by politics, with no hobbies and few friendships outside of it. [...] Loyalties to Rangel were severely tested during the height of the ethics investigations of him, when a number of political figures bailed out on a lavish 80th birthday gala planned for Rangel at New York's Plaza Hotel.|$|E

500|$|During the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Spurs {{started with}} a lackluster 6–8 record and Popovich came under fire from the press. However, Duncan and Robinson stood behind their coach, and {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 31–5 run. The sophomore averaged 21.7 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.5 blocks in the regular season, making both the All-NBA and All-Defense First Teams. In the 1999 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 3–1, swept the Los Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers 4–0, and defeated the Cinderella story New York Knicks 4–1 in the Finals. In this series, a large contingent of Virgin Islanders flew over to support their local hero, and were not disappointed. In the first two games, the [...] "Twin Towers" [...] outscored their Knicks counterparts Chris Dudley/Larry Johnson with 41 points, 26 rebounds, and nine blocks versus five points, 12 rebounds, and zero blocks. After a Game 3 loss in which Duncan was held scoreless in the third quarter and committed three turnovers in the last quarter, Duncan bounced back with 28 points and 18 rebounds in a Game 4 win, and in Game 5, the Spurs protected a 78–77 lead seconds from the end with the ball in the Knicks' possession. Double teamed by Duncan and Robinson, Knicks swingman Latrell Sprewell missed a last-second desperation shot, and after closing out the series with a strong 31-point and 9-rebound showing in Game 5, Duncan was named Finals MVP, bringing San Antonio their first-ever NBA championship. The accolades for the Spurs soon arrived, with Sports Illustrated reporting that the San Antonio [...] "monkey has been shed", and that the Spurs were no longer known as the [...] "San Antonio softies". The magazine praised Finals MVP Duncan, who was later quoted: [...] "This is incredible. We kept our focus and we pulled it out." [...] Sports Illustrated journalist and retired NBA player Alex English added: [...] "Duncan came up big each time they went to <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> sweet turnaround jumper off the glass. He was the man tonight [...]" [...] And Popovich later said to losing coach Jeff Van Gundy: [...] "I've got Tim [...] and you don't. That's the difference." ...|$|E

I'm sick of people who cheat, sick of cleaning up their mess and trying to explain it. There is heavy evidence against <b>him.</b> <b>With</b> <b>that</b> much evidence, I don't know how he's {{going to get out of}} it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams was {{frequently}} critical of pitchers and their refusal {{to bring the}} related kind of strategic thinking to their pitch selection that he brought to hitting. However, he did show great respect for Red Sox pitcher Bill [...] "Spaceman" [...] Lee, crediting <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> kind of mindset. [...] Pitchers apparently feared Williams; {{he still has the}} highest walk-to-at-bat ratio (.2623) of any player in the Hall of Fame.|$|E

2500|$|To {{give the}} Doctor {{time to recover}} and the TARDIS time to {{regenerate}} from the extensive damage it had suffered, Compassion dropped the Doctor off on Earth in the year 1889; she then delivered Fitz to 2001, with the intent that he wait for the Doctor {{to catch up to}} <b>him.</b> <b>With</b> <b>that,</b> Compassion departed for parts unknown. Back in 1889, meanwhile, the Doctor awoke in a railway carriage to discover no memory as to his real identity, and no possessions save a small, shapeless box– {{what was left of the}} TARDIS after its power loss— and a note, simply stating [...] "Meet me in St. Louis', 8 February 2001. Fitz".|$|E
60|$|She was {{watching}} <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> curious {{look in her}} eyes which he never wholly understood--half mocking, half tender.|$|E

60|$|Grace {{looked at}} <b>him</b> <b>with</b> eyes <b>that</b> perhaps spoke more eloquently of joy at his {{recovery}} than of comprehension of his delight.|$|R
60|$|Margaret made no answer, only {{toyed with}} the dagger blade, and watched <b>him</b> <b>with</b> eyes <b>that</b> glittered more coldly than its steel.|$|R
60|$|She put {{the old man}} {{back with}} her hand. She looked at <b>him</b> <b>with</b> a sudden {{irradiation}} of her blank face. She answered <b>him</b> <b>with</b> lips <b>that</b> struggled slowly into a frightful smile.|$|R
