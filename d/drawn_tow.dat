5000|$|The Corps of Engineers had blasted {{out some}} of the larger rocks in the river and removed some snags. At {{critical}} places at various rapids the Corps had installed huge ringbolts set in the rocks beside the river, so a steamboat could hook up a cable to these bolts, wrap the end around a steam-powered winch on board, and literally crank its way up the rapids. [...] Horse <b>drawn</b> <b>tow</b> paths alongside the river were also employed.|$|E
40|$|Students use wood {{blocks and}} model boats to {{investigate}} how {{the shape of}} an object determines the friction it encounters as it is <b>drawn</b> through a <b>towing</b> tank. They learn the advantages of streamlining and increased waterline length and observe that {{the shape of an}} object affects its stability. Students are also introduced to the terms power, turbulence, hydrodynamics, work, and boat design, and explore the relationship of waterline length to speed. Educational levels: High school...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} Reynolds number {{dependence}} of the Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) of flexible marine risers. Emphasis is placed on revealing the trends that exist between the Strouhal number and the Reynolds number and between the dimensionless amplitude (A/D) and Reynolds number. Data is <b>drawn</b> from recent <b>towing</b> tank experiments which used flexible cylinders of three different diameters. The 38 m long pipes were exposed to uniform and sheared currents. The Reynolds number range extended from approximately 5, 000 to 220, 000 — well into the critical regime — with the larger diameter pipes responding in up to the 13 th mode and the smaller diameter pipe responding well above the 20 th mode. The results and trends from this set of experiments are compared to previous results from laboratory and field experiments. SHEAR 7 JI...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{design of}} {{structural}} modeling is usually {{based on the}} different geometric function. Since every component has a definite life span, {{it is necessary to}} calculate its core parameters. To find the life span of component, the component must be as input parameter to the Finite Element Analysis. The Finite Element Analysis is nothing but a numerical method for solving Engineering and Mathematical problems. The Analysis of the “Rear Axle Casing of Tractor ” using cast iron material with special grade “SG 500 ” for already existing model, taken in the real time is done by using “ANSYS”. The stress, strain, deformation analysis of the component is done by giving various boundary conditions. These analyzed results help to redesign the rear casing of tractor. The redesigning of rear axle casing of a tractor is done using “PRO/E”. During redesigning the component, various criteria’s which are undergoing in the real field must be taken into an account. The analysis of the redesigned model is done by giving various boundary conditions for both materials ‘SG 500 ” and “SG 200 ”. Then the stress, strain, deformation, structural supports, structural results are evaluated and also cores, dies and patterns are generated and hence the redesigned rear axle casing of tractor is found to be in safer mode. The better material which is suitable for the rear axle casing is given, by comparing the above mentioned materials. INTRODUCTION OF TRACTOR The word tractor originated from the Latin word “trahere”, meaning pull. Today, tractors are used for <b>drawing</b> in, <b>towing</b> or pulling objects that are extremely hard to move. The tractor on farms which is used to push agricultural machineries or trailers that plough or harrow fields...|$|R
2500|$|Ariel started [...] {{to raise}} her anchor at 5 am on the 29th and with the paddle steamer Island Queen towing alongside, headed down-river for the sea. The river pilot left and the tug was sent ahead to tow. The fast flowing River Min then {{presented}} problems for the under-powered tug as they met eddies and Ariel had to anchor {{to regain control of}} the situation. By this time it was low tide. With a mean draft of 18ft 5.5 ins., there was not enough water for her to get over the bar. [...] Captain Keay's frustration was increased by Fiery Cross, with a more powerful tug and <b>drawing</b> significantly less, <b>towing</b> past her and getting out to sea. Then the weather closed in: poor visibility preventing safe departure on the next tide. On the morning of the 30th Ariel finally got to sea, but with Taeping and Serica only a few minutes behind and Fiery Cross 14 hours ahead. In a final delay, Ariel could not leave her pilot on Island Queen, as the tug's boat capsized on launching (the boat crew eventually being rescued) - so a pilot boat had to be summoned.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not long}} before it was {{announced}} that flags were seen flying at the mast-heads of the tug and lifeboat--a sure evidence that a rescue had been successfully accomplished. This caused many a burst of cheering from the crowds, as the fact and its import became gradually known. But these were as nothing compared with the cheers that arose when the steamer, with the lifeboat and the schooner in <b>tow,</b> <b>drew</b> near, and it could be seen that there were many people on board--among them women and children. When they finally surged past the pier-head on the crest of a tremendous billow, and swept into the harbour under a vast shower of spray that burst over the pier and rose above the mast-heads of the shipping within--as if to pour a libation on the gallant crews-- then a succession of cheers, that cannot be described, welcomed the victors and re-echoed from the chalk-cliffs, to be caught up and sent out again and again in thrilling cadence on the mad sea, which had thus been plundered of its booty and disappointed of its prey! ...|$|R
