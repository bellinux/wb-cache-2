50|$|The Model 20 {{offered a}} {{simplified}} and rarely used tape-based system called TPS (Tape Processing System), and DPS (Disk Processing System) that provided {{support for the}} 2311 disk drive. TPS could run on a machine with 8 KB of memory; DPS required 12 KB, which was pretty hefty for a Model 20. Many customers ran quite happily with 4 KB and CPS (Card Processing System). With TPS and DPS, the card reader was used to read the <b>Job</b> <b>Control</b> Language <b>cards</b> that defined the stack of jobs to run and to read in transaction data such as customer payments. The operating system was held on tape or disk, and results could also be stored on the tapes or hard drives. Stacked job processing became an exciting possibility for the small but adventurous computer user.|$|R

40|$|Does <b>job</b> <b>control</b> {{act as a}} stress-buffer when {{employees}} 2 ̆ 7 {{type and}} level of work self-determination is taken into account? It was anticipated that <b>job</b> <b>control</b> would only be stress-buffering for employees high in self-determined and low in non-self-determined work motivation. In contrast, <b>job</b> <b>control</b> would be stress-exacerbating for employees who were low in self-determined and high in non-self-determined work motivation. Employees of a health insurance organization (N = 123) completed a Survey on perceptions of role overload, <b>job</b> <b>control,</b> work self-determination, {{and a range of}} strain and engagement indicators. Results revealed that, when individuals high in self-determination perceived high <b>job</b> <b>control,</b> they experienced greater engagement (in the form of dedication to their work). In addition, when individuals high in non-self-determination perceived high job demands, they experienced more health complaints. A significant 3 -way interaction demonstrated that, for individuals low in non-self-determination, high <b>job</b> <b>control</b> had the anticipated stress-buffering effect on engagement (in the form of absorption in their work). In addition, low <b>job</b> <b>control</b> was stress-exacerbating. However, contrary to expectations, for those high in non-self-determination, high <b>job</b> <b>control</b> was just as useful as low <b>job</b> <b>control</b> as a stress-buffer. The practical applications of these findings to the organizational context are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} high job demands, low <b>job</b> <b>control,</b> and high social support on need for recovery (NFR) among computer workers. Methods: Data was obtained from a longitudinal cohort study, including 5 consecutive measurements, with an in-between period of 6 months. General estimating equations analyses were performed to assess the risk for high NFR 6 months later. Odds ratios (ORs) for high NFR were calculated for high job demands, low <b>job</b> <b>control</b> and low social support, separately. Likewise, ORs were calculated for combinations of job demands and <b>job</b> <b>control,</b> {{as well as for}} combinations of <b>job</b> demands, <b>job</b> <b>control</b> and social support. Results: High job demands resulted in an increased risk for high NFR 6 months later, particularly in older workers. Low social support showed also an increased risk for future high NFR, but {{this was not the case}} for low <b>job</b> <b>control.</b> Furthermore, a combination of high job demands and low <b>job</b> <b>control,</b> as well as a combination of high job demands, low <b>job</b> <b>control</b> and low social support demonstrated an increased risk for future high NFR where older workers showed higher risks. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that adverse psychosocial work characteristics predicted future NFR among computer workers. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, nursing and allied health employee's {{perceptions}} of <b>job</b> <b>control</b> {{and the relationship}} to performance evaluation were explored. Supervisor perceptions of their subordinate's level of <b>job</b> <b>control</b> was assessed with subordinate perceptions of <b>job</b> <b>control,</b> {{to determine the effects}} of perceptual congruence on reactions to performance evaluation. In addition, supervisor attributions to subordinate performance was assessed to test the relationship with subordinate responses to performance evaluation. One hundred and forty-four participants including forty-five matched supervisor-subordinate pairs in a large Queensland health care organisation were surveyed. The measures included perceptions of <b>job</b> <b>control,</b> supervisor attributions to subordinate performance and the effects of subordinate reactions to performance evaluation. The results indicated that there were no differences in the perceptions the supervisor held of their employee's <b>job</b> <b>control</b> and the perceptions the subordinate held in relation to their own levels of <b>job</b> <b>control.</b> In addition, it was found that <b>job</b> <b>control</b> significantly contributed to positive reactions to performance evaluation and when there was a close match between supervisor and subordinate perceptions of level of control, there was a resulting positive reaction to performance evaluation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} whether a curvilinear relationship between <b>job</b> <b>control</b> and well-being is be moderated by desire for control, such that the relationship is curvilinear in the shape of an inverted U for individuals with low desire for control, and positive and linear for individuals with high desire for control. This study was designed to provide clarification as to why researchers have produced mixed evidence in support of Warr’s (1987, 1994) Vitamin model, which states that <b>job</b> <b>control</b> and well-being are curvilinearly related in the shape of an inverted U. A total of 165 individuals from a variety of occupations participated in this study via online survey. The results did not provide any evidence that a curvilinear relationship between <b>job</b> <b>control</b> and well-being was moderated by desire for control. Furthermore, there was no evidence of any type of curvilinear relationship between <b>job</b> <b>control</b> and well-being, or any interaction between <b>job</b> <b>control</b> and desire for control. Instead, there was only evidence of a positive and linear relationship between <b>job</b> <b>control</b> and well-being. The major implication of the findings is that more research is needed to provide an explanation for the mixed evidence in support of a curvilinear relationship between <b>job</b> <b>control</b> and well-being...|$|R

30|$|First, we {{investigated}} the direct {{effects in the}} interplay of <b>job</b> <b>control,</b> SOC strategy use (mediator), and work engagement. <b>Job</b> <b>control</b> was positively associated with work engagement (Hypothesis 1) {{as well as with}} SOC use (Hypothesis 2). Also, a positive association of SOC strategies on work engagement (Hypothesis 3) was observed (cf., Table  3). Additionally, in line with Hypothesis 4 we found a significant indirect effect of <b>job</b> <b>control</b> on work engagement mediated through employees’ SOC strategy use (B[*]=[*] 0.09, 95 [*]% CI 0.02 – 0.22). The direct effect of <b>job</b> <b>control</b> on work engagement remained significant under control of the mediator SOC (B[*]=[*] 0.50, SE[*]=[*] 0.16, t[*]=[*] 3.03, p[*]<[*] 0.01), indicating a partial mediation effect.

40|$|Drawing from Karasek's job demands-control model, {{this study}} {{investigated}} how perceived amount and clarity of interdependency in managers' jobs affect role stress, {{and the extent to}} which <b>job</b> <b>control</b> moderates these relationships. Results show that amount of interdependency was positively associated with role conflict, and clarity of interdependency was negatively associated with role ambiguity. There was also support for the job demands-control model as greater <b>job</b> <b>control</b> reduced role ambiguity when clarity of interdependency was low. Although higher <b>job</b> <b>control</b> produced lower role ambiguity when both clarity and amount of interdependency were low, higher <b>job</b> <b>control</b> did not produce lower role ambiguity when clarity of interdependency was low and amount of interdependency was high, suggesting that the buffering value of <b>job</b> <b>control</b> on reducing role stress is contingent on the task interdependencies that managers confront.

We found evidence of a graded relation-ship; with each quintile increase in <b>job</b> <b>control</b> experienced by an individual, the person’s mental health increased. The biggest improvement was a 1. 55 -point increase in mental health (95 % confidence interval: 1. 25, 1. 84) for peo-ple moving from the lowest (worst) quintile of <b>job</b> <b>control</b> to the highest. Separate analyses of each of the component subscales of job control—decision authority and skill discretion—showed results consistent with those of the main analysis; both were significantly associated with mental health in the same direction, with a stronger association for decision authority. We conclude that as people’s level of <b>job</b> <b>control</b> increased, so did their mental health, supporting the value of targeting improvements in <b>job</b> <b>control</b> through policy and practice interventions. fixed effects; job control; job stressors; longitudinal studies; mental health; psychosocial working condition...|$|R
