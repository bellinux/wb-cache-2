And what's more, Their children are less likely to get higher education in order to get into higher class in their futures. It could lower the social class mobility to our self and so <b>does</b> <b>our</b> next generation. The major problem of first generation is about earning money for family because of housing inequality. It's hard to get a loan from bank and lots of bills to pay. They just worry how to survive to tomorrow. But for our children, they deserve a better future, but under housing inequality, they need more time and money to get the same education as who are not suffering from housing inequality. These makes them give up their education easily but {{this is the only way}} they can get into higher class in the future. Not so many of people can make it.|$|E

[...] Kirkus Reviews praised the book, writing, [...] "while making no attempt at depth of characterization, Whitehead audaciously blurs the line between social realism and fabulist satire." [...] The Library Journal praised the book, noting, [...] "in spare and evocative prose, Whitehead does Shakespeare one better: What's in a name, and how <b>does</b> <b>our</b> identity relate to our own sense of who we are?" [...] The New York Observer was critical of the book but noted, [...] "readers not looking for direct emotional access to the characters may find it gratifying to solve the intellectual puzzle set here by Colson Whitehead." ...|$|E

She later begins a choreographed routine with her girlfriends, who appear to also have been mistreated by their men. The women then march down Auburn Avenue before they head home to throw their men's clothes off the balcony. The video received mixed to positive reviews. Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy was positive and called it a [...] "beautifully shot portrait of a woman {{on the edge of a}} nervous breakdown", and The Fader writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd regarded it as an accurate representation of how women act when they are [...] "wronged by dudes".

[...] Lambie stated it was done to explore [...] "how human empathy breaks down when individuals are reduced to an image on a screen", and concluded, [...] "whether it's directed at the innocent or the guilty, cruelty is still cruelty". Atad asserted it ultimately lead viewers to choose between their [...] "so-called justice and the competing value of empathy". Writing for Sabotage Times, Gareth Dimelow concluded it leaves the viewer to ponder: [...] "If someone has no recollection of their crimes, can they be effectively punished? <b>Does</b> <b>our</b> societal bloodlust for vengeance make us just as dangerous as the criminals we seek to discipline?" [...] GamesRadar's Richard Edwards found that Brooker was able to present a [...] "morally complex idea" [...] without taking a side on the discussion. Sancto felt the episode [...] "plays with the viewer's emotions ... making it all the more difficult to find a moral stance on her story in the end".|$|E
