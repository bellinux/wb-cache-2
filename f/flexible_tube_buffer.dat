Unlike to other piping components, <b>flexible</b> <b>tubes</b> consist of a thin walled shell of revolution with a corrugated meridian, in order to provide the flexibility needed to absorb mechanical movements. It is very complicated to analyze the behavior of <b>flexible</b> <b>tubes</b> because of its complex figure. Some fundamental behavior of the <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> for automobile is reported with analysis method. Obtained results are as follows; (1) The von-Mises stress is increased with increase of deflection at the <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> end and the linearity of stress variation depends on length of the <b>flexible</b> <b>tube.</b> (2) The number of cycles to failure is decreased with increase of deflection at the <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> end...|$|R

30|$|In {{traditional}} lavatory systems, flushwater drives blackwater till {{it passes}} the back zone {{and enters the}} exit pipe. In the study of An et al. (2014), weight of some water from the flushing box is used in tilting down a U-shape trapway. It has a spring located in large corrugated <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> that contracts prior to flushing due to the elastic strain energy of the spring to maintain a certain slope. A certain amount of water flows into the corrugated <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> once flushing begins. Once {{the mass of the}} inflowing water becomes larger than the elastic energy of the spring, the corrugated <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> relaxes to the bottom, making the slope of the trapway horizontal and facilitating the discharge of waste.|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} {{resonant}} absorber, i. e. a micro-slotted resonator with <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> bundles, {{is presented in}} this paper. The sound absorbing structure consists of a micro-slotted facing plate and a back sheet {{as well as the}} <b>flexible</b> rubber <b>tube</b> bundles. Each <b>flexible</b> rubber <b>tube</b> connects to a hole of the facing sheet via a small connecting <b>tube.</b> The <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> length may be much greater than the cavity depth, and can be deliberately made different from one another to absorb sound at different frequencies of interest. Due to the incorporation of the tube bundles into the micro-slotted resonant absorber, not only the absorption coefficients can be increased considerably, but also the frequency bandwidth of absorption can be broadened accordingly. In addition, because of the tube-cavity coupling resonances, through properly design, two or more obviously resonant absorption peaks may occur in the frequency spectrum of sound absorption. The sound absorption properties of the resonant absorber with tube bundle are measured in an impedance tube. The effects of the structural parameters of the micro-slotted resonator with <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> bundles on sound absorption are measured and analyzed. Furthermore, the sound absorption principles of the absorber are also introduced in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel navigation sensor for guidance of a <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> based on magnetic induction. In many applications, such as pipe inspection and medical intubation, the <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> has been utilized for inner surface monitoring and inspection. In particular, for medical intubation that inserts a stomach tube or endoscope, accuracy of locating the <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> mainly relies on experienced operators. Although X-ray tomography and oxygen sensors {{have been applied}} to detect {{the location of the}} inserted tube, the implementation is usually time consuming and costly, an equipment being bulky so that their practical applications are limited. On the contrary, magnetic sensors, offering contact free and compactness in size, have been preferred in the areas of position/orientation detection. In this study, a compact orientation sensor based on magnetic induction has been developed; both magnetic field generator and detector are designed to minimize the space along the <b>flexible</b> <b>tube.</b> Magnetic mutual inductance is analyzed with the extended-distributed multiple-pole model, and design parameters are optimized to determine an operating range of orientation angles. Performance of the sensor is numerically simulated and compared to experimental results. The results show the accuracy in a wide operating range and the potential in many applications. clos...|$|R

50|$|The fluid {{reservoir}} {{is connected to}} the collabsible bladder. The lower end of the bladder is connected to a <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> made of synthetic rubber or PVC. The first bit of the <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> that begins {{at the lower end of}} the bladder is 'U' shaped by using an elastic connector or a wire spiral. The end of the <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> were the water flows out is open to the atmospheric pressure. If the vertical height from the reservoir to the bladder is less than from the ground to the bladder and during a certain flow rate the bladder performs an interesting phenomenon of collapsing and opening along with the generation of a pulsatile flow of the liquid. The cause of this phenomenon can be explained by the functioning of the Starling resistor which produces self-excited oscillations caused by fluid-structure interaction in an elastic tube due to sudden stoppage of flow. This pulsatile flow generator can actually be seen as a modification of the Starling resistor.|$|R

A number of rollers, shoes, or wipers attached to a rotor compresses the <b>flexible</b> <b>tube.</b> As the rotor turns, the part of the tube under compression closes (or occludes), forcing the fluid through the tube. Additionally, when the tube opens to its natural state after the passing of the cam it draws (restitution) fluid into the pump.

The influences of rotation frequency and stroke length as the parameter of the pulsating flow on drag reduction were examined. The coefficient of friction in the case of a pulsating flow does not change compared with that of a steady flow. Namely, it is clear that the coefficient of friction in a <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> is smaller than that in a rigid tube, in the case of the pulsating flow.

40|$|The {{stability}} of fluid flow in a <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> to non-axisymmetric perturbations is analysed in this paper. In {{the first part}} of the paper, the equivalents of classical theorems of hydrodynamic stability are derived for inviscid flow in a <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> subjected to arbitrary non-axisymmetric disturbances. Perturbations of the form v_i = v_i exp [ik(x − ct) + inθ] are imposed on a steady axisymmetric mean flow U(r) in a <b>flexible</b> <b>tube,</b> and the {{stability of}} mean flow velocity profiles and bounds for the phase velocity of the unstable modes are determined for arbitrary values of azimuthal wavenumber n. Here r; θ and x are respectively the radial, azimuthal and axial coordinates, and k and c are the axial wavenumber and phase velocity of disturbances. The flexible wall is represented by a standard constitutive relation which contains inertial, elastic and dissipative terms. The general results indicate that the fluid flow in a <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> is stable in the inviscid limit if the quantity UdG=dr≥ 0, and could be unstable for UdG=dr < 0, where G = rU '/=(n^ 2 k^ 2 r^ 2). For the case of Hagen-Poiseuille flow, the general result implies that the flow is stable to axisymmetric disturbances (n= 0),but could be unstable to non-axisymmetric disturbances with any non-zero azimuthal wavenumber (n≠ 0). This is in marked contrast to plane parallel flows where two-dimensional disturbances are always more unstable than three-dimensional ones (Squire theorem). Some new bounds are derived which place restrictions on the real and imaginary parts of the phase velocity for arbitrary non-axisymmetric disturbances. In the second part of this paper,the etability of the Hagen-Poiseuille flow in a <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> to non-axisymmetric disturbances is analysed in the high Reynolds number regime. An asymptotic analysis reveals that the Hagen-Poiseuille flow in a <b>flexible</b> <b>tube</b> is unstable to non-axisymmetric disturbances even in the inviscid limit,and this agrees with the general results derived in this paper. The asymptotic results are extended numerically to the moderate Reynolds number regime. The numerical results reveal that the critical Reynolds number obtained for inviscid instability to non-axisymmetric disturbances is much lower than the critical Reynolds numbers obtained in the previous studies for viscous instability to axisymmetric disturbances when the dimensionless parameter Σ= pGR^ 2 /n^ 2 is large. Here G is the shear modulus of the elastic medium, p is the density of the fluid, R is the radius of the tube and n is the viscosity of the fluid. The viscosity of the wall medium is found to have a stabilizing eect on this instability...|$|R
