2500|$|Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter {{described}} Blindness as [...] "provocative but predictable cinema", startling but {{failing to}} surprise. Honeycutt criticized the film's two viewpoints: Julianne Moore's character, {{the only one}} who can see, is slow to act against atrocities, and the behavior of <b>Danny</b> <b>Glover's</b> character comes off as [...] "slightly pompous". Honeycutt explained, [...] "This philosophical coolness is what most undermines the emotional response to Meirelles' film. His fictional calculations are all so precise and a tone of deadly seriousness swamps the grim action." [...] Justin Chang of Variety described the film: [...] "Blindness emerges onscreen both overdressed and undermotivated, scrupulously hitting the novel's beats yet barely approximating, so to speak, its vision." [...] Chang thought that Julianne Moore gave a strong performance but did not feel that the film captured the impact of Saramago's novel. Roger Ebert called Blindness [...] "one of the most unpleasant, not to say unendurable, films I've ever seen." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated that, although it [...] "is not a great film, ... it is, nonetheless, full of examples of what good filmmaking looks like." ...|$|R
