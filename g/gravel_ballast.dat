She was lightly built, and apparently top-heavy, as the steamboat inspectors twice refused to issue her a seaworthiness certificate, only relenting when her builders installed 7tons of <b>gravel</b> <b>ballast</b> in her hull and 5tons of iron weights bolted to her keel.

25|$|In {{an archaeological}} {{excavation}} {{of the road}} at {{the southern edge of}} Bourne (TF098193), where it ran across a margin between Kellaways clay and the argillaceous (clayey) Kellaways sand, {{it was found that the}} construction of the carriageway had been done by digging two parallel shallow trenches into the subsoil and over-filling them with <b>gravel</b> <b>ballast</b> so as to form kerbs. Coarse sand was used to form the carriageway between them. This was a skilful use of the available materials as south of Kate's Bridge, the road passes over such minerals but little but rather friable Cornbrash is available near the excavated site. Clearly, this part of the road was constructed from the south, northwards and the materials carried along it. However, further north, in the Long Hollow, cornbrash from Sapperton TF019239, seems to have been used (Lane p.23.) Again, the use is north of the source.|$|E
500|$|To {{allow for}} larger trains, the {{permanent}} way was upgraded. The rail profiles were upgraded to 49 kilograms per meter (78lb/yd), were continuously welded and the <b>gravel</b> <b>ballast</b> {{was replaced with}} crushed stone. The distance of the line was after the upgrades [...] The upgrades allowed the maximum axle load to be increased to [...] and the train weight to increased to [...] A nominal train consisted of 20 hooper cars with air brakes. In 1960, work started on demolishing the tracks at the port, followed by all tracks at the workshop at Kirkenes the following year. From then, all non-ore transport in the company was taken over using road transport. The three remaining electric shunters and the steam locomotive were chopped up. Two diesel shunters were sold to Norsk Jernverk in Mo i Rana. Up until this point, the railway had operated 33 steam locomotives, 14 electric locomotives and 4 diesel locomotives.|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{the line}} had single {{parallel}} tracks of Stephenson gauge , fixed to stone blocks or sleepers.

2500|$|The {{specifications}} {{for the construction}} of the uncompleted portion of the line were accepted by our ex-General Counsel Mr. McNaught, and our Chief Engineer Mr. Kendrick was not allowed an opportunity to examine and comment on same. The specifications were so drawn as to comply with the kind of road which it was expected to build, and allowed but two miles of sidings in [...] of main line, and made entirely inadequate provision for operating facilities. The worst feature, however, was the clause which provided that the track would be ballasted with adjacent material, instead of train-hauled <b>gravel</b> <b>ballast.</b> The soil is particularly wet, and {{a large portion of the}} line traverses muskeg swamps; this omission would be better understood by a physical examination of the line than words can convey. The natural surface was so bad that the construction company [...] forced to haul in ballast in order to get construction trains over the track.|$|E
50|$|Construction of {{the park}} {{required}} the removal of 30 mi of railway track and accompanying sleepers, the digging and forming of drainage channels, levelling and consolidation of {{thousands of tons of}} <b>gravel</b> or <b>ballast,</b> and the removal of some brick built road bridges. The old station platform at Thurstaston, the preserved 1950s-era railway station at Hadlow Road, Willaston, a number of bridges and the occasional railway incline signs, which indicate a degree of climb or descent, are some of the few remains of the original railway line.|$|R
40|$|A normal roofing {{membrane}} {{is exposed}} to various mechanical and climatic impacts which can reduce durability and the service life of the membrane. In so called inverted roofs the membrane is situated beneath the insulation layer - which is <b>ballasted</b> with <b>gravel</b> or vegetated substrate. Thus, the sealing is protected versus the above mentioned damaging influences. Drawback of this solution is the direct exposure of the insulation to the outdoor climate. Therefore only materials with a high vapour diffusion resistance shall be used to minimize the entry of water into the insulation. However, the long term experience shows that also XPS boards experience some moisture accumulation especially in case where the cover layer remains humid most of the time. This slows down the drying process towards the top compared to <b>gravel</b> <b>ballasted</b> roofs. Based on long term field tests of green roofs this paper provides new approaches to simulate the hygrothermal conditions in inverted roofs. The model includes the simulation of the moisture behaviour of the substrate and an estimation {{of the amount of}} rainwater remaining at the interface between the sealing membrane and the insulation boards. Applying this model allows to asses the moisture accumulation in the insulation and the subsequent increase in the material's thermal conductivity over the life time of the roof. Considering the long-term moisture behaviour helps to specify the thickness of the insulation layer required to maintain the aspired level of thermal resistance over the whole service life of the roof...|$|R

To cross an open-work trestle in the dark is awkward, and when Deering balanced on a narrow tie and looked for the next, he sweated and breathed hard. On one trestle he stopped. Sixty feet below him, he saw the foam of an angry torrent; the next tie was some distance off, and the wood sparkled with frost.|$|E

40|$|Ballast rail has a vital fuction {{to support}} the train‚Äôs load and its dynamic forces.

Its therefore requires to investigate stability of the ballast under flood flow above the rail condition and any measure or improvement required by Hydraulic Modeling.

50|$|Located {{between the}} villages of Ridgeway and Mount Victory in southeastern Hardin County's Hale Township, it {{consisted}} of a large kame of gravel that had been desposited by glaciers. In {{the first years of}} white settlement of Ohio, the kame was not widely known to be an archaeological site; locals found artifacts and skeletons there, but news of its existence first reached a wider audience in 1856. In that year, the Bellefontaine and Indiana Railroad began constructing a rail line between Mount Victory and Ridgeway. Because the railroad needed significant amounts of <b>gravel</b> for track <b>ballast</b> purposes, a small spur line was built from the main line {{to the base of the}} hill, enabling workers to shovel gravel into rail cars that were then taken to the construction zone. Prior to their excavations, it appeared to be a simple hill, about 1.5 acre in area and covered with an apple orchard; before the apple trees were planted, it had been the site of an unusually dense and lush woodland.|$|R

5000|$|The {{line was}} very lightly graded and built, and its {{undulations}} {{gave rise to}} the local sobriquet of [...] "Sowbelly Railroad". Knauer intended it as another outlet for black granite from his quarries, and to attract residents of Phoenixville to make outings to his hotel in St. Peters. However, it was operated by the Wilmington and Northern, using a leased Reading engine. Although the railroad projected a 30 mi extension into Lancaster in 1893, it narrowly escaped a sheriff's sale in May when its president paid off the damages for which it had been attached. Traffic was low, and service ended on December 1, 1893. The rails remained in place for about a year. In July 1894, the Wilmington and Northern reportedly leased the railroad again and sent out work gangs to put the line back in repair. However, service was never restored. The company entered receivership in the spring of 1895. It was dissolved in 1895 and the rails removed to be sold to John T. Dyer, a railroad contractor and quarryman. The timbers were used for a number of local projects. By 1900, only the <b>ballast</b> (<b>gravel)</b> and some concrete abutments remained.|$|R
