40|$|TiO 2 –SiO 2 {{composite}} materials with photocatalytic properties {{similar to those}} of slurry powdered TiO 2 is obtained by a novel sol–gel synthetic strategy involving the hydrolysis/condensation of TMOS assisted by PEG as templating agent and the grafting of preformed titania nanocrystals onto the macropore walls of the silica matrix. In order to anchor TiO 2 particles to the surface of SiO 2, avoiding their embedding into silica matrix, functionalization with carboxylic acid or amine derivatives was carried out. The functionalization induces the confinement of titania nanocrystals in PEG, during the silica formation, and allows their dispersion on the silica surface. TiO 2 –SiO 2 materials exhibit high thermal and chemical stability and a photocatalytic activity in the phenol mineralization comparable to that of powder TiO 2 in slurry (<b>half</b> <b>degradation</b> <b>time</b> 120 min). These results suggest that the immobilization procedure here reported provides high accessibility of the catalyst active sites preserving the functional properties of the photoactive catalyst...|$|R

In spite of numerous studies on mammals and humans there is still no general agreement on the retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> of both radionuclides in the skeleton in the general population. Here we determined plutonium and (90) Sr in human vertebrae in individuals deceased between 1960 and 2004 in Switzerland. Plutonium was measured by sensitive SF-ICP-MS techniques and (90) Sr by radiometric methods. We compared our results to the ones obtained for other environmental compartments to reveal the retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> of NBT fallout (239) Pu and (90) Sr in trabecular bones of the Swiss population. Results show that plutonium has a retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> of 40 +/- 14 years. In contrast (90) Sr has a shorter retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> of 13. 5 +/- 1. 0 years. Moreover (90) Sr retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> in vertebrae is shown to be linked to the retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> in food and other environmental compartments. These findings demonstrate that the renewal of the vertebrae through calcium homeostatic control is faster for (90) Sr excretion than for plutonium excretion.

40|$|Thirty four {{patients}} with aortic regurgitation were studied by continuous wave Doppler ultrasound. In 30 of these the regurgitation was graded by cineangiography as mild, moderate, or severe and in four severe regurgitation was confirmed at operation. The <b>half</b> <b>times</b> of the aortoventricular pressure differences obtained with Doppler compared well with those obtained from pressure recordings at catheterisation. The relation between pressure <b>half</b> <b>times</b> and cineangiographic gradings of severity was not consistent. Similarly, {{a control group}} of {{patients with}}out aortic regurgitation showed {{a wide range of}} the invasively recorded pressure <b>half</b> <b>times</b> which overlapped with those in patients with aortic regurgitation. This suggests that factors such as systemic vascular resistance, and aortic and left ventricular compliance can have an appreciable effect on the pressure <b>half</b> <b>time.</b> If these factors are not included the method will be of limited value, except in patients with pressure <b>half</b> <b>times</b> of less than 300 ms, when regurgitation invariably is severe. These results suggest that at present the method is of value only in recognising the patients with the most severe aortic regurgitation who need early operation...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{compare the}} effect of {{exercise}} on pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> in patients with mechanical or bioprosthetic mitral valves. A relative pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> (pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> {{as a percentage of}} RR interval) was used in an attempt to correct for the shortening of the diastolic time interval caused by the increase in heart rate during exercise and thus to uncover the effects of valve design on pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> during exercise. PATIENTS [...] Twenty clinically stable (New York Heart Association grade I-II) patients with mechanical (n = 12) or bioprosthetic (n = 8) mitral valves (median age 51) years. The median time since valve replacement was 42 months. METHODS [...] Continuous wave Doppler echocardiography from the apical view at rest and during moderate supine bicycle exercise (50 W). RESULTS [...] During exercise the mean (SD) heart rate increased from 79 (12) to 101 (12) beats per minute (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) of difference, 15 to 29 /min) and the peak pressure gradient from 11 (5) to 18 (6) mm Hg (95 % CI of difference 5 to 9 mm Hg). The pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> decreased from 114 (30) to 78 (26) ms (95 % CI of difference (30 - 42 ms). There was no difference between the valve types. The relative pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> remained unchanged in patients with mechanical valves during exercise (13 (4) rest and 13 (5) % exercise, respectively) and decreased in patients with bioprostheses (17 (3) and 12 (3) %, respectively (95 % CI of difference 2 to 8 %, p = 0. 025). CONCLUSIONS [...] In patients with mechanical mitral valves the decrease in the pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> during exercise is probably mostly the result of the shortening of the diastolic time interval with increasing heart rate whereas in patients with bioprosthetic valves an increase in functional valve area may contribute to the shortening of pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> during exercise...|$|R

40|$|To {{test the}} {{validity}} of a relation between the pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> and the diastolic time interval, previously shown in a pulse duplication system, eight patients with prosthetic mitral valves and permanent pacemaker systems were studied.

The pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> {{was found to be}} closely correlated with the diastolic time interval although there was individual variation and in three prostheses the pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> attained a plateau when the diastolic time interval was more than 300 ms. It is likely that the orifice area is the main controller of pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> where there is stenosis of the prosthesis, but that other factors such as ventricular or atrial compliance and the diastolic time interval may modify or obscure the effect of orifice area in normally functioning prosthetic valves...|$|R
40|$|Transmitral {{pressure}} <b>half</b> <b>time</b> (PHT) {{was assessed}} by continuous wave Doppler in 44 patients with rheumatic mitral valve stenosis (14, pure mitral valve stenosis; 15, combined mitral stenosis and regurgitation; and 15 with associated aortic valve regurgitation). The mitral valve area, derived from transmitral pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> by the formula 220 /pressure <b>half</b> <b>time,</b> was compared with that estimated by cross sectional echocardiography. The transmitral pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> correlated well with the mitral valve area estimated by cross sectional echocardiography. The correlation between pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> and the cross sectional echocardiographic mitral valve area was also good for patients with pure mitral stenosis and for those with associated mitral or aortic regurgitation. The regression coefficients in the three groups of patients were significantly different. Nevertheless, a transmitral pressure <b>half</b> <b>time</b> of 175 ms correctly identified 20 of 21 patients with cross sectional echocardiographic mitral valve areas less than 1. 5 cm 2. There were no false positives. The Doppler formula significantly underestimated the mitral valve area determined by cross sectional echocardiography by 28 (9) % in 19 patients with an echocardiographic area greater than 2 cm 2 and by 14. 8 (8) % in 25 patients with area of less than 2 cm 2.

This was overestimated by cross sectional echocardiography by 0. 16 (0. 19) cm 2 and underestimated by Doppler by 0. 13 (0. 12) cm 2.
