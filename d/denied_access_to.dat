5|$|The port of Antwerp was an {{important}} strategic objective because Allied supply lines were heavily stretched and needed a deep-sea port near the front lines. The British Second Army liberated Antwerp on September 6, {{with help from the}} local resistance.

5|$|Bodyguard of Lies is a 1975 non-fiction {{book written}} by Anthony Cave Brown, {{his first major}} {{historical}} work. Named for a wartime quote of Winston Churchill, it is a narrative account of Allied military deception operations during the Second World War. The British and American governments resisted Brown's attempts to research the book. Many of the topics were still classified and he was <b>denied</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> British war records. The material {{in the book is}} predominantly based on oral testimony as well as some American records, declassified toward the end of Brown's research.|$|E

5|$|The Umayyads were {{followed}} by the Abbasid dynasty which came to power {{with the help of}} Iranian Muslims. The persecution of Zoroastrians increased significantly under the Abbasids, temples and sacred-fire shrines were destroyed. Also during Abbasid rule, the status of Zoroastrians in Persian lands was reduced from zimmi (or dhimmi, people who were protected by the state and generally considered 'People of the Book') to 'kafirs' (non-believers). As a result, Zoroastrians were not granted the same rights and status as Jews and Christians. Iranian Muslims were welcomed to the court, but not Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians were <b>denied</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> bathhouses on the grounds that their bodies were polluted.|$|E

According to UN mission head Johan Verbeke, about 60,000 ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia became vulnerable after the mission's end.|$|E

The arrest of Klaus Fuchs in January 1950, and the June 1951 defection of Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, left Americans with a distrust of British security arrangements.

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1798, the Mediterranean Sea was entirely {{under the control of}} the French Navy and their allies, {{including}} Spain, which had switched sides in the French Revolutionary Wars in late 1796 at the Treaty of San Ildefonso. <b>Denied</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> deep water ports and adequate supplies, the Royal Navy fleet deployed in the Mediterranean under Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis was forced to withdraw to the nearest friendly fleet anchorage, at the mouth of the Tagus River in Portugal. Although forced to retreat, Jervis' force was not defeated and on 14 February 1797 he achieved a victory over the Spanish Navy at the Battle of Cape St Vincent, capturing four Spanish ships of the line. A blockade of the Spanish Atlantic ports was instituted, especially Cadiz, the large southern fleet anchorage, and the Spanish did not again attempt to break out during the remainder of the year.|$|E
5|$|Brown began {{researching and}} writing Bodyguard of Lies in 1961. Most of the {{material}} is based on oral testimony from Second World War intelligence personnel, as well as records from the National Archives and declassified American records (although Brown says {{that most of the}} book was written before he was able to access the latter, in 1974). Brown wrote Bodyguard of Lies at a time when details of both cryptography and deception during the war were still classified. His attempts at research was resisted by the British and American governments; he was <b>denied</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> British war records and had to undertake considerable work to obtain US records via Freedom of Information requests.|$|E
5|$|Discrimination against Jews, longstanding but extralegal {{throughout}} much of Europe at the time, was codified in Germany immediately after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April of that year, excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions {{of the right to}} practise. Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to force Jews to leave the country. Jewish businesses were <b>denied</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts.

5|$|George's {{marriage}} to Sophia Dorothea was dissolved, {{not on the}} grounds that either of them had committed adultery, but {{on the grounds that}} Sophia Dorothea had abandoned her husband. With the agreement of her father, George had Sophia Dorothea imprisoned in Ahlden House in her native Celle, where she stayed until she died more than thirty years later. She was <b>denied</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> her children and father, forbidden to remarry and only allowed to walk unaccompanied within the mansion courtyard. She was, however, endowed with an income, establishment, and servants, and was allowed to ride in a carriage outside her castle, albeit under supervision. Melusine von der Schulenburg acted as George's hostess openly from 1698 until his death, and they had three daughters together, born in 1692, 1693 and 1701, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Royal Flush {{was planned}} in April 1944 by Ronald Wingate, deputy {{controller}} of the LCS. His theory {{was based on}} the idea that the Allied nations might rely on forms of help from neutral countries following any invasions. Having seen the implementation of Operation Graffham, and with the deceptions aimed at Scandinavia and the Mediterranean, he chose Sweden, Turkey and Spain as the targets. For Sweden this was the continuation of Graffham, with demands from the US, UK and Russia that the Germans be <b>denied</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the country following an Allied invasion of Norway. In the case of Turkey this was built on existing pressure, applied from the outset of the war, to join the Allied nations.|$|E

The Quadi were the first to surrender, in 172. The known terms of the peace are that Marcus Aurelius installed a client king, Furtius, on their throne, and the Quadi were <b>denied</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Roman markets along the limes.
