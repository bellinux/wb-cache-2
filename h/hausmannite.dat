40|$|The {{sorption}} of Pu(VI) and Pu(V) onto manganite (MnOOH) and <b>Hausmannite</b> (Mn 3 O 4) was {{studied at}} pH 5. Manganite sorbed 21 - 24 % from a 1 x 10 - 4 M plutonium solution and the <b>hausmannite</b> removed between 43 - 66 % of the plutonium.

40|$|Oxidation of As-III {{by three}} types of {{manganese}} oxide minerals affected by goethite was investigated by chemical analysis, equilibrium redox, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Three synthesized Mn oxide minerals of different types, birnessite, todorokite, and <b>hausmannite,</b> could actively oxidize As-III to As-V, and greatly varied in their oxidation ability. Layer structured birnessite exhibited the highest capacity of As-III oxidation, followed by the tunnel structured todorokite. Lower oxide <b>hausmannite</b> possessed much low capacity of As-III oxidation, and released more Mn 2 + than birnessite and todorokite during the oxidation. The maximum amount of As-V produced during the oxidation of As-III by Mn oxide minerals was in the order: birnessite (480. 4 mmol/kg) > todorokite (279. 6 mmol/kg) > <b>hausmannite</b> (117. 9 mmol/kg). The oxidation capacity of the Mn oxide minerals {{was found to be}} relative to the composition, crystallinity, and surface properties. In the presence of goethite oxidation of As-III by Mn oxide minerals increased, with maximum amounts of As-V being 651. 0 mmol/kg for birnessite, 332. 3 mmol/kg for todorokite and 159. 4 mmol/kg for <b>hausmannite.</b> Goethite promoted As-III oxidation on the surface of Mn oxide minerals through adsorption of the As-V produced, incurring the decrease of As-V concentration in solutions. Thus, the combined effects of the oxidation (by Mn oxide minerals) -adsorption (by goethite) lead to rapid oxidation and immobilization of As in soils and sediments and alleviation of the As-III toxicity in the environments...|$|E

The synthesized birnessite, todorokite, cryptomelane, and <b>hausmannite</b> were single-phased minerals and had the typical morphologies from analyses of XRD and TEM/ED. The PZCs of the synthesized birnessite, todorokite and cryptomelane were 1. 75, 3. 50 and 2. 10, respectively. The magnitude order of their surface variable negative charge was: birnessite >= cryptomelane > todorokite.

Birnessite exhibited the largest adsorption capacity on heavy metals Pb 2 +, Cu 2 +, Co 2 +, Cd 2 + and Zn 2 +, while <b>hausmannite</b> the smallest one. Birnessite, cryptomelane and todorokite showed the greatest adsorption capacity on Pb 2 + among the tested heavy metals. Hydration tendency (pK(1)) of the heavy metals and the surface variable charge of the Mn minerals had significant impacts on the adsorption. The ability in Cr(III) oxidation and concomitant release of Mn 2 + varied greatly depending on the structure, composition, surface properties and crystallinity of the minerals.

40|$|Chromium {{is a very}} {{versatile}} {{metal that}} is used for many applications in the world. Two {{of the most common}} ions of chromium that occur naturally are Cr(III) and Cr(VI). These two oxidation states have very different heath effects in living organisms. Cr(III) is relatively non-toxic to living organisms; however, Cr(VI) is very toxic to most living organisms This study was conducted to find a simple and cost effective method to sequester these two common ionic species of chromium from sources of water that are adjacent to or that are affected by other water sources contaminated by these two ions. In this study an investigation was conducted to observe the binding between three different engineered nanomaterials (Magnetite, <b>Hausmannite</b> and Jacobsite) to both hexavalent and trivalent chromium. A traditional synthesis was used to make these nanomaterials, which consisted of a titration of iron(II) chloride for the Magnetite, manganese sulfate for the <b>Hausmannite,</b> and {{a combination of the two}} previous salts in a 2 : 1 ratio for the Jacobsite. Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and <b>Hausmannite</b> (Mn 3 O 4) were synthesized using two different aging processes and Jacobsite (MnFe 2 O 4) was synthesized using only one process. The first aging process involves a traditional heating source in an open vessel at 90 °C for 60 minutes. The second ageing technique used was a microwave assisted hydrothermal synthesis method using a closed vessel at 90 °C for 30 minutes. The Jacobsite was aged using only the microwave technique. ^ The batch studies showed that the binding to the three different materials were pH dependent. The studies showed that Cr(III) and Cr(VI) bind to the nanomaterials differently at different pHs. In addition, the binding of the Cr(III) to the nano-Magnetite showed identical behavior binding to both the open vessel and the hydrothermally synthesized nanoparticles with pH. But the Cr(VI) showed differences in the binding to the open vessel and the closed vessel nano-Magnetite, with higher binding at lower pHs observed with the open vessel nanomaterials compared to the closed vessel nanomaterials. The <b>Hausmannite</b> micro-waved aged material had a better affinity for the hexavalent chromium then the open aged system. The studies with Cr(III) showed that the ion had greater affinity with the <b>Hausmannite</b> material than with Cr(VI). The Jacobsite showed favorable binding to Cr(VI) then it did to Cr(III) at higher pHs. The studies showed that all the materials exhibited the majority of their binding to chromium at around pH 4. Further data was obtained from batch studies included time dependency, isotherm capacities and interference studies. Overall the nanomaterials adsorbed both chromium species, and two of them (Magnetite and <b>Hausmannite)</b> reduced the hazardous Cr(VI) to Cr(III) determined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

These treatments were followed systematically b X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and AAOD-extractable Mn analyses. About 5 % of original <b>hausmannite</b> (surface area = 6 m 2 /g) remained in the solid residue of the AAOD treatment; however, if the <b>hausmannite</b> surface area was increased to 8 m 2 /g, by grinding, it completely dissolved in oxalate. Synthetic <b>hausmannite</b> of high surface area (37 m 2 /g) and rhodochrosite were completely dissolved by oxalate. Manganosite (1. 5 m 2 /g) and especially pyrolusite (~ 1 m 2 /g) were more resistant to AAOD attack. Ground manganosite (4. 2 m 2 /g) dissolved completely, but ground pyrolusite (7. 2 mZ/g) was only partially attacked by AAOD, inasmuch as about 25 % of pyrolusite {{was found in the}} residue. An increase of the extraction time to 4 hr did not completely dissolve the ground pyrolusite. As a result of the AAOD treatment, MnC 204 - 3 H 20 and inC 204. 2 H 20 precipitated from the oxalate solutions with all starting minerals, except pyrolusite (~ 1 mVg), which only slightly dissolved. The seldom reported MnC 204 - 3 H 20 phase was identified in residues of freshly extracted samples by its strong char-acteristic peak at 6. 5. - 6. 6 ~k, the intensity of which gradually decreased and disappeared over several days when the sample was exposed to ambient conditions (22 "C and 70 % relative humidity). The trihydrate phase also collapsed after heating AAOD-treated rhodochrosite at 50 "C; tx-MnC 204 - 2 H 20 was identified as the main crystalline product. Heating the ct-MnC 204. 2 H 20 product at 115 ~ overnight transformed most of it to MnC 204.

Most of the numerous specimens were collected by the writer and associates on the U. S. Geological Survey at localities in the United States, supplemented by other specimens from well-known localities elsewhere, especially Canada and Mexico. Following determinations of the minerals, the geological environment of the specimens was reviewed {{in the hope of}} making confident interpretations of their modes of origin. In many descriptions of the minerals, even during recent years, it has seemed that their identities have not been posi-tively determined and the criteria by which the modes of origin are interpreted leave some doubt that conclusions are correct. The present review indicates confidently that <b>hausmannite</b> is hypogene although re-cently, <b>hausmannite</b> from several localities has been interpreted as supergene. In those places where the geologic environment is here reviewed, the conclusion of supergene origin is open to question. On the other hand, specimens of manganite and braunire examined seem to fall readily into two groups: (1) a group in which manganite and braunire are clearly hypogene and (2) a group in which these minerals are clearly super-gene. In other words, both manganite and braunire can be formed either by deposition from solutions rising from depth or by descending solutions of surficial origin.
