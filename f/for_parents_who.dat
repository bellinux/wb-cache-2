He homeschooled his six children, remains a homeschooling advocate, {{and a member}} of a non-denominational Christian organization that promotes homeschooling, the Institute in Basic Life Principles. While Speaker of the House in 1997, Webster insisted that legislation providing funding to schools must balance the needs of all school districts and not raise any new taxes. He agreed to a school construction plan funded by borrowing up of to 2.5 billion in bonds, though he thought the crowding problem was being exaggerated for political purposes. He also sponsored 1998 legislation to improve and streamline pre-kindergarten education and provide training <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> would be homeschooling their children.|$|E
25|$|According to the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), parents {{believe that}} parental {{controls}} on gaming consoles are useful.

25|$|Schizophrenic patients' {{deficit in}} theory of mind impairs their daily {{interactions}} with others. An {{example of a}} disrupted interaction is one between a schizophrenic parent and a child. Theory of mind is particularly important <b>for</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>who</b> must understand the thoughts and behaviors {{of their children and}} react accordingly. Dysfunctional parenting is associated with deficits in the first-order theory of mind, the ability to understand another person's thoughts, and the second-order theory of mind, the ability to infer what one person thinks about another person's thoughts. Compared with healthy mothers, mothers with schizophrenia are found to be more remote, quiet, self-absorbed, insensitive, unresponsive, and to have fewer satisfying interactions with their children. They also tend to misinterpret their children's emotional cues, and often misunderstand neutral faces as negative. Activities such as role-playing and individual or group-based sessions are effective interventions that help the parents improve on perspective-taking and theory of mind. Although there is a strong association between theory of mind deficit and parental role dysfunction, future studies could strengthen the relationship by possibly establishing a causal role of theory of mind on parenting abilities.|$|E

500|$|John Keats (The New York Times Book Review) {{described}} Compulsory Miseducation as [...] "passionate" [...] and [...] "eloquent". He called Goodman's propositions in {{the absence}} of formal schooling [...] "startling" [...] and characterized Goodman as [...] "a lonely humanist crying in a Philistine marketplace, where the largest single share of public wealth is devoted to the strategies of overkill, and where another enormous amount is dedicated to putting blinders on the probable victims." [...] Keats recommended the book <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> put their children's welfare before their own. Eli M. Oboler (Library Journal), meanwhile, only recommended Goodman's [...] "polemic onslaught" [...] for those who like [...] "contentious [...] disagreeable" [...] material.

500|$|Levinson {{proposes that}} {{citizenship}} education {{can provide the}} [...] "cultural coherence" [...] that may be missing from a [...] "detached" [...] school—which would be a diverse community that prioritizes [...] "critical thinking, tolerance, and reflectiveness". She argues for a constitutional mandate to establish the [...] "autonomy-promoting aim of education" [...] regardless of public support, and asks for a [...] "culture change". Levinson distinguishes between parental and child rights, as laws exist <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> do not act in their children's best interests. She adds that children are limited by the restricted scope of their parents' knowledge, and that the state should intervene to combat this small-mindedness {{in the interests of}} children. Specifically, she cites Christian criticism of curricular neutrality as a tactic to justify the imposition of their own [...] "limited and restrictive" [...] worldview, and that external knowledge increases the odds of their children not adopting their worldview. Her argument is that the limited worldviews resulting from [...] "excessive paternalism" [...] consequently stunt children's ability to develop adult autonomy or make rational decisions. Thus, state and parental paternalism should be limited where it will hurt individual [...] "capacity for autonomy".|$|E

500|$|Despite {{objections}} from those medical practitioners [...] who still practised variolation, and who foresaw {{a decline in}} their income, free vaccination of the poor {{was introduced in the}} UK in 1840. Because of associated deaths, variolation was declared illegal in the same year. Vaccination was made compulsory in England and Wales by the 1853 Vaccination Act, and parents could be fined £1 if their children were not vaccinated before they were three months of age. The law was not adequately enforced, and the system for providing vaccinations, [...] unchanged since 1840, was ineffective. After an early compliance by the population only a small proportion were vaccinated. Compulsory vaccination was not well received and, following [...] protests, the Anti-Vaccination League and the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League were formed in 1866. Following the anti-vaccination campaigns there was a severe outbreak of smallpox in Gloucester in 1895, the city's first [...] in twenty years; 434 people died, including 281 children. Despite this, the British government conceded to the protesters and the Vaccination Act of 1898 abolished fines and made provision for a [...] "conscientious objector" [...] clause– the first use of the term– <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> did not believe in vaccination. During the following year, 250,000 objections were granted, and by 1912 {{less than half of the}} population of newborns were being vaccinated.

500|$|Similar {{to their}} {{experience}} with bringing Black onto the project, obtaining the voicework of the metal artists were also unexpected but beneficial. This led to some confusion during voice recording sessions; both Lita Ford and Rob Halford had difficulties with lines involving a character named [...] "Lita Halford". Furthermore, both Black and Osbourne frequently injected profanity into their scripted lines during recording sessions. Instead of rerecording these, the development left these in the game, but included the option for a profanity content filter to be enabled by the player to [...] "bleep" [...] out these words and mask such word on screen using the Parents Music Resource Center [...] "Parental Advisory" [...] label, an icon that Schafer considered {{to be part of}} the history of heavy metal. [...] A similar filter exists for gore in the game, preventing any dismemberment and disabling blood in the game. Schafer stated the filters were added to the game in consideration of older players that may not wish to see such aspects, or <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> opt to play the game with younger children. During development, Schafer stated that while he could not confirm what other musicians and bands would be in the game, there would be more than already stated, and that these musicians were [...] "especially conducive to character creation" [...] due to the amount of theatrics used in their concert shows.|$|E

40|$|Background: Parent-to-parent support <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> with {{children}} <b>who</b> are deaf or {{hard of hearing}} (D/HH) is identified as {{an important component of}} early hearing detection and intervention (EHDI) programs for children with hearing loss. Purpose: The specific aim of this review was to identify the constructs and components of parent-to-parent support <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> of children <b>who</b> are D/HH. Research Design: An extensive scoping literature review identified 39 peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 - 2014. Studies were selected and reviewed based on standardized procedures. Results: Data was identified, extracted and organized into libraries of thematic and descriptive content. A conceptual framework of parent-to-parent support <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> of children <b>who</b> are D/HH was developed and presented in a comprehensive, bidirectional informational graphic. The constructs and components of the conceptual framework are 1) well-being: parent, family and child, 2) knowledge: advocacy, system navigation and education, 3) empowerment: confidence and competence. Conclusions: The findings from this scoping review {{led to the development of}} a structured conceptual framework of parent-to-parent support <b>for</b> <b>parents</b> of children <b>who</b> are D/HH. The conceptual framework provides an important opportunity to explore and clearly define the vital contribution of parents in EHDI programs...|$|R
