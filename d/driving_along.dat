5|$|Johnston is <b>driving</b> <b>along</b> a quiet road, {{when his}} car is {{overtaken}} by Gunsche. Gunsche forces Johnston off the road, strangles him to death, and places {{a piece of}} wood—meant to resemble the Cross—inside Johnston's car, before setting him and the car ablaze. The remains are later examined by Watts and Means; they cannot determine if the wood is the Cross or not. However, Watts finds Johnston's partially burnt diary, and reads an entry about his contacting Means. Suspecting betrayal, he expels Means from the Group immediately.|$|E
5|$|The Triangle Link is {{partially}} financed with tolls, with toll collection {{taking place at}} Føyno. It is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, such that any car passes through the plaza once. Cars <b>driving</b> <b>along</b> the E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo {{need to use the}} interchange. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount. It is estimated that the tunnel will be paid off and the tolls removed in 2012 or 2013.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{opens with}} the Doctor and Donna {{exploring}} a marketplace on the Asian styled planet Shan Shen. Donna is {{approached by a}} fortune teller who convinces her to get a free reading. The fortune teller helps Donna recall the event that led to her meeting the Doctor. Donna remembers when she was <b>driving</b> <b>along</b> with her mother, Sylvia, through London {{to get a new}} job; at an intersection, Donna wanted to turn left to get to the security firm H.C. Clements for a well-paid temp position, while Sylvia wanted her to turn right as to take a job as a PA at a friend's business. Donna ultimately turned left. The fortune teller gives Donna the chance to choose again and encourages her to turn right this time. As she makes this new choice, a large beetle attaches itself to her back.|$|E
5|$|In Sarasota County, the {{flooding}} closed several roads {{and led to}} many overflown creeks and rivers, including the Horse Creek which crested at 5.8feet (1.8m) above flood level. Damage to roads and bridges totaled about $1million. Due to the flat landscape of the region, {{the flooding}} persisted for several days. The depression spawned a tornado in a mobile home park in Nokomis, destroying the roofs of fivehomes and causing leaks in twelveothers. Throughout the area, {{the passage of the}} depression left about 45,000customers without power, primarily due to gusty winds. The outages were fairly short-lived due to power companies calling in extra workers to restore the power. Moderate winds toppled a construction crane at the northern end of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, closing the bridge for 35minutes before the crane was removed. In Pinellas County, a man hydroplaned while <b>driving</b> <b>along</b> a flooded roadway; he crashed into a concrete pole and was killed. Severe crop damage to orange trees was reported in association with the flooding. Damage from the depression totaled over $2.6million (1992USD, $4million 2008USD), with about4,000houses affected by the flooding and an additional 70destroyed. Twopeople were killed in Florida.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small things like that take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi <b>driving</b> <b>along</b> the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E

5|$|The tolls are {{collected}} at a toll plaza located on Føyno. The plaza is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, {{so that any}} car passes through the plaza once. However, traffic only traveling between Føyno to Bømlo {{does not have to}} pay. Cars <b>driving</b> <b>along</b> E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo need to use the interchange. There is also an intersection allowing access to the island. The plaza has six lanes, of which two in each direction have a toll booth and one in each direction has an automatic collection. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Rihanna walking towards a white Jeep Wrangler, but stops {{due to her}} mobile phone ringing.

As a visual of Rihanna <b>driving</b> <b>along</b> a bridge in the Florida Keys, the song begins to play. During the first verse, {{different}} scenes are intercut of Rihanna, including a close-up shot of the singer driving behind the wheel is shown, walking along the beach and dancing in a black dress against a white backdrop, as she sings about how her boyfriend has been seeing another girl without Rihanna knowing.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a flat-band {{state in a}} quasi-one-dimensional rhombic lattice is robust {{in the presence of}} external <b>drivings</b> <b>along</b> the lattice axis. The lattice was formed by periodic arrays of evanescently coupled optical waveguides, and the external drivings were realized by modulating the paths of the waveguides. We excited a superposition of flat-band eigenmodes at the input and observed that this state does not diffract in the presence of static as well as high-frequency sinusoidal drivings. This robust localization is due to destructive interference of the analogous wavefunction and is associated with the symmetry in the lattice geometry. We then excited the dispersive bands and observed Bloch oscillations and coherent destruction of tunneling. 2017 Optical Society of America. Comment: 5 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
25|$|Junaluska {{salamanders}} {{have only}} {{been found in the}} Blue Ridge Mountain area in the Cheoah River, Santeetlah Creek, and Tululah Creek in Graham County of North Carolina. They are also found in a limited number of creeks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Sevier County, Tennessee. These salamanders are very rarely encountered in either area. One looking for this species is more likely to find E. junaluska in larger rocky streams in colder weather. Another popular way of spotting this species is late-night <b>driving</b> <b>along</b> roads on rainy nights. They can be seen moving between the terrestrial habitat they inhabit and the areas where they breed.|$|E
25|$|McCormick's {{body was}} found on June 30, 1999 near a West Alton, Missouri cornfield by a woman <b>driving</b> <b>along</b> a field road off Route 367. The reason he was 15 miles away from his current address is another mystery, as he did not own a car and the area is not served by public transportation. Though the body had already {{somewhat}} decomposed, authorities used fingerprints to identify McCormick. There was no indication that anyone had a motive to kill McCormick {{and no one had}} reported him missing, so the authorities initially ruled out homicide, but no cause of death was officially determined at the time. McCormick was last seen alive five days earlier, on June 25, 1999, getting a checkup at St. Louis' now-defunct Forest Park Hospital.|$|E

Then Yongguk begins to rap in front a red wall and in a misty rice field while Jieun continues playing the piano in the abandoned building. After the interchanging shots between the three, Jieun proceeds to sing the chorus in the rice field and along with shots where she sings {{in the back seat}} of the car.
