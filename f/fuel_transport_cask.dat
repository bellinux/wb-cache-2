The investigation revealed higher strength for tempered martensitic specimens with a considerable amount of ductility. Increased Si & Cr content resulted increasing in ferrite {{volume fraction}} consequently leading to increased ductility and impact toughness, whereas increased pearlite volume fraction resulted in increased hardness.

40|$|The casks {{used for}} {{transport}} of nuclear materials, especially {{the spent fuel}} element (SPE), must be designed according to rigorous acceptance criteria and standards requirements, e. g. the International Atomic Energy Agency ones, {{in order to provide}} protection to people and environment against radiation exposure particularly in a severe accident scenario. The aim of this work was the evaluation of the integrity of a spent fuel cask under both normal and accident scenarios transport conditions, such as impact and rigorous fire events, in according to the IAEA accident test requirements. The thermal behaviour and the temperatures distribution of a Light Water Reactor (LWR) spent <b>fuel</b> <b>transport</b> <b>cask</b> are presented in this paper, especially with reference to the Italian cask designed by AGN, which was characterized by a cylindrical body, with water or air inside the internal cavity, and two lateral shock absorbers. Using the finite element code ANSYS a series of thermal analyses (steady-state and transient thermal analyses) were carried out in order to obtain the maximum fuel temperature and the temperatures field {{in the body of the}} cask, both in normal and in accidents scenario, considering all the heat transfer modes between the cask and the external environment (fire in the test or air in the normal conditions) as well as inside the cask itself. In order to follow the standards requirements, the thermal analyses in accidents scenarios were also performed adopting a deformed shape of the shock absorbers to simulate the mechanical effects of a previous IAEA 9 m drop test event. Impact tests on scale models of the shock absorbers have already been conducted in the past at the Department of Mechanical, Nuclear and Production Engineering, University of Pisa, in the ' 80 s. The obtained results, used for possible new licensing approval purposes by the Italian competent Authority of the cask for PWR spent fuel cask transport by the Italian competent Authority, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSubstantial {{progresses}} made in {{last five}} {{decades in the}} front end of the nuclear fuel cycle in India has been supported adequately with advances and innovations in the field of back end technology and methodology developments for power reactors in general and thermal reactors in particular. The activities in the back end are characterized by spent <b>fuel</b> <b>transport</b> and storage, reprocessing, waste management and large scale support technology developments. The specifically designed spent <b>fuel</b> <b>transport</b> <b>casks</b> are in operation for shipment of the spent fuel to pre-reprocessing underwater storage facilities operating at Tarapur and Kalpakkam. Three reprocessing plants based on PUREX process located at Trombay, Tarapur and Kalpakkam have been set up to undertake reprocessing of the spent fuel from Trombay based research reactors, power reactors of western sector and southern sector respectively. The complete waste treatment, immobilization and disposal cycle for Low and Intermediate Level waste is in place to manage such waste from power as well as research reactors with a number of chemical treatment plants and near surface disposal facilities operational in various power plant sites. As regards to management of high level liquid wastes mainly arising from the reprocessing stream, two vitrification plants are currently operational whereas third one in under commissioning. One pre-disposal storage facility for vitrified high level waste products is operational at Tarapur while another new storage facility is under construction at Kapakkam. Research and development activities in the field of permanent geological disposal of such vitrified high level waste are in progress. These activities in the back end have been amply supported by development of large technological innovations and design of remote handling systems, robotics, radiation shielding etc. Development of advanced matrices, innovations in processes related to actinide separations and partitioning, recovery of other valuable isotopes are among the areas of future research and developments in fuel cycle of thermal reactors in India...|$|R
40|$|The Container Analysis Fire Environment (CAFE) {{computer}} code {{is being developed}} at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) to predict the response of massive spent nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>transport</b> <b>casks</b> {{to a range of}} severe fire environments. It is designed for use in transportation risk and design studies. CAFE employs physics-based reaction chemistry and radiation heat transfer models that are appropriate for fuel-rich and highly sooty pool fires. These models allow CAFE to produce accurate fire heat transfer results even when relatively coarse (and fast running) computational grids are employed. Parameters for these models must be determined from large-scale fire test data. Three fire tests were performed at the SNL outdoor fire test facility to benchmark CAFE. In these tests, the interior surface of a 2. 4 m diameter, 4. 6 m long, and 2. 5 cm thick pipe calorimeter was instrumented with 70 Type-K thermocouples. It was suspended above a 7. 2 m diameter water pool with enough JP 8 jet fuel on top to burn for up to 40 minutes. Heat flux gages, directional flow probes, thermocouples, and anemometers were used to characterize the environment {{in the vicinity of the}} calorimeter during and after the fire. Transient wind conditions and calorimeter temperatures were recorded during and after the fires. The average wind speed was roughly 0. 8 m/s during the first test, 1. 1 m/s during the second, and 2. 6 m/s during the third.

40|$|In many countries, the {{criticality}} {{evaluation of}} spent <b>fuel</b> storage or <b>transport</b> <b>casks</b> assumes that fresh fuel is loaded instead of spent fuel.

Based on the nuclear safety analysis {{carried out by the}} Russian Research Center "Kurchatov Institute " for regular VVER- 1000 fuel, it has become necessary {{to limit the number of}} fuel assemblies loaded into a cover below its designed capacity (12 FA instead of 18 FA as initially designed).

This paper considers two systems for VVER nuclear fuel transportation dealing with the issue associated with incompliance with Ukrainian regulatory requirements on nuclear safety, and proposes solutions to this issue.

40|$|Preliminary {{shielding}} calculations {{were performed}} for a prototype National Spent Nuclear <b>Fuel</b> Program (NSNFP) <b>transport</b> <b>cask.</b> This analysis {{is intended for}} use in the selection of cask shield material type and preliminary estimate of shielding thickness. The radiation source term was modeled as cobalt- 60 with radiation exposure strength of 100, 000 R/hr. Cobalt- 60 was chosen as a surrogate source because it simultaneous emits two high-energy gammas, 1. 17 MeV and 1. 33 MeV. This gamma spectrum is considered to be large enough that it will upper bound the spectra of all the various spent nuclear fuels types currently expected to be shipped within the prototype cask. Point-kernel shielding calculations were performed {{for a wide range of}} shielding thickness of lead and depleted uranium material. The computational results were compared to three shielding limits: 200 mrem/hr dose rate limit at the cask surface, 50 mR/hr exposure rate limit at one meter from the cask surface, and 10 mrem/hr limit dose rate at two meters from the cask surface. The results obtained in this study indicated that a shielding thickness of 13 cm is required for depleted uranium and 21 cm for lead in order to satisfy all three shielding requirements without taking credit for stainless steel liners. The system analysis also indicated that required shielding thicknesses are strongly dependent upon the gamma energy spectrum from the radiation source term. This later finding means that shielding material thickness, and hence cask weight, can be significantly reduced if the radiation source term can be shown to have a softer, lower energy, gamma energy spectrum than that due to cobalt- 60...|$|R

40|$|Storage, {{transportation}} {{and disposal of}} spent nuclear fuel continue to be significant problems faced by the commercial nuclear industry. Agreements made between the nuclear utilities and the Department of Energy regarding spent fuel disposal {{have yet to be}} implemented due to the delayed opening of the Yucca Mountain waste repository. This delay has forced utilities to consider alternative spent fuel storage options, the most common being dry storage in casks on the reactor site.

The subcritical margin estimated using best-estimate methods is discussed in comparison to the margin estimated using conventional bounding methods of uncertainty propagation. To quantify the comparison, each of the strategies for estimating uncertainty has been performed using a common database of spent fuel isotopic assay measurements for pressurized-light-water reactor fuels and predicted nuclide concentrations obtained using the current version of the SCALE code system. The experimental database applied in this study has been significantly expanded to include new high-enrichment and high-burnup spent fuel assay data recently published for a wide range of important burnup-credit actinides and fission products.
