50|$|Cryptococcosis is {{also seen}} in cats and {{occasionally}} dogs. It {{is the most}} common deep fungal disease in cats, usually leading to chronic infection of the nose and sinuses, and skin ulcers. Cats may develop a bump over the bridge of the nose from local tissue inflammation. It can be associated with FeLV infection in cats. Cryptococcosis is most common in dogs and cats but cattle, sheep, goats, horses, wild animals, and birds can also be infected. Soil, <b>fowl</b> <b>manure,</b> and pigeon droppings are among the sources of infection.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of two organic residues {{as sources of}} macro-nutrients in three types of soils of the third plateau of Paraná state was studied. Treatment consisted of a dose (38 t. ha- 1) of <b>fowl</b> <b>manure</b> and sewage sludge neutralized by a 3 : 1 (CaO+MgO) mixture. <b>Fowl</b> <b>manure</b> was kept in natura. Maize (Zea m ys L.) was reference plant. After 30 days of seeding, the aerial parts of the plants were cut. They were dried at 70 0 C till constant weight was obtained, then weighted and ground. Analyses were undertaken after nitric-perchloric digestion of the samples. Macro-nutrient levels in soils and in plants were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, flame technique. Results showed that production of dry matter was higher when <b>fowl</b> <b>manure</b> was used. Levels of macro-nutrients in Terra Roxa- TR were {{higher than those of}} Latossolo Verme ho Escuro – LE (Deep Red Latisol) and Podzólico Vermelho – PV (Red Podzolic), soils respectively. In aerial parts of maize plants collected in the soils treated with organic residues the concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, S and P were higher than those without treatment.

Em casa de vegetação avaliou-se a potencialidade de dois resíduos orgânicos como fonte de macronutrientes em três solos do terceiro Planalto do Estado do Paraná. Os tratamentos consistiram numa dose (38 t. ha. - 1) de esterco de ave e de lodo de esgoto neutralizado, permanecendo o esterco de ave in natura. O milho safrinha (Zea mays L.) foi utilizado como planta teste. Após 30 dias da semeadura, cortou-se a parte aérea das plantas. Estas, foram secadas a peso constante, moídas e analisadas após digestão nitro-perclórica. Os teores de macronutrientes nos solos e nas plantas foram determinados por espectrometria de absorção atômica. Os resultados mostraram que a produção de material seco foi superior com a cama de ave. Os teores de macronutrientes no solo TR (Terra Roxa) foram superiores aos dos solos LE (Latossolo Vermelho Escuro) e PV (Podzólico Vermelho), respectivamente. Na parte aérea das plantas de milho apenas as concentrações dos elementos K, Ca, Mg, S, P foram estatisticamente diferentes. O lodo de esgoto 60 % foi responsável pela maior relação Ca:Mg...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of organic soil amendments against S. sclerotiorum, {{the cause of}} soft rot of lettuce, and similar diseases {{of a range of}} other crops, was evaluated in the glasshouse and in the field. Stem rot of tomato, also caused by S. sclerotiorum, was also studied under field conditions. Lucerne hay, stable manure and <b>fowl</b> <b>manure</b> greatly suppressed disease incidence caused by S. sclerotiorum in lettuce and tomato crops. These amendments significantly reduced sclerotium numbers remaining in the soil after crop harvest. This was observed in the field and in glasshouse experiments. Incorporation of organic amendments, in particular lucerne hay, stable manure and <b>fowl</b> <b>manure,</b> significantly increased the number and fresh weight of marketable lettuce heads and the number and fresh weight of marketable tomato fruit. There was 100 % germination when sclerotia were added to soil extract and distilled water. Aqueous leachates from lucerne hay, stable manure and cow manure, however, substantially reduced the viability of sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum. Sclerotium viability was reduced when tomato stems infested with S. sclerotiorum were buried in a compost heap (internal temperature 50 - 600 C) and composted for seven weeks. There was a 100 % kill of sclerotia isolated from infested material and buried in the compost heap, 98 % kill of sclerotia incubated in an oven at 40 C compared to 10 % reduction in viability of those isolated from non-composted infected tomato stems. Organic amendments generally reduced the number of sclerotia in the soil over the experimental period. Disease incidence reflected levels of sclerotia in soil. The presence of organic substrate combined with high moisture levels, high relative humidity, and mild temperature suppressed Sclerotinia diseases, delayed onset of disease in some seasons and decreased the rate of disease development in lettuce and tomatoes.
