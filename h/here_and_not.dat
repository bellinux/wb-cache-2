500|$|Following the rain-soaked Belgian Grand Prix, Massa {{expressed}} his {{hope that the}} Italian Grand Prix would be held on a dry track, saying [...] "it would be nice {{not to have the}} rain <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> have any opportunity to have a consistent race." [...] The close nature of the Championship meant that Ferrari's home race had {{the potential to be a}} turning point in the season. Testing at the Monza circuit in early September had indicated that the performance gap between McLaren and Ferrari had narrowed. Despite this, Ferrari were hoping that their straight-line speed would be better suited to Monza's long straights. Ferrari confirmed on September 12 that Räikkönen would continue to drive for the team until at least 2010, ending media speculation that he could be about to retire.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} race, Stewart {{drove to the}} victory lane; the win earned him $55,725. He said, [...] "The fact that we've won 17 times <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> won on the right day is proof it's good momentum, but it's no {{guarantee}} obviously. It's nice to come here, especially for Steve and I, being our first race together, {{to be able to}} come out and have two really good strong and solid races back-to-back is an awesome start for us." [...] Earnhardt felt that the race was [...] "pretty good" [...] and praised Stewart for his victory. He also said that he aimed to start the Daytona 500 without using a backup car. Ambrose was happy with his third-place finish, [...] "We learned a lot for Sunday, we got a good result. We are smiling right now but it was very close to being the other way around." [...] He also said he was hoping to carry on his good form into the Daytona 500.|$|E
500|$|Scheduling {{the concert}} meant a {{financial}} loss of £500,000 for the band, despite sponsorship from Coca-Cola and GSM. Ticket prices were set at just DM 8 ( [...] , [...] ), {{because of the}} 50percent unemployment rate in the city. Bono offered for the group to perform a benefit concert or small show in Sarajevo, but the city requested they hold the full PopMart show. Bono said, [...] "We offered to do a charity gig here, just turn up and do a scratch gig, but they wanted the whole fucking thing. They wanted the lemon!" [...] McGuinness added, [...] "we {{felt it was important}} that we treat this as another city on the tour, to pay them that respect. To come <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> do the whole show would have been rude." [...] According to news releases following the concert, the total net income for the show was US$13,500; however, tour promoter John Giddings noted that price did not include the costs of the production or transportation.|$|E

500|$|Interviewed by the Israeli daily {{newspaper}} Haaretz {{about the fact}} that some of her European senior colleagues had formed alliances with, and visited, some Israeli settlers and groups, Marine Le Pen said: [...] "The shared concern about radical Islam explains the relationship ... but it is possible that behind it is also the need of the visitors from Europe to change their image in their countries ... As far as their partners in Israel are concerned, I myself don't understand the idea of continuing to develop the settlements. I consider it a political mistake and would like to make it clear in this context that we must have the right to criticize the policy of the State of Israel – just as we are allowed to criticize any sovereign country – without it being considered anti-Semitism. After all, the National Front has always been Zionistic and always defended Israel's right to exist". She has opposed the immigration of French Jews to Israel in response to radical Islam, explaining: [...] "The Jews of France are Frenchmen, they're at home here, and they must stay <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> emigrate. The country is obligated to provide solutions to the development of radical Islam in the problematic regions".|$|E
2500|$|Babai in the 'Book of Union' teaches two qnome (hypostasis—not the Chalcedonian {{use of this}} term, essence), {{which are}} unmingled but everlastingly united in one parsopa (person, character, identity, also [...] "hypostasis" [...] in Chalcedonian usage.) It is {{essential}} to use the Syrian terms <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> any translations, because the same words mean {{different things to different}} people, and the words must be accepted in the particular sense of each. In Greek Christology, hypostasis is used specifically to refer to what would correspond to Babai's parsopa, and ousion would correspond to qnome. In the period in which Babai and others formulated their respective Christological models, words such as [...] "hypostasis" [...] and [...] "ousion" [...] had less specifically fixed definitions. Thus, it was possible for two individuals to honestly use a single term to mean two distinctly different things. According to Jaroslav Pelikan, [...] "Syriac was a richer and more complex language than either Greek or Arabic, and it allowed for more precise distinction".|$|E
2500|$|The Gnostic {{movements}} {{may contain}} {{information about the}} historical Jesus, since some texts preserve sayings which show similarities with canonical sayings. Especially the Gospel of Thomas has {{a significant amount of}} parallel sayings. Yet, a striking difference is that the canonical sayings center on the coming endtime, while the Thomas-sayings center on a kingdom of heaven that is already <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> a future event. According to Koester, this is because the Thomas-sayings are older, implying that in the earliest forms of Christianity Jesus was regarded as a wisdom-teacher. An alternative hypothesis states that the Thomas authors wrote in the Second Century CE, changing existing sayings and eliminating the apocalyptic concerns. According to April DeConinck, such a change occurred when the endtime did not come, and the Thomasine tradition turned toward a [...] "new theology of mysticism" [...] and a [...] "theological commitment to a fully-present kingdom of heaven here and now, where their church had attained Adam and Eve's divine status before the Fall." ...|$|E

2500|$|Collider.com's Kayti Burt {{felt the}} episode of Arrow [...] "gets enough nostalgic hits {{in to make}} it work, while also giving us an {{exciting}} (batshit crazy) final act to launch us into the final part of the superhero crossover... Though the shared hallucination gimmick might lack long-term narrative consequence and feel like {{a bit of a}} 'Look, It's The 100th Episode!' plot device, it works because of the performance of all of the actors (including many returning ones) and the sentiment that this show has genuinely inspired in people." [...] Conversely, Burt [...] "was a bit sad that Arrow was robbed the opportunity of having a 100th episode outside of the already considerable demands of the crossover event, which were sometimes at odds with what this episode was trying to do... This episode was trying to do far too much and was therefore a bit of a mess, but it's hard to dislike an hour of TV that is earnestly trying to please its fans in so many different ways." [...] She gave the episode 3 stars out of 5. Sara Netzley, for Entertainment Weekly praised the episode, awarding it an [...] "A", saying [...] "Lots of Arrow action <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> as much for The Flash/Supergirl folks to do. Still, it all worked beautifully. We get enough cross-team action to make it a treat for viewers of the Berlanti-verse while still forwarding the invasion story line – and honoring the characters, plots, and themes that have made Arrow such a satisfying show over the last four and a half seasons. It was a tall order, but the episode pulled it off." ...|$|E
