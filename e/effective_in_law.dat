Robert Moody quotes that, according to a single surviving record book, he was [...] "firm and <b>effective</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> enforcement, and yet, where allowed discretion by law, humane and flexible". His involvement in judicial affairs and apparent good reputation made him eligible {{to serve in the}} Salem Witch Trials, and he was appointed a judge along with six other men on May 27, 1692. There is no evidence, however, of his attendance at any of the examinations. Indeed, he resigned from the Court of Oyer and Terminer around June 8, 1692, the same time as Bridget Bishop's trial and sentence for witchcraft.

This paper considers the four rescripts that survive from the troubled reign of the preceding Emperor, Probus. None contains a great legal innovation; none shows a drastic lowering of legal standards. Their importance lies in what they reveal about general matters. Despite the enormous military and economic problems of the age, the imperial chancellery functioned; rescripts were issued to the most ordinary individuals, men and women alike. There {{was no need for}} a rescript to be concerned with an important principle or difficult point of law.

Between 1999 and 2009, courts crafted new First Amendment doctrines to protect Internet speakers from having their anonymity automatically stripped away upon the filing of a libel action. Courts also adapted existing First Amendment protections for hyperbole, satire, and other non-factual speech to protect the distinctive discourse of Internet message boards.
