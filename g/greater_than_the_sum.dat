The club operated on a small budget and was famed as a team <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its parts, boasting few international stars. Gloucestershire's overall knockout record between 1999 and 2002 was 28 wins and seven losses from 37 games, including 16 wins from 18 at the Bristol County Ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{taste of}} jianbing is also {{major reason for}} its popularity. Alisa Grandy, a western food vendor who serves jianbing in Portland, {{describes}} Jianbing’s taste as fantastic and special because the combination of different ordinary ingredients makes the taste <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of them. In the book Food and Chinese Culture: Essays on Popular Cuisine, it is described that the look and smell of Jianbing Guozi {{are as good as}} its taste, and it tastes better when serving with green garlic and fermented flour sauce with the sweetness of its crispy layer.|$|E

In the event of the merger, BAE shareholders would own 40% and EADS 60% of the new enlarged organisation. A key French EADS shareholder Lagardere asked EADS to rethink the proposed merger plan as the conditions were unsatisfactory. The bosses of BAE Systems and EADS issued a joint statement seeking political support for their proposed 35 billion euro (US$45 billion) merger from the British, French and German governments; and reiterated that the combination is borne out of opportunity, not necessity and the new company would be <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its parts.

Asch stated: [...] "Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated.

40|$|Interactions among {{telecommunications}} networks, computers, {{and other}} peripheral devices {{have been of}} interest since the earliest distributed computing systems. A key architectural question is the location (and nature) of programmability. One perspective, that examined in this paper, is that network elements should be as programmable as possible, {{in order to build}} the most flexible distributed computing systems. This paper presents my personal view of the history of programmable networking over the last two decades, and in the spirit of "vox audita perit, littera scripta manet", includes an account of how what is now called "Active Networking " came into being. It demonstrates the deep roots Active Networking has in the programming languages, networking and operating systems communities, and shows how interdisciplinary approaches can have impacts <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sums</b> of their parts.

The band told her to put [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] first and [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] last, with the rest sequenced according to her preference. Bono said of MacColl's contribution, [...] "Your hope for your album is that it will always be <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its parts.

IGN's Cam Shea {{said it is}} [...] "a shame that Dishonoreds story isn't <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its decidedly memorable parts", and added, [...] "Dishonored is a game you'll talk with your friends about". Eurogamers Dan Whitehead, The Verge's Arthur Gies, and Giant Bomb's Patrick Klepek criticized {{the end of the}} game for its generic missions, [...] "late narrative missteps", and abrupt ending. Klepek also criticized the repetitive ambient dialogue in the missions. Whitehead also stated that the unique, inventive, and distinctive missions allowed for memorable gameplay that subverted the overarching story. Joystiq's Alexander Sliwinski was disappointed by the abrupt ending, and that the story did not explore much of the developed world of Dunwall, but said that the overall experience left him wanting more. [...] In contrast, The Escapist's Susan Arendt wrote that the story was well paced, and Shacknewss John Keefer stated that it was emotionally immersing and is [...] "role-playing at its story-driven finest", but added that some plot points were not properly explained or developed.|$|E

Publishers Weekly enjoyed that Najika was not given a magical power and had to keep improving her cooking skills. Although the reviewer for School Library Journal described the series as [...] "a perfectly ordinary romance manga," [...] he praised Nunzio Defilippis and Christina Weir's adaptation of the manga. Deb Aoki of About.com listed the manga {{as one of the}} best shōjo series. Jason Thompson rated the series 3.5 out of 4 stars, describing it as [...] " [...] quick, delightful read." [...] Another reviewer for Publishers Weekly, Johanna Draper Carlsen, wrote that she found the manga reminiscent of the romantic comedy film Simply Irresistible (1999) and that the manga contained conventional shōjo aspects. In a later review of the second volume, she described the series as [...] "entertaining enough, but it’s fluffy and forgettable (like so many of the mousse items and drinks Najika makes). The volumes already feel familiar, even as I’m reading them for the first time." [...] Mania Entertainment's Sakura Eries expressed her lukewarm feelings towards the first volume, writing that the reader's suspension of disbelief was vital to enjoying the manga. She disliked the two-dimensional characterization and Ando's illustrations of the characters, although she felt that the food was well-drawn. Comparing the series to others in the cooking genre, she wrote that it differed in that [...] "cooking is Najika's expression of self and her means of creating relationships and drawing others to common ground (like the estranged Kitazawa Brothers)." [...] In follow-up reviews of the second and third volumes, she remained lukewarm to the series; she praised Kobayashi's portrayal of Akane's eating disorder, though she disliked how Najika's quest to find her flan prince seemed to become more of a side-plot. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network praised Najika as a likeable protagonist and the characterizations as believable. He enjoyed the plot and recipes, although he wrote that the character designs lacked creativity, and criticized the plot clichés and the antagonists' weak characterization. He had mixed feelings about the fourth volume's emphasis on conventional shōjo romance and plot twists at the cost of its cooking aspect. He found the artwork conventional, though able to convey emotion. He wrote that the fifth volume finally balanced the romance and cooking elements, although he disliked the inclusion of a side story, preferring another chapter instead. In his review of the seventh volume, he concluded: [...] "this series takes the hoariest elements of the romance/drama/cooking genres and still manages to come up with something <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its parts." ...|$|E
