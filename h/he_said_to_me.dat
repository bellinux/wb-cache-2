500|$|Morrison did not {{excel at}} academics, and focused instead on music. He practised his music in solitude, {{and was not}} skilled at socialising. [...] "One time <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it wasn't that he didn't want to talk, but tunes were running through his head all the time. He said he didn't know whether he'd been blessed or cursed because the words and music wouldn't go out of his head," [...] said his mother Violet.|$|E
500|$|September 5, 1942: In {{the morning}} {{attended}} a special {{action from the}} women's concentration camp (Muslims); the most dreadful of horrors. Master-Sergeant Thilo (troop doctor) was right when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that this is the}} anus mundi. In the evening towards 8:00 attended another special action from Holland [...] Because of the special rations they get a fifth of a liter of schnapps, 5 cigarettes, 100 g salami and bread, the men all clamor to take part in such actions. Today and tomorrow (Sunday) work.|$|E
500|$|Morrissey had {{specific}} {{instructions on how}} he wanted the [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] single to be packaged. He told Rough Trade's art department that the single should have a paper label centre with four vents encircling the middle, in homage to singles from the 1960s. The cover to the single features a photograph of George O'Mara by Jim French, taken from Margaret Walters' history The Nude Male. The sleeve's homoerotic undertones elicited the reaction Morrissey was hoping for of unease and outrage. Rourke said when he showed the recording to his parents his father was [...] "mortified. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'that's a bloke's bum' and I said, 'yeah' but when he asked me why I just didn't {{have an answer for}} him".|$|E

500|$|Klowden {{recalled}} {{later that}} [...] "he was very {{down in the}} dumps about his wife. [...] He told me how he had met Northrup. He said {{he went to a}} party and got drunk and when he {{woke up in the morning}} he found Northrup was in bed with him. He was having a lot of problems with her. I remember <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I was the only person he knew who would set up a white silk tent for him. I was rather surprised when we were driving back to LA on Sunday evening, he stopped at a florist to buy some flowers for his wife." [...] In November 1950, Northrup attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. Hubbard blamed Klowden for the suicide bid and told her to forget about him and the Foundation, but resumed the affair with her again within a month.|$|E
500|$|... "John Doe" [...] was co-executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she {{had never}} helmed an episode before, MacLaren {{utilized}} information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, [...] "Kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list. The most powerful thing <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie {{in his head and}} really visualizes it." [...] Gilligan later said that MacLaren [...] "really rose to the occasion and really did her homework." [...] The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate [...] "smoke and mirrors", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it really was. A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. However, the scene was reportedly torpid to film. Gilligan later joked that [...] "You could have stood there and had a sandwich while the thing was backing up: it was so slow." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Kloves was {{selected}} to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as [...] "tough", as it did not [...] "lend itself to adaptation {{as well as the}} next two books." [...] Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he [...] "almost never read", but Harry Potter jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series. When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to [...] " [...] her baby." [...] Rowling admitted that she [...] "was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves," [...] but recalled her initial meeting with him: [...] "The first time I met him, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted." [...] Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.|$|E

2500|$|Wright had {{discovered}} a terse, imagistic, free verse of clarity, and power.

2500|$|Life on {{the tour}} was not easy. [...] "One night", Gonzales {{recalled}} later, [...] "I sprained an ankle badly. The next night in another town I was hurting.

6000|$|... "’The nearest {{place is}} three miles off,’ <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> turning <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and {{apparently}} trying to soften a naturally harsh voice; ’if you {{will give me}} the pleasure of your company, I will make you as comfortable as I can.’ ...|$|R

Camp David had failed, and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'You should remain in Paris.' I asked him why, and he said, 'Because I am going to start an intifada.

2500|$|Schweitzer {{continues}} {{writing in}} The Quest of the Historical Jesus {{that it is}} totally unreasonable to think that [...] "coming quickly", [...] "near", and [...] "soon" [...] could mean hundreds of years, much less, thousands {{of years in the}} future. [...] "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near." [...] (Revelation 1:3) [...] "And <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'These words are faithful and true'; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place." [...] "And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near" [...] (Revelation 22:6, 7, 10, 12). [...] "All these things shall come upon this generation" [...] (Matthew 23:36). Schweitzer concludes that the 1st-century theology, originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed Jesus, is totally incompatible with modern Christian belief.|$|E
2500|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} {{that much of the}} public fascination for Fasanella's work had relied on the political and socio-economic messages they contained rather than their artistic appeal. As those messages fell from favor, Fasanella was abandoned by many of his strongest supporters. As he told one reporter: [...] "The other day, I called an old lefty pal at 1199 (the drug and hospital workers' union) and offered them my stuff. 'Forget it Ralph,' <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> 'We don't want your stuff.'" ...|$|E

60|$|Confronted by {{the serious}} {{responsibility}} {{that he had}} undertaken, he justified what <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Still pale, still distressed, he was now nevertheless master of himself.

2500|$|His last single, [...] "Nineteen", {{released}} {{a few weeks}} before his death, was produced by Paul Hardcastle. It bore no relation to the producer's chart-topping single of the same title some months earlier. [...] "This was a guy whose records I used to play when I was at school," [...] said Hardcastle. [...] "He was a hero of mine – I couldn't work out why he wanted to work with me. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'You're {{at the top of your}} game technically right now, so can you help me?'"

2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If {{you can tell}} me how you are going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like to know how it is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ...
