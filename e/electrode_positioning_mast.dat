40|$|SummaryBackgroundSeveral {{clinical}} trials have shown inconsistent results regarding {{the effect of}} <b>electrode</b> <b>positions</b> {{on the success of}} electrical cardioversion. AimsThe aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of the anterior-posterior <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> on the success of electrical cardioversion in patients undergoing external electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. MethodsPubmed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched for randomized controlled trials. The effect of the anterior-posterior <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> on cardioversion success is presented as a risk ratio with 95 % confidence interval. ResultsTen trials with 1281  patients were included in the analysis. The anterior-posterior <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> had no advantages in terms of success of electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation compared with the anterior-lateral <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> (risk ratio 1. 02, 95 % confidence interval 0. 96 – 1. 09; P= 0. 50). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with a left atrium diameter≤ 45 mm and lone atrial fibrillation might derive benefits from the anterior-posterior <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> in terms of success of cardioversion. No evidence of publication bias was detected. ConclusionsThe present analysis suggests that only patients with a left atrium diameter≤ 45 mm and lone atrial fibrillation might derive benefits from the anterior-posterior <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> compared with the anterior-lateral <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> during external electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. However, there was insufficient evidence to support any advantages for the anterior-posterior <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> in other situations...|$|R

Patients suffering from oropharyngeal dysphagia in the presence of Parkinson’s disease have been treated with surface {{electrical stimulation}}. Because of controversial reports on this treatment, a pilot study was set up. This study describes the effects of a single session of surface electrical stimulation using different <b>electrode</b> <b>positions</b> in ten patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (median Hoehn and Yahr score: II) and oropharyngeal dysphagia compared to ten age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects during videofluoroscopy of swallowing. Three different <b>electrode</b> <b>positions</b> were applied in random order per subject. For each <b>electrode</b> <b>position,</b> the electrical current was respectively turned “on” and “off” in random order. Temporal, spatial, and visuoperceptual variables were scored by experienced raters who were blinded to the group, <b>electrode</b> <b>position,</b> and status (on/off) of the electrical current.

Only a few significant effects of a single session of surface electrical stimulation using different <b>electrode</b> <b>positions</b> in dysphagic Parkinson patients could be observed in this study. Furthermore, significant results for temporal and spatial variables were found regardless of the status of the electrical current in both groups suggesting placebo effects. Following adjustment for electrical current status as well as <b>electrode</b> <b>positions</b> (both not significant, P > 0. 05) in the statistical model, significant group differences between Parkinson patients and healthy control subjects emerged.

40|$|A {{cochlear}} implant (CI) is an auditory prosthesis that enables hearing by providing electrical stimuli through an electrode array. It {{has been previously}} established that the <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> can influence CI performance. Thus, <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> {{should be considered in}} order to achieve better CI results. This paper describes how the <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> influences the auditory nerve fiber (ANF) response to either a single pulse or low- (250 pulses/s) and high-rate (5, 000 pulses/s) pulse-trains using a computational model. The field potential in the cochlea was calculated using a three-dimensional finite-element model, and the ANF response was simulated using a biophysical ANF model. The effects were evaluated in terms of the dynamic range, stochasticity, and spike excitation pattern. The relative spread, threshold, jitter, and initiated node were analyzed for single-pulse response; and the dynamic range, threshold, initiated node, and interspike interval were analyzed for pulse-train stimuli responses. <b>Electrode</b> <b>position</b> was found to significantly affect the spatiotemporal pattern of the ANF response, and this effect was significantly dependent on the stimulus rate.

Pitch comparisons were obtained for pure tones and electrical stimuli presented at different <b>positions</b> (<b>electrodes)</b> in the scala tympani, keeping the electric pulse rate fixed at 100, 250, or 800 pps.

Computed tomography (CT) {{is the standard}} method for postoperative imaging of the <b>electrode</b> <b>position.</b> CT scans accurately reflect <b>electrode</b> depth and <b>position,</b> which is essential prior to use. However, routine CT examinations expose patients to radiation, which is especially problematic in children. We examined whether new CT protocols could reduce radiation doses while preserving diagnostic accuracy. METHODS To investigate whether <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> can be assessed by low-dose CT protocols, a cadaveric lamb model was used because the inner ear morphology is similar to humans. The scans were performed at various volumetric CT dose-indexes CTDIvol) /kV combinations. For each constant CTDIvol the tube voltage was varied (i. e., 80, 100, 120 and 140 kV). This procedure was repeated at different CTDIvol values (21 mGy, 11 mGy, 5. 5 mGy, 2. 8 mGy and 1. 8 mGy). To keep the CTDIvol constant at different tube voltages, the tube current values were adjusted. Independent evaluations of the images were performed by two experienced and blinded neuroradiologists. The criteria diagnostic usefulness, image quality and artifacts (scaled 1 - 4) were assessed in 14 cochlear-implanted cadaveric lamb heads with variable tube voltages. RESULTS Results showed that the standard CT dose could be substantially reduced without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy of <b>electrode</b> <b>position.</b> The assessment of the CI <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> was feasible in almost all cases up to a CTDIvol of 2 - 3 mGy. The number of artifacts did not increase for images within this dose range as compared to higher dosages.

The main consequences of this are that smoother images are produced {{and the number of}} artefacts and their magnitude are generally reduced.

Image smoothness is used as the criterion for the readjustment. Computer simulation tests have shown that this modification produces improved image fidelity. 1...|$|R

40|$|To {{define a}} minimal set of {{descriptive}} parameters for cochlear morphology and study {{its influence on}} the cochlear implant <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> in relation to surgical insertion distance. Cochlear morphology and <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> were analyzed using multiplanar reconstructions of the pre- and postoperative CT scans in a population of 336 patients (including 26 bilaterally implanted ones) with a CII HiFocus 1 or HiRes 90 K HiFocus 1 J implant. Variations in cochlear diameter and cochlear canal size were analyzed. The relationship between the outer and inner walls was investigated. Size differences based on sex, age, and ear side were investigated using linear mixed models. Two new methods, spiral fitting and principal component analysis, were proposed to describe cochlear shape, and the goodness of fit was investigated. The relationship between cochlear shape and <b>electrode</b> <b>position,</b> in terms of modiolus proximity and insertion depth, was analyzed using clustering, {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) and simple linear regression analysis. Large variations in cochlear morphology were found, with cochlear canal sizes ranging from 0. 98 to 2. 96 nmm and average cochlear diameters between 8. 85 and 5. 92 nmm (with standard deviations of around 0. 4 nmm). The outer and inner walls were significantly correlated (p < 0. 01), and a size difference of 4 % in favor of males was found. Spiral fitting shows good alignment of the true measurements, with residuals having a mean of 0. 01 nmm and a standard deviation of 0. 29 nmm. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the use of one component, which describes size, is sufficient to explain 93. 6 % of the cochlear shape variance. A significant sex difference was also found with spiral fitting and PCA. Cochlear size was found to have a significant influence on modiolus proximity and insertion depth of the electrode (p < 0. 01). Cochlear size explained around 13 % of the variance in <b>electrode</b> <b>position.</b> When cochlear size was combined with surgical insertion, more than 81 % of the variance in insertion depth can be explained. This study demonstrates a large variety in cochlear morphology, which significantly impacts <b>electrode</b> <b>position</b> in terms of modiolus proximity and insertion depth. The effect size is, however, relatively small compared with surgical insertion distance. PCA is shown to be an accurate reduction method for describing cochlear shape...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{impedance}} tomography (EIT) {{has been}} investigated as a potential non-invasive method for breast cancer imaging {{for more than two}} decades. However, since EIT requires direct contact with the boundary, <b>electrode</b> <b>positioning</b> and boundary movement have always been considered as two of the sources of errors and artifacts. A breast can be deformed due to its natural structure. Therefore, if the breast is deformed on purpose, each deformation can provide one new set of independent EIT measurements data. More independent data provides more information from the same region of interest. In this hypothesis, information gathered with different deformations is combined, in all cases we assumed that shape and <b>electrode</b> <b>positions</b> measured by other means. Simulations have been carried out to verify the hypothesis, and results show improvements in the detectability of the early stage tumor in depth...|$|R
