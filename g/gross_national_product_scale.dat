We carry out diagnostic and stability tests, including linearity tests. A linear error-correction model with the monetary base performs better than a model with M 1. A specification with M 2 is not supported. We use real <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> as the <b>scale</b> variable and a short-term interest rate as the opportunity cost measure. We estimate an income elasticity of 0. 86 and an interest rate elasticity of - 0. 44 for the monetary base". ("JEL "E 41) Copyright 2006 Western Economic Association International. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{examine the}} long-run and short-run {{dynamics}} of the US <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> and petroleum imports {{for the last three}} decades. We find evidence of a long-run relationship between <b>gross</b> domestic <b>national</b> <b>product</b> and petroleum imports, but only a fragile one. Similarly there is a significant feedback (long-term) effect from petroleum imports to <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> and vice versa. This feedback is fairly significant. However, the short-term effect is highly significant, but there is a relatively slow response from the values of <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> to petroleum imports. Therefore, the link between US <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> and petroleum imports is fragile in the long run. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: All the postsocialist {{economies are}} {{suffering}} from a transition from a stable steady state or cycle into the chaotic region. Economic activity is much more erratic. The basic objectives of this paper were: first, to establish the logistic model of the <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> (GNP); second, {{to show how the}} dynamics for iterators to this model are the same as for the logistic equation, and third, to introduce the Phillips-Okun law into the model. The Phillips-Okun law was adopted. Within chaotic region the time path of real GNP is highly sensitive in variation in parameter values or initial values. The behaviour of the <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>product</b> is much less predictable.
