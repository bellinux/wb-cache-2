The station eventually separated from a simulcast and began running its own music programming from 6 a.m. to midnight. The station offered a beautiful music format {{but in the}} mid-1970s, it began playing Progressive type AOR format in the evenings, and was known as [...] "Rock 95 LIP-FM". By 1978, the station had converted to an all AOR format and changed its call letters to WJZQ. In the early 1980s, [...] "Rock 95" [...] changed to a Top 40/CHR format. In 1990, it became a Dance type Top 40 station, first as [...] "FM 95 WJZQ", and then later as [...] "Power 95 WJZQ". It returned to mainstream top 40 by late 1991/early 1992. The transition to [...] "Power 95" [...] was marked by playing a continuous loop of Snap's [...] "The Power" [...] for 24 hours without interruption or explanation. In September 1992, it became [...] "95 WIIL ROCK" [...] with a Classic rock format. For a short period {{in the summer of}} 2003, <b>WIIL</b> <b>was</b> renamed [...] "95.1 The Rock Station!", but returned to [...] "95 WIIL Rock" [...] not long after. In 2004, it took a more Active Rock direction, while continuing a Mainstream Rock format. In November 2009, the station shifted to a full-blown active rock format.|$|R
