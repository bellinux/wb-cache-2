5|$|On 3 August 2009, {{shortly after}} the death of former President Corazon Aquino, widow of Benigno Aquino, Jr., {{legislative}} measures have been filed calling for her official recognition as a national hero. Congresswoman Liwayway Vinzons-Chato filed a house resolution declaring Corazon Aquino a national hero. Although, a week after she filed the resolution, she realized that there is no Filipino historical figure declared through law. On 10 August 2009, she cited on her privilege speech in Congress the nine Filipino heroes recommended by National Heroes Committee in 1995. She then urge Congress to sign the resolutions declaring the nine Filipinos recommended by the National Heroes Committee plus Benigno Aquino, Jr. and Corazon Aquino as national heroes. Congressman Salvador Escudero interpellated Vinzons-Chato's speech and stated that heroes are made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> and minds of people and not through legislation. After the interpellation, it was moved by House of Representatives to refer the privilege speech of Vinzons-Chato to the Committee of Basic Education and Culture.|$|E

40|$|Cytomegalovirus-induced {{myocarditis}} {{is largely}} immune-mediated. BALB/c mice produced {{higher levels of}} IL- 4 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> indicative of a Th 2 -like response. Although IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 18, and TNF-α were produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> during acute infection, BALB/c mice lacked a substantial IL- 2 and IFN-γ response. Conversely, C 57 BL/ 6 mice produced significant levels of IFN-γ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> with no significant levels of IL- 4 or IL- 6, suggestive of a dominant Th 1 -like response to virus infection. IFN-α/β immunotherapy is known to suppress the development of MCMV-myocarditis. Cytokine secretion in IFN-stimulated MCMV-infected BALB/c myocytes {{was found to be}} IFN subtype-dependent with elevation of IL- 6 and IL- 18 levels. During the chronic phase of disease, IFNA 6 DNA treatment in vivo increased IL- 18 production <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart.</b> These results suggest that IFN subtype therapy may have immunomodulating effects in reducing disease severity in BALB/c mice via regulation of cytokine production <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart...</b>|$|R

25|$|KCNE2 was {{originally}} discovered to regulate hERG channel function. KCNE2 decreases marcoscopic and unitary current through hERG, and speeds hERG deactivation. hERG generates IKr, {{the most prominent}} repolarizing current in human ventricular cardiomyocytes. hERG, and IKr, are highly susceptible to block by a range of structurally diverse pharmacological agents. This property means that many drugs or potential drugs {{have the capacity to}} impair human ventricular repolarization, leading to drug-induced Long QT syndrome (LQTS). KCNE2 may also regulate hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) pacemaker channels in human heart and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> of other species, as well as the Cav1.2 voltage-gated calcium channel.|$|E

5000|$|SKKU's motto, [...] "Humanity, Righteousness, Propriety, and Wisdom" [...] (仁, 義, 禮, 智), {{reflects}} the basic spirit of Confucianism. These four cardinal virtues express humankind's four inherent elements of spirit, action, conscience, and intellect. Humanity abides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> that loves, righteousness abides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> that knows right from wrong, propriety abides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> that knows forbearance, and wisdom abides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> that perceives. Confucian philosophy attests to man's innate goodness, {{and at the}} same time recognizes that this quality must nevertheless be awakened and nurtured. These four principles, which comprise SKKU's educational philosophy, are the basis for higher education's goals of the search for truth and the establishment of social justice, which are, in turn, based on humanity.|$|R
25|$|Hearts {{collected}} no senior silverware in the inter war years. Tommy Walker {{joined the}} Hearts ground staff aged 16 in February 1932.

A talented and elegant inside-forward, Walker quickly earned a place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hearts</b> first team, helping the side to victory in the 1933 Jubilee edition of the Rosebery Charity Cup, in a season in which they finished 3rd in the league. He was a regular first team player by 1933–34 but despite some emphatic victories, inconsistent form limited Hearts to a sixth-place finish.|$|E

25|$|The synod {{teaches that}} the Word of God, both written and preached, and the Sacraments are means of grace {{through which the}} Holy Spirit gives the gift of God's grace, creates faith <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> of individuals, forgives sins {{for the sake of}} Christ's death on the cross, and grants eternal life and salvation. Many Missouri Synod Lutherans define a sacrament as an action instituted by Jesus that {{combines}} a promise in God's Word with a physical element, although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament. This means that some may disagree on the number of sacraments. All agree that Baptism and Communion are sacraments. Confession and absolution is called a sacrament in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession and so is also considered by many Lutherans to be a sacrament, because it was instituted by Christ and has His promise of grace, even though it is not tied to a physical element.|$|E
