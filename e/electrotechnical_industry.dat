From 1915 he {{was director of the}} Bund der Elektrizitätsversorgungs-Unternehmungen Deutschlands (the association of German power-generating utilities) at Berlin. From late 1916 until March 1918 he served as Kriegsreferent at the Reichsschatzamt (Imperial Treasury). In this position, he drafted the Kohlensteuergesetz (law on coal tax). In March 1918, Raumer along with Walther Rathenau and Carl Friedrich von Siemens created the Zentralverband der Deutschen elektrotechnischen Industrie (association of German <b>electrotechnical</b> <b>industry)</b> at Berlin.

As the Russian and Finnish power systems are asynchronous, a direct AC connection was not possible and a HVDC-back-to-back station was needed. It was decided to build the substation near Vyborg in the Karelian ASSR. The first unit of the substation was commissioned in December 1981 followed by the second unit in the autumn 1982 and the third unit in the summer 1984. The system was manufactured by the Ministry for <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Industry</b> of the USSR.

The dispute {{ended up in the}} longest strike in the <b>electrotechnical</b> <b>industry</b> in the Netherlands, which lastet for almost half a year and several court cases were held. The Dutch Union NVV (Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen) with chairman Arie Groenevelt [...] (quote: we will strike until the company ceases) [...] was not willing to amend their demands and as a result the company went into receivership. This made an ending to the Pelger era and 102 Fte's lost their jobs. The company received national notority, due to all the publicity. To continue the employment of the workers a foundation was raised, named Stichting voor behoud van Werkgelegenheid: Combinatie Machines Apparaten en Constructies, or in short COMBIMAC. In the committee of the foundation the following people were appointed: Mr. P.J.S. de Jong, former Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of Defense. Mr. A. Jellesma, director of company W. Hubert & Co. in Sneek and Mr. W. de Vries director of company Hydro-Holland in Meppel. The company continued with 35 Fte's. In 1976 Mr. P.W.

40|$|The {{permanent}} magnets {{which can be}} manufactured from rare earth base alloys have magnetic properties which substantially exceed the values obtained before with the Alnico and Ferrite magnets where the specific energy (from 3 to 6 times) and the resistance to de-magnetization (from 30 to 4 times) are concerned, but at a higher primary material cost (from 3 to 30 times). The extent that these materials penetrate into the <b>electrotechnical</b> and electrical <b>industries</b> will be governed by the volume of new applications they can create and the volume of old applications which they can improve or re-introduce. In the first instance, we examine how the essential physical properties : high magnetisation, strong anisotropy, higher than ambient Curie point, are obtained in the rare earth transition metal alloys. In the second instance, we see how the coercivity is created in the elementary crystals of these alloys, whether by resistance to the nucleation of a wall, or by opposition to its propagation. This is important : - on one hand, to differentiate between the two families now in competition, the magnet type SmCo 5 and the magnet type Sm(Co, Cu) z (z = 5 to 8. 5), - on the other hand, to try to forecast the type of substitution to employ on the rare earth or transition metals, {{as a means of}} introducing significant quantities of less expensive or more plentiful rare earths, without disturbing the coercivity too much. Finally, the manufacturing process is described : preparation of alloys by fusion or by co-reduction, milling, compression in a magnetic field, sintering, heat treatment, machining not forgetting magnetisation and de-magnetisation, the temperature stabilisation, the resistance to oxidation and temperature variations...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Silver, silver alloys, {{as well as}} silver matrix based {{composites}} {{have been}} well known and applied in the <b>electrotechnical</b> and electronics <b>industry</b> for several decades. For many applications in electrotechnology, including electric contacts and brushes, unreinforced sliver alloys {{do not meet the}} requirements concerning mainly durability and wear resistance, first of all to tribological and electroerosive wear. These wear processes may be prevented by introducing to silver reinforcement particles and alloys. The target of the research included basic mechanical properties determination of the silver matrix composites reinforced with ceramic particles, manufactured with the use of suspension methods. Design/methodology/approach: In the presented paper the authors demonstrate possibilities of manufacturing of silver matrix composites on the way of casting technology utilization. Findings: The results of the research prove that applied suspension technology, based on introducing of agglomerated foundry alloy which is the carrier for reinforcement particles (SiC lub Al 2 O 3) allows to produce in an effective and, what is important, in an economically attractive way, sliver alloys based composites. Research limitations/implications: The researches on the structure of manufactured composites and their mechanical properties that are presented in the paper prove the possibilities of mechanical mixing technology application for producing mechanical and stable connection between silver matrix and ceramic particles of aluminium oxide and silicon carbide. Originality/value: The manufacturing of this type of composites is based most of all on the utilization of powder metallurgy techniques.

Due to their toxicity and persistence under natural conditions "denser-than-water" non aqueous phase liquids are substantial threats to the subsurface environment as well as the surface ecosystems including human beings. During the last two decades a number of technical solutions has been presented to enhance the situation of contaminated areas. One of the more recently established concepts are permeable reactive barriers. Permeable reactive barriers are passive in situ treatment zones containing a reactive material suitable to remove the contamination from the groundwater. They are installed downgradient from the pollution source perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction to immobilise or degrade the dissolved pollutants in the groundwater as it flows through. This project was organised in two main parts. The first part assessed seven different iron powders in batch experiments to determine the most efficient powder in terms of degradation velocity. The second part of the study employed this powder in a column experiment using different mixing ratios with sand to evaluate its performance under simulated subsurface conditions in a permeable reactive barrier. The aim of this experiment was to obtain a more detailed description of the behaviour and performance of the selected material. In the batch experiment the most promissing iron powder produced a half-life of tetrachloroethylene of 2. 36 h. The column study demonstrated that cis-dichloroethylene has the longest half-life compared to tetrachlorethylene and trichloroethylene with 1. 65 h.
