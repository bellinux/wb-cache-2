The immediate consequence of this high directivity, coupled with the high <b>free</b> <b>space</b> <b>loss</b> at these frequencies, is the possibility of a more efficient use of frequencies for point-to-multipoint applications. Since a greater number of highly directive antennas can be placed in a given area, the net result is greater frequency reuse, and higher density of users.

5000|$|Millimeter waves {{propagate}} {{solely by}} line-of-sight paths, {{they are not}} reflected by the ionosphere nor do they travel along the Earth as ground waves as lower frequency radio waves do. [...] At typical power densities they are blocked by building walls and suffer significant attenuation passing through foliage. [...] Absorption by atmospheric gases is a significant factor throughout the band and increases with frequency. However it is maximum at a few specific absorption lines, mainly those of oxygen at 60 GHz and water vapor at 24 GHz and 184 GHz. [...] At frequencies in the [...] "windows" [...] between these absorption peaks, millimeter waves have much less atmospheric attenuation and greater range, so many applications use these frequencies. Millimeter wavelengths are the same order of size as raindrops, so precipitation causes additional attenuation due to scattering (rain fade) as well as absorption. [...] The high <b>free</b> <b>space</b> <b>loss</b> and atmospheric absorption limits useful propagation to a few kilometers. Thus, they are useful for densely packed communications networks such as personal area networks that improve spectrum utilization through frequency reuse.|$|E

The <b>free</b> <b>space</b> <b>loss</b> equation has been modzjied to include all atmospheric attenuation and fading effects that cannot be neglected over the range of frequency of interest. Terrain profiles along all directions of interest within the coastal areas and inland areas for four benchmark cases have been analyzed in detail.

30|$|Since the <b>free</b> <b>space</b> {{propagation}} <b>loss</b> {{scales as}} {{the square of}} the carrier frequency, the mmWave communications in the 60 GHz band suffers severe attenuation. The <b>free</b> <b>space</b> propagation <b>loss</b> at 60 GHz is 28 dB more than that at 2.4 GHz [3]. Therefore, the mmWave communications range is limited, and it is mainly applied in short-range indoor communications, such as wireless personal area networks (WPANs). To combat the severe propagation loss, the high gain directional antenna is commonly implemented at both the transmitter and receiver. As a result of directional listening and transmission, the deafness problem occurs when applying the carrier sense to avoid contentions within current transmissions. Besides, the multi-user interference (MUI) is relatively low, thus more concurrent transmissions can be supported to further increase the network capacity [4]. However, multiple communication links transmitting in the same time slot would lead to a high MUI, which might decrease the network throughput. Further, it is beneficial to employ multi-hop for transmission when the direct link is suffering low channel quality [1, 5]. Therefore, how to schedule appropriate concurrent transmissions to improve the network throughput is a significant and challenging issue.|$|R
40|$|Optical fibers confine {{and guide}} light almost unattenuated and thus convey light forces to polarizable nano-particles over very long distances. Radiation {{pressure}} forces arise from scattering of guided photons into <b>free</b> <b>space</b> while gradient forces {{are based on}} coherent scattering between different fiber modes or propagation directions. Interestingly, even scattering between co-propagating modes induces longitudinal forces as the transverse confinement of the light modes creates mode dependent longitudinal wave-vectors and photon momenta. We generalize a proven scattering matrix based approach to calculate single as well as inter-particle forces to include several forward and backward propagating modes. We show that an injection of the higher order mode only in a two mode fiber will induce a stationary tractor force against the injection direction, when the mode coupling to the lower order mode dominates against backscattering and <b>free</b> <b>space</b> <b>losses.</b> Generically this arises for non-absorbing particles {{at the center of}} a waveguide.
