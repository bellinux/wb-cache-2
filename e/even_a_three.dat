Acting Secretary David Henshaw faced a dilemma. His budget could not support such a cost, yet he could not allow the country's favorite ship to deteriorate. He turned to Captain John Percival, known in the service as [...] "Mad Jack". The captain traveled to Virginia and conducted his own survey of the ship's needs. He reported that the necessary repairs and upgrades could be done {{at a cost of}} $10,000. On 6 November, Henshaw told Percival to proceed without delay, but stay within his projected figure.

He left New York at the end of May 1844. Before the voyage ended in Boston 495 days later, the ship sailed 52,370.5 miles, circumventing the globe for the only time in her illustrious career.|$|E

I call it ideal because {{the quality of the}} frequency approximation that it makes is maximized, and it extends the range of its frequency scaling factor to all the rational numbers between zero and one.

I designed the ideal rate multiplier as a method for easily producing just tempered musical intervals. <b>Even</b> <b>a</b> <b>three</b> bit ideal rate multiplier produces many recognizable musical intervals.

In such a case the standard Weibull distributions are no more suitable to describe the peaks population, which presents a multi-modal form.

This paper {{shows the}} robust non {{existence}} of competitive equilibria <b>even</b> in <b>a</b> simple <b>three</b> period representative agent economy with dynamically inconsis-tent preferences. We distinguish between a sophisticated and naive representative agent.

Therefore, even allowing for negative prices, the market clearing allocation is not {{contained in the}} convex hull of demand. Finally, with a naive representative agent, we show that perfect foresight is incompatible with market clearing and individual optimization at given prices. JEL Classification: D 50, D 91...|$|R

The hybrid method {{is applied to the}} analysis of sound radiation from open pipes, or ducts, and uses mode matching to couple a finite element discretization of the region surrounding the open end of the duct to wave based modal expansions for adjoining interior and exterior regions. The hybrid method facilitates the analysis of ducts of arbitrary but uniform cross section as well the study of conical flanges and here a modal expansion based on spherical harmonics is applied. Predictions are benchmarked against analytic solutions for the limiting cases of flanged and unflanged circular ducts and excellent agreement between the two methods is observed. Predictions are also presented for flanged and unflanged rectangular ducts, and because the hybrid method retains the sparse banded and symmetric matrices of the traditional finite element method, it is shown that predictions can be obtained within an acceptable time frame <b>even</b> for <b>a</b> <b>three</b> dimensional problem.
