25|$|The {{move away}} from big labels and big budgets paradoxically brought a bigger {{marketing}} push and healthier sales. Thompson's first two self-funded releases, 2003's The Old <b>Kit</b> <b>Bag</b> and 2005's Front Parlour Ballads, did well in the indie charts {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. In May 2007 Thompson released Sweet Warrior. The album was licensed to different labels in different territories: Shout! Factory in the USA, P-Vine in Japan, Planet Records in Australia, and Proper Records in the UK and Europe. In August of the same year Island released a live Richard and Linda Thompson album, compiled from recordings made during the November 1975 tour to promote the Pour Down Like Silver album.|$|E
25|$|The {{refugees}} {{were transferred to}} the cruise ship Neuralia, which had been taken into war service. The Czechs looked to smuggle Ant between the two ships by hiding him in a <b>kit</b> <b>bag.</b> This failed as the dog pushed {{his head out of}} the bag just as they were boarding – fortunately for Ant the new crew seemed happy to have a dog on-board and welcomed him. The facilities on Neuralia were much better than Northmoor, as the cabins remained fitted out as a cruise ship and Ant could stay in the cabin with the men. The remainder of the voyage went smoothly, until Bozděch was informed about the quarantine rules for dogs upon entering the United Kingdom. Having no money with which to pay for the quarantine fees, the Czechs sought once again to smuggle him – this time into the UK. They elected to hide Ant once again in a bag, this time mixed up in those being transferred as cargo by crane. They arrived at the docks in Liverpool on 12 July, where they successfully took Ant ashore. They were nearly found out by a pair of military police as they were at the train station nearby as {{they were on their way}} to Cholmondeley, Cheshire.|$|E

500|$|Friday {{was marked}} {{during the game}} by Mark Lawrenson, who so {{frustrated}} the Cardiff forward with his close attention that Friday waited for Lawrenson to attempt a slide tackle and then {{kicked him in the}} face. After receiving a red card, Friday left the ground with the game still going on; according to legend, before leaving he broke into the Brighton dressing room and defecated in Lawrenson's <b>kit</b> <b>bag.</b> Cardiff eventually lost 4–0. [...] "I am sick and tired of it", Andrews told the South Wales Echo on 1 November. [...] "To be sent off in his first game back is as much as a man can stand". Friday was transfer-listed and served a three-match suspension before making his final appearance on 10 December in Cardiff's 6–3 away defeat against Bolton. Liza was by now the mother of Friday's second daughter, Arabella, but around this time began divorce proceedings. Friday claimed that he had had enough of people telling him what to do, and walked into Andrews's office on 20 December 1977 to announce that he was retiring from professional football. The club promptly released him and cancelled his contract.|$|E

He slept in Oakland that night, and on Sunday covered the seventy miles back. And on Monday morning, weary, he began the new week's work, but he had kept sober.|$|E

60|$|He {{had come}} and {{disappeared}} in almost record time, but, brief though his passing had been, it had been long enough to bring consolation to Archie. A sudden bright light had been vouchsafed to Archie, and he now saw an admirably ripe and fruity scheme for ending his troubles. What could be simpler than to toddle down one flight of stairs and in an easy and debonair manner ask the chappie's permission to use his telephone? And what could be simpler, once {{he was at the}} 'phone, than {{to get in touch with}} somebody at the Cosmopolis who would send down a few trousers and what not in a <b>kit</b> <b>bag.</b> It was a priceless solution, thought Archie, as he made his way downstairs. Not even embarrassing, he meant to say. This chappie, living in a place like this, wouldn't bat an eyelid at the spectacle of a fellow trickling about the place in a bathing suit. They would have a good laugh about the whole thing.|$|E
6000|$|After {{a moment}} GEORGE {{goes over to}} the extreme left hand corner of [...] the room, where several {{articles}} are piled.

[...] with his monogram, a small travelling pillow with his monogram, a [...] linen toilet case embroidered in blue, to hang on the wall--these [...] last evidently presents from admiring lady friends. Finally he [...] brings forth a large rubber life preserving suit. He makes a show [...] of putting all these things in the bag, including the life- [...] preserving suit; and reveals a certain sentiment, not too deep, for [...] the pillow, the pincushion and the toilet case. At length he strews [...] everything over the floor, and is surveying the litter with mock [...] despair when a girl appears on the lawn outside, through one of the [...] windows. She throws into the room a small parcel wrapped in tissue [...] paper, and disappears. GEORGE picks up the parcel and looks [...] surprised, and suddenly runs out of the door, upper right. He [...] presently returns, dragging the girl by the wrists, she resisting.|$|E

50|$|During {{the years}} of the First World War, M. Cooper (Overalls), which by then {{employed}} over 600 people, halted production of workwear and began making uniforms, <b>kit</b> <b>bags</b> and rucksacks for the British Army. In 1937, a new factory dedicated to the manufacture of denim was opened in Stratford, with the business reporting a profit of £1,000 by year end. The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 led Morris Cooper to split the business into two: one arm continued making workwear, while the other concentrated on producing military uniforms, battle fatigues and flight overalls. M. Cooper (Overalls) eventually became one of the biggest suppliers to His Majesty's Armed Forces.|$|R

50|$|Some of the {{techniques}} used by the inmates were ingenious and not too dissimilar {{to those in the}} war film The Great Escape about Allied POWs. Excavating the tunnels was not easy because of the heavy clay soil upon which the camp was built. Cans, meat tins, and even knives from the canteen were used as digging implements. The soil was hauled out of the tunnel on a makeshift skip and put into <b>kit</b> <b>bags.</b> At first, prisoners carried the soil in their pockets to the long-jump pit or garden plots. Others kneaded clay into balls and dropped them through a hole in a false wall they had constructed in an unused room in one of the huts. To support the tunnel roof, oak benches were stolen from the canteen and bed legs were cut down when supplies of wood were depleted. A ventilation pipeline was made from condensed milk tins; air was forced through by a hand-operated fan. The tunnel even had its own electric lights, tapped off the mains supply. Noise was concealed by chorus singing.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "Bug-Out Bag" [...] {{is related}} to, and {{possibly}} derived from, the [...] "bail-out bag" [...] emergency kit many military aviators carry.

They were directed to [...] "bug out" [...] when being overrun was imminent. The concept passed into wide usage among other military and law enforcement personnel, though the [...] "bail-out bag" [...] is as likely to include emergency gear for going into an emergency situation as for escaping an emergency.
