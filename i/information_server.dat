2500|$|Internet Information Services (IIS, {{formerly}} Internet <b>Information</b> <b>Server)</b> is an extensible {{web server}} created by Microsoft {{for use with}} the Windows NT family. IIS supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SMTP and NNTP. [...] It has been {{an integral part of}} the Windows NT family since Windows NT 4.0, though it may be absent from some editions (e.g. Windows XP Home edition), and is not active by default.|$|E
2500|$|MDAC 1.0 {{was first}} {{released}} in August 1996. According to Microsoft, [...] "MDAC 1.0 existed more as concept than a coordinated, stand-alone setup program." [...] The MDAC 1.0 stack consisted of ODBC 3.0, OLE DB 1.1, ADO 1.0, and the Advanced Data Connector (ADC) 1.0 [...] {{which according to}} Microsoft was the precursor to the Remote Data Service of MDAC 1.5. It also included ODBC drivers for Access/Jet, SQL Server and Oracle databases. MDAC 1.0 was released via several mechanisms: the Advanced Data Connector shipped with Internet <b>Information</b> <b>Server</b> (IIS) 3.0 and as a downloadable cab file; OLE DB 1.1 and ADO 1.0 shipped with the OLE DB 1.1 SDK, which came with Visual Studio 97 and was also downloadable. MDAC 1.0 came with Active Server Pages, that itself came in IIS 3.0, and also came with Visual InterDev 1.0.|$|E
2500|$|Microsoft script {{technologies}} including VBScript and JScript {{were released}} in 1996. JScript, a reverse-engineered implementation of Netscape's JavaScript, {{was part of}} Internet Explorer 3. [...] JScript was also available for server-side scripting in Internet <b>Information</b> <b>Server.</b> Internet Explorer 3 also included Microsoft's first support for CSS and various extensions to HTML, but in each case the implementation was noticeably different to that found in Netscape Navigator at the time. These differences {{made it difficult for}} designers and programmers to make a single website work well in both browsers, leading to the use of [...] "best viewed in Netscape" [...] and [...] "best viewed in Internet Explorer" [...] logos that characterized these early years of the browser wars. JavaScript began to acquire a reputation for being one of the roadblocks to a cross-platform and standards-driven Web. Some developers took on the difficult task of trying to make their sites work in both major browsers, but many could not afford the time. With the release of Internet Explorer 4, Microsoft introduced the concept of Dynamic HTML, but the differences in language implementations and the different and proprietary Document Object Models remained and were obstacles to widespread take-up of JavaScript on the Web.|$|E
40|$|Most wide-area <b>information</b> <b>servers</b> are {{instrumented}} {{to collect}} statistics about documents that clients retrieve. However, instrumenting wide-area <b>information</b> <b>servers</b> presents a limited picture of client access patterns. To characterize client patterns that involve several protocols and many servers in a wide-area information system, {{it is necessary}} to instrument clients as well as servers. Precise characterization of client access patterns can be used effectively to decrease network load, server load, and client access latency. This report describes a tracing facility for collecting wide-area information access patterns.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system that}} provides query based associative access to the contents of distributed <b>information</b> <b>servers.</b> In typical distributed information systems {{there are so many}} objects that underconstrained queries can produce large result sets and extraordinary processing costs. To deal with this scaling problem we use content labels to permit users to learn about available resources and to formulate queries with adequate discriminatory power. We have implemented associative access to a distributed set of <b>information</b> <b>servers</b> in the content routing system. A content routing system is a hierarchy of servers called content routers that present a single query based image of a distributed information system. We have successfully used a prototype content routing system to locate documents on several user le systems and on a large number of <b>information</b> <b>servers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{predominant}} use of point-to-point {{communication protocols}} {{on the global}} Internet, combined with the communication patterns imposed by the World Wide Web, make inefficient use of the Internet's increasingly scarce network bandwidth.

40|$|Advances {{in digital}} signal {{processing}} technology {{make it possible to}} embed the low-level functions performed by a video surveillance system into cameras. The result is metadata cameras, like MPEG- 7 cameras, that provide descriptions of what they see in the form of XML documents served over a network. We use this concept to build video <b>information</b> <b>servers</b> that are conceptually similar to MPEG- 7 cameras, but differ in that they interact with client applications and can be configured dynamically to perform different functions. We demonstrate the use of these video <b>information</b> <b>servers</b> in some simple surveillance applications. Dynamic configuration of the servers allows them to do more than describe video content. For example, we present a functioning surveillance system, built with content description servers, that describes the activity in a hockey game based on the observations of several cameras. Thus, we demonstrate that content description servers provide building blocks with which to create networked video surveillance systems.
