40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this Master thesis was to establish an optimized ethanol organosolv pretreatment of Norway spruce (Picea abies) for bioethanol production (63 wt% EtOH, pH~ 3. 5 in aqueous phase, 170 - 240 &# 176;C, 90 min) utilizing hydrolytic enzymes in the saccharification. Focus in the ethanol organosolv pretreatment was on achieving a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> with minimal degradation of cellulose. To test the generality of the method, a series of ethanol organosolv pretreatments were also to be performed on sugarcane bagasse (50 wt% EtOH, pH~ 3. 5 in aqueous phase, 155 - 210 &# 176;C, 90 - 120 min). The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> increased with increasing temperature during pretreatment, the fastest increase was observed with sugarcane bagasse. Two reactor modes were utilized in the pretreatment of Norway spruce. Still, {{the use of a}} regular batch reactor achieved the highest <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification.</b> The maximum <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> of ~ 66 % was reached at ~ 235 &# 176;C for Norway spruce, while sugarcane bagasse reached ~ 82 % at ~ 210 &# 176;C. Cellulose was subjected to degradation (5 - 10 percentage points) at these temperatures. This was not desired. Sequential enzymatic hydrolysis (30 FPU/g cellulose, 32 pNPGU/g cellulose, 50 &# 176;C, 48 hrs) of ethanol organosolv pretreated biomass achieved complete conversion for both rawmaterials at the highest degrees of delignification. SEM analyses of the ethanol organosolv pretreated biomass indicated reprecipitation of spherical lignin particles on Norway spruce pretreated at high temperatures. </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{characterize}} chemically and morphologically elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum), and evaluate the potential of its fibers for production of printing and writing paper grade pulp. The elephant grass was chemically and morphologically characterized and cooked by the soda process to two different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> (kappa 17. 5 and 10. 6). The resulting pulps were fully bleached by the O-D*-(EP) -D sequence and characterized for their beatability, drainability and physical-mechanical properties. The lignin content (20. 2 %) was low, indicating that this grass should be easier to pulp. The morphological analyses of the elephant grass indicated a short fiber material, similar to hardwoods. The soda pulp from elephant grass cooked to kappa number 17. 5 presented higher screened yield than 10. 6 kappa pulp, with alkali demands of 15. 0 % and 20. 0 %, respectively. The total active chlorine required by the 17. 5 and 10. 6 kappa pulps, were 42. 1 and 35. 1 kg/odt pulp, respectively, to achieve an ISO brightness of approximately 90. 0 %. The bleached soda pulps cooked to 17. 5 and 10. 6 kappa number showed similar refinability and resistance to drainage, but the tensile and burst index were highest for the 17. 5 kappa pulp at beating energy consumptions in the range of 0 - 6 Wh. It was concluded that both 10. 6 and 17. 5 kappa pulps from elephant grass are suitable for the production of printing and writing paper grade pulps, but the highest kappa 17. 5 pulp is more economically attractive given its highest pulping yield, despite the significantly increased of chemical demand for bleaching A produção de papel para impressão e escrita Grau de celulose a partir de capim-elefante...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the major}} factors {{affecting}} the ability of F. oxysporum to produce bioethanol from straw is the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> straw <b>delignification</b> (Christakopoulos et al. 1991 a). It {{should be noted that}} this study differs from many others in that the focus was on the ability of strains of the fungus F. oxysporum to release bioethanol from unprocessed wheat straw. The performance of filamentous fungi in lignocellulosic bioconversion is affected by various culture conditions (Singh et al. 1992) and thus we set out to determine the optimal conditions for F. oxysporum-mediated bioconversion of non-alkali-treated straw to bioethanol. As reported earlier by Christakopoulos et al. (1991 a), a combination of aerobic and non-aerobic growth phases is necessary for the F. oxysporum-mediated biodegradation of straw and fermentation of the resulting sugars to bioethanol. Previous studies suggested that the source of nitrogen in the minimal media {{plays an important role in}} the both the production of cellulase by Clostridium thermocellum (Garcia-Martinez et al. 1980) and anaerobic growth and product formation by S. cerevisiae (Albers et al. 1996).

40|$|Single {{stage and}} {{two-stage}} sodium sulfite cooking {{were carried out}} on either spruce, pine or pure pine heartwood chips to investigate the influence of several process parameters on the initial phase of such a cook down to about 60 % pulp yield. The cooking experiments were {{carried out in the}} laboratory with either a lab-prepared or a mill-prepared cooking acid and the temperature and time were varied. The influences of dissolved organic and inorganic components in the cooking liquor on the final pulp composition and on the extent of side reactions were investigated. Kinetic equations were developed and the activation energies for delignification and carbohydrate dissolution were calculated using the Arrhenius equation. A better understanding <b>of</b> the <b>delignification</b> mechanisms during bisulfite and acid sulfite cooking was obtained by analyzing the lignin carbohydrate complexes (LCC) present in the pulp when different cooking conditions were used. It was found that using a mill-prepared cooking acid beneficial effect with respect to side reactions, extractives removal and higher stability in pH during the cook were observed compared to a lab-prepared cooking acid. However, no significant difference in <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> or carbohydrate degradation was seen.  The cellulose yield was not affected in the initial phase of the cook however; temperature had an influence on the rates <b>of</b> both <b>delignification</b> and hemicellulose removal. It was also found that the  corresponding activation energies increased in the order:  xylan, glucomannan, lignin and cellulose. The cooking temperature could thus be used to control the cook to a given carbohydrate composition in the final pulp. Lignin condensation reactions were observed during acid sulfite cooking, especially at higher temperatures. The LCC studies indicated the existence of covalent bonds between lignin and hemicellulose components with respect to xylan and glucomannan. LCC in native wood showed the presence of phenyl glycosides, ϒ-esters and α-ethers; whereas the α-ethers  were affected during sulfite pulping. The existence of covalent bonds between lignin and wood polysaccharides might be the rate-limiting factor in sulfite pulping. The sulfite pulping process is today practised in {{only a small number of}} pulp mills around the globe and the number of sulfite mills that use sodium as the base (cation) is less than five. However, due to the increasing interest in the wood based biorefinery concept, the benefits of sulfite pulping and especially the sodium based variety, has recently gained a lot of interest. It was therefore considered to be of high importance to further study the sodium based sulfite process to investigate if its benefits could be better utilized in the future in the production of dissolving pulps. Of specific interest was to investigate how the pulping conditions in the initial part of the cook (≥ 60 % pulp yield) should be performed in the best way. Thus, this thesis is focused on the initial phase of sodium based single stage bisulfite, acid sulfite and two-stage sulfite cooking of either 100 % spruce, 100 % pine or 100 % pine heartwood chips. The cooking experiments were carried out with either a lab prepared or a mill prepared cooking acid and the temperature and cooking time were varied. Activation energies for different wood components were investigated as well as side reactions concerning the formation of thiosulfate.

40|$|For a {{delignification}} {{reaction to}} occur, cooking chemicals must be {{transported to the}} reaction site. After fragmentation reactions in the lignin structure, lignin fragments need to be solubilised in order to diffuse out of the fibre wall and complete the complicated delignification reaction. Despite major research efforts, there are still several aspects of this complex process that are not fully understood. This study {{is part of a}} larger investigation aimed at increasing the knowledge of the reaction kinetics of a kraft cook. In the present paper, different aspects of reaction kinetics <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> and approaches to the modelling <b>of</b> kraft <b>delignification</b> are discussed. In the experimental part, the effect of active chemical concentrations on the reaction kinetics <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> <b>of</b> Scots pine (Pinus silvestris) was investigated at five temperature levels. Cooks with the addition of an industrial softwood black liquor and increased sodium ion concentration were also performed. To minimise the influence of mass transport on the reaction rates, wood meal was used as a substrate and all cooks were conducted at a high liquor-to-wood ratio (200 : 1) to minimise the deviation from initial bulk concentrations. The rate <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> in the kraft cook increased with increasing hydrosulphide ion and hydroxide ion concentrations. An increase in sodium ion concentration retarded the rate <b>of</b> <b>delignification,</b> while an increase in concentration of dissolved kraft lignin in the cooking liquor increased the delignification rate during the main part of the cook. These results qualitatively resemble many of the results found in the literature.

Published only in printed form, {{availability}} see BibidOxygen delignification (O-delignification) is {{an important}} tool for improving yield, reducing lignin content of pulp and lowering the bleach chemical consumption in the pulp and paper industries. This process is designed after cooking to maximize the delignification rate in comparison to {{the final phase of}} Kraft cooking without sacrificing pulp quality. In order to improve the yield of O-delignification, combinations of different approaches were tested in this study. The first was to introduce a high kappa number Kraft pulp into the O-delignification stage to take advantage of the higher yield-delignification selectivity of O-delignification compared to that of the final stage of Kraft cooking. Another was to keep the alkali concentration at a relatively low but constant level throughout the O-delignification stage to minimize the cellulose degradation during delignification. This was achieved by using a flow-through reactor (FT-R)  configuration. A high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> (> 76 %) was achieved at low alkali but high concentration of dissolved oxygen. In addition, reaction kinetic models for delignification and cellulose degradation were proposed for FT-R oxygen delignification of high kappa number pulps to allow optimization of the delignification and selectivity of the oxygen stage to reach a target kappa number.  Finally, to avoid excessive cellulose degradation at higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> over 76 %, the addition of different viscosity-preserving chemicals was examined while the temperature was raised to a higher level than that during conventional oxygen delignification (110 - 115 deg C).

40|$|Biological {{upgrading}} {{of wheat}} straw by the white-rot fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Pleurotus eryngii, Phlebia radiata, and Ceriporiopsis subvermispora was monitored during 60 -day solid-state fermentation. Analysis of straw included determination of {{weight loss and}} lignin content, color analysis, and infrared spectroscopy, whereas the studies on the water-soluble fractions were carried out by infrared spectroscopy, elementary analyses and quantification of the total phenols and reducing sugars. The most selective degradation of lignin was produced by P. eryngii and especially by C. subvermispora, the former species releasing {{the greatest amount of}} colored water-soluble products, whereas an increase in straw brightness was caused by C. subvermispora. In general, the composition of the water-soluble fraction correlated with the extent of straw transformation. The initial fermentation stage (0 - 15 days) was characterized by the accumulation of water-soluble products from lignin degradation and fungal metabolism, the concentration of which tended to stabilize in the second stage (16 - 60 days). The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> at the second stage tended to coincide with the decrease of the water-soluble nitrogen. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the role of oxygen on the selectivity of chlorine dioxide in the pre-delignification stage of a E. globulus pulp bleaching plant. Its main purpose is to study the selectivity of chlorine dioxide when applied to an oxygen pre-delignified hardwood kraft pulp and to compare it to that of a conventional pre-delignification with chlorine dioxide (D). The intrinsic viscosity and kappa number were used to follow the polysaccharides degradation and the delignification rates. In an oxygen stage (O), the selectivity varies with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification.</b> In the initial fast phase of reaction it exhibits values similar to those of chlorine dioxide in a conventional pre-delignification stage (D), although it diminishes drastically in the second, slow phase of reaction. On the other hand, chlorine dioxide in a conventional pre-delignification stage (D) is a very selective agent and its selectivity remains practically constant along the process. Moreover, it's shown that it is independent of the initial viscosity and kappa number of pulp. However, when chlorine dioxide is applied to a previously oxygen delignified pulp, its selectivity decreases gradually with the extent of delignification in the preceding oxygen stage. The experiments suggest that the global selectivity of an OD sequence with Eucalyptus globulus kraft pulp can be improved if the delignification with oxygen is limited to the fast phase of reaction, which corresponds to the first 5 − 10 min of reaction.

40|$|The kraft pulps {{produced}} from heartwood and sapwood of Eucalyptus globulus at 130 degrees C, 150 degrees C, and 170 degrees C {{were characterized by}} wet chemistry (total lignin as sum of Klason and soluble lignin fractions) and pyrolysis (total lignin denoted as py-lignin). The total lignin content obtained with both methods was similar. In the course <b>of</b> <b>delignification,</b> the py-lignin values were higher (by 2 to 5 %) compared to Klason values, which {{is in line with}} the importance of soluble lignin for total lignin determination. Pyrolysis analysis presents advantages over wet chemical procedures, and it can be applied to wood and pulps to determine lignin contents at different stages <b>of</b> the <b>delignification</b> process.

In the present papers the authors treated the experimnts {{carried out to}} find out the proportional relation between the Cellulase of bacteria and that in the body of ship-worm with the following results. (See Table 1, 2, Fig. 1, 2). In the two prepared enzymes extrected from the ship-worm liver and from bacteria, the activity of Xylanase was more effective than in the case of other Polyase, the action of Protease and Lipase being very faint. The existence of Catalase in the bacteria was not confirmed. As to the enzymatic hydrolysis of various cellulose by these tow Cellulases, the regenerated cellulose (e. g. filter paper and Soda-pulp) was decomposed far more easily than the native cellulose (e. g. absorbent cotton), and the action of them to the woods was showed to be done in proportion to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> powdering and <b>delignification.</b> The optimum pH of bacterial Cellulase was found to be 6. 4 and that of ship-worm enzyme to lie at the tow points of 5. 6 and 6. 6.

40|$|A {{catalytic}} lignocellulose biorefinery {{process is}} presented, valorizing both polysaccharide and lignin components into {{a handful of}} chemicals. To that end, birch sawdust is efficiently delignified through simultaneous solvolysis and catalytic hydrogenolysis {{in the presence of}} a Ru on carbon catalyst (Ru/C) in methanol under a H- 2 atmosphere at elevated temperature, resulting in a carbohydrate pulp and a lignin oil. The lignin oil yields above 50 % of phenolic monomers (mainly 4 -n-propylguaiacol and 4 -n-propylsyringol) and about 20 % of a set of phenolic dimers, relative to the original lignin content, next to phenolic oligomers. The structural features of the lignin monomers, dimers and oligomers were identified by a combination of GC/MS, GPC and 2 D HSQC NMR techniques, showing interesting functionalities for forthcoming polymer applications. The effect of several key parameters like temperature, reaction time, wood particle size, reactor loading, catalyst reusability and the influence of solvent and gas were examined in view of the phenolic product yield, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> and the sugar retention as a first assessment of the techno-economic feasibility of this biorefinery process. The separated carbohydrate pulp contains up to 92 % of the initial polysaccharides, with a nearly quantitative retention of cellulose. Pulp valorization was demonstrated by its chemocatalytic conversion to sugar polyols, showing the multiple use of Ru/C, initially applied in the hydrogenolysis process. Various lignocellulosic substrates, including genetically modified lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, were finally processed in the hydrogenolytic biorefinery, indicating lignocellulose rich in syringyl-type lignin, as found in hardwoods, as the ideal feedstock for the production of chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Various ionic liquids {{have been}} {{identified}} as effective pretreatment solvents that can enhance the cellulose digestibility of lignocellulose by removing lignin, one of the main factors contributing to the recalcitrant nature of lignocellulose. 1 -Butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium methylsulfate ([BMiM]MeSO 4) is a potential delignification reagent, hence its application as a pretreatment solvent for sugarcane bagasse (SB) was investigated. The study also evaluated the benefit of an acid catalyst (i. e., H 2 SO 4) and the effect of pretreatment conditions, which varied within a time and temperature range of 0 - 240 min and 50 - 150 °C, respectively. The use of an acid catalyst contributed to a more digestible solid and a higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification.</b> However, the [BMiM]MeSO 4 -H 2 SO 4 combination failed to produce a fully digestible solid, as a maximum cellulose digestibility of 77 % (w/w) was obtained at the optimum pretreatment condition of 125 °C for 120 min. Furthermore, up to half of the lignin content could be extracted during pretreatment, while simultaneously extensive, sometimes complete, removal of xylan, the presence of which, also hampers cellulose digestibility. Hence, [BMiM]MeSO 4 has been identified an effective pretreatment solvent for SB as the application thereof both significantly improved digestibility, and simultaneously removed two of the main factors contributing to the recalcitrant nature of lignocellulose. As xylan and lignin have potential value as precursor chemicals, the existing process may in future be extended toward substrate fractionation, a biorefinery concept where value is added to all feedstock constituents. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Alkaline sulfite/anthraquinone (ASA) cooking of Pinus radiata and Pinus caribaea {{wood chips}} {{followed}} by disk refining {{was used as}} a pretreatment for the production of low lignified and high fibrillated pulps. The pulps produced with different delignification degrees and refined at different energy inputs (250, 750 and 1600 Wh) were saccharified with cellulases and fermented to ethanol with Saccharomyces cerevisiae using separated hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) or semi-simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSSF) processes. RESULTS: Delignification of ASA pulps was between 25 % and 50 %, with low glucans losses. Pulp yield was from 70 to 78 % for pulps of P. radiata and 60 % for the pulp of P. caribaea. Pulps obtained after refining were evaluated in assays of enzymatic hydrolysis. Glucans-to-glucose conversion varied from 20 to 70 %, depending on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>delignification</b> and fibrillation of the pulps. The best ASA pulp of P. radiata was used in SHF and SSSF experiments of ethanol production. Such experiments produced maximum ethanol concentration of 20 g L- 1, which represented roughly 90 % of glucose conversion and an estimated amount of 260 L ethanol ton(- 1) wood. P. caribaea pulp also presented good performance in the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation but, due to the low amount of cellulose present, only 140 L ethanol would be obtained from each ton of wood. CONCLUSION: ASA cooking followed by disk refining was shown to be an efficient pretreatment process, which generated a low lignified and high-fibrillated substrate that allowed the production of ethanol from the softwoods with high conversion yields.
