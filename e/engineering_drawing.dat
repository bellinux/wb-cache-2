25|$|The primary graphic motifs of constructivism {{were the}} {{rectangular}} {{bar and the}} triangular wedge, others were the more basic geometries of the square and the circle. In his series Prouns, El Lizzitzky assembled collections of geometries at various angles floating free in space. They evoke basic structural units such as bars of steel or sawn lumber loosely attached, piled, or scattered. They were also often drafted and share aspects with technical drawing and <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing.</b> Similar in composition is the deconstructivist series Micromegas by Daniel Libeskind.|$|E

He still continued in the Citizen Military Forces with the 40th Battalion, and was assigned {{from time to time}} with the 6th Military District or the 6th District Base. In 1932 he won the army's gold-medal essay competition with his paper, 'The New Warfare', in which he wrote about the influence of modern technology on tactics.

500|$|Professor Ewing {{left the}} {{university}} in 1903 {{to become the first}} Director of Naval Education at the Admiralty but Inglis remained; he was appointed a university demonstrator in mechanism by Professor Bertram Hopkinson, Ewing's successor, and worked with him to study the effects of vibration. [...] Inglis was promoted to lecturer of mechanical engineering in 1908. [...] Hopkinson recognised Inglis' academic abilities and assigned him the heaviest teaching load of all the staff, covering statics, dynamics, structural engineering theory, materials <b>engineering,</b> <b>drawing,</b> engine balance and the design of steel girders and reinforced concrete. Inglis later recalled that if he wished to learn more on a subject then he volunteered to teach a course on it. [...] From 1911 Inglis became involved in hydraulic engineering and served {{on the board of the}} Cambridge University and Town Waterworks Company, serving as deputy chairman from 1924 to 1928 and chairman from 1928 to 1952.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> {{and artistic}} drawing are {{both types of}} drawing, and either may be called simply [...] "drawing" [...] when the context is implicit. <b>Engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> shares some traits with artistic drawing in that both create pictures. But whereas the purpose of artistic drawing is to convey emotion or artistic {{sensitivity}} in some way (subjective impressions), the purpose of <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> is to convey information (objective facts). One of the corollaries that follow from this fact is that, whereas anyone can appreciate artistic drawing (even if each viewer has his own unique appreciation), <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> requires some training to understand (like any language); {{but there is also}} a high degree of objective commonality in the interpretation (also like other languages). In fact, <b>engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> has evolved into a language that is more precise and unambiguous than natural languages; in this sense it is closer to a programming language in its communication ability. <b>Engineering</b> <b>drawing</b> uses an extensive set of conventions to convey information very precisely, with very little ambiguity.|$|E

However, the complexities arising in the process of design, in general, defy formal analysis and computational support is required. In providing intelligent computational support for concurrent engineering, a combination of various problem-solving strategies may be required for complex design situations. It is proposed that an appropriate model for such provision {{is in the form of}} a set of interacting autonomous intelligent agents, possessing different problem-solving capabilities and differing degrees of intelligence. The requirements for such agent-based design support are discussed and possibilities for its realisation, with the aid of Web technology, in a distributed design environment are explored. ...|$|R
