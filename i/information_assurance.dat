The foundations of <b>Information</b> Systems <b>Assurance</b> and <b>information</b> Quality provide a solid foundation for improving the current efforts in Cyber Forensics. With increasing computer and network systems usage as well as the increasing frequency of attacks on information systems, the need for controlling risks in information systems have become more apparent. Meeting that need, <b>Information</b> Systems <b>Assurance</b> has continued to evolve: from the CIA (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) into variations such as the five pillars (confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and nonrepudiation) and the Parkerian Hexad (confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, possession, and utility). Also, with the continuing growth of information systems, the need for improving the quality of such systems has also evolved focusing on various components of information Quality (accuracy, relevance, consistency, timeliness and completeness). Utilizing the foundations of <b>Information</b> Systems <b>Assurance</b> and <b>information</b> Quality a model is derived for Cyber Forensics Assurance...|$|R
