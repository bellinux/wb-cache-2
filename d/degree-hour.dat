We propose a method in which {{the temperature of the}} free-running building is used to express: 1) the ratio between energy consumption for heating and cooling, 2) energy saved when ventilation is used instead of mechanical cooling, and 3) the degree of building adaptation to the environment.

40|$|Residential {{electricity}} demand {{is affected by}} three types of external factors: weather, time, {{and the price of}} electricity. Ontario has mandated time-of-use pricing for all residential customers in the province. We implement a data-driven study using multiple linear regression to quantify the effects of mandatory time-of-use pricing on residential {{electricity demand}} in south west Ontario. In order to isolate the effects of this pricing policy on electricity demand, we first account for the combined effects of weather and time. Our treatment of temporal variables such as month, working days, and hour-of-day is consistent with prior work. However, there is no consensus in prior work for modelling the effects of temperature and weather over time. In temperate regions like Ontario, the relationship between residential electricity demand and temperature is notably non-linear across winter and summer seasons. A mild or extreme summer may skew the estimated impacts of time-of-use pricing if the effects of temperature are not properly accounted for. To address this challenge, we formulate a detailed comparison of existing methods used to transform dry-bulb temperature observations. We consider piecewise linear and natural spline transformations for modelling non-linearity. We also consider coincident weather observations such as humidity, wind chill, and qualitative weather conditions. Finally, we consider variable transformations that take into account the time delay or build-up of temperature that household thermal controls react to. We consider lagged observations, cooling <b>degree-hour,</b> heating <b>degree-hour,</b> moving average, and exposure-lag-response transformations. For all combinations of temperature variable transformations we report the explanatory power, out-of-sample prediction accuracy, and discuss impacts on model interpretability. Using the results from our temperature transformation comparison, we select a well-performing, descriptive model for use in a time-of-use case study. Ontario's time-of-use pricing policy is evaluated according to two of its stated objectives: energy conservation and shifting consumption out of peak demand periods. We show that during the summer rate season, time-of-use pricing is associated with electricity conservation across all price periods. The average demand change during on-peak and mid-peak periods is - 2. 6 % and - 2. 4 % respectively. Change during working day and non-working day off-peak periods is - 0. 9 % and - 0. 6 % but is not statistically significant. The peak-to-average ratio, a separate metric to measure shifted electricity demand, changed - 0. 8 % under time-of-use pricing from 1. 441 to 1. 429. These results are consistent with prior time-of-use evaluations carried out within the province, though less pronounced compared to pilot studies...|$|E

The aim of this research is to investigate the technical and economic viability of applying some criteria of thermal performance in residential buildings. The methodology is based on the identification of the costs and energy in the life cycle of projects based on environmental comfort on passive (natural) and active (artificial) ways, detailing the influence on energy consumption of the building. It was applied in residential projects, both vertical and horizontal, of lower and middle class, in two distinct microclimates (Porto Alegre and Bento Gon??alves, southern Brazilian cities), examining alternatives of envelope, insulation and the use of architectural fa??ade elements. To analyze the thermal performance was adopted the Brazilian standard NBR 15575 and <b>degree-hour</b> method, with BIM modeling through Revit/Autodesk and for the thermal simulation Ecotect/Autodesk and EnergyPlus. The life cycle of the proposed case studies was analyzed by considering a period of 50 years, comparing the costs and embodied energy of alternatives.

40|$|When {{incorrectly}} designed, windows can {{be responsible}} for unnecessary energy consumption in a building. This may result from its dimensions, orientation and shadowing. In a moderate climate like the Portuguese, and considering an annual thermal comfort assessment of a space, if windows are under-dimensioned or over-shadowed, they {{can contribute to the}} increase of heating needs. However, when over-dimensioned or under-shadowed, they contribute to the increase of cooling requirements. Therefore, it is important to find the optimum design that balances orientation, dimension and shadowing, contributing to minimize both the heating and cooling needs. This study presents a parametric analysis of a double glazing window in its orientation and dimension, located in the Portuguese city of Coimbra. For each window orientation and dimension, the optimum overhang depth is determined. The objective is to minimize <b>degree-hours</b> of thermal discomfort.

40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} {{trends in}} accumulated winter chill across the fruit growing region of central California and its internal coastal valleys. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} global warming is in motion in California and is causing accumulated winter chill to decrease across the fruit and nut growing regions of California. The detection of potential trends in accumulated winter chill (between 0 and 7. 2 °C) was determined using two complementary climate datasets. The California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) contains hourly climate data and is suitable for computing accumulated chill hours and chill <b>degree-hours.</b> But, its longest data records extend back only to the 1980 s. The National Weather Service Coop climate record is longer, extending beyond the 1950 s at many sites. But its datasets only contain information on daily maximum and minimum temperatures. To assess long term trends in winter chill accumulation, we developed an algorithm that converted information from daily maximum and minimum temperature into accumulated hours of winter chill and summations of chill-degree hours.

40|$|Windows {{are one of}} the {{elements}} that greatly influence the performance of buildings, both in terms of thermal comfort and energy consumption for heating or cooling. It is therefore important to find an optimal design that balances their orientation, dimension and shadowing. This paper presents a method- ology for the parametric study of a window optimal dimension, based on the thermal performance of a reference room located in the climate region of Coimbra, Portugal. First, the parameters of opening type, orientation, and size are evaluated. During a second stage, the impact of using overhangs is assessed, {{with one of the most}} common window types in Portugal. The thermal assessment is carried out by cal- culating the <b>degree-hours</b> of discomfort using dynamic simulation. Results show that for this location, triple glazing has better performance than single and double glazing, especially for the north orientation. The worst opening orientation is northeast and northwest, independent of the window type. It is observ- able that optimum window dimension does not imply equal space cooling and heating needs. Results also demonstrate that overhangs do not significantly improve the room’s thermal performance but allow windows to have a wider interval of admissible sizes without compromising performance...|$|R

We sampled seeds of A. nemorosa in 15 populations along a 1900 -km long latitudinal gradient at three to seven seed collection dates postanthesis and investigated the relative effects of growing <b>degree-hours</b> > 5 C, soil characteristics and latitude on seed nutrient concentrations. Seed nitrogen, nitrogen: phosphorus ratio and calcium concentration decreased towards northern latitudes, while carbon:nitrogen ratios increased. When taking differences in growing degreehours and measured soil characteristics into account and only considering the most mature seeds, the latitudinal decline remained particularly significant for seed nitrogen concentration. We argue that the decline in seed nitrogen concentration {{can be attributed to}} northward decreasing seed provisioning due to lower soil nitrogen availability or greater investment in clonal reproduction.

We found that the optimum PCM has amelting temperature that is approximately equal to the average ambient air temperature in the hottest month, and that the free-cooling potential is proportional to the average daily amplitude of the ambient airćs temperature swings. For all the analysed climatic conditions the PCM with a wider phase change temperature range (12 K) was found to be the most efficient.

To assist public health agencies in ranking urban areas in terms of heat stress and developing mitigation plans or allocating various resources, this study characterized urban heat in California and quantified an urban heat island index (UHII) at the census-tract level (~ 1 km 2). Multi-scale atmospheric modeling was carried out and a practical UHII definition was developed. The UHII was diagnosed with different metrics and its spatial patterns were characterized for small, large, urban-climate archipelago, inland, and coastal areas.

For this reason, in this paper, an automated procedure is used to generate and optimize buildings’ {{thermal performance}} in a closed O-shape urban quarter with ten building blocks to determine the importance of including the surroundings in estimating the buildings’ thermal behavior. The overall shape of the urban quarter is pre-designed, being mainly residential, with several stores in the ground floor and limited to three levels. Each building will have four alternative designs created using a hybrid evolutionary strategy technique that generates building's floor plans according to practitioner's preferences and requirements. Then, a sequential variable optimization procedure coupled with dynamic simulation engine is used to explore the improvement potential of each solution by changing and adding several building elements. The final quarter design is determined by combining the best of all buildings’ solutions from thermal performance criteria. The results demonstrate the influence of urban context in the resulting building's thermal performance. Despite the building's shape is similar in the four solutions, these have significant thermal behavior difference due to their interior organization and position in the urban quarter. A comparison analysis is carried out between all building block designs. The buildings, which have exterior walls with openings facing south, have almost half <b>degree-hours</b> of thermal discomfort due to the combination of large openings and shading overhangs.

40|$|The {{projection}} of magnetospheric regions into the dayside ionosphere {{as determined by}} particle precipitation characteristics was studied for dependence on solar wind parameters. It {{was found that the}} solar wind kinetic pressure p dramatically affected the map of magnetospheric projections. Under the constraint that p greater than or equal 4 nPa(yielding (p) = 5. 9 nPa), the area of the cusp (magnetic latitude times magnetic local time extent) was 4. 83 degree-hours; whereas under the constraint that p greater than or equal 2 nPa (yielding (p) = 1. 5 nPa), the cusp area was only 1. 01 <b>degree-hours.</b> The ionospheric footprint of the low-latitude boundary layer was similarly affected. Various possible correlations of p with other solar wind variables, including n, v, and absolute value of B(sub z), proved unable to account for the pressure effect. Because one criterion for identifying the cusp is high fluxes, the effect of nv was investigated with particular care, both in examples and statistically. Again, p itself had by far the most striking effect. Thus we concluded that some physical mechanism is needed to account for the pressure effect. One possibility is that increased direct solar wind plasma penetration of the magnetopause occurs under high-p conditions in the manner suggested by various proponents of impulsive penetration models. An alternative, which we find promising, is that, regardless of the original interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, a high-p solar wind leads to a large compression factor for the magnetosheath field, which is the field actually in contact with the magnetosphere. From this latter viewpoint, the chief effect of high particle pressure is simply to enhance the effectiveness of the interaction of the IMF with the magnetosphere...|$|R

Previous research indicated that early-spring temperatures for 30 days after bloom have a strong effect on early peach fruit growth, and both the time and potential fruit size at harvest. We analyzed fruit-size trends of three major cultivars in the California fresh-market peach industry (Flavorcrest, Elegant Lady and O’Henry) over a 20 -year period {{to determine if there}} is a clear relationship between early-spring temperatures and packed fruit sizes industrywide. This research confirmed two significant trends: the size of packed fruit has increased over the 20 -year period between 1985 and 2004, and high early-spring temperatures tended to decrease the size of packed fruit at harvest for any given year. Over the past few decades, models of peach fruit growth and plant development have identified useful principles for assisting growers in making horticultural management de-cisions. For example, harvest-date pre-diction models are now available to aid in managing fruit crops (Ben Mimoun and DeJong 1999). The unusually early harvest of California’s peach crop in 2004 — which had record high temper-atures during bloom time — and atten-dant difficulties in attaining the fruit sizes desired by the market (DeJong 2005) have increased interest in using physiological concepts to understand the effects of early-spring temperature on peach fruit growth and in anticipat-ing fruit size at harvest. The dependence of peach fruit devel-opment on spring temperatures during the first 30 days after bloom has been established; there is a strong correlation between the sum of growing <b>degree-hours</b> accumulated in the 30 days after bloom (GDH 30) and the number of days between bloom and harvest for several stone-fruit cultivars (Ben Mimoun an...|$|R

Covariates common to all parcels within a river section (air and water temperature) and hydraulic variables specific to each parcel (flow velocity V, water depth D, Froude number V/(gD) 1 / 2) were used as explanatory variables. The results of a hierarchical logistic regression analysis indicates that once the air temperature reached the critical value for anchor ice formation, the Froude number was the unique parameter controlling the spatial distribution of anchor ice within a reach. The model correctly classified 67. 5 % of the presence-absence observations of anchor-ice on the parcels. This logistic model {{is one of the first}} attempts to predict the spatial distribution of anchor ice despite numerous other field and laboratory work...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} varying {{substrate}} moisture contents and incubation temperatures on developing snapping turtle embryos was addressed. Mass change was measured for several clutches of snapping turtle eggs within field nests. Throughout the incubation period, {{a subset of}} the total number of nests was measured on either a weekly or a bi-monthly interval. Mass of each egg within a particular nest was separately weighed and inspected. Nest microclimate measurements, such as soil water potential and volumetric water content, were also measured on a regular basis. The patterns of egg mass change, which have previously been determined to be due to water exchange of the egg with the nesting environment, were compared with soil water content. Viable eggs, which produce living hatchlings, have positive water balances, with a net water uptake over the course of incubation. Eggs which are infertile or in which the embryo dies have negative water balances. Furthermore, egg water exchange has been determined to be independent of those soil water contents experienced at the present test site;The phenomenon of temperature dependent sex determination was also analyzed in the common snapping turtle Chelydra serpentina. Field and laboratory treatments were undertaken to investigate the mechanism of action. Copper constantan thermocouples were placed within field nests to record hourly temperature averages over the course of the field incubation period. Similar thermocouples were placed within climate-controlled growth chambers programmed to alter temperature treatments. Following incubation, offspring sex ratios were determined and compared among the different treatments. The influence of varying egg geographic origin on resulting offspring sex ratios was also analyzed. Both field and laboratory-incubated eggs required approximately 150 <b>degree-hours</b> to produce at least 50 % female offspring. Those eggs originating from more southern locations required fewer degree hours to produce a given percentage of female turtles. In other words, more female offspring from lower latitudes were produced within a particular temperature treatment than resulted from more northern latitudes...|$|R
40|$|Northern bobwhite {{populations have}} {{declined}} concurrent with global warming. The focal period {{of this study}} was the 12 -d pre-incubation period, when bobwhite eggs remain in the nest without the thermal protection of the incubating parent. This study first established the storage and thermal limits of bobwhite eggs, then investigated how global warming may impact oviparous embryos and how bobwhite embryos react to acute and chronic doses of simulated drought temperatures during pre-incubation. First, the maximum storage limit of bobwhite eggs was determined by storing eggs &# 8804; 21 d and measuring hatching success and pH of egg albumen and yolk. Hatching success of stored eggs declined after 14 d, when yolk and albumen pH reached levels detrimental to embryonic development. Secondly, thermal limits were determined by exposing bobwhite eggs to hyperthermic temperatures (38 - 52 °C). Bobwhite embryos survived 50 °C for 1 h, 49 °C for 3 h and 46 °C for 6 h. Results indicate an adaptation to the naturally occurring temperature extremes that can occur in the bobwhite's southern range during pre-incubation. Subsequently, bobwhite eggs were exposed to either low constant (LC), low fluctuating (LF), high constant (HC), or high fluctuating (HF) temperatures during pre-incubation to determine if the nature of temperatures differentially affected development. Although eggs exposed to high heat loads (HC and HF), and low heat loads (LF and LC) had equal heating <b>degree-hours</b> within groups, they exhibited differential growth during pre-incubation. Oxygen consumption, hatch timing, and hatching success were also affected by the thermal regimes. Eggs in simulated drought (HF) had a 47 % lower hatch rate than eggs in simulated non-drought (LF) indicating that thermal stress during pre-incubation may contribute to population declines during drought. Finally, northern bobwhite eggs were exposed to acute or chronic doses of simulated drought temperatures, which tested for critical periods of development during pre-incubation. Collectively, data indicated that the earliest stages of bobwhite development were more affected by hyperthermic temperatures. Indeed, a critical period of development exists during the first 2 / 3 of pre-incubation during which exposure to hyperthermic temperatures results in aberrant development, hatching plasticity, and reduced hatch rates...|$|R
40|$|Global {{warming is}} likely to alter {{reproductive}} success of ground-nesting birds that lay eggs normally left unattended for days or even weeks before actual parental incubation, especially in already warm climates. The native North American bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) is such a species, and pre-incubation quail eggs may experience temperatures ≥ 45 °C. Yet, almost nothing is known about embryonic survival after such high pre-incubation temperatures. Freshly laid bobwhite quail eggs were exposed during a 12 day pre-incubation period to one of five thermal regimes: low oscillating temperatures (25 - 40 °C, mean = 28. 9 °C), high oscillating temperatures (30 - 45 °C, mean = 33. 9 °C), low constant temperatures (28. 85 °C), high constant temperatures (mean = 33. 9 °C), or commercially employed pre-incubation temperatures (20 °C). After treatment, eggs were then incubated at a standard 37. 5 °C to determine subsequent effects on embryonic development rate, survival, water loss, hatching, and embryonic oxygen consumption. Both quantity of heating degree hours during pre-incubation and specific thermal regime (oscillating vs. non-oscillating) profoundly affected important aspects of embryo survival and indices of development and growth Pre-incubation quail eggs showed a remarkable tolerance to constant high temperatures (up to 45 °C), surviving for 4. 5 ± 0. 3 days of subsequent incubation, but high oscillating pre-incubation temperature increased embryo survival (mean survival 12. 2 ± 1. 8 days) and led to more rapid development than high constant temperature (maximum 38. 5 °C), even though both groups experienced the same total heating <b>degree-hours.</b> Oxygen consumption was ~ 200 - 300 μl O 2. egg. min- 1 at hatching in all groups, and was not affected by pre-incubation conditions. Oscillating temperatures, which are the norm for pre-incubation quail eggs in their natural habitat, thus enhanced survival at higher temperatures. However, a 5 °C increase in pre-incubation temperature, which equates to the predicted long-term increases of 5 °C or more, nonetheless reduced hatching rate by approximately 50 %. Thus, while pre-incubation bobwhite eggs may be resiliant to moderate oscillating temperature increases, global warming will likely severely impact wild bobwhite quail populations, especially in their strongholds in southern latitudes...|$|R
40|$|Two {{evaluation}} {{methods are}} introduced for {{expression of the}} quality of the thermal conditions in the animal-occupied zone (AOZ) in rooms for weaned piglets. One method uses only the AOZ temperature, while the other uses the kata-value (KV), which combines air velocity and temperature and indicates the heat loss to the environment. AOZ thermal conditions should be within the thermo-neutral zone (TNZ) of the piglets. The methods use two new numerical indicators, based on the duration and the magnitude of excess of AOZ thermal conditions outside the TNZ: one referring to the number of <b>degree-hours</b> (°Ch), and the other to the number of kata-value-hours (KVh) during a batch. The objective was to evaluate the two methods in a door-ventilated room for weaned piglets. In the experiment, temperature was measured in all ten pens of a room and air velocity in three pens during eight successive batches, together lasting about one year. Pens closer to the air inlet had higher temperatures and lower KV than pens in the back of the room. Momentary temperature difference between pens reached up to 7 °C. During the first days of most batches, pen conditions in the back of the room were "too cold. " At the end of most batches, pen conditions in the middle of the room were "too warm. " The value of the two indicators varied per pen and per batch from 0 to 319 °Ch (0 to 219 KVh) "too cold" and from 0 to 602 °Ch (0 to 793 KVh) "too warm. " For "too warm" conditions, there was a significant (P 0. 96), but not for "too cold" conditions (R 2 > 0. 48). Therefore, measuring air velocity in addition to temperature in the AOZ for recognition of "too cold" conditions had surplus value. Excluding outliers from one extremely warm batch, the maximum value of the indicator for "too warm" was 65 °Ch. This indicator significantly affected the feed conversion ratio, which increased with 0. 0024 kg/kg per °Ch, and daily growth and daily feed intake, which decreased with 0. 0022 kg/animal and 0. 0030 kg/animal, respectively, per °Ch. The methods presented are useful tools in the technical evaluation of climate systems and for a more optimal climate control in the AOZ...|$|R
40|$|Steindachneridion parahybae is a {{freshwater}} catfish {{endemic to}} the Paraíba do Sul River and {{is classified as}} an endangered Neotropical species. An increasing number of conservation biologists are incorporating morphological and physiological research data to help conservation managers in rescue these endangered species. This study investigated the embryonic and larval development of S. parahybae in captivity, with emphasis in major events during the ontogeny of S. parahybae. Broodstocks were artificially induced to reproduce, and the extrusion occurred 200 - 255 <b>degree-hours</b> after hormonal induction at 24 °C. Larval ontogeny was evaluated every 10 minutes under microscopic/stereomicroscopic using fresh eggs samples. The main embryogenic development stages were identified: zygote, cleavage, including the morula, blastula, gastrula phase, organogenesis, and hatching. The extruded oocytes showed an average diameter of 1. 10 ± 0. 10 mm, and after fertilization and hydration of eggs, the average diameter of eggs increased to about 1. 90 ± 0. 60 mm, characterized by a large perivitelline space that persisted up to embryo development, the double chorion, and the poles (animal and vegetative). Cell division started about 2 minutes after fertilization (AF), resulting in 2, 4, 8 (4 x 2 arrangement of cells), 16 (4 x 4), 32 (4 x 8) and 64 (2 x 4 x 8) cells. Furthermore, the blastula and gastrula stages followed after these cells divisions. The closed blastopore occurred at 11 h 20 min AF; following the development, the organogenetic stages were identified and subdivided respectively in: early segmentation phase and late segmentation phase. In the early segmentation phase, there was {{the establishment of the}} embryonic axis, and it was possible to distinguish between the cephalic and caudal regions; somites, and the optic vesicles developed about 20 h AF. Total hatching occurred at 54 h AF, and the larvae average length was 4. 30 ± 0. 70 mm. Gradual yolk sac reduction was observed during the first two days of larval development. The first feeding occurred {{at the end of the}} second day. During the larval phase, cannibalism, heterogeneous larval growth and photophobia were also observed. This information will be important in improving the artificial reproduction protocols of S. parahybae in controlled breeding programs. The authors would like to thank the local fishermen who helped to collect the wild females, Ms. Eduardo Sanches for providing the cannibalism pictures, CESP (Companhia Energética de São Paulo) for providing the Fish Farm facilities and FAPESP (2007 / 55949 - 7 and 2008 / 57687 - 0) for financial support. ...|$|R
