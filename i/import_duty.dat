5|$|The tea ship Dartmouth {{arrived in}} the Boston Harbor in late November, and Adams wrote a {{circular}} letter calling for a mass meeting {{to be held at}} Faneuil Hall on November 29. Thousands of people arrived, so many that the meeting was moved to the larger Old South Meeting House. British law required the Dartmouth to unload and pay the duties within twenty days or customs officials could confiscate the cargo. The mass meeting passed a resolution introduced by Adams urging the captain of the Dartmouth to send the ship back without paying the <b>import</b> <b>duty.</b> Meanwhile, the meeting assigned twenty-five men to watch the ship and prevent the tea from being unloaded.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical analysis {{as to what}} extent countries {{have been able to}} recover revenue losses from <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> due to trade liberalization policies through indirect taxes. In contrast to the existing literature, we identify major trade liberalization policies and explore their revenue effects. Specifically, we investigate how revenues from <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> and consumption tax revenues change as a result over the course of GATT/WTO accession. Employing a robust difference-in-difference specification as well as non-parametric methods, our results reveal a substantial, statistically significant inverse relationship between GATT/WTO membership and <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> supporting concerns about revenue losses. At the same time, however, we find a significant increase in revenues from indirect taxes and VAT. Our findings indicate that countries joining GATT/WTO, including low income countries, have successfully substituted revenues from <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> with higher indirect taxes including VAT...|$|R

40|$|Using National Accounts {{data and}} static {{input-output}} analysis we assess {{the extent of}} shifting the incidence of Dutch <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> to foreign customers and global tariff incidence on final demands. About 70 % of the tariffs collected in the Netherlands are paid by foreign customers, mainly those in other EU-countries. While the Dutch export the incidence {{of most of the}} <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> that they collect, they also <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> levied elsewhere in the EU. Assessing tariff incidence globally we conclude that Dutch tariff incidence is in line with the incidence in the other member states of the European Union.

25|$|The Derbyshire lead {{industry}} declined {{after the}} late 18th century because of worked-out veins, increased production {{costs and the}} discovery of much cheaper foreign sources. The industry was protected from this foreign ore by <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A reduction in the duty in 1820 and its abolition in 1845 brought a steep rise in the volume of lead imported into England and accelerated the local industry's decline.|$|E

25|$|Approved Permits (APs) for {{automobiles}} preferentially allow bumiputra {{to import}} vehicles. Automotive companies wishing {{to bring in}} cars {{need to have an}} AP to do so. APs were originally created to allow bumiputra participation in the automotive industry, since they were issued to companies with at least 70% bumiputra ownership. In 2004, The Edge (a business newspaper) estimated that APs were worth approximately RM 35,000 each. They also estimated that the late Nasimuddin Amin, {{the former chairman of the}} Naza group, received 6,387 in 2003, making him the largest single recipient of APs. More than 12,200 APs were issued in 2003. In addition to APs, foreign car marquees are required to pay between 140% to 300% <b>import</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite Belfast's {{seemingly}} growing {{significance to}} the English monarchy, it was {{still very much a}} small settlement at this stage. John Speed's 1610 map of Ireland marks Belfast as an insignificant village, and the 1612 patent styles it a town, or village. Nearby Carrickfergus, successfully held by the English for much longer, was still the more prominent settlement and centre for trade. In 1640 Thomas Wentworth, then Lord Deputy of Ireland, purchased from Carrickfergus its trade monopolies (namely, one third <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> compared with other locations in the kingdom) and bestowed them upon Belfast. The customs house was also relocated to Belfast at around the same time, and new trade flooded into the town, much to the expense of the prosperity of Carrickfergus.|$|E
25|$|In {{the states}} of Bavaria, Wurttemberg, Hesse, and Baden, the SPD was {{successful}} in extracting various socio-political and democratic concessions (including {{the replacement of the}} class-based electoral systems with universal suffrage) through electoral alliances with bourgeois parties, voting for parliamentary bills and state budgets. In the Reichstag, the SPD resorted to a policy of tactical compromise in order to exert direct influence on legislation. In 1894, the parliamentary SPD voted for a government bill for the first time ever. It reduced the <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> on wheat, which led to a reduction in the price of food. In 1913, the votes of SPD parliamentarians helped to bring in new tax laws affecting the wealthy, which were necessary due to the increase in military spending.|$|E

25|$|The mercantile {{smuggling}} {{industry had}} {{developed in the}} border areas, due to Mexico's ban of some imported goods, and exorbitant <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> on the goods it did allow. The ensuing rebellion over the import tariffs {{came to be known}} as the Merchants War. The initial seed money for Carbajal's army was raised in June 1851 through the sale of Mexican land grants to disgruntled merchants in Texas. An additional $6,000 came from an earlier loan that Carbajal's mother-in-law Patricia de la Garza De León had advanced him before her 1849 death.nCarbajal recruited his troops from within Texas, some of whom joined in part because he had promised them recovery of the runaways. Among the recruits were thirty Texas Rangers led by Colonel John S. Ford.|$|E
25|$|By late 1965, British Eagle {{placed an}} order for two Boeing 707-320Cs. The aircraft, which were to be {{delivered}} in early 1967, were primarily intended for passenger and freight charters to the Far East and Australia. To avoid paying the 14% tax the British Government had imposed on imported, new foreign aircraft to protect competing British models, the airline needed to persuade the Board of Trade {{that there was no}} equivalent home-grown alternative. It also cited the Board's earlier decision to approve BOAC's application for an <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> waiver on two new Boeing 707-336Cs as a precedent. Despite being offered a mixed-traffic version of the Super VC10 and acknowledging that aircraft's superior passenger appeal, British Eagle favoured the 707-320C because of its greater payload and range. This made the 707 a more attractive aircraft for the kind of charter operations envisaged.|$|E
25|$|Partly due to low {{awareness}} {{among the}} general population and prohibitive equipment costs, the number of licensed amateur radio operators did not increase significantly {{over the next two}} decades, numbering fewer than a thousand by 1970. CW (Morse code) and AM were the predominant modes at that time. The electronic equipment was mostly valve-based, obtained from Indian army surpluses. During the mid-1960s, the modes of operation saw a change from Amplitude Modulation to Single Side Band (SSB) as the preferred communication mode. By 1980, the number of amateur radio operators had risen to 1,500. In 1984, then Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, waived the <b>import</b> <b>duty</b> for wireless equipment. After this, the number of operators rose steadily, and by 2000 there were 10,000 licensed ham operators. As of 2007, there are more than 17,000 licensed users in India.|$|E

40|$|The {{ratio of}} <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> to total <b>imports</b> {{is a widely}} used measure of tariff policy in growth empirics; {{as a matter of}} fact, however, no clear and robust {{relationship}} emerges from the statistical analysis linking such an index to growth. This failure may be explained by precise theoretical reasons. Total <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> are generated by different fiscal instruments, such as “ad valorem” and specific tariffs, which (according to the insights of R&D based endogenous growth models) exert completely different growth effects. As a consequence, the theoretical form of the relationship between <b>import</b> <b>duties</b> and growth critically changes according to which kind of tariff barrier is mainly raised and no clear empirical link may be expected to emerge in a cross-section of economies characterized by sufficiently heterogeneous tariff policies...|$|R
