40|$|Abstract. The energy {{consumption}} is increasing {{year after year}} {{with the development of}} economy in our country. Improving and optimizing the way of energy use constantly is necessary. Industrial waste heat is the energy which is not used in the thermal conversion equipment and energy-using equipment in the process of production. In the research, a novel system is developed for waste heat recovery. Parts of sensible heat and latent heat of the low temperature flue gas are recycled through the recuperative heat exchanger which reduces the temperature of the <b>exhausted</b> <b>flue</b> gas. Comparing with the common boiler and the depth recovery system of flue gas waste heat under different conditions, {{it was found that the}} latter not only increases the available heat and thermal efficiency, but also reduces the <b>exhausting</b> temperature of <b>flue</b> gas...|$|R

Powered direct-vent systems include an exhaust fan to aid in the expulsion of combustion gasses.|$|E

5000|$|Simple {{types of}} {{gas-fired}} furnace lose {{significant amounts of}} energy in the hot waste gases. High-efficiency condensing furnaces condense the water vapor (one of the by-products of gas combustion) and extract the latent heat to pre-heat the incoming furnace airflow, using a second heat exchanger. [...] This increases the efficiency (energy delivered into the building vs. heating value of gas purchased) to over 90%. An incidental beneficial effect is that the <b>exhaust</b> <b>flue</b> is much smaller and can be made of plastic pipe since the exhaust gas is much cooler. As a result it can be more easily routed through walls or floors. However, the condensing furnace is more expensive initially because of the extra induced draft fan and condensate pump required, and the extra heat exchanger in the firebox.|$|E
5000|$|The {{outcome was}} a {{complete}} redesign, the Model D of 1922. The uniflow engine, perceived as {{the root of the}} troubles with the Doble Detroit, gave place to a two-cylinder compound type, still with Joy's valve gear, but with piston valves. Another crucial development was a coiled monotube once-through vertically-mounted cylindrical boiler following the thinking behind the later version of the Detroit boiler, the most distinctive feature of which was the placing of the burner {{at the top of the}} boiler. This plus drastic insulation was meant to cause the hot gases to reside within the boiler casing for an optimum length of time giving up the maximum amount of heat to the feedwater. There was a forced draft burner at the top of the boiler and an <b>exhaust</b> <b>flue</b> at the bottom. The venturi was placed horizontally at the top of the vertical boiler barrel and oriented in such a way as to avoid direct contact with the monotube while inducing a swirl motion to the gases. It was thus a counterflow design with water entering the lower end of the coiled monotube and progressing upward toward the burner, which meant that the hottest gases gave superheat to the steam at the top of the coil whilst the cooler gases preheated oncoming the feedwater at the bottom. The distinctive hand operated [...] "miniature steering wheel” rotating a throttle control rod that passed down the middle of the steering column can be observed in D2 which still exists (in the UK) at the present time. Photographic evidence shows that D1 retained the foot throttle pedal, so when the wheel throttle control was first applied is not clear. The latter probably gave more precise adjustment.|$|E

The waste heat recovery of flue gas decreases coal consumption. Other approaches for heat recovery of flue gas, direct utilization of flue gas energy and indirect flue gas heat recovery system, are also considered in this work. The proposed systems coupled with a reference 330 MWe power plant are simulated using equivalent enthalpy drop method. The results show that the additional economizer scheme has the best performance.

40|$|AbstractCombustion {{chambers}} have a {{very important}} role in the functioning and efficiency of gas turbine engines. The role of a combustion chamber is to convert the chemical energy of a fuel, in the presence of air, into thermal energy so that the working fluid of the engine can be expanded inside a turbine. By doing so, the turbine produces mechanical work at the shaft which can be again converted in electrical energy by an electric generator if the gas turbine engine is for industrial use. One important aspect regarding the combustion processes that take place inside the combustion chamber is the quantity of NOx it produces.

40|$|The huge {{emissions}} {{of greenhouse gases}} from fossil-fuelled power plants is emphasizing the need for efficient carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. With reference to operating plants, the post-combustion CO 2 capture option is attractive as it implies minimal intervention on the existing plants. The most typical options are: amine-based absorption, pressure or thermal swing adsorption, membrane separation. These processes {{may turn out to be}} fairly expensive and result in major efficiency penalties. On the other hand, there has been growing attention on the possibility to sequester CO 2 by water absorption and conversion into stable bi/carbonates. One drawback of this process is represented by the slow apparent kinetics. It appears that the rate enhancement may be pursued by enzymatic catalysis of carbonic anhydrase (CA), a broad group of ubiquitous metalloenzymes. The fixation of gaseous CO 2 into carbonate ions is controlled by the hydration reaction. The captured carbon can be safely sequestered by precipitation of carbonates. Providing that a proper metal ion source is available to the biomimetic capture system, a mild mineral sequestration may occur. Sea water and/or brines are typical Ca++ sources available at industrial scale. A theoretical model has been proposed to analyse the performances of an innovative CA-based CCS process. The enzymatic absorption unit (EAU) is a three-phase system: the solid phase is the carrier with immobilised CA; the liquid phase, the aqueous stream bearing Ca++; the gas phase, the <b>exhausted</b> <b>flue</b> gas. The liquid phase is further processed in a Carbonate Recovery unit (CRU). The aims of the study are: i) the general assessment of the process mass and energy balances; ii) the analysis of the role of the immobilised CA specific activity and stability on process performance; iii) the optimization of operating conditions for both the EAU and the CRU.
