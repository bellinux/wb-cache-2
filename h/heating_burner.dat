5000|$|The {{fragrance}} lamp's {{process is}} initiated by igniting the stone burner {{seated at the}} mouth of the lamp. After a few minutes the flame is extinguished by blowing it out. The <b>heated</b> <b>burner</b> remains active as the flame-less, low-temperature catalytic combustion process and diffuses the aromatics throughout the room. The lamp does not operate with an open flame, making it much safer to operate than scented candles. Its lower operating temperature also means that, unlike scented candles, the aromatics are diffused very efficiently into the ambient air without being burned.|$|R

40|$|Unconventional ways {{of growing}} plants, {{when we return}} to non-chemical methods of {{controlling}} weeds, require new weed control methods. One of the few physical methods, which found wider application in practice, is a flame weeder with <b>heat</b> <b>burners</b> based {{on the use of}} gas (LPG). However, the process of practical use of this flame weeder has a number of factors that positively or negatively affect the effectiveness of weed control. A precise setting of flame weeders is influenced, for example by weed species, weed growth stage, weather, type of crop grown, but also heat transmission and heat absorption by plant. Many variables that enter into the process must be eliminated for their negative impacts on achieving the best results in fighting against weeds. In this paper, we have focused on naming these parameters, on field trials that confirm the justification of the precise setting of parameters, and recommendations for practice to achieve a higher efficiency of thermal weed control...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the combustion characteristics of new burners used for home and water heating appliances and domestic cook top is presented {{with the aim of}} evaluating the effect of burner configurations and operating conditions on the emissions of gaseous pollutants and organic carbon (OC). Advanced in-situ optical diagnostics, based on laser induced emission spectroscopy (LIE), and ex-situ measurements, based on scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), and particles collection by water-based sampling technique, are used in order to evaluate the total particulate concentration and size distribution functions. For the home <b>heating</b> <b>burners</b> three different configurations: two premixed and one diffusive are studied under various operative conditions. Measurements have shown that particulate matter with size in the 1 nm to 10 nm size range is formed in all the examined conditions. The emitted mass concentration of these compounds is very low, of the order of 0. 001 ppm. They are formed in large number concentrations in the flame region but are also strongly oxidized in the post-oxidation region of the devices.

25|$|Vegetable oil {{can be used}} as an {{alternative}} fuel in diesel engines and in <b>heating</b> oil <b>burners.</b> When vegetable oil is used directly as a fuel, in either modified or unmodified equipment, it is referred to as straight vegetable oil (SVO) or pure plant oil (PPO). Conventional diesel engines can be modified to help ensure that the viscosity of the vegetable oil is low enough to allow proper atomization of the fuel. This prevents incomplete combustion, which would damage the engine by causing a build-up of carbon. Straight vegetable oil can also be blended with conventional diesel or processed into biodiesel or bioliquids for use under a wider range of conditions.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{experimental}} study of the oxidation of cyclohexane has been performed in a jet-stirred reactor at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1100 K (low- and intermediate temperature zones including the negative temperature-coefficient area), at a residence time of 2 s and for dilute mixtures with equivalence ratios of 0. 5, 1, and 2. Experiments were carried out at quasi-atmospheric pressure (1. 07 bar). The fuel and reaction product mole fractions were measured using online gas chromatography. A total of 34 reaction products have been detected and quantified in this study. Typical reaction products formed in the low-temperature oxidation of cyclohexane include cyclic ethers (1, 2 epoxycyclohexane and 1, 4 -epoxycyclohexane), 5 -hexenal (formed from the rapid decomposition of 1, 3 -epoxycyclohexane), cyclohexanone, and cyclohexene, as well as benzene and phenol. Cyclohexane displays high low-temperature reactivity with well-marked negative temperature-coefficient (NTC) behavior at equivalence ratios 0. 5 and 1. The fuel-rich system (ϕ = 2) is much less reactive in the same region and exhibits no NTC. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first jet-stirred reactor study to report NTC in cyclohexane oxidation. Laminar burning velocities were also measured by the <b>heated</b> <b>burner</b> method at initial gas temperatures of 298, 358, and 398 K and at 1 atm. The laminar burning velocity values peak at ϕ = 1. 1 and are measured as 40 and 63. 1 cm/s for Ti = 298 and 398 K, respectively. An updated detailed chemical kinetic model including low temperature pathways was used to simulate the present (jet-stirred reactor and laminar burning velocity) and literature experimental (laminar burning velocity, rapid compression machine, and shock tube ignition delay times) data. Reasonable agreement is observed with most of the products observed in our reactor, as well as the literature experimental data considered in this paper...|$|R
