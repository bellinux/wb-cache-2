Out of 100 prisoners visited by AI, more than 20 showed signs of ill-treatment, including open—and sometimes fresh—wounds on legs, arms, and heads; cigarette burns; and <b>friction</b> <b>burns</b> on wrists. These prisoners had received no medical care. They allegedly were daily tied to pillars, beaten with sticks and bricks, and kicked. Those inflicting the abuse regularly demanded money.

After attending a talk by William Boyd Dawkins, he took an interest in cave archeology and especially in stratigraphy. In the 1890s, Balch was introduced to the caves of the Mendip Hills by Thomas Willcox, manager of the Priddy lead mines. While caving with Willcox at Lamb Leer in 1897, one of Balch's ropes snapped.

50|$|A <b>friction</b> <b>burn</b> {{is a form}} of {{abrasion}} {{caused by}} the friction of skin rubbing against a surface. A <b>friction</b> <b>burn</b> may also be referred to as skinning, chafing, or a term named for the surface causing the burn such as rope burn, carpet burn or rug <b>burn.</b> Because <b>friction</b> generates heat, extreme cases of chafing may result in genuine burning of the outer layers of skin.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was carried out between 2010 and 2013, a total of 7968 Autopsies were {{conducted}} of which 3. 31 % (n – 264) cases were deaths due to hanging. The most preferred ligature materials were Stole (n – 79) and Bed spread/Sari (n – 68). In 88 % of the cases, hanging was complete. Females (n – 136) and males (n – 128) were equally affected. The major age group involved in both the sexes was of 31 – 40 years, contributing to 50. 76 % (n – 136) of the self suspension. In 80. 58 % (n – 213) of the incidents, ligature mark showed discontinuity (incomplete). A Slip type of knot was used in majority of the noose, contributing to 97. 73 % (n – 258) of the suspensions. In 87. 88 % (n – 232) of hanging an oblique shaped ligature mark was noticed. The horizontal and near oblique ligature marks were seen only in cases of partial suspension. In 95. 45 % (n – 252) of the cases, the ligature mark showed blackening of the skin (<b>friction</b> <b>burn).</b> Only 4. 54 % (n – 12) showed intact skin. The outer layer of the skin over the ligature mark showed displacement in majority of the cases. Married victims contributed to 70. 45 % of cases. Domestic issues were the commonest reason (n – 82) for self suspension, of which female (n – 68) formed the majority of victims. In 70. 83 % (n – 187) of cases damage to neck muscle fibers and hemorrhage at the Sternal end of the Sternocleidomastoid muscle were present. In 85. 61 % (n – 226) of cases the cervical vertebra was intact. In 52. 27 % (n – 138) of the cases the internal carotid artery showed transverse tear. In 99. 42 % (n – 248) cases the thyroid cartilage was found intact. The hyoid bone was damaged in 6. 06 % (n – 16) of the victims.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prospectively {{evaluate}} AWBAT-S in comparison with Biobrane for the treatment of superficial partial-thickness burns using the patient as his or her own control. Primary outcome measures included length of hospital inpatient stay and patient-reported perception of pain. Secondary outcome measures included time to healing, clinical outcome of burn sites (scarring) and a comparison of cost of care for patients treated with AWBAT-S versus Biobrane. Superficial partial-thickness burns involve damage to the epidermis and superficial dermis. 1 The destroyed tissue typically blisters and sloughs off leaving an open and exuding dermis with nerve endings exposed. They thus represent one of the most painful of the several categories of thermal injuries. Historically, conservative treatment consisted of removing nonviable tissue on the ward (the aggressiveness dictated by pain), daily bathing or showering with <b>friction</b> washing of <b>burn</b> wounds and applying new dressings with topical medications 1 to 2 times a day. 2, 3 These procedures cause severe pain and anxiety in patients, even with the use of opiate analgesics. The management of these injuries at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) involves aggressive cleaning under general anaesthetic immediately, or within 24 hours, after the burn injury and arrival at hospital, followed by the application of a biosynthetic epithelial replacement (Biobrane, Dow Hickam/Berte...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{validate}} a method of measuring activity limitation in leprosy and diabetes. The resulting questionnaire should be quick and simple to use in basic clinical settings, not require any testing skills or equipment, be validated across a number of cultures in order to be widely applicable, be relevant for anyone with long-standing peripheral neuropathy and be sensitive to changes in clients' capabilities. Because of impaired sensibility in hands or feet, persons affected by leprosy or diabetes are expected to be aware that many activities carry a risk of injury, particularly repetitive stress, excess pressure, <b>friction</b> or <b>burns.</b> They are expected to avoid these risky activities, or modify how they are carried out, in order to prevent injury. An additional aim of the study was therefore to find ways of assessing how far clients were aware of safety issues and how much they limited their activities voluntarily because of safety concerns. Method. Lists of activities of daily living relevant for the target populations were generated through individual interviews and focus group discussions. A questionnaire of 374 items was compiled and administered to 436 persons affected by leprosy and 132 affected by diabetes in five countries in four continents. A total of 76 % of respondents had impairments. Occupational therapists not otherwise involved in this study gave an independent assessment of the degree of activity limitation of 207 respondents. The process of item selection from this database is presented step by step. Items for the SALSA scale were practised by at least 70 % of respondents in all participating populations, were easy to perform for some but difficult for others, correlated well with the assessment of independent practitioners and had good item-total correlation. The present set of 20 items is well represented by a single principal component and had a high scale reliability coefficient. Results. On a 20 -item scale, one would expect a score of 20 if the respondents practiced all the activities listed without difficulty. Higher scores reflect increasing activity limitation. The SALSA score varied from 10 to 75 with a mean of 32. The distribution of the scores was not different between men and women or between disease groups. There was a consistent increase of the SALSA score with age and with the level of impairment. Compared to India and Nigeria, the average SALSA scores, adjusted for age and impairment level, were higher in Israel and Brazil, but lower in China. The spearman correlation coefficient between the SALSA scores and the scores assigned by the independent experts was 0. 67. Among 23 respondents without overt disease, the SALSA score had a median of 19 and half the respondents scored between 18 and 20. Conclusions. The present research has resulted in the SALSA scale, a short questionnaire which can be administered within 10 min and which provides a standardized measure of activity limitation in clients with a peripheral neuropathy. It can be used to make comparisons between (groups of) individuals in different countries and in the same person (or group) over time. General health workers can use SALSA to screen clients and refer those with high scores to specialised services. In addition, the scale will assist service providers in designing appropriate interventions...|$|R
