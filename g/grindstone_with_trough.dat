Ownership of the mill {{was transferred to the}} park's namesake, Thomas McConnell in 1875. He replaced the waterwheel with water turbines and the <b>grindstones</b> <b>with</b> rolling mills. This made McConnell's Mill one of the first rolling mills in the country. The mill processed oats, corn, buckwheat and wheat until it was closed in 1928. Ownership of the land transferred from Thomas H. Hartman to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy in 1942. The conservancy then transferred the land to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1957 when McConnells Mill State Park was formally dedicated.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a controlled experimental {{examination of the}} efficiency of Australian Aboriginal <b>grindstones</b> <b>with</b> a variety of surface morphologies in milling seeds into meal. Several replicate sandstone grindstones (large and small millstones with functional surfaces ranging in length from 43 cm to 16 cm and a mortar) were employed to process three domesticated commercial grains that serve as viable proxies for native grains. These were processed in 10 min grinding sessions. Our results show that large millstones significantly outperform both the small millstones and the small mortar in the net output of ground grain. We also find that other factors may influence productivity, including the amount of wear and the seed being processed. These variations are of sufficient magnitude to have possibly influenced crucial economic decisions...|$|R

5000|$|Manufactured <b>grindstones</b> <b>with</b> {{embedded}} {{silicon carbide}} or aluminum oxide {{can be used}} to grind small wood logs called [...] "bolts" [...] to make stone pulp (SGW). If the wood is steamed prior to grinding it is known as pressure ground wood pulp (PGW). Most modern mills use chips rather than logs and ridged metal discs called refiner plates instead of grindstones. If the chips are just ground up with the plates, the pulp is called refiner mechanical pulp (RMP) and if the chips are steamed while being refined the pulp is called thermomechanical pulp (TMP). Steam treatment significantly reduces the total energy needed to make the pulp and decreases the damage (cutting) to fibres. Mechanical pulps are used for products that require less strength, such as newsprint and paperboards.|$|R

40|$|Mouse tongue {{epithelium}} {{is characterized}} by a circadian variation in the number of cells undergoing DNA synthesis. Groups of male BDF 1 mice were followed over 48 h and a double-labelling method with tritiated thymidine and bromodeoxyuridine used to determine S-phase labelling indices, together with cell influx to and cell efflux from S, at 4 -hourly time points. Control animals exhibited diurnal peaks in labelling index at 03 : 00 <b>with</b> <b>trough</b> activity 12 h later at 15 : 00. Cell influx peaked at 23 : 00 <b>with</b> <b>troughs</b> occurring between 11 : 00 to 15 : 00. Peak cell efflux occurred at 07 : 00 <b>with</b> <b>trough</b> activity at 19 : 00. Animals injected with epidermal growth factor at 05 : 00 demonstrated a significant fall in both influx and efflux throughout the 48 -h period (P < 0. 001), but with preservation of labelling indices, suggesting a slower transit of cells through S-phase, whereas epidermal growth factor injected at 15 : 00 only produced a significant rise in cell- efflux values. Adrenergic stimulation by intravenous phenylephrine/isoprenaline injection at both 05 : 00 and 15 : 00 resulted in a significant rise in cell efflux (P < 0. 001), although there was also a rise in labelling index in the 15 : 00 group (P < 0. 001). Animals injected with calmodulin at 05 : 00 demonstrated a significant reduction in labelling index throughout the 48 -h period (P < 0. 001), but maintained control values for cell influx and efflux, suggesting faster transit of cells through S. Calmodulin injection at 15 : 00 produced only a significant reduction in cell influx (P < 0. 001). Administration of exogenous growth factors significantly alters the normal rhythmical proliferation of oral epithelial cells in a mouse model. These effects appear to be both growth factor- and time- dependent, and may have both physiological and pathological implications. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Several single-center {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that higher doses of vancomycin, aimed at producing trough concentrations of> 15 mg/liter, are associated with increased risk of nephrotoxicity. We prospectively assessed the relative incidence of nephrotoxicity in relation to trough concentration in patients with documented methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections at seven hospitals throughout South Carolina. Adult patients receiving vancomycin for at least 72 h with at least one vancomycin trough concentration determined under steady-state conditions were prospectively studied. The relationship between vancomycin trough concentrations of> 15 mg/ml and the occurrence of nephrotoxicity was assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses, controlling for age, gender, race, dose, length of therapy, use of other nephrotoxins (including contrast media), intensive care unit (ICU) residence, episodes of hypotension, and comorbidities. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0. 5 mg/dl or a> 50 % increase from the baseline for two consecutive measurements. MICs of vancomycin for the MRSA isolates were also determined. A total of 288 patients were studied between February 2008 and June 2010, with approximately one-half having initial trough concentrations of> 15 mg/ml. Nephrotoxicity was observed for 42 patients (29. 6 %) <b>with</b> <b>trough</b> concentrations> 15 mg/ml and for 13 (8. 9 %) <b>with</b> <b>trough</b> concentrations of < 15 mg/ml.
