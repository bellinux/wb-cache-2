So little, however, was I, now {{on the eve of a}} great happiness, like a drowning man, that nothing whatever passed before me. I lost sight even of my friends, and though Jimmy was on his knees at my feet, his hand clasping mine, he disappeared as if his open mouth had swallowed the rest of his face. I had only one thought--that I was smoking my last pipe. Unconsciously I crossed my legs, and one of my slippers fell off; Jimmy, I think, slipped it on to my foot. Marriot stood over me, gazing into the bowl of my pipe, but I did not see him.|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} becomes a bit murkier when new material uncovered by Stanford's Prof. Scott Sagan {{led him to}} write: In addition, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> that on October 24, shortly after DEFCON 2 was declared, General Power also sent the following special message to all SAC wings, in a clear (uncoded) voice transmission, emphasizing the need for safety and caution in the dangerous operation: ...|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} argued that until the 1940s, Egypt was more in favour of territorial, Egyptian {{nationalism}} and distant from the pan-Arab ideology. Egyptians generally did not identify themselves as Arabs, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> that when the Egyptian nationalist leader Saad Zaghlul met the Arab delegates at Versailles in 1918, he insisted that their struggles for statehood were not connected, claiming that the problem of Egypt was an Egyptian problem and not an Arab one.|$|E
5000|$|Radiopaque marking: Before operation, sponges can be soaked {{through with}} ‘radio-opaque marker’. This allows a sponge {{to be easily}} seen on plain radiographs. When the markers are noticed, it can be assumed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> a {{retained}} sponge. A.P. Zbar, Surgical Directorate at Oldchurch and Harold Wood Hospitals stated “the diagnosis is easily made by plain abdominal radiography, when a radio-opaque marker is seen”. [...] This method is flawed in that it doesn’t work if the sponges have broken into smaller pieces over time.|$|E

5000|$|One {{remarkable}} {{exception to}} early Japanese histories overlooking Himiko is the Nihon Shoki quoting the Wei Zhi three times. In 239, [...] "the Queen 女王 of Wa" [...] sent envoys to Wei; in 240, they returned [...] "charged with an Imperial rescript and a seal and ribbon"; and in 243, [...] "The Ruler [...] "king" [...] of Wa again sent high officers as envoys with tribute" [...] (tr.

50|$|Due to his {{position}} as Lord Mayor of London in 1567, Sir Roger Martyn was present {{in his role as}} a high commissioner in the examination of a group of Puritans who had been accused of holding a conventicle in the Plumbers' Hall in June 1567. Also present at the examination were the Bishop of London, and Dean of Westminster. Also notably present at the examination was Edmund Bonner, an ex-bishop of London noted for his cruel treatment of protestants during Queen Mary's reign. The document which tells us about the examination 'is the earliest surviving Puritan text of its kind and is a rare example of how the High Commission conducted an examination.' As a document <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> about the Vestments Controversy.|$|E
50|$|Given their {{abundance}} in cloud forest Winkler samples, remarkably few nests have been observed. Small nests of A. tristani and A. paratristani are occasionally found in bits of rotten wood on the ground. The dark workers curl and lie motionless on disturbance, blending with the background debris. Only the white brood gives them away. An exception is some montane sites in Guatemala and Chiapas where A. robustus occurs. Adelomyrmex robustus {{can be a}} more conspicuous presence, with large colonies in rotten wood at forest edges. Adelomyrmex bispeculum, a species endemic to Monteverde, Costa Rica, is only known from three nest collections. These nests were in small chambers in clay soil, one beneath a stone and two in a vertical trailside bank. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> that this species has not been collected {{in the hundreds of}} sifted litter samples taken in the Monteverde area, in which A. tristani is very abundant. It suggests fine-scale microsite segregation of Adelomyrmex species.|$|E

30|$|As <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> in this review, a {{critical}} concern about WAF tests is guessing. Thus, without surprise, {{a lot of}} effort was taken to examine guessing (how and why it happens) and find ways, albeit not necessarily as effective as intended, to counteract it, such as selecting high frequency words, varying the distributions of associates, using semantically unrelated distractors, not letting learners know the number of associates, and using a “better” scoring method.|$|E
40|$|Mistical suspension, silence, time, absolute, ontology, ineffability, aletheiaIn {{the mystical}} ecstasy {{there is a}} sensorial and {{intellectual}} suspension when contemplating the absolute, the ontological Being. Silence is not only significant: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing.</b> The greatest expression of experience inner silence. The word is insufficient when the ontological reality is revealed. Revelation or truth, the Greek concept of aletheia, takes on greater significance in that transcendental experience. It is also suspended phenomenological time and remains eternity open...|$|E

40|$|In {{considering}} how curriculum and teaching influence education, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> {{to note that}} most faculty members treat curriculum the way bankers treat investments.

Ireland is being held up for prudent adjustment and austerity. Yet 6 years into the crisis, Ireland's economy is only just emerging from its second bout of recession, its debt to GDP ratio stands at about 120 %, and its fiscal deficit, although falling, is still above the 3 % European Union guideline. 1 <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> to sift through the evidence and see how the Irish health system has adjusted to this macroeconomic environment, providing lessons for those who must embrace austerity...|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} that order flow in a foreign {{exchange}} market appears to have permanent price impact only if it comes from certain regions. These regions are - as predicted by the local information hypothesis - centers of political and financial decision making. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> that orders from other regions only show a very short-lived but no permanent price impact. Local information is so important that it carries over from the usually considered market orders to aggressively priced limit orders too. The finding is robust to common news shocks, to the consideration of feedback trading and to further controls. Local information hypothesis Price impact Limit orders Informed traders...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{describes}} {{the beliefs and}} practices associated {{with the notion of}} ziarah in a single community, that of Bayat, a small district (kecamatan) in Klaten between Yogyakarta and Surakarta. There are some of terms from Bayat in this text, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> to consider how key terms have been used within their culture of origin. In elucidating ziarah practices and its interpretations, visitors in Bayat refer to the cultural contexts with which they are familiar. The logic of ziarah thus reflects visitor's everyday life experiences. Applying vernacular terms used in Bayat entails taking this cultural context into consideration. Copyright (c) 2014 by SDI.

40|$|The {{title of}} this paper {{condenses}} one of the characteristics that the late religious fact adopted: {{as opposed to the}} tolerance that in general characterized the ancient pagan cults, the Christianity adopted during and after the fourth century the form of an intolerant and intransigent religion. The paper proposes to fix our attention on privileged scenery of observation: Roman and Late Roman Upper Egypt. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> because of the excellent source of information that has survived over there. Because, indeed, it is enough with observing the reliefs that have survived on the facades and walls of the ancient Egyptian temples (Hellenistics and Romans) to see the unequivocal tracks {{of the fact that we}} bring up here: the Roman rulers’ absolute assumption of traditional Egyptian religion and the mutilation of Egyptian temples by Christians...|$|E
30|$|The {{size of the}} {{software}} organization matters [18], i.e. in a small organization the entire software development and delivery chain may be performed by a single (co-located) team. For instance Scrum has only three roles {{in order to create}} flow. There are no separate testers and coders in Scrum, because everyone does what has to be done, {{in order to get the}} Sprint release ready. In larger organizations, typically multiple people and different roles are needed to create an end-to-end value stream like illustrated in Fig.  2. For each particular software organization, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>revealing</b> to map the value stream flow backwards (upstream) from the focal point of the customer software use to realize all intermediate steps and exchanges, since the customer value (−in-use) is only created when the customer(s) can actually consume and use {{the software}}.|$|E
