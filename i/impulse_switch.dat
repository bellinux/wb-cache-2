Although more than ten VSC-HVDC projects are under construction and many more are in operations globally, the testing criteria for HVDC XLPE cables are mainly referenced to test guideline TB 496 recommended by CIGRE. Due to the large stray capacitance of the VSC-HVDC cables, the <b>switching</b> <b>impulse</b> overvoltage stress of the cables is the main electrical parameter concerned, a unified overvoltage factor of 2. 1 p. u. being generally accepted. However, the <b>switching</b> <b>impulse</b> overvoltage stress of a VSC-HVDC cable system depends on not only the VSC topology but also the cable parameters and the volt-ampere characteristics of the dc cable surge arresters used.

The risk of lightning striking the blade {{is expected to be}} higher when they are located in a highly polluted and humid zone. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is considered to be among the severe pollutant near sea transported through air and gets deposited on the blade surface thereby increasing the surface conductivity of the material. Lightning can strike any part of the blade other than the receptors and the polluted surface with higher conductivity can allow discharge current to propagate over the surface thus causing severe burning of material and damaging the blade.

In recent years, hybrid impulsive and switching systems have been extensively studied [41 – 43]. In [41], Li et al. investigated the global stability of impulsive switching HNN. However, they only consider the fixed-time impulse, and the <b>impulses</b> occur at <b>switching</b> instants, {{as well as in}} [42] and [43]. In [44], the authors also consider the fixed-time impulse, {{despite the fact that the}} impulses do not occur at the same time as the switching signals. In [45], Song et al. discussed the state-dependent impulses in nonlinear fractional-order systems. In [46] and [47], the authors investigated the impacts of state-dependent delay on the stability of nonlinear differential systems. In the present paper, we study the global stability of switching CGNNs with state-dependent <b>impulses,</b> where the <b>switches</b> occur at the fixed time, while the impulses do not occur at fixed times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first switching CGNNs model that takes into account the state-dependent impulses. Firstly, we give the sufficient conditions that ensure every solution of system intersects each surface of discontinuity exactly once. Nextly, we prove the existence of solution to switching CGNN with state-dependent impulse. Then, we obtain the quantitative relation between new jump operators and system state and show that the global stability of the corresponding comparison system implies the same stability of the considered state-dependent impulsive switching CGNN. Finally, we establish a stability criterion for the considered CGNN using the proposed comparison system.|$|R
