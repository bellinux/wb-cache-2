50|$|The {{window manager}} uses the first request to {{intercept}} any request for mapping top-level windows (children {{of the root}} window). Whenever another application requests the mapping of a top-level window, the server does not do it but sends an event to the window manager instead. Most window managers reparent the window: they create a larger top-level window (called the <b>frame</b> <b>window)</b> and reparent the original window as a child of it. Graphically, this corresponds to placing the original window inside the <b>frame</b> <b>window.</b> The space of the <b>frame</b> <b>window</b> that is not taken by the original window {{is used for the}} decorative frame around the window (the “border” and the “title bar”).|$|E

5000|$|Technically, a reparenting {{window manager}} {{registers}} with the X server {{to be notified}} when a top-level window is mapped (attempts to become visible). When such an event is generated, the window manager creates a <b>frame</b> <b>window,</b> {{and in most cases}} also a title bar window. The <b>frame</b> <b>window</b> then becomes the parent of both the main window and the title bar window. Other forms of decoration, such as buttons, window title, etc., may also be created; these would normally be parented by the title bar window.|$|E

50|$|By {{assuming}} a Gaussian human response {{time to a}} particular in-game event, it becomes possible to discuss the effect of lag in terms of probabilities. Given a lag-less display, a human has a certain probability to land his/her input within a window of frames. As video games operate on discrete frames, missing the last frame of the window even by 0.1 ms causes an input to be interpreted a full frame later. Because of this, any amount of lag will affect a human's ability to hit a particular timing window. The severity of this impact {{is a function of}} the position and variance of a human's response to a visual cue, the amount of lag introduced, and the size of the timing window. For example, given a very large window of 30 frames, a human would likely have a 99.99% chance of hitting this window. By introducing one frame of lag, the human's ability to hit the 30 <b>frame</b> <b>window</b> would likely remain in the 99.99% range (assuming the human is responding somewhere near the middle of the window). Given a smaller window of say 2 frames, however, the effect of lag becomes much more significant. Assuming the human's response is centered on the 2 <b>frame</b> <b>window</b> and the super-human has a 99.99% chance to hit the window, introducing a full frame of lag causes the success rate to drop all the way to about 50%.|$|E

The New York Times reported that [...] "Staff members described sitting in his room and hearing ear-piercing noise or watching water ripple in glasses on his desk as the floor shook."

50|$|Some of {{the cars}} seemed spot on in detail and {{proportions}} like the Porsche 924 and the Volkswagens. Others were less confident in their realism. The Porsche 924 had nearly perfect proportion and the details were exquisite. The wheel design was generic but detailed and attractive with five larger and five smaller slots. Everything opened, including the rear plastic hatch. Even the hidden headlights popped up by moving a lever {{at the front of}} the chassis. When fully opened, however, the headlight lever stuck out from under the front bumper like some kind of strange antenna. The seats tilted forward, but chrome plating the steering wheel and gear shift was not so realistic. Another negative was that though the doors opened they did not include the door <b>frame</b> <b>window</b> surround.|$|E
40|$|To my family. ii The {{motivation}} for this thesis {{has been to}} improve the robustness of image processing appli-cations to motion estimation failure and in particular applications {{for the restoration of}} archived film. The thesis has been divided into two parts. The first part is concerned with the development of an missing data detection algorithm that is robust to Pathological Motion (PM). PM can cause clean image data to be misdiagnosed as missing data. The proposed algorithm uses a probabilistic framework to jointly detect PM and missing data. A five <b>frame</b> <b>window</b> is employed to detect missing data instead of the typical three <b>frame</b> <b>window.</b> This allows the temporally impulsive intensity profile of blotches to be distinguished from the quasi-periodic profile of PM. A second diagnostic for PM is defined on the local motion fields of the five <b>frame</b> <b>window.</b> This follows the observation that Pathologi-cal Motion causes the Smooth Local Flow Assumption of motion estimators to be violated. A ground truth comparison with standard missing data detectors shows that the proposed algo...|$|E

50|$|During {{its long}} {{career as an}} {{institution}} and hotel several major alterations {{have been carried out}} to the house. Externally the most notable alteration has been the addition of a bow fronted garden room to the terrace cloister of the garden from the main block and the in-filling of the garden cloister. This appears to have been carried out in the 1930s. The cloister has been in-filled with steel <b>framed</b> <b>windows</b> and doors of typical design of the period. Many of the original casement windows have also been replaced with steel <b>frame</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
30|$|Reverberant speech {{recognition}} has been tackled by feature enhancement at the front-end and model adaptation at the back-end. One {{of the simplest}} approaches to feature enhancement is the cepstral mean normalization (CMN) [1]. However, since reverberation time is usually longer than the <b>frame</b> <b>window</b> length for feature extraction, its effectiveness is limited. A major back-end approach {{is the use of}} maximum-likelihood linear regression (MLLR) [2] that adapts the acoustic model parameters to the corrupted speech.|$|E
30|$|The {{short-term}} cepstral coefficients are computed {{within a}} 30 -ms <b>frame</b> <b>window</b> at a 10 -ms shift. The {{dimension of the}} cepstral coefficients is 20. The voice-quality, prosodic, and GNE features are extracted over a 30 -ms frame length and at a 10 -ms shift using Praat software [43]. Then, each of the voice-quality, prosodic, and GNE features is estimated over a 500 -ms window with a 10 -ms shift. This is done to smooth out the feature estimation of the unvoiced frames. It is also done to synchronize them with the cepstral coefficients.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A novel {{temporal}} video segmentation method that, {{in addition}} to abrupt cuts, can detect with very high accuracy gradual transitions such as dissolves, fades and wipes is proposed. The method relies on evaluating mutual information between multiple pairs of frames within a certain temporal <b>frame</b> <b>window.</b> This way we create a graph where the frames are nodes and the measures of similarity correspond to the weights of the edges. By finding and disconnecting the weak connections between nodes we separate the graph to subgraphs ideally corresponding to the shots. Experiments on TRECVID 2004 video test set containing different types of shot transitions and significant object and camera motion inside the shots prove that the method is very efficient. I...|$|E

In [15], the <b>frame</b> <b>window</b> width {{is the same}} as the pulse width of the signal to be measured and the Gabor frames is not quite redundant. So the sparsity S of the Gabor coefficients recovered for signal representation is very small and the column dimension to row number ratio r of the measurement matrix is large enough to result in good RIP. However, to ensure enough sampling channel number in the sampling scheme proposed here, the E-spline smoothness order N should not be too small. According to [21], if N is large, which means the frame windows are high order exponential reproducing windows, the frames will be very redundant, and so the RIP may be hard to be satisfied [22]. In this study, we find that, for neutralizing the disadvantage caused by the redundancy, the frame windows width W [...]...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new missing data detection algorithm that is robust to Pathological Motion (PM). PM causes clean image {{data to be}} misdiagnosed as missing data, resulting in damage to the image during restoration. The proposed algorithm uses a probabilistic framework to jointly detect PM and missing data. It builds on an existing technique of using five frames for detection instead of the standard three frames. This allows the temporally impulsive intensity profile of blotches to be distinguished from the quasi-periodic profile of PM. Another diagnostic for PM is defined on the motion fields of the five <b>frame</b> <b>window.</b> This follows the observation that PM results in motion fields which are not smooth. A ground truth comparison with standard missing data detectors shows that the proposed algorithm dramatically reduces the number of falsely detected missing data regions. It is also shown to reduce image damage during missing data treatment...|$|E
