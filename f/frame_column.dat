Moreover, {{the results obtained}} were compared with experimental data. On this basis, a degenerated three-linearity (D-TRI) restoring force model was established which could reflect the hysteresis performance of corroded RC <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> through theoretical analysis and data fitting. Results indicated that the hysteretic bearing capacity of <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> decreased significantly due to corrosion of the rebar. In view {{of the characteristics of}} the hysteresis curve, the plumpness of the hysteresis loop for <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> decreased and shrinkage increased with increasing rebar corrosion. All these illustrated that the seismic energy dissipation performance of <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> reduced but their brittleness increased. As for the features of the skeleton curve, the trends for corroded and noncorroded members were basically consistent and roughly corresponded to the features of a trilinear equivalent model. Thereby, the existing Clough hysteresis rule can be used to establish the restoring force model applicable to corroded RC <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> based on that of the noncorroded RC members. The calculated skeleton curve and hysteresis curve of corroded RC <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> using the D-TRI model are closer to the experimental results...|$|R

The shear {{behaviors}} of steel reinforced high strength and high performance concrete (SRHSHPC) composite <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> are studied through the test {{on a number}} of SRHSHPC specimens with grade of concrete strength varied from C 80 to C 120 subjected to constant axial compression and cyclically varying horizontal load. Four influencing factors, namely, shear span ratio, axial compression ratio, stirrup ratio and concrete strength, are taken into consideration in the test, and strain gauges are respectively placed on steel web, stirrups as well as reinforcement bars to study the shear mechanism of SRHSHPC composite columns. According to test results, the shear failure patterns and shear mechanism of the specimens are discussed. By analyzing the contribution of the steel web, concrete, stirrups and reinforcement bars to the shear capacity, the shear mechanism of the SRHSHPC composite columns is figured out. Therefore, the influence of shear span ratio, axial compression ratio, stirrup ratios and concrete strength on shear {{behaviors of}} the SRHSHPC <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> is clear. Finally, concrete truss model and principle of accumulation are applied to discuss the shear capacity and a calculation model for shear strength of the SRHSHPC composite columns is established.

The basic characteristic of this new method of analysis is that the infill/frame contact lengths and the contact stresses are estimated {{as an integral part of}} the solution, and are not assumed in an ad-hoc way. Using this technique, the response of multi-story fully or partially infilled frames under lateral static loads has been investigated. In particular, the redistribution of the action-effects of lateral loads on the infiiled frames has been studied. It is shown that the presence and continuity of the infiil panels critically influence the redistribution of shear forces and leads, in general, to decreased shear forces on the <b>frame</b> <b>columns.</b> However, in case the infilled frames are built with a soft ground story, the shear forces acting on the <b>frame</b> <b>columns</b> are considerably higher than those obtained from the analysis of the bare frame.

The evaluation functions can also be used as tools for directly estimating the behavior of the designed structure. A successive quadratic programming (SQP) method is employed to solve the optimization problem of the approximate evaluation functions.

Flexibility-based method for modeling shear wall finite element and multi-vertical-line element (SFI-MVLEM) was proposed. Method of deleting failure component elements was presented, {{as well as the}} model solving algorithm. The FEM was validated by the completed structure test. On these bases, 3 groups of typical frame-shear structure systems were designed to perform nonlinear dynamic collapse analysis under different initial failure conditions, in order to study the impact of the number of floors and earthquake resistant design on the progressive collapse resistance of frame-shear structures. Analysis results showed that, at initial failure of <b>frame</b> <b>column,</b> the residual shear wall element can well complete the internal force redistribution of structure to provide alternative force transmission path, thereby forming antiprogressive collapse force.

It can avoid the adverse effects on the main structure under the earthquake. Then this paper designs three reinforced concrete frame models: one including stairs, one excluding stairs and one including the stairs with the use of isolation measures. And the authors use the response spectrum method for each model to calculate and analyze, the results show that the staircase had an impact on the lateral stiffness of the structure, and the seismic performance had an obvious difference between the model including stairs and the model excluding stairs. The layout of stairs can change the structure stiffness center, thus affect the torsion effects of the structure. The stairs, the staircase <b>frame</b> <b>column</b> force and the sway were increased and formed the weak parts of force. By setting the isolator to separate stairs with the main structure, the stairwell structural damping ratio is increased, the seismic effects on stair components are effectively reduced, the staircase column internal forces are significantly reduced and they can avoid the staircase column damage occurred under an earthquake. At last, this paper presents a reasonable measure to separate stairs from the overall structure, and a design and calculation method to set isolator in the frame structure staircase. It can make stairs members do not participate in seismic calculations of the overall structure and can effectively avoid the stairs component damage...|$|E
40|$|How can an {{electron}} {{be both a}} wave and a particle? At the same time? Because it is a quantum field. That key insight seems to be underappreciated, given the awe and mysticism that permeate most nontechnical discussions of modern physics. Perhaps {{the root of the}} problem is that most popularizations of quantum mechanics and of particle physics shy away from quantized fields, the natural language for microscopic phenomena. In 'The Lightness of Being: Mass, Ether, and the Unification of Forces', Frank Wilczek confronts quantum field theory head on, demystifying not only wave-particle duality but also the origin of mass for hadrons (that is, everyday matter). Wilczek is the Herman Feshbach Professor of Physics at MIT and a co-recipient of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics. His research has spanned almost all aspects of theoretical particle physics, with significant forays into condensed-matter physics and dense nuclear matter (condensed quark matter, one might say). Recurring themes are the richness of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the alluring ideas of unification. His breadth and depth make him a sought after speaker for colloquia and public lectures. Wilczek also contributes an occasional Reference <b>Frame</b> <b>column</b> to 'Physics Today'. The material in 'The Lightness of Being' reflects the scope of the author's research. The book consists of three parts: the quantum fields of QCD (the ether that makes mass), gravitation (the ether that feels mass), and unification. Part 1, which traces notions of mass from Isaac Newton's time through theoretical and computational results of the past 40 years, is the most substantial and original; it is rich, modern, and rooted in observed phenomena. Part 2 continues in the same vein as it connects gravity, also an observed phenomenon, to QCD. Part 3 is more conventional, for a popularization of particle physics, in its focus on speculative ideas that (still) await direct experimental tests. Readers of 'Physics Today' will know that Wilczek can write with wit, grace, and an uncanny facility for using lightweight language to express heavy-duty ideas. They will find much of that kind of writing in 'The Lightness of Being'. Wilczek addresses subtle ideas with vim and vigor. He avoids some of the jargon of quantum field theory; for example, he calls the vertex in a Feynman diagram a hub. In more ambitious terminology, he refers to space-filling, everfluctuating quantum fields [...] be they electrons, quarks, gluons, or gravity [...] as 'the Grid'. The term is supposed to be short and familiar, evoking the ubiquitous electric grid (and soon-to-beubiquitous computing grid). It also, for the expert, cleverly alludes to lattice gauge theory. Indeed, after vividly explaining how the dynamics of QCD and the constraints of Heisenberg uncertainty conspire to create mass from the Grid, Wilczek emphasizes that the picture is backed by lattice QCD computations of 'heroic' proportions. Unfortunately, too much of 'The Lightness' is laden with clunky affectation: silly names (a pulsed electron accelerator is called the 'ultrastroboscopic nanomicroscope'), sophomoric jokes ('hadron' is 'not a typo'), references to pop culture (Wilczek might have called quantum fields 'the Matrix, but the sequels tarnished that candidate'), and many pointless footnotes. In a public lecture the audience may guffaw at such jokes, but on the printed page they fall flat. Wilczek explains physics so well that the inappropriate humor is the biggest unexplained puzzle of the book. It is fine to be silly, even crude, as long as the reader's path to understanding is made easier. A joke can inform with an unexpected perspective or simply give the mind a pause to refresh. Some of the humor achieves such aims, but too many gags impede the pace of the otherwise fine exposition. Three appendices, a glossary, and a set of endnotes are crisp and sober. They are excellent. 'The Lightness of Being' is not unbearable, but it is weighed down with too much clutter to rank as a masterpiece. It's a pity: Wilczek's best writing [...] some of it in this book [...] is...|$|E
