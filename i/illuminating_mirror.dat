2500|$|Fused {{plugs and sockets}} {{of various}} {{proprietary}} and non-interchangeable types are found in older public buildings in the UK, where {{they are used to}} feed AC electric wall clocks. They are smaller than conventional sockets, commonly being made to fit BESA junction boxes, and are often of very low profile. Early types were available fused in both poles, later types fused in the line only and provided an earth pin. Most are equipped with a retaining screw or clip to prevent accidental disconnection. The prevalence of battery powered quartz controlled wall clocks has meant that this connector is rarely seen in new installations for clock use. [...] However, it has found use where a low profile fused connector is required and is still available.

5000|$|In 1991, a [...] 4.9-liter V8—the {{largest of}} this type—became the new {{standard}} powerplant. Also new was a grille of an inverted trapezoid design (almost upside-down from last years egg-crate keystone design), and revised bumper and body-side moldings. The new grille held the familiar shape of the Cadillac crest itself—a styling cue that continues to this day. The grille was now attached to the forward edge of the hood, and lifted up along with the hood when raised (similar to Mercedes-Benz). The secondary hood release latch {{was at the bottom}} of the grille instead of its previous location above the passenger side headlight. In addition to the new engine and minor front-end restyling, several previously optional features became standard this year, including the anti-lock braking system, accent striping, automatic door locks, twilight sentinel headlamp control, electrochromic inside rear-view mirror, and electric rear window and side mirror defogger. New standard features included rear-seat air conditioning vents, central door unlocking from the driver's door and luggage compartment, sun visors with shaded slide-out extensions, rear window lock-out switch, brake / transmission interlock safety switch, and an oil life indicator through the fuel data center. Other new features included the available remote keyless entry system, and the optional <b>illuminated</b> <b>mirrors</b> now featured a slide switch that offered variable intensity lighting. The first [...] "Deville Touring Sedan" [...] became available to the public on April 1, 1991. As a limited edition of only 1,500 produced for the 1991 model year, it was offered in 5 monochromatic paint schemes: Carmine Red; Cotillion White; Black; Dark Slate Gray metallic; and Black Sapphire Metallic. Larger 16" [...] x 6.5" [...] forged aluminum wheels with a wreath and crest center cap were fitted to P215/60R16 Goodyear GA all-season radial tires. A quicker 17:1 steering gear was also used. The specific Beechwood-color interior of the DeVille Touring Sedan had leather seating areas and revised seat design with integral lumbar support. Both driver and passenger seat featured six-way power seat adjusters and power recliners. This specific interior also featured American Walnut wood accents on the doors and instrument panel. A grill-mounted wreath and crest replaced the traditional stand-up hood ornament. Side door moldings feature [...] "TOURING SEDAN" [...] lettering and import style break-away outside rearview mirrors were painted body color. Revised sport door handles also are painted body color. The revised exterior also included a cloisonne deck lid lock cover similar to the STS and Eldorado Touring Coupe. Approximately 75 of these 1991 models remain roadworthy as of December 31, 2014.|$|R

5000|$|As {{part of this}} update, officially {{known as}} the TJ MY02 series, side impact bars {{previously}} fitted only to export models were also introduced for Australian market cars, and the front doors now featured energy absorbing material. The Magna Executive received ABS and power windows as standard, while the Advance, Sports and VR-X were each fitted with a six speaker sound system (up from four), automatic climate control, front map lamps, glovebox lamp and power antenna. The Verada Xi's electric sunroof with front map lamps and C pillar courtesy lamps was now optional on all models. The Sports was further distanced from the VR-X by no longer sharing the same boot lid spoiler, but a smaller version (which became another optional accessory across the Magna range, and was fitted as standard on subsequent limited-run models, the Verada GTV and Diamante VR-X). Power for the standard (non [...] "high output") 3.5-litre V6 engine increased to [...] thanks to a higher compression ratio and a Karman Vortex airflow meter.

40|$|A {{particle}} fallout/activity sensor measures relative {{amounts of}} dust or other particles which collect on a mirror {{in an area}} to be monitored. The sensor includes a sensor module and a data acquisition module, both {{of which can be}} operated independently of one another or in combination with one another. The sensor module includes a housing containing the mirror, an LED assembly for <b>illuminating</b> the <b>mirror</b> and an optical detector assembly for detecting light scattered off of the mirror by dust or other particles collected thereon. A microprocessor controls operation of the sensor module's components and displays results of a measurement on an LCD display mounted on the housing. A push button switch is also mounted on the housing which permits manual initiation of a measurement. The housing is constructed of light absorbing material, such as black delrin, which minimizes detection of light by the optical detector assembly other than that scattered by dust or particles on the mirror. The data acquisition module can be connected to the sensor module and includes its own microprocessor, a timekeeper and other digital circuitry for causing the sensor module to make a measurement periodically and send the measurement data to the data acquisition module for display and storage in memory for later retrieval and transfer to a separate computer. The time tagged measurement data {{can also be used to}} determine the relative level of activity in the monitored area since this level is directly related to the amount of dust or particle fallout in the area...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{pressure}} {{on a flat}} mirror submerged in a transparent liquid, depends {{not only on the}} refractive index n of the liquid, but also on the phase angle psi_ 0 of the Fresnel reflection coefficient of the mirror, which could be anywhere between 0 ^∘ and 180 ^∘. Depending on the value of psi_ 0, the momentum per incident photon picked up by the mirror covers the range between the Abraham and Minkowski values, i. e., the interval (2 _ 0 /nc, 2 n_ 0 /c). Here ħ is the reduced Planck constant, w_ 0 is the frequency of the incident photon, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. We argue that a simple experimental setup involving a dielectric slab of refractive index n, a vibrating mirror placed a short distance behind the slab, a collimated, monochromatic light beam <b>illuminating</b> the <b>mirror</b> through the slab, and an interferometer to measure the phase of the reflected beam, is all that is needed to deduce the precise magnitude of the radiation {{pressure on}} a submerged mirror. In the proposed experiment, the transparent slab plays the role of the submerging liquid (even though it remains detached from the mirror at all times), and the adjustable gap between the mirror and the slab simulates the variable phase-angle psi_ 0. The phase of the reflected beam, measured as a function of time during one oscillation period of the mirror, then provides the information needed to determine the gap-dependence of the reflected beam's Doppler shift and, consequently, the radiation pressure experienced by the mirror.

5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a <b>mirror</b> <b>illuminating</b> light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that {{the side of the}} moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|R
