500|$|The {{writer of}} the ceremony, Frank Cottrell Boyce, said: [...] "People around us thought it might need defending, so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> do press the next morning. I was {{completely}} surprised [...] [...] A {{lot of people were}} surprised. [...] But I don't think Danny was surprised. [...] Danny never blinked. At no point did he show any feeling {{that it was going to}} be anything but amazing. [...] And he was right." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the battle, US Air Force assets {{had flown}} 9,691 {{tactical}} sorties and dropped 14,223tons of bombs on targets within the Khe Sanh area. Marine Corps aviators had flown 7,098 missions and released 17,015tons. Naval aircrews, many of whom were redirected from Operation Rolling Thunder strikes against North Vietnam, flew 5,337 sorties and dropped 7,941 tons of ordnance in the area. Westmoreland later wrote that [...] "Washington so feared that some word of it might reach the press that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> desist, ironically answering what those consequences could be: a political disaster." ...|$|E
2500|$|Only 68 overs were {{possible}} {{on the second}} day. Ian Bell dominated, setting out his case for an England call-up, with 143 not out. He said, [...] "If I was to play for England, I'd bat anywhere <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> bat. Just to play would be great. I'm batting at three for Warwickshire and enjoying it. I know there’s some competition [...] and there's a lot being talked about it. I've just got to concentrate on scoring as many runs as I can for Warwickshire." [...] No other player scored so freely though, and Warwickshire ended the day on 277 for 6.|$|E
6000|$|... "For my part," [...] {{said the}} private, meekly, [...] "I must obey my officers; so when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> run, <b>I</b> run; and when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> fight, <b>I</b> fight." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2003, {{a drunken}} Rogers taunted Australian Idol judge Mark Holden in an Adelaide airport terminal. He claimed that You Am <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> [...] "make way" [...] by their record label for new Idol winners. A {{physical}} altercation ensued and both parties were reprimanded by airport authorities.|$|R
2500|$|Soros was 13 {{years old}} in March 1944 when Nazi Germany {{occupied}} Hungary. Jewish children were barred from attending school by the Nazis, and Soros and the other schoolchildren were made {{to report to the}} Judenrat ("Jewish Council") which had been established during the occupation. Soros later described this time to writer Michael Lewis: [...] "The Jewish Council asked the little kids to hand out the deportation notices. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> go to the Jewish Council. And there I was given these small slips of paper.... I took this piece of paper to my father. He instantly recognized it. This was a list of Hungarian Jewish lawyers. He said, [...] "You deliver the slips of paper and tell the people that if they report they will be deported." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2002, a {{representative}} of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, the General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, contacted former Central Intelligence Agency Counterterrorism Department head Vincent Cannistraro stating that Saddam [...] "knew there was a campaign to link him to 11 September and prove he {{had weapons of mass destruction}} (WMDs)." [...] Cannistraro further added that [...] "the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> stand aside and they would handle it." [...] Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all [...] "killed" [...] by the George W. Bush administration because they allowed Saddam to remain in power, an outcome viewed as unacceptable. It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep $1 billion USD.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{members of}} the cast {{described}} Hustle's filming schedule as incredibly hectic. Vaughn said that [...] " [...] was offered to me, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> {{get on a plane}} an hour after I got the phone call and start shooting the following day." [...] Speaking in 2009 after filming four series of the show, Lester explained that [...] "when we start shooting Hustle we film two episodes concurrently, with the scenes out of sequence. Knowing where you are in the intricate plots at any one moment is... challenging". Murray, by contrast, claimed that the hardest scene to film was from the fourth episode, when Danny loses spectacularly to Stacie in strip poker and ends up entirely naked. [...] "It was the toughest scene for me of the entire six months we spent filming the series... Stacie is supposed to be calm, cool and collected... she looks down, checks him out and casually and suavely makes a comment. I kept looking down, dissolving into fits of laughter and was almost unable to deliver my line. So all you'll see is me laughing".|$|E
6000|$|... "Pass?" [...] {{repeated}} the baron. [...] "You mean they {{fight with the}} fist--so? To distribute a pass--so," [...] and the baron struck out at an imaginary enemy.

5000|$|Little Sister Magdeleine {{summed up}} the {{vocation}} of the Little Sisters of Jesus in these words:"If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> define the mission of our community in a single word, I would not hesitate for a single moment to cry, 'Unity'. All our vocation {{can be summed up}} in the word, 'Unity'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, nay, {{we brought}} you here, {{and we do}} what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> do from Above.

2500|$|The {{university}} has been criticised for their handling of reported sexual assaults. One case highlighted {{the way in}} which the University claimed to [...] "assist" [...] a student after the student alleged sexual assault by another student. News Limited reported that the University did not take any disciplinary action against the alleged perpetrator, instead advising the victim to change behaviour, with the victim adding: [...] "Nothing happened to him. Instead <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> make all the changes". For self-protection the victim independently succeeded in taking out an Apprehended Violence Order via the courts against the alleged. Karen Willis, the executive officer of Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia, described the actions of the university as [...] "disgraceful", as it placed the [...] "onus and responsibility on the person who has experienced violence". The university responded that its instructions are [...] "standard procedure", it [...] "does not comment on specific allegations", and it is not able to investigate sexual assault claims, as those must be investigated by the NSW Police. Another alleged victim considers their sexual assault and UoW's [...] "response to be equally despicable." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, Gainsbourg and English actress Jane Birkin began a {{relationship}} {{when they met}} {{on the set of}} the film Slogan. After filming, he asked her to record the song with him. Birkin had heard the Bardot version and thought it [...] "so hot". She said: [...] "I only sang it because I didn't want anybody else to sing it", jealous at the thought of his sharing a recording studio with someone else. Gainsbourg asked her to sing an octave higher than Bardot, [...] "so you'll sound like a little boy". It was recorded in an arrangement by Arthur Greenslade in a studio at Marble Arch. Birkin said she [...] "got a bit carried away with the heavy breathing – so much so, in fact, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> calm down, which meant that at one point I stopped breathing altogether. If you listen to the record now, you can still hear that little gap." [...] There was media speculation, as with the Bardot version, that they had recorded live sex, to which Gainsbourg told Birkin, [...] "Thank goodness it wasn't, otherwise I hope {{it would have been a}} long-playing record." [...] It was released in February 1969. The single had a plain cover, with the words [...] "Interdit aux moins de 21 ans" [...] (forbidden to those under 21), and the record company changed the label from Philips to Fontana.|$|E
2500|$|Paulini uses life {{experiences}} {{her and her}} friends and family have gone through as inspiration for writing songs, and tries to keep the lyrics as honest as possible. She began writing songs before entering Australian Idol, but stated that she had [...] "stopped and just did the projects <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] referring to her first two albums released through Sony BMG. Paulini had no songwriting credits on her debut album One Determined Heart (2004), and co-wrote only two tracks on her second album Superwoman (2006). In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Paulini revealed that she felt manufactured with her first two albums, saying: [...] "You kind of actually feel trapped because when they would ask you to make an album, they'd {{have a list of}} songs ready for you to choose from. It was like a massive list of just songs that other people have written that you can just kind of go, 'Oh yeah. I like that one. I like the sound of this.' It just didn't seem real. I mean, it wasn't real for me. They were all great songs and written by awesome writers. But, they weren't my words and my experiences; I didn't feel like it belonged to me." [...] Paulini was heavily involved with the songwriting on her third album Come Alive (2015), having co-written all but two tracks on the album. She referred to Come Alive as her first real album as she took her time working on it, explaining that with [...] "this one, this is me. Every experience in there is me, it's what I've gone through, or what I’ve interpreted {{from my point of view}} with other situations with my friends and family." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{spend hours}} {{trying to imagine}} the encounter, inventing little dialogues. I go alone to the Bureau to find if any news has come to hand from the Great Index in Paris, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> wait another twenty-four hours.

60|$|Like other Arabs, the Hutaym tribe {{is divided}} into a {{multitude}} of clans, septs, and families, each under its own Shaykh. All are Moslems, after the Desert pattern, a very rude and inchoate article. Wellsted knew them by their remarkably broad chins: the Bedawi recognize them by their look; by their peculiar accent, and {{by the use of}} certain peculiar words, as Harr! when donkey-driving.

2500|$|Ledley {{was played}} in an {{unfamiliar}} role at left-back during his first month at Celtic, a position he had only previously played in once or twice. [...] Despite playing {{in an unfamiliar}} position, he concentrated on establishing himself in his new team, stating [...] "...if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> do a job for my team, I {{try to do it}} {{to the best of my}} ability", and he scored his first goal for Celtic against St Mirren in a 4–0 home victory in the SPL on 22 August 2010.

60|$|These rough plains {{were also}} the haunt of the rhea, our ostrich, and {{it was here that}} I first had a close sight of this {{greatest}} and most unbird-like bird of our continent.
