As they near the neighboring house and call out, Leatherface lunges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> and kills Franklin with a chainsaw. Sally runs toward the house and finds the desiccated remains of an elderly couple upstairs. She escapes from Leatherface by jumping through a second-floor window and flees to the gas station. The proprietor calms her with offers of help but then ties her up, gags her and forces her into his truck. He drives to the house, arriving {{at the same time as}} the hitchhiker, now revealed as Leatherface's brother. The hitchhiker recognizes Sally and taunts her.|$|E
5|$|Although Niémen {{was very}} badly damaged, Amethyst was almost {{uncontrollable}} and despite Seymour's best efforts, {{he was unable}} to close with Niémen to ensure her surrender. Dupotet meanwhile was overseeing hasty repairs in the hope of getting away before Amethyst could recover. At 03:45, however, a new ship emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness,</b> soon revealed to be the British frigate HMS Arethusa. Arethusa was deployed as part of the force blockading the ports of Northern Spain and her commander, Captain Robert Mends, was a successful officer who had been commended just two weeks earlier for raiding the French-held port of Lekeitio. Mends immediately pulled alongside Niémen and Dupotet fired a single shot each at Amethyst and Arethusa. The shot at Amethyst missed its target, but the one at Arethusa struck the ship and threw up splinters. Mends was struck on the forehead and badly wounded, the only man to be hit. Both Amethyst and Arethusa then opened fire, Niémen surrendering immediately.|$|E

5|$|Dozens of Dementors emerge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> {{while one}} descends and {{attempts}} to suck out the riders' souls. This effect is achieved by projecting the riders' faces onto a cloud of fog {{in front of the}} Dementor, blasting cold air towards the riders, and using a heartbeat-like sound played through the sub-woofers built into the benches. After shaking the riders out of the trance, Harry causes the Dementors to flee with a protective Patronus Charm. After the final Dementor, and while Harry uses his Patronus, the riders enter the final video dome segment, where the cliffs outside the Chamber of Secrets cave in. They fly over the Black Lake, back into Hogwarts and through the Main Hall and Grand Staircase, where they are cheered on by a series of onscreen characters from the movies who appear three-dimensional. Professor Dumbledore sends everyone back through the Floo Network to the Room of Requirement, where they exit their bench.|$|E
5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group are {{targeted}} and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E

25|$|In July 1805 Plumper, {{together}} with her sister-ship , {{were part of the}} Royal Navy force blockading the coat of northern France. On 15 July the two gun-brigs were off Granville, Manche when they became becalmed. To avoid the tide carrying them onto the coast, the two anchored in the afternoon off Chausey. A heavy fog came up and at 2:30 am on 16 July, several French vessels were seen to emerge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> Plumper attempted to get closer to Teazer so that they could support each other, but was unable to so. The French force, which consisted of six brigs, a schooner, and a ketch, stood off and battered Plumper with their guns. Plumper returned fire, but being armed primarily with cannonades, was outranged. During the exchange of fire, Garrety had an arm shot off, a leg crippled by grapeshot, and a piece of langrange lacerated his chest. Four seamen were also wounded. After an hour, Sub-Lieutenant Richards, who had taken over command after Garrety had been taken below, struck. Later, some of Plumpers crew accused Richards of having too quickly surrendered.|$|E
25|$|Goya depicts Saturn feasting {{upon one}} of his sons. His child's head {{and part of the}} left arm have already been consumed. The right arm has {{probably}} been eaten too, though it could be folded in front of the body and held in place by Saturn's thumbs. The titan is on the point of taking another bite from the left arm; as he looms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness,</b> his mouth gapes and his eyes bulge whitely. The only other brightness in the picture comes from the white flesh, the red blood of the corpse, the white knuckles of Saturn as he digs his fingers {{into the back of the}} body. There is evidence that the picture may have originally portrayed the titan with a partially erect penis, but, if ever present, this addition was lost due to the deterioration of the mural over time or during the transfer to canvas; in the picture today the area around his groin is indistinct. It may even have been overpainted deliberately before the picture was put on public display.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eighth}} season of TV series Supernatural, protagonists Dean and Sam Winchester {{discover}} that Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) {{has been living}} in isolation for centuries because he became disgusted with Heaven's actions. Although he initially presents himself as an ally in the brothers' quests to seal up Heaven and Hell after they find him again, Metatron later turns against them, tricking their angelic ally Castiel into completing a ritual that leaves Castiel stripped of his angelic powers and banishes all angels apart from Metatron to Earth. Throughout the ninth season, the brothers and Castiel are forced to deal with the return of the arch-demon Abaddon along with the angels that were banished by Metatron's actions, with Metatron gathering allies that he will 'allow' back into Heaven while presenting Castiel as the villain, until Castiel manages to regain his powers and trick Metatron into revealing the monster he truly is to the other angels. Although he is released from prison in Heaven when the brothers and Castiel question him for information about the new threat in the tenth season, he is subsequently stripped of his powers by Castiel and left to wander Earth, powerless to do anything more than watch as the world goes by while aware that the other angels will kill him if he does anything to draw their attention. After God returns to help the Winchesters against new foe the Darkness- essentially God's sister, who he sacrificed to make the world- Metatron sacrifices himself to give the Winchesters time to escape after they rescue Lucifer- currently using Castiel as a vessel- <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Darkness.</b>|$|E

She is referred to as a great and loving primordial Mother Goddess in the Hindu tantric tradition.

Fraser then ordered Jamaica and Belfast to move into range and finish the crippled ship off with torpedoes. After several more torpedo hits, Scharnhorst settled further into the water and began to list to starboard. At 19:45, the ship went down by the bows, with her propellers still slowly turning. British ships began searching for survivors, but were soon ordered away after just a few were pulled out of the water even though voices could still be heard calling for help <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> Of the crew of 1,968 officers and enlisted men, only 36 men survived.|$|E

500|$|Inman's {{squadron}} entered Dunkirk harbour on {{the late}} evening of 7July 1800, Dart slowly leading the way {{and the rest of}} the squadron sailing in a line behind the heavily armed sloop. [...] Inman had crewed the hired ships Vigilant and Nile with men impressed from smugglers ships, and these men acted as guides for the British force. At midnight the shapes of the French frigates appeared <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> ahead and Dart gradually passed down their line, until a hail from one of the frigates demanded to know where Dart had come from. A French-speaking officer replied [...] "De Bordeaux" [...] ("from Bordeaux") and was then asked what the little ships behind Dart were, to which the officer replied [...] "Je ne sais pas" [...] ("I do not know"). Apparently satisfied with this reply, there were no more questions from the frigate and Dart continued its passage until it came alongside the last French frigate but one. Lookouts on this ship recognised the shape of the strange vessel that had appeared out of the night and immediately opened fire, to which Dart swiftly responded. Campbell knew that his heavy carronades were devastating at close range, and had ordered them to be double-shotted, meaning that each carronade carried twice the ordinary number of missiles. The effect was immediate, with heavy casualties and severe damage inflicted on the French vessel. The fast loading abilities of the carronades allowed the sloop's 15guns to keep up a steady fire as Dart swept on to the last ship in line, Désirée.|$|E
500|$|The [...] are {{humans who}} willingly {{give up their}} lives to have their souls sealed in statues and commune with summoners with whom they have {{established}} a mental link. This link grants a summoner access to a fayth's dreams and enables {{him or her to}} physically realize those dreams as , powerful creatures which may be employed to aid the summoner in battle or in a time of special need. During the events of Final Fantasy X, the fayth of the aeon Bahamut serves as the chosen representative of the fayth as a collective. The fayth aids High Summoner Yuna and her guardians in bringing the spiral of death to an end, which results in their own passing. In Final Fantasy X-2, the fayth return in their aeon forms, this time having been overcome by the despair and malice of Shuyin, rendering them his unwilling puppets of chaos. Yuna and her allies free both the fayth and Shuyin <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> that has consumed them. Ten aeons are identified in Final Fantasy X: Valefor, Ifrit, Shiva, Ixion, Bahamut, Anima, Yojimbo and the three Magus Sisters. The game builds on mythological figures through the inclusion of the aeons, such as the Arabic Ifrit, the Hindu deity Shiva and even the Jungian figure Anima and the demon Valefor. Wilder wrote on the Jungian analysis of Anima and tied Square Enix's depiction of the Aeon as both a representation of Seymour's corruption. Wilder analyzes the chained and blinded depiction of the figure that is Seymour's mother and tying the form to her bound to servitude to Seymour in his descent into madness.|$|E
500|$|From 1953 to 1967, O'Hara had a {{relationship}} with Enrique Parra, a wealthy Mexican politician and banker. She met him at a restaurant during a trip to Mexico in 1951. O'Hara stated that Parra [...] "saved me <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> of an abusive marriage and brought me back into the warm light of life again. Leaving him {{was one of the most}} painful things I have ever had to do." [...] As her relationship with Parra progressed, she began to learn Spanish and even enrolled her daughter in a Mexican school. She moved in 1953 to a smaller property at 10677 Somma Way in Bel Air, amid frequent visits to Mexico City, where she and Parra were very well-known celebrities. She hired a detective to follow Parra in Mexico and found that he was being fully honest about the relationship with his ex-wife and that she could trust him. John Ford intensely disliked Parra, and it affected her relationship with Ford in the 1950s as he often interfered in her affairs and frowned upon the demise of her marriage to Price, being a devout Catholic like O'Hara. Price also continued to harass O'Hara for dating Parra and filed a case against her on 20 June 1955, seeking custody of Bronwyn and accusing her of immorality. O'Hara filed a countersuit, charging him with contempt of court for refusing to pay $50 a month in child support and a $7 a month alimony. During the publicity stage of The Long Gray Line in 1955, Ford insulted O'Hara and her brother Charles when he remarked to Charles, [...] "if that whore sister of yours can pull herself away from that Mexican long enough to do a little publicity for us, the film might have a chance at some decent returns".|$|E
