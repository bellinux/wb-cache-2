Contrary to other mortuary temples, the <b>inner</b> <b>sanctum</b> was thus separated from the pyramid by the courtyard. The only remains of the mortuary temple that are visible today are its basalt paving and the large granite blocks framing the outer door.|$|E

5|$|Parashurameshvara Temple {{was built}} by the Shailodbhavas, who had Shiva as their family deity.

The temple was repaired in 1903, with some changes in the roof of the <b>inner</b> <b>sanctum,</b> whilst retaining most of the original structure. Being located in the eastern coast, Parashurameshvara, like other Orissan temples, was not much affected by Muslim invasions of the 12–13th centuries. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a ticketed monument.|$|E

5|$|The {{layout of}} the complex, however, differs {{significantly}} from that of earlier complexes. Indeed, it is organized on a north–south axis rather than an east–west one: the high temple is located south of the main pyramid and its structures are turned away from it. Furthermore, a small offering chapel is adjoining the eastern base of the pyramid, a configuration otherwise unattested since offering chapels usually occupy the <b>inner</b> <b>sanctum</b> of the mortuary temple. Finally, immediately {{to the south of}} Userkaf's funerary enclosure is a second smaller pyramid complex attributed to his wife, queen Neferhetepes.|$|E

It is now visited by a large number of Tibetans, who come to worship Jowo in the temple's <b>inner</b> <b>sanctum.</b> During the Revolution, the temple was spared destruction and was reportedly boarded up until 1979. At that time, portions of the Jokhang reportedly housed pigs, a slaughterhouse and Chinese army barracks. Soldiers burned historic Tibetan scriptures. For a time, it was a hotel.|$|E
5|$|Parashurameshvara Temple {{is one of}} the Parashurameshvara {{group of}} temples, {{considered}} to be the oldest temples in Bhubaneswar. Some historians believe Parashurameshvara Temple to have been built in the early 8th century CE., subsequent to the construction of the Satruguneswar, Bharateswar and Lakshmaneswar temples in the late 7th century, although K.C.Panigrahi places the date as 650 CE. Fergusson believed that the temple might have been initiated at around 500 CE. A mid-7th century date is agreed by most scholars based on style and the presence of the eight planets which appear over the door to the <b>inner</b> <b>sanctum</b> as the later temples portray nine.|$|E

As the scenario begins, the players are told that the evil wizard Acererak is said to linger in his ancient tomb in undead form. Originally a powerful lich, he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull.

5|$|Apart {{from these}} sculptures, entire {{sequences}} from the Hindu epics (commonly the Ramayana and the Mahabharata) have been sculpted in a clockwise direction {{starting at the}} main entrance.

Also frequently seen in these temples is Durga, with several arms holding weapons given to her by other gods, {{in the act of}} killing a buffalo (a demon in a buffalo's form) and Harihara (a fusion of Shiva and Vishnu) holding a conch, wheel and trident. Many of these friezes were signed by the artisans, the first known instance of signed artwork in India.|$|E
25|$|Only priests {{attached}} to a fire temple may enter the innermost sanctum itself, which is closed {{on at least one}} side and has a double domed roof.

The wall(s) of the <b>inner</b> <b>sanctum</b> are almost always tiled or of marble, but are otherwise undecorated. There are no lights – other than that of the fire itself – in the <b>inner</b> <b>sanctum.</b> In Indian-Zoroastrian (not evident in the modern buildings in Iran) tradition the temples are often designed such that direct sunlight does not enter the sanctuary.|$|E

He covers the hotly contested memberships in the “right” clubs to the rise of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago which leveled long-standing barriers with its glitz and celebration of new glamour. He hilariously writes about the architecture wars -— when the high social value of buying one of the “grand old” homes shifted to knocking those old houses down and the race to build mega-mansions in their place. And he captures the uneasy alliances that fuel marriages -- including the successive trophy wives - to the rancorous and even fatal divorces.|$|R
