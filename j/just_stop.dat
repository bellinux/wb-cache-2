500|$|Marmarosa {{continued}} {{to perform in}} Pittsburgh, albeit irregularly. Around 1963, DeFranco dropped by; he recalled that the pianist [...] "would play brilliantly for half a tune, then <b>just</b> <b>stop</b> and walk away. He didn't even know who I was". Marmarosa's last performance in public has been dated variously as occurring in 1968 or the early-to-mid 1970s. Diabetes contributed to his permanent retirement. [...] "Even the resurgence of interest in bebop in the 1970s and 80s did not {{bring him back to}} national attention", reported The New York Times.|$|E
500|$|The song heavily {{features}} bombastic tribal drums, and paranoia-inducing strings {{that create}} a feeling of tension. The beat of [...] "Monster" [...] {{has been described as}} a [...] "hyperventilating death rattle" [...] by The Washington Posts Chris Richards, commenting that the song was permeated with dark, urgent-sounding moans. The chorus of the song has two separate meanings; on the surface, it appears that West is bragging about his abilities as a rapper, while also making a comment on the media's reception of him, with lines like [...] "gossip, gossip, nigga <b>just</b> <b>stop</b> it, everybody knows I'm a muthafuckin' monster".|$|E
500|$|The two lead counsel clashed {{again during}} their final {{addresses}} to the jury, with Pepler objecting to Diefenbaker's use of testimony from the preliminary hearing. Justice McFarlane stated to Pepler, [...] "I {{do not think}} you should object like this", and when Pepler persisted, the judge [...] "roared" [...] at him, [...] "Please, <b>just</b> <b>stop</b> this." [...] Diefenbaker stated, [...] "I sat and suffered while my learned friend misconstrued the evidence" [...] and when he noticed Pepler muttering under his breath, said to him, [...] "You are growling", to which Pepler replied, [...] "Yes I am growling. I am objecting too." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Lantieri, {{mechanical}} effects {{supervisor for}} the 1912 scenes, noted {{the difficulty in}} shooting the train sequence. [...] "You can't <b>just</b> <b>stop</b> a train," [...] he said, [...] "If it misses its mark, it takes blocks and blocks to stop it and back up." [...] Lantieri hid handles for the actors and stuntmen to grab onto when leaping from carriage to carriage. The carriage interiors shot at Universal Studios Hollywood were built on tubes that inflated and deflated to create a rocking motion. For the close-up of the rhinoceros that strikes at (and misses) Indiana, a foam and fiberglass animatronic was made in London. When Spielberg decided {{he wanted it to}} move, the prop was sent to John Carl Buechler in Los Angeles, who resculpted it over three days to blink, snarl, snort and wiggle its ears. The giraffes were also created in London. Because steam locomotives are very loud, Lantieri's crew would respond to first assistant director David Tomblin's radioed directions by making the giraffes nod or shake their heads to his questions, which amused the crew. For the villains' cars, Lantieri selected a 1914 Ford Model T, a 1919 Ford Model T truck and a 1916 Saxon Model 14, fitting each with a Ford Pinto V6 engine. Sacks of dust were hung under the cars to create a dustier environment.|$|E
500|$|However, {{in a more}} mixed review, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the song [...] "seems {{as if it were}} written by a ninth-grader imagining her rebellious college sister’s lifestyle" [...] and felt that it lacked {{creativity}} within Cyrus' catalog. Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan was skeptical of Cyrus' increasingly provocative image, stating that the lyrics in the chorus would be [...] "an odd fit for any singer" [...] and opining that [...] "there's still a bit too much Disney in her voice to fill the track." [...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone {{came to me and said}} okay, you've got the first single. I had to say no, I know this is it and I'll go to battle if I have to, against anyone who doesn't believe in it. Now I have this freedom to do whatever I want, because people trust me.' She was right about this one. The song's straightforward party is now tied to a sordid universe of visuals- the official video and the VMA performance." [...] Common Sense Media gave the song two stars out of five saying that [...] "After listening to the weird intro to [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] you'll kind of wish the song did <b>just</b> <b>stop</b> right there." ...|$|E
500|$|The tenth track, [...] "White Christmas", was {{the first}} song to be {{recorded}} for Wrapped in Red. A cover of Rodgers and Hammerstein's [...] "My Favorite Things" [...] follows up as the eleventh track. Clarkson opted for the Broadway performance of the song to stray away from Julie Andrews' version, citing: [...] "I think you shouldn't go near anywhere of what she's doing because she's so good." [...] Clarkson and Kurstin co-wrote [...] "4 Carats" [...] with Cathy Dennis and Livvi Franc. Originally written as a pop song, they converted it into a Christmas song to fit the album's theme, describing it as a crossover between Eartha Kitt's [...] "Santa Baby" [...] (1953) and Madonna's [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1984). A rendition of Imogen Heap's [...] "Just for Now" [...] was described by Clarkson as her highly dysfunctional environment, saying: [...] "Can we <b>just</b> <b>stop</b> for like five minutes and have like a normal Christmas setting?" [...] The song begins by sampling the melody of the Christmas tune [...] "Carol of the Bells". The closing track, a rendition of the traditional carol [...] "Silent Night", features McEntire and Trisha Yearwood and ends in an a cappella setting between the trio. In addition, two tracks were {{also included in the}} deluxe edition of the album: the first, Clarkson's cover of [...] "I'll Be Home for Christmas" [...] from her iTunes Session extended play, and the second, her rendition of the first stanza of the ecclesiastical hymn [...] "Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel".|$|E

500|$|The caravan {{park was}} largely empty at the time, and closed for winter {{several days after}} filming ended. Both actors and crew slept in the same caravan in which the film was set. Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he {{felt that it was}} [...] "quite hectic but [...] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." [...] During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that [...] "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll <b>just</b> <b>stop</b> eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer." [...] Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that [...] "When I was 14, I had– let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if [...] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, {{for the rest of your}} life you're very aware of it. It can make you feel your foundations are a little bit shaky. It's a devastating experience but we revisited it. I just went with my instincts and intuition." ...|$|E

The demonstration was among ACT Up's most controversial, but Petrelis almost didn't participate; none of the other activists wanted to include him in their affinity groups for that demonstration because, he recalled, [...] "People felt I was too angry." [...] Petrelis said he nonetheless felt driven to go and changed his mind. Arriving early before the police had established barricades, Petrelis was able to enter the church, and sit on the aisle {{in the middle of the}} cathedral. As other protesters stage silent die-ins, or calmly read prepared statements, Petrelis stood on the pew and screamed, [...] "O'Connor, you're killing us! You're killing us, <b>just</b> <b>stop</b> it! <b>Just</b> <b>stop</b> it!" [...] Before officers removed him from the cathedral, Petrelis screamed, [...] "We will not be silent.

[...] The Israel Defense Forces {{did not respond to}} the accusation, but Foreign Policy magazine noted that while [...] "dolphins have been used by various militaries, including by both the United States and Russia, this report likely falls into what is a surprisingly fertile genre of conspiracy theories: the notion that Israeli intelligence routinely uses all manner of birds and other animals as tools of espionage." ...|$|E

[...] Teammate and fellow linebacker, James Farrior, later told NFL Network that Harrison was so green early on in his career that he would simply [...] "give up" [...] on plays on which he was struggling and even would ask the coaches not to play him when he was struggling. Farrior said, [...] "He was a knucklehead that didn't know the plays.

2500|$|In August 2008, Steven Pifer, former Ambassador to Ukraine, {{said that}} Russian rhetoric and media {{narrative}} suggested they were preparing a large-scale operation.

[...] "It's almost approaching the point where there is just no relationship to reality. But again, certainly the rhetoric is appropriate to a larger operation against Georgia to <b>just</b> <b>stop</b> and reverse whatever military gains the Georgians made in South Ossetia on [...]" [...] Pifer said that Russia laid a well-prepared trap and the Georgians took the bait. [...] "The Georgian leadership made a mistake on [...] They should have understood from what they have seen from the Russians that the Russians were looking for a pretext. They [...] gave them that pretext when they decided to go in a fairly large way into South Ossetia," [...] he said.

Regarding windfarms, he {{says that in the}} future, they will be described as [...] "a reminder of the time when mankind temporarily took leave of its senses and decided wind, waves and lashings of tofu could somehow generate enough electricity for the whole planet". Clarkson has voiced some views regarding global warming: he believes that higher temperatures are not necessarily negative and that anthropogenic carbon dioxide production has a negligible effect on the global climate, but is aware of the negative potential consequences of global warming, saying [...] "let's <b>just</b> <b>stop</b> and think for a moment what the consequences might be.

2500|$|After its release, it was aired by MTV a {{total of}} three times, all of these after the 10pm watershed, due to its highly charged sexual content, before being {{permanently}} banned; this made it Madonna's second video to be banned from airing by the channel, after [...] "Justify My Love" [...] in 1990. MTV spokeswoman Linda Alexander said, [...] "The themes of the video are clearly aimed at a more adult audience. It is not appropriate for a general viewing audience". Madonna herself said she understood the channel's ban on the video; [...] "MTV plays to a huge audience {{and a lot of them}} are children, and a lot of themes I'm exploring in my videos aren't meant for children, so I understand that they say I can't show it [...] I accept it". Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis said that [...] "This is pretty much normal Madonna fare, [...] But how much longer can you continue mining sexuality?
