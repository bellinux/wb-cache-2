5|$|Unlike Terra and Ventus, Aqua is {{the only}} protagonist who did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of {{reference}} for Tetsuya Nomura to design from, and thus was designed from scratch. Later in the design process, Nomura became concerned that Aqua would not be popular, and this drove his decision to make her very distinct in her personal bravery and combat abilities. While her outfit design was based on Terra's, her movements were chosen to distinguish her from other characters by having her specialize in magical combat. Aqua is voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi in Japanese and Willa Holland in English.|$|E

25|$|The knife must be {{minimally}} {{slightly longer}} than the neck but preferably at least 2 times {{as long as the}} animal's neck is wide, but not so long that the weight of the knife is deemed excessive. If the knife is too large, it is assumed to cause Derasah, excessive pressing. Kosher knife makers sell knives of differing sizes depending on the animal. Shorter blades may technically be used depending on the number of strokes employed to slaughter the animal but the normative practice today is that shorter blades are not used. The knife must not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>point.</b> It is feared a point may slip into the wound during slaughter and cause Haladah, covering, of the blade. The blade may also not be serrated, as serrations cause Iqqur, tearing.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and {{was intended as a}} morality tale. Spotnitz made sure that the episode had an explicit purpose and reason, and he noted, [...] "If you're going to depart from literal reality as most of us know—if you're going to go into supernatural—as a writer {{you have to ask yourself}} 'Why? ...

Caine describes Cutter as [...] "a teacher, a father and a guide to Angier". Caine, in trying to create Cutter's nuanced portrait, altered his voice and posture. Nolan later said that [...] "Michael Caine’s character really becomes something of the heart of the film.

500|$|The show {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Jon Pareles from The New York Times compared the concert with aerobics {{and said that}} the concert was more of a workout than being erotic. Isabel Albiston from The Daily Telegraph compared the tour with the 2006 Confessions Tour and said that [...] "two years later, Madonna's biceps are no smaller and, with the news that 100 pairs of fishnet pantyhose have been procured from eBay for the artist, her costumes no less raunchy. [...] Madonna seemed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to prove." [...] Another review by Helen Brown from the same publication said that [...] "Sticky Sweet's highlights include a fresh, crunchy and gipsied-up 'La Isla Bonita' (complete with fiddles, flamenco and a spliced-in Romani folk tune) and a raved-up 'Like a Prayer'." [...] Sarah Liss from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation commented that [...] "something about witnessing the 50-year-old crow's feet and wrinkles on Madonna's face, projected a hundred times larger than life, as she works her ass off (to paraphrase part of her stage banter) for a crowd of almost 20,000 feels more awe-inspiring than any of her old-school shock tactics." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{property}} of tangency {{is defined as}} follows. First, a point, line or circle {{is assumed to be}} tangent to itself; hence, if a given circle is already tangent to the other two given objects, it is counted as a solution to Apollonius' problem. Two distinct geometrical objects are said to intersect if they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> in common. By definition, a point is tangent to a circle or a line if it intersects them, that is, if it lies on them; thus, two distinct points cannot be tangent. If the angle between lines or circles at an intersection point is zero, they are said to be tangent; the intersection point is called a tangent point or a point of tangency. (The word [...] "tangent" [...] derives from the Latin present participle, tangens, meaning [...] "touching".) In practice, two distinct circles are tangent if they intersect at only one point; if they intersect at zero or two points, they are not tangent. The same holds true for a line and a circle. Two distinct lines cannot be tangent in the plane, although two parallel lines can be considered as tangent at a point at infinity in inversive geometry (see below).|$|E
500|$|Unlike the Silver Age Kathy Kane, who was romantically {{attracted}} to Batman, {{the new version}} of Kane is a lesbian.

Stories appeared on television news outlets such as CNN, general news magazines such as USA Today, and gay culture magazines such as Out. The modern Katherine [...] "Kate" [...] Kane made her first comic book appearance in issue #7 of the maxi-series 52 (2006), where Kane is revealed to have been romantically involved with Renee Montoya, a former Gotham City Police detective (who later takes up the mantle of the Question after the original hero dies). When questioned about the editorial decision to make Batwoman a gay character in an interview with Wizard Entertainment, DC Comics Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Dan DiDio stated [...] "It was from conversations we’ve had for expanding the DC Universe, for looking at levels of diversity. We wanted to have a cast that is much more reflective of today’s society and even today’s fanbase. One of the reasons we made her gay is that, again when you have the Batman Family—a series of characters that aren’t super-powered and inhabit the same circle and the same city—you really want to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of difference. It was really important to me to make sure every character felt unique." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{an example}} of the {{physical}} meaning of RG in particle physics, [...] consider an overview of charge renormalization in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Suppose we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> positive charge of a certain true (or bare) magnitude. The electromagnetic field around it has a certain energy, and thus may produce some pairs of (e.g.) electrons-positrons, which will be annihilated very quickly. But, in their short life, the electron will be attracted by the charge, and the positron will be repelled. Since this happens continuously, these pairs are effectively screening the charge from abroad. Thus, the measured strength of the charge will depend on how close to our probes it may enter. Hence a dependence of a certain coupling constant (here, the electric charge) with distance scale.|$|E
