50|$|The European {{integration}} process has extended {{the right of}} foreigners to vote. Thus, European Union citizens were given voting rights in local elections by the 1992 Maastricht Treaty. Several member states (Belgium, Luxembourg, Lithuania, and Slovenia) have extended since then {{the right to vote}} to all foreign residents. This was already the case in Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden. Further, voting and eligibility rights are granted among citizens of the Nordic Passport Union, and between numerous countries through bilateral treaties (i.e. between Norway and Spain, or between Portugal and Brazil, Cape Verde, Iceland, Norway, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile and Argentina), or without them (<b>i.e.</b> <b>Ireland</b> and the United Kingdom). Finally, within the EEA, Iceland and Norway also grant the right to vote to all foreign residents.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in week 10, the STWRM team {{began playing}} Are You Smarter Than Mark. In this game, co-host Mark Degenkolb and a call-in {{contestant}} are asked 5 questions each about current events, popular culture, or a special topic (<b>i.e.</b> <b>Ireland</b> trivia, cooking trivia, etc.). If {{the question is}} answered correctly, the contestant gets 2 points added to their total score. If the question is answered incorrectly, the opponent {{gets a chance to}} steal the question with a correct answer for 1 point. If after 10 rounds the score is tied, a tiebreaker question is employed. The tiebreaker is usually a number and the contestant who gets closest wins. If the call-in contestant has more points than Mark {{at the end of the}} game, they are the winner and smarter than Mark. If the call-in contestant has less points than Mark at the end of the game, they are the loser and not as smart as Mark and must listen to Tyra Banks' rant from Season 5 of America's Next Top Model.|$|E

30|$|These {{academic}} BIM education publications were {{authored by}} researchers from 24 countries (the USA, Brazil, Mexico, the UK, Ireland, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Latvia, Turkey, Egypt, the UAE, Israel, Nigeria, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Australia). The global distribution of these 70 publications {{is shown in}} Fig.  2. Researchers in USA, Australia, and Brazil have published more BIM education-related publications than {{other countries in the}} period evaluated (30, 8, and 7 publications, respectively). Their intensive discussion and development of academic BIM education provided rich experiences and knowledge from which educationalists and researchers in other regions and countries could learn. As for Europe, there were only 2 publications authored by UK academics, despite the strong need for academic BIM education in the UK due to the 2016 BIM mandate plan released by the government, and despite the existence of a national organization promoting academic BIM education there (i.e., the BIM Academic Forum by UK BIM Task Group) (Underwood & Ayoade 2015). UK BIM education researchers could share more of their experiences with and knowledge about academic BIM education in the future. Beside the UK, there were only 8 publications concerning academic BIM education authored by researchers in 8 European countries (<b>i.e.,</b> <b>Ireland,</b> Finland, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, and Latvia). Language barriers need to be overcome for educationalists and researchers in this region to share more of their efforts to the global tertiary BIM education community. Compared with the European region, researchers from 7 Asian countries have published 9 publications in which they share their experiences with academic BIM education. This shows that Asian countries are not only keen to promote BIM at the moment (Cheng & Lu 2015), but also that researchers in this area are keen to promote academic BIM education and exchange their experiences.|$|E
