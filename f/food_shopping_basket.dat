Price cuts on healthy foods increase their consumption in school cafeterias, and soda taxes appear to reduce soda consumption by the public. People often {{are willing to}} use incentives to change their behavior through the means of a commitment device.

40|$|Fruit and {{vegetable}} consumption determinants among individuals living in two areas of rural south west England were identified using a retail survey, qualitative study and an individual survey. Fruit {{and vegetable}} items were assessed using a <b>shopping</b> <b>basket</b> methodology; results showed supermarkets were the cheapest and convenience stores {{the most expensive}} store-types with quality, range and availability best in supermarkets. Focus groups were used to elicit beliefs underlying intention to consume Government recommended quantities of fruit and vegetables each day and understand rural individuals' <b>food</b> <b>shopping</b> patterns. Based on these results a postal questionnaire was administered among 1000 rural individuals (response 40. 6 %) collecting information on TPB variables towards intention to consume five portions of fruit and vegetable each day, actual fruit and vegetable consumption behaviour, <b>food</b> <b>shopping</b> behaviour patterns and demographics. All TPB variables {{were found to be}} good predictors of intention with self-efficacy and attitude the strongest predictors: some support was found for the inclusion of self-identity and descriptive norm in healthy eating TPB models. Individual survey data were analysed using descriptive and regression techniques exploring relationships between socio-economic/demographic factors, <b>food</b> <b>shopping</b> patterns, underlying beliefs and fruit and vegetable consumption. Gender, socio-economic status, age, healthy eating knowledge and growing fruit and vegetables predicted fruit and vegetable consumption; groups at risk of under-consuming were men, low/middle socio-economic status, low healthy eating knowledge and younger. No <b>food</b> <b>shopping</b> behaviour patterns predicted fruit and vegetable consumption behaviour and the level of retail provision had no significant effect on consumption. It is suggested that rural 'food deserts' may not exist spatially; they are limited to individuals dependent on less than ideal local retail provision. Beliefs predicting increased fruit and vegetable consumption were: 'fruit and vegetables are inexpensive', 'have good storage capacity' and 'enough time to shop', 'five portions reduces heart disease risk' and 'is enjoyable'.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to obtain {{quantitative}} data on the metabolic flows (energy consumption, {{not only by the}} establishment but also in the transportation of workers and customers, and packaging use) and their resulting environmental impacts of a standard <b>shopping</b> <b>basket</b> purchase in five city center municipal markets and a hypermarket in a suburban retail park in the province of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). The main results show that a standard <b>shopping</b> <b>basket</b> purchased in a retail park requires 20 times more energy than one purchased in a municipal market (11. 1 kWh and 0. 57 kWh, respectively). Customer transportation represents 83. 2 % of energy consumption in a retail park, while the greatest impacts in a municipal market stem from the establishment itself (49. 5 %) and worker transportation (40. 4 %). Secondly, the packaging use inventory is higher in a hypermarket (253 g) than in a municipal market (102 g). However, the overall environmental impact associated with a standard <b>shopping</b> <b>basket</b> is 10 times higher on average in a hypermarket than in a municipal market, and the carbon footprints of the hypermarket and the municipal market are 3. 8 and 0. 4 kg of CO₂ eq., respectively. According to the sensitivity analysis, current policies for reducing the amount of plastic bag packaging have little repercussion in a retail park because its relative weight in terms of total packaging use is only 7 %. Nevertheless, they have notable effects in municipal markets where plastic bags represent 25 % of the packaging use. Finally, if customers selected the least packaged products available in hypermarkets, each <b>shopping</b> <b>basket</b> could reduce up to 47. 2 % of its used packaging weight and between 15. 4 and 59. 0 % of its associated environmental impact...|$|R

40|$|Older {{people are}} an {{increasing}} {{section of the}} UK population as part {{of what has been}} described as a global ageing phenomenon. It is projected that by the year 2021, 12. 3 million people in the UK will be over pensionable age. It is suggested that the decentralisation of many food retailers to edge-of-town and out-of-town locations has resulted in some older people experiencing difficulty in accessing <b>food</b> <b>shops.</b> Older people who experience the greatest difficulties in <b>food</b> <b>shopping</b> are considered to be at the greatest nutritional risk. Varied diets are generally considered to be associated with increased nutrient intake and healthier diets. The present study examined how older people residing in Guildford accessed <b>food</b> <b>shops.</b> The study considered the extent to which the availability of <b>food</b> <b>shops,</b> the stores older people use and their attitudes with regard to diet and health may influence their dietary variety. Shopping behaviour and dietary variety were investigated using focus groups, a face-to-face questionnaire and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). A dietary variety score system, developed from the FFQ, is employed in this study. Attitudes with regard to healthy eating were measured using questions based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Neither access to <b>food</b> <b>shops</b> nor store choice was found to have an influence on dietary variety. Store choice was primarily influenced by respondents' ability to reach food stores, namely in terms of the method of transport available and their perceived ease of access to the store Respondents reported shopping more frequently or relying on friends or relatives, in order to maintain their independence and reach <b>food</b> <b>shops.</b> Attitudes to diet and health were found to influence dietary variety. Findings suggest that older people in Guildford employ coping strategies as a means of reaching <b>food</b> <b>shops,</b> obtaining <b>food</b> and maintaining independence and social inclusion...|$|R
40|$|Background: Fruit and {{vegetables}} are protective {{of a number of}} chronic diseases; however, their intakes have been shown to vary by socioeconomic position (SEP). Household and <b>food</b> <b>shopping</b> environmental factors are thought to contribute to these differences. To determine whether household and <b>food</b> <b>shopping</b> environmental factors are associated with fruit and vegetable (FV) intakes, and contribute to socioeconomic inequalities in FV consumption. [...] - Methods: Cross-sectional data were obtained by a postal questionnaire among 4333 adults (23 – 85 years) living in 168 neighbourhoods in the south-eastern Netherlands. Participants agreed/disagreed with a number of statements about the characteristics of their household and <b>food</b> <b>shopping</b> environments, including access, prices and quality. Education was used to characterise socioeconomic position (SEP). Main outcome measures were whether or not participants consumed fruit or vegetables on a daily basis. Multilevel logistic regression models examined between-area variance in FV consumption and associations between characteristics of the household and <b>food</b> <b>shopping</b> environments and FV consumption. [...] - Results: Only a few household and <b>food</b> <b>shopping</b> environmental factors were significantly associated with fruit and vegetable consumption, and their prevalence was low. Participants who perceived FV to be expensive were more likely to consume them. There were significant socioeconomic inequalities in fruit and vegetable consumption (ORs of not consuming fruit {{and vegetables}} were 4. 26 and 5. 47 among the lowest-educated groups for fruit and vegetables, respectively); however, these were not explained by any household or <b>food</b> <b>shopping</b> environmental factors. [...] - Conclusions: Improving access to FV in the household and <b>food</b> <b>shopping</b> environments will only make a small contribution to improving population consumption levels, and may only have a limited effect in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in their consumption. ...|$|R
