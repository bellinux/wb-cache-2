5|$|This {{class of}} {{objections}} is more radical than the above, claiming {{that a major}} aspect of evolution <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> unscientific or implausible, but rather impossible, because it contradicts some other law of nature or is constrained {{in such a way}} that it cannot produce the biological diversity of the world.|$|E
5|$|Prey {{mobility}} {{could also}} explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics {{that make them}} more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have more reason to develop aposematism. After the switch, the frogs had greater ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> a signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase their reproductive success.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the actors}} were {{specialised}} comedians, notably Joseph Haines who played the false-wit character Sparkish, Alithea's original fiancé. At the outset of his high-profile career as comedian and song-and-dance man, young Haines already {{had a reputation for}} eccentricity and dominant stage presence, suggesting that Sparkish <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> a comic butt for the truewits Horner, Harcourt, and Dorilant to mock, but also a real threat to the romance of Harcourt and Alithea.|$|E
50|$|According to Ryle, mental {{processes}} are merely intelligent acts. There are no mental {{processes that are}} distinct from intelligent acts. The operations of the mind <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> represented by intelligent acts, {{they are the same}} as those intelligent acts. Thus, acts of learning, remembering, imagining, knowing, or willing <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> clues to hidden mental processes or to complex sequences of intellectual operations, they are the way in which those mental processes or intellectual operations are defined. Logical propositions <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> clues to modes of reasoning, they are those modes of reasoning.|$|R

5|$|The Toronto Argonauts {{currently}} {{lead the}} Canadian Football League in total wins and in winning percentage in the Grey Cup. Early {{success in the}} final can partly {{be attributed to the}} weakness of western teams: between 1921 and 1952 the Argonauts won in nine straight appearances, including six straight against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The team's success <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> an historical aberration, however: they have won six of their nine appearances since the formation of the CFL, including their last five straight.|$|E
5|$|Even {{people with}} {{complete}} SCI, in whom {{the spinal cord}} cannot transmit any messages past {{the level of the}} lesion, can achieve orgasm. In 1960, in one of the earliest studies to look at orgasm and SCI, the term phantom orgasm was coined to describe women's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI—but subsequent studies have suggested the experience <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> psychological. Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied by physical signs normally found at orgasm, such as increased blood pressure. Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the cervix regardless of level or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience.|$|E
5|$|The Leges Henrici Primi or Laws of Henry I <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> a {{compilation}} of laws but an integrated legal treatise, the first such {{in the history of}} England, written in the Latin language about 1115. It records the legal customs of medieval England. It was part {{of a small group of}} similar writings devoted to legal procedures that were written for royal administrators. Besides the Leges, other works of this type produced at this time were the Quadripartitus, parts of the Leges Edwardi Regis, the Instituta Cnuti, and the Consiliatio Cnuti. It is possible the Leges Willhelmi was also written during this time period. It is the longest of the legal tracts from its time, and made some effort to be comprehensive.|$|E

If a department of an educational institution, it {{may be related to}} a teaching program. In any case, it exists for scientific ends and is not to be restricted or diverted by other demands. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> a landscaped or ornamental garden, although it may be artistic, nor is it an experiment station or yet a park with labels on the plants. The essential element is the intention of the enterprise, which is the acquisition and dissemination of botanical knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Æthelric was a monk at Christ Church Priory at Canterbury {{prior to}} his {{becoming}} a bishop. Several historians opine {{that he might have}} been the same as the Æthelric who was a monk of Canterbury and a relative of Godwin, Earl of Wessex. That Æthelric was elected by the monks of Canterbury to be Archbishop of Canterbury in 1050, but was not confirmed by King Edward the Confessor who insisted on Robert of Jumièges becoming archbishop instead. The evidence <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> that they shared the same name, because the name was a relatively common one in Anglo-Saxon England. Other evidence pointing to the possibility of them being the same person includes {{the fact that he was}} felt to have been unfairly deposed in 1070 as well as the bishop's great age in 1076.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} about the {{treatment}} of alcoholism, the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the BAC limit was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between {{the second and third}} offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a per se rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that <b>is,</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> a presumption). Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC limit for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC limit was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|E

5|$|Roman Catholic priest Servais Pinckaers {{regarded}} Christian ethics as {{closer to}} the virtue ethics of Aristotle than Kant's ethics. He presented virtue ethics as freedom for excellence, which regards freedom as acting in accordance with nature to develop one's virtues. Initially, this requires following rules—but the intention is that the agent develop virtuously, and regard acting morally as a joy. This is in contrast with freedom of indifference, which Pinckaers attributes to William Ockham and likens to Kant. On this view, freedom is set against nature: free actions are those not determined by passions or emotions. There is no development or progress in an agent's virtue, merely the forming of habit. This is closer to Kant's view of ethics, because Kant's conception of autonomy requires that an agent <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> guided by their emotions, and is set in contrast with Pinckaer's conception of Christian ethics.|$|E
