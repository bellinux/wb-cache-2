50|$|The LM13700 is an {{integrated}} circuit {{consisting of two}} current controlled operational transconductance amplifiers (OTA), each having <b>differential</b> <b>inputs</b> and a push-pull output. The LM13700 is like a standard op-amp: each has a pair of <b>differential</b> <b>inputs</b> and a single output, but an OTA is voltage in and current out rather than voltage in and voltage out; and OTAs are programmable via the IABC pin. Linearizing diodes at the input reduce distortion and allow increased input levels. The darlington output buffers provided are specifically designed to complement the wide dynamic range of the OTA. This chip is very useful in audio electronics especially in analog synthesizer circuits like voltage controlled oscillators, voltage controlled filters, and voltage controlled amplifiers. The darlington output buffers on the LM13700 {{are different from those}} on the LM13600 in that their bias currents (and hence their output DC levels) are independent of IABC pin. This usually results in performance superior to that of the LM13600 in audio applications.|$|E
50|$|In {{instrumentation}} systems, {{the use of}} <b>differential</b> <b>inputs</b> {{with high}} common mode rejection ratio, to minimise the effects of induced AC signals on the parameter to be measured, is widespread.

50|$|An ideal op-amp amplifies the {{differential}} input; if this input is 0 volts (i.e. both inputs {{are at the}} same voltage with respect to ground), the output should be zero. However, due to manufacturing process, the <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> transistors of real op-amps may not be exactly matched. This causes the output to be zero at a non-zero value of <b>differential</b> <b>input,</b> called the input offset voltage.|$|R
50|$|The {{operational}} transconductance amplifier (OTA) is an amplifier whose <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> voltage {{produces an}} output current. Thus, it is a voltage controlled current source (VCCS). There is usually an additional input for a current {{to control the}} amplifier's transconductance.

40|$|An {{improved}} subranging or {{comparator circuit}} is provided for an analog-to-digital converter. As a subranging circuit, the circuit produces a residual signal representing {{the difference between}} an analog input signal and an analog of a digital representation. This is achieved by subdividing the digital representation into two or more parts and subtracting from the analog input signal analogs of each of the individual digital portions. In another aspect of the present invention, the subranging circuit comprises two sets of <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> pairs in which the transconductance of one <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> pair is scaled relative to the transconductance of the other <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> pair.

50|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature for this series is presence of four fast, 12-bit, simultaneous sampling ADCs (multiplexer to over 30 channels), and interestingly, four matched, 8 MHz bandwidth op-amps with all pins exposed and additionally internal PGA (Programmable Gain Array) network. The exposed pads {{allow for a}} range of analogue signal conditioning circuits like band-pass filters, anti-alias filters, charge amplifiers, integrators/differentiators, 'instrumentation' high-gain <b>differential</b> <b>inputs,</b> and other. This eliminates need for external op-amps for many applications. The built-in two-channel DAC has arbitrary waveform as well as a hardware-generated waveform (sine, triangle, noise etc.) capability. All analogue devices can be completely independent, or partially internally connected, meaning that one can have nearly everything that is needed for an advanced measurement and sensor interfacing system in a single chip.|$|E
50|$|In many cases, {{the most}} {{expensive}} part of an integrated circuit is the pins, because they make the package larger, and each pin has {{to be connected to}} the integrated circuit's silicon. To save pins, it is common for slow ADCs to send their data one bit at a time over a serial interface to the computer, with the next bit coming out when a clock signal changes state, say from 0 to 5 V. This saves quite a few pins on the ADC package, and in many cases, does not make the overall design any more complex (even microprocessors which use memory-mapped I/O only need a few bits of a port to implement a serial bus to an ADC). Commercial ADCs often have several inputs that feed the same converter, usually through an analog multiplexer. Different models of ADC may include sample and hold circuits, instrumentation amplifiers or <b>differential</b> <b>inputs,</b> where the quantity measured is the difference between two voltages.|$|E
5000|$|William R. Hewlett's Wien bridge {{oscillator}} can {{be considered}} as a combination of a differential amplifier and a Wien bridge, connected in a positive feedback loop between the amplifier output and <b>differential</b> <b>inputs.</b> At the oscillating frequency, the bridge is almost balanced and has very small transfer ratio. The loop gain {{is a product of the}} very high amplifier gain and the very low bridge ratio. [...] In Hewlett's circuit, the amplifier is implemented by two vacuum tubes. The amplifier's inverting input is the cathode of tube V1 and the non-inverting input is the control grid of tube V2. To simplify analysis, all the components other than R1, R2, C1 and C2 can be modeled as a non-inverting amplifier with a gain of 1+Rf/Rb and with a high input impedance. R1, R2, C1 and C2 form a bandpass filter which is connected to provide positive feedback at the frequency of oscillation. Rb self heats and increases the negative feedback which reduces the amplifier gain until the point is reached that there is just enough gain to sustain sinusoidal oscillation without over driving the amplifier. If R1 = R2 and C1 = C2 then at equilibrium Rf/Rb = 2 and the amplifier gain is 3. When the circuit is first energized, the lamp is cold and the gain of the circuit is greater than 3 which ensures start up. The dc bias current of vacuum tube V1 also flows through the lamp. This does not change the principles of the circuit's operation, but it does reduce the amplitude of the output at equilibrium because the bias current provides part of the heating of the lamp.|$|E

50|$|Earlier {{versions}} of the OTA had neither the Ibias terminal (shown in the diagram) nor the diodes (shown adjacent to it). They were all added in later versions. As depicted in the diagram, the anodes of the diodes are attached together and the cathode of one {{is attached to the}} non inverting input (Vin+) and the cathode of the other to the inverting input (Vin&minus;). The diodes are biased at the anodes by a current (Ibias) that is injected into the Ibias terminal. These additions make two substantial improvements to the OTA. First, when used with input resistors, the diodes distort the <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> voltage to offset a significant amount of input stage non linearity at higher <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> voltages. According to National Semiconductor, the addition of these diodes increases the linearity of the input stage by a factor of 4. That is, using the diodes, the signal distortion level at 80 mV of <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> is {{the same as that of}} the simple differential amplifier at a <b>differential</b> <b>input</b> of 20 mV. Second, the action of the biased diodes offsets much of the temperature sensitivity of the OTA's transconductance.|$|R

40|$|Many high {{performance}} ADCs {{are now being}} designed with <b>differential</b> <b>inputs.</b> A fully differential ADC design offers the advantages of good common-mode rejection, reduction in second-order distortion products, and simplified dc trim algorithms. Although they can be driven single-ended, a fully differential driver usually optimizes overall performance. One {{of the most common}} ways to drive a differential input ADC is with a transformer. However, there are many applications where the ADCs cannot be driven with transformers because the frequency response must extend to dc. In these cases, differential drivers are required. This tutorial focuses on driving high resolution 16 - to 18 -bit ADCs with sampling rates up to 10 MSPS. The bandwidth of the input signals is generally limited to a few MHz.
