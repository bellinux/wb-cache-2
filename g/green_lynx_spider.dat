40|$|Guarding <b>green</b> <b>lynx</b> <b>spiders</b> reduce egg sac {{mortality}} {{from two}} major sources, ants and sac dislodgement, using specific behavior patterns. However, {{they do not}} discriminate against egg sac s parasitized by mantispids, which are a third important mortality source. When ants are placed on eg g sacs females attack, relocate the sac, or cut attachment lines so that the sac hangs from a minima l number of threads. Egg sacs are also relocated in response to other disturbances. The method of moving the egg sac relies heavily on silk lines and is distinct from that of lycosids and pisaurids...|$|R

Predators include the bug Geocoris punctipes, an assassin bug of genus Sinea, the shield bugs Perillus bioculatus and Stiretrus anchorago, the mirid bug Tupiocoris notatus, the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), and the <b>green</b> <b>lynx</b> <b>spider</b> (Peucetia viridans).|$|E
50|$|Oxyopes is a genus of <b>lynx</b> <b>spiders</b> found worldwide. It {{includes}} arounds 300 {{species and}} is classified under the <b>lynx</b> <b>spider</b> family Oxyopidae. Like other <b>lynx</b> <b>spiders,</b> they are easily recognizable by the six larger eyes arranged hexagonally {{on top of}} the head (prosoma), with the remaining smaller two eyes in front. They are also characterized by long spine-like bristles (setae) on their legs. They are ambush predators, actively hunting prey by sight. Though they produce and use silk, they do not build webs to capture prey.|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} biology of the <b>green</b> <b>lynx</b> <b>spider,</b> Peucetia viridans, in South Carolina, with {{emphasis}} on the selection factors that maintain extended maternal care. Nocturnal predation on the clutch was greater than diurnal predation. Chiracanthium inclusum (Araneae, Clubionidae) was the primary predator of eggs and emerged spiderlings. After producing a fertile egg sac in the field, female P viridans produced at least three fertile sacs in the laboratory. In the field, females produced a second egg sac if their first sac was lost early in the season. In contrast with other studies, spiderlings were unable to exit from about 74 % of the egg sacs {{without the aid of}} the mother...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSpiderines are {{comparatively}} long polypeptide toxins (∼ 110 residues) from <b>lynx</b> <b>spiders</b> (genus Oxyopes). They {{are built}} of an N-terminal linear cationic domain (∼ 40 residues) and a C-terminal knottin domain (∼ 60 residues). The linear domain empowers spiderines with strong cytolytic activity. In the present work we report 16 novel spiderine sequences from Oxyopes takobius and Oxyopes lineatus classified into two subfamilies. Strikingly, negative selection acts on both linear and knottin domains. Genes encoding Oxyopes two-domain toxins were sequenced {{and found to}} be intronless. We further discuss a possible scenario of <b>lynx</b> <b>spider</b> modular toxin evolution...|$|R
50|$|Oxyopes macilentus, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the lean <b>lynx</b> <b>spider,</b> is a species of <b>lynx</b> <b>spiders</b> from East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and northern Australia. They are active predators, hunting invertebrates (including other spiders) among vegetation. They are especially common in grassy areas and rice fields. Their bodies are characteristically long and thin, about four times {{as long as it}} is wide. Their body color ranges from pale white to yellow, orange, or green; with a pattern of black, orange, and white longitudinal lines. Females have a maximum body length of 10 mm, while males grow to 9 mm.|$|R

50|$|Oxyopes salticus is {{a species}} of <b>lynx</b> <b>spider,</b> {{commonly}} known as the Striped Lynx Spider, first described by Hentz in 1845. Its habitat tends to be grasses and leafy vegetation; grassy, weedy fields, and row crops.|$|R
50|$|Adult {{individuals}} are good jumpers and can defend against predators like mantises (Mantodea) or <b>lynx</b> <b>spiders</b> with the spines on the hindlegs. Moreover, Valanga irregularis is well camouflaged {{as the body}} colour resembles the plant stem and leaf they are hiding behind.|$|R
50|$|Some {{members of}} the genus Oxyopes are {{abundant}} enough {{to be important in}} agricultural systems as biological control agents. This is especially true of the striped <b>lynx</b> <b>spider</b> (Oxyopes salticus). Their net value in agriculture has been disputed however, on the grounds of their predation of pollinators.|$|R
50|$|Oxyopes takobius is {{a species}} of venomous spiders {{belonging}} to the genus Oxyopes of the <b>lynx</b> <b>spider</b> family, Oxyopidae. The species was first described in 1969, and is found from Central Asia to China. Its venom contains a peptide toxin called oxyopinin (oxyopinin 4a), which was discovered in 2002.|$|R
50|$|Oxyopes lineatus is {{a species}} of spider in the family Oxyopidae, the {{so-called}} <b>lynx</b> <b>spiders.</b> Two sub-species are recognised, namely O. lineatus lineatus (Latreille, 1806) and O. lineatus occidentalis (Kulczynski, 1907). They are ambush hunting spiders and do not trap their prey in webs, but subdue their victims with their venomous fangs (chelicerae). They are harmless to humans and larger animals and are not aggressive.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lynx</b> <b>spider</b> is {{the common}} name for {{any member of the}} family Oxyopidae. Most species make little use of webs, instead {{spending}} their lives as hunting spiders on plants. Many species frequent flowers in particular, ambushing pollinators, much as crab spiders do. They tend to tolerate members of their own species more than most spiders do, and at least one species has been identified as exhibiting social behaviour.|$|R
25|$|The monophyly of {{the family}} Salticidae is well {{established}} through both phylogenetic and morphological analyses, but no consensus exists on what other group of spiders are most {{closely related to the}} jumping spiders. Suggested sister groups have included the oxyopids (<b>lynx</b> <b>spiders),</b> thomisids (crab spiders), clubionoids (sac spiders), and web-building spiders. A 2016 phylogenetic analysis suggests that the sister group may be a clade consisting of the families Eutichuridae and Philodromidae, although this relationship is only weakly supported.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lynx</b> <b>spiders,</b> {{in spite}} of being largely ambush hunters, are very speedy runners and leapers, alert and with good vision. Except when {{defending}} egg purses, many tend to flee rapidly when approached by predators or large creatures such as humans. They tend not to be very aggressive towards other {{members of their own}} species, and sometimes meet casually in small groups. Possibly as an extreme example, at least one member of the genus Tapinillus is remarkable as being one of the few social spiders, living in colonies with communal feeding, cooperative brood care, and generational overlap.|$|R
5000|$|Oxyopes heterophthalmus {{is a long}} legged, diurnal hunting spider {{which is}} capable of running very fast and jumping on their prey {{in a similar fashion}} to a cat, leading to their common name of <b>lynx</b> <b>spider.</b> They do not utilise webs to catch prey. Their {{eyesight}} is not as good as that of the jumping spiders but they can see their prey from a distance of up to 10 cm. [...] In Great Britain adults occur in late May and June. The female spins a cocoon which is attached to a plant, she guards this until the eggs hatch..|$|R
50|$|Montgomery's {{earliest}} papers concerned ribbon worms (phylum Nemertea), a {{group on}} which he would write 10 papers. He also published 10 papers on horsehair worms (phylum Nematomorpha) and two on rotifers. Montgomery wrote 14 scientific articles on spiders, and {{he was known to}} keep large amounts in his laboratory and home from which he recorded observations of courtship, mating, and other behaviors. He wrote on the taxonomy of wolf <b>spiders</b> (family Lycosidae), <b>lynx</b> <b>spiders</b> (Oxyopidae), and nursery web spiders (Pisauridae). In a 1909 paper detailing the anatomy and development of various organs in spiders he rejected a prevalent idea at the time that arachnids evolved from Merostomata (a group including horseshoe crabs and extinct sea scorpions) adapting to a terrestrial life, and proposed instead that the aquatic lifestyle of horseshoe crabs evolved from terrestrial ancestors.|$|R

50|$|Oxotoxins, or oxytoxins, are a {{group of}} {{neurotoxins}} present in the venom of <b>lynx</b> <b>spiders</b> belonging to the genus Oxyopes, hence the name oxytoxin. They are disulfide-rich peptides. Only two types are so far reported from two different species, the larger oxytoxin 1 (OxyTx1) from Oxyopes kitabensis, and the smaller oxytoxin 2 (OxyTx2) from Oxyopes lineatus. OxyTx1, the first known oxytoxin, was discovered in 2002. It was found to enhance the lethal efficacy of the spider venom by acting together with oxyopinins. It is composed of 69 amino acid residue, which are cross-linked by five disulfide bridges. It is a large peptide having a molecular mass of 8059.2 Da; but shows the size of 9,109.4 Da due {{to the presence of}} disulfide bridges. It is a potent insecticide, but non-toxic to mice up to 1 μg/20-g mouse. It acts synergistically with oxyopinins of the same venom to increase the insecticidal effect.|$|R
50|$|They {{belong to}} the RTA clade of spiders, spiders that all have a Retrolateral Tibial Apophysis on the male pedipalp. A recent phylogenetic {{analysis}} places Psechridae as close relatives of the <b>Lynx</b> <b>spiders</b> (Oxyopidae), as well as wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and nursery web spiders (Pisauridae) (Agnarsson et al. 2013). With body lengths of up to 2 cm and funnel webs more than 1 m in diameter, {{they are among the}} biggest cribellate spiders. Psechrids construct cribellate webs and Fecenia construct webs that are similar to orb webs of Orbiculariae spiders, a remarkable example of evolutionary convergence (Blackledge et al. 2012, Agnarsson et al. 2013). Psechridae spiders are only found in SE Asia, where they occur in forests from lowland to altitudes exceeding 2000 m. Female Psechrus carry their egg-sac in the chelicerae, similar to their relatives, the ecribellate Pisauridae. They feature several characteristics normally found in ecribellate spiders, for example brood care behavior, and a colulus with no apparent function (Fang et al. 2000).|$|R
