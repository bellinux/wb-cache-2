5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people {{do not respond to}} the SSRI, even though this is not an officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly <b>fluoxetine</b> or sertraline) may result in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, each neuron in {{the brain}} {{releases}} the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle. Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, <b>fluoxetine,</b> chlorpromazine, and many others.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including <b>fluoxetine</b> (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic fluorides, or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic fluorides have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and <b>fluoxetine</b> also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, <b>fluoxetine,</b> erythromycin, diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including <b>fluoxetine</b> (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) <b>fluoxetine,</b> fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, <b>fluoxetine,</b> diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluoxetine</b> {{increases}} {{the concentration of}} circulating allopregnanolone, a potent GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator, in the brain. Norfluoxetine, a primary active metabolite of <b>fluoxetine,</b> produces a similar effect on allopregnanolone levels in the brains of mice. Additionally, both <b>fluoxetine</b> and norfluoxetine are such modulators themselves, actions which may be clinically-relevant.|$|E
25|$|The {{bioavailability}} of <b>fluoxetine</b> {{is relatively}} high (72%), and peak plasma concentrations are reached in 6–8hours. It is highly bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin and α1-glycoprotein. <b>Fluoxetine</b> is metabolized {{in the liver}} by isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP2D6. The role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of <b>fluoxetine</b> may be clinically important, as there is great genetic variability in the function of this enzyme among people. CYP2D6 is responsible for converting <b>fluoxetine</b> to its only active metabolite, norfluoxetine. Both drugs are also potent inhibitors of CYP2D6.|$|E
25|$|In {{children}} and adolescents, <b>fluoxetine</b> is the antidepressant of choice due to tentative evidence favoring its efficacy and tolerability. In pregnancy, <b>fluoxetine</b> {{is considered a}} category C drug. Evidence supporting {{an increased risk of}} major fetal malformations resulting from <b>fluoxetine</b> exposure is limited, although the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the UK has warned prescribers and patients of the potential for <b>fluoxetine</b> exposure in the first trimester (during organogenesis, formation of the fetal organs) to cause a slight increase in the risk of congenital cardiac malformations in the newborn. Furthermore, an association between <b>fluoxetine</b> use during the first trimester and an increased risk of minor fetal malformations was observed in one study.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to <b>fluoxetine</b> {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to increase serotonergic activity in fish, subsequently reducing aggressive behavior. Perinatal exposure to <b>fluoxetine</b> at relevant environmental concentrations {{has been shown to}} lead to significant modifications of memory processing in 1-month-old cuttlefish. This impairment may disadvantage cuttlefish and decrease their survival. Somewhat less than 10% of orally administered <b>fluoxetine</b> is excreted from humans unchanged or as glucuronide.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, over 24.4 million {{prescriptions}} for generic <b>fluoxetine</b> were {{filled in the}} United States, making it the third-most prescribed antidepressant after sertraline and citalopram. In 2011, 6 million {{prescriptions for}} <b>fluoxetine</b> were filled in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} {{potential}} for interaction with highly protein-bound drugs due to the potential for <b>fluoxetine</b> to displace said drugs from the plasma or vice versa hence increasing serum concentrations of either <b>fluoxetine</b> or the offending agent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluoxetine</b> is a {{racemic mixture}} of (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine where both enantiomers {{contribute}} to its biological activity. Since mono-substitution in the 4-para {{position of the}} phenoxy group (figure 4) results in selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake, a disubstitution i.e. 2,3- or 2,4- substitution therefore results {{in a loss of}} SERT selectivity. <b>Fluoxetine</b> has the widest spectrum of activity since it is the least SERT selective of all the SSRIs. <b>Fluoxetine</b> also has a 5-HT2C antagonist activity where it blocks the 5-HT activity of 5-HT2C receptors enhancing the release of both NE and DA. A 5-HT2C antagonist do not only help out with therapeutic effects of <b>fluoxetine</b> but also the tolerability of the drug. The advantage of being 5-HT2C antagonist is that it has a stimulatory effect and many patients have experienced an increase in energy, concentration and focus and a decrease in fatigue from the very first dose. The stimulant activity of 5-HT2C antagonist can however, be a disadvantage for patients with agitation, insomnia and anxiety. Another feature of <b>fluoxetine</b> is a weak NE re-uptake inhibition which can have clinical effect in higher doses. <b>Fluoxetine</b> also has a long half-life which can reduce withdrawal symptoms which are characteristic for some SSRIs after abrupt discontinuation, but it also means that {{it takes a long time}} to clear the drug and its active metabolite after discontinuing <b>fluoxetine</b> treatment.|$|E
25|$|There is less data on <b>fluoxetine</b> than on {{antidepressants}} as a whole. For {{the above}} {{analysis on the}} antidepressant level, the FDA had to combine the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications to obtain statistically significant results. Considered separately, <b>fluoxetine</b> use in children increased the odds of suicidality by 50%, and in adults decreased the odds of suicidality by approximately 30%. Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK MHRA found a 50% increase of odds of suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the children and adolescents on <b>fluoxetine</b> {{as compared to the}} ones on placebo. According to the MHRA data, for adults <b>fluoxetine</b> did not change the rate of self-harm and statistically significantly decreased suicidal ideation by 50%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluoxetine</b> is used {{to treat}} {{premenstrual}} dysphoric disorder.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{pathological}} gambling, along with fluvoxamine, clomipramine has been shown effective in the treatment, with reducing the problems of pathological gambling in a subject by up to 90%. Whereas in trichotillomania, the use of clomipramine has again {{been found to be}} effective, <b>fluoxetine</b> has not produced consistent positive results. <b>Fluoxetine,</b> however, has produced positive results in the treatment of pathological skin picking disorder, although {{more research is needed to}} conclude this information. <b>Fluoxetine</b> has also been evaluated in treating IED and demonstrated significant improvement in reducing frequency and severity of impulsive aggression and irritability in a sample of 100 subjects who were randomized into a 14-week, double-blind study. Despite a large decrease in impulsive aggression behavior from baseline, only 44% of <b>fluoxetine</b> responders and 29% of all <b>fluoxetine</b> subjects were considered to be in full remission at the end of the study. Paroxetine has shown to be somewhat effective although the results are inconsistent. Another medication, escitalopram, has shown to improve the condition of the subjects of pathological gambling with anxiety symptoms. The results suggest that although SSRIs have shown positive results in the treatment of pathological gambling, inconsistent results with the use of SSRIs have been obtained which might suggest a neurological heterogeneity in the impulse-control disorder spectrum.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>fluoxetine</b> and other antidepressants {{in the treatment}} of mild-to-moderate depression is controversial. A meta-analysis published by Kirsch in 2008 suggests, in those with mild or moderate symptoms, the efficacy of <b>fluoxetine</b> and other SSRIs is clinically insignificant. A 2009 meta-analysis by Fournier which evaluated patient-level data from six trials of the SSRI paroxetine and the non-SSRI antidepressant imipramine has been further cited as evidence that antidepressants exhibit minimal efficacy in mild to moderate depression. A 2012 meta-analysis using individual patient level-data of <b>fluoxetine</b> for the treatment of depression concluded statistically and clinically significant benefit was seen irrespective of baseline depression severity, and no significant effect was found on baseline severity on observed efficacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{extremely}} slow {{elimination of}} <b>fluoxetine</b> and its active metabolite norfluoxetine {{from the body}} distinguishes it from other antidepressants. With time, <b>fluoxetine</b> and norfluoxetine inhibit their own metabolism, so <b>fluoxetine</b> elimination half-life changes from 1 to 3days, after a single dose, to 4 to 6days, after long-term use. Similarly, the half-life of norfluoxetine is longer (16days) after long-term use. Therefore, the concentration of the drug and its active metabolite in the blood continues to grow through {{the first few weeks}} of treatment, and their steady concentration in the blood is achieved only after four weeks. Moreover, the brain concentration of <b>fluoxetine</b> and its metabolites keeps increasing through at least the first five weeks of treatment. That means that the full benefits of the current dose a patient receives are not realized for at least a month since its initiation. For example, in one 6-week study, the median time to achieving consistent response was 29days. Likewise, complete excretion of the drug may take several weeks. During the first week after the treatment discontinuation, the brain concentration of <b>fluoxetine</b> decreases only by 50%, The blood level of norfluoxetine 4 weeks after the treatment discontinuation is about 80% of the level registered {{by the end of the}} first treatment week, and 7 weeks after the discontinuation norfluoxetine is still detectable in the blood.|$|E
25|$|Because most {{antidepressants}} function by inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinepherine {{these drugs}} {{can interfere with}} natural neurotransmitter levels in other organisms impacted by indirect exposure. Antidepressants <b>fluoxetine</b> and sertraline have been detected in aquatic organisms residing in effluent dominated streams. The presence of antidepressants in surface waters and aquatic organisms has caused concern because ecotoxicological effects to aquatic organisms due to <b>fluoxetine</b> exposure have been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluoxetine</b> {{has been}} shown to inhibit acid sphingomyelinase, a key {{regulator}} of ceramide levels which derives ceramide from sphingomyelin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fluoxetine,</b> {{also known}} by trade names Prozac and Sarafem among others, is an {{antidepressant}} of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It {{is used for}} the treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), bulimia nervosa, panic disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It may decrease the risk of suicide in those over the age of 65. <b>Fluoxetine</b> has also been used to treat premature ejaculation. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|In addition, <b>fluoxetine</b> {{has been}} found to act as an agonist of the σ1-receptor, with a potency greater than that of {{citalopram}} but less than that of fluvoxamine. However, the significance of this property is not fully clear. <b>Fluoxetine</b> also functions as a channel blocker of anoctamin 1, a calcium-activated chloride channel. A number of other ion channels, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and 5-HT3 receptors, are also known to be inhibited at similar concentrations.|$|E

25|$|Sertraline {{has been}} found to {{directly}} act on the enzyme 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) and modulate its activity, thereby enhancing the conversion of 5α-dihydroprogesterone into the neurosteroid allopregnanolone and thus increasing the production of allopregnanolone in the brain. The same is true for certain other SSRIs including <b>fluoxetine</b> and paroxetine. However, a subsequent study failed to reproduce these findings, and a direct interaction of SSRIs with 3α-HSD is controversial. In any case, another study found that, at least in the case of <b>fluoxetine</b> and its active metabolite norfluoxetine, these drugs normalized low allopregnanolone levels in socially isolated mice and at low doses that were inactive on serotonin reuptake (10- to 50-fold lower, specifically). On the basis of these results, SSRIs like <b>fluoxetine</b> and norfluoxetine were described as selective brain steroidogenic stimulants (SBSSs).|$|E
25|$|A 2014 meta {{analysis}} concluded that olanzapine plus <b>fluoxetine</b> {{was the most}} effective among nine treatments for bipolar depression included in the analysis.|$|E
25|$|Statins have a {{protective}} effect on blood vessels, and SSRIs such as <b>fluoxetine</b> may help RP symptoms but {{the data is}} weak.|$|E
25|$|Patients who {{are taking}} {{anticoagulants}} or NSAIDS must be careful when taking <b>fluoxetine</b> or other SSRIs, as they can sometimes increase the blood-thinning effects of these medications.|$|E
25|$|Evidence is {{insufficient}} to {{support the use of}} medications to treat obstructive sleep apnea. This includes the use of <b>fluoxetine,</b> paroxetine, acetazolamide and tryptophan among others.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, omeprazole, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, topiramate, ketoconazole, itraconazole, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, erythromycin, probenecid, propranolol, imipramine, ciprofloxacin, <b>fluoxetine,</b> and {{valproic acid}} prolong {{the action of}} {{diazepam}} by inhibiting its elimination.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} of clinical trials by the FDA statisticians showed {{the incidence of}} suicidal behaviour among the adults on venlafaxine to be {{not significantly different from}} <b>fluoxetine</b> or placebo.|$|E
25|$|Paroxetine is a {{constrained}} structural analogue of <b>fluoxetine</b> {{where the}} linear phenylpropylamine group of <b>fluoxetine</b> has been folded into a piperidine ring (figure 5). The compound has {{the possibility of}} four stereoisomers because it contains two chiral centers, but one of them, the (3S,4R)-isomer, is marketed as paroxetine. Research has shown that stereochemical factors affect affinity of the molecule for SERT where substitution into the 2-ortho-position of either aromatic rings decreases affinity for rat SERT {{by as much as}} 10–100 times, where the greatest loss occurs in the phenoxy ring.|$|E
25|$|In a {{meta-analysis}} of various trials involving <b>fluoxetine</b> (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), and sertraline (Zoloft) {{to test their}} relative efficacies in treating OCD, clomipramine {{was found to be}} the most effective.|$|E
25|$|A meta-analysis, {{including}} {{studies with}} <b>fluoxetine,</b> paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram versus placebo, showed SSRIs {{to be effective}} in reducing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, whether taken continuously or just in the luteal phase.|$|E
