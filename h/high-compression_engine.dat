50|$|Firing the gap of a spark plug, {{particularly}} in the combustion chamber of a <b>high-compression</b> <b>engine,</b> requires a greater voltage (or higher tension) than {{can be achieved by}} a simple magneto. The high-tension magneto combines an alternating current magneto generator and a transformer. A high current at low voltage is generated by the magneto, then transformed to a high voltage (even though this is now a far smaller current) by the transformer.|$|E
50|$|One {{phenomenon}} {{that can affect}} water-cooled diesel engines is cylinder cavitation and erosion. This {{is due to a}} phenomenon in <b>high-compression</b> <b>engines</b> where the ignition of the fuel in the cylinder causes a high-frequency vibration that causes bubbles to form in the coolant in contact with the cylinder. When these tiny bubbles collapse, coolant impacts the cylinder wall, over time causing small holes to form in the cylinder wall. This damage is mitigated in some engines with coatings, or with a coolant additive specifically designed to prevent cavitation and erosion damage. Engines damaged in this way will require the affected cylinder to be repaired (where possible) or will be rendered unusable.|$|R
5000|$|The 1.9-litre {{engine was}} fitted {{in the top}} of the range [...] "Opel Rallye Kadett" [...] as an {{alternative}} to the smaller <b>high-compression</b> 1.2-litre <b>engine</b> also offered for this sportingly attired variant, readily identifiable from the thick black side stripe and the black paint on the lid of the bonnet/hood.|$|R
5000|$|Crankshafts on six-cylinder engines {{generally}} have either four or seven main bearings. Larger engines and diesels {{tend to use}} seven bearings because of high loadings and to avoid crankshaft flex. Because of the six-cylinder engine's smooth characteristic, {{there is a tendency}} for a driver to load the engine at low engine speeds. This can produce crankshaft flex in four main bearing designs where the crank spans the distance of two cylinders between main bearings. This distance is longer than the distance between two adjacent main bearings on a V6 with four mains, because the V6 has cylinder bores on opposite banks which overlap significantly; the overlap may be as high as 100%, minus the width of one connecting rod (1.00" [...] or so). In addition, modern <b>high-compression</b> <b>engines</b> subject the crankshaft to greater bending loads from higher peak gas pressures, requiring the crankthrows to have greater support from adjacent bearings, so it is now customary to design straight-sixes with seven main bearings.|$|R
50|$|The Rumpler C.VI was a high-altitude {{reconnaissance}} aircraft {{used by the}} Germans during the First World War. The aircraft was designed, along with the C.VII, based on the previous success of high-altitude Zeppelins, from which the engine was also taken: the Maybach Mb.IVa high-altitude <b>high-compression</b> <b>engine.</b> In order {{to operate in the}} thinner atmosphere, the aircraft also had a special carburetor and a radiator; however, the radiator was half-sized in order to reduce weight.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} 1924 Chrysler {{included a}} carburetor air filter, <b>high-compression</b> <b>engine,</b> full pressure lubrication inside the engine, and an oil filter, {{at a time}} when most autos came without all these features. Among the innovations in its early years would be the first practical mass-produced four-wheel hydraulic brakes, a system nearly completely engineered by Chrysler with patents assigned to Lockheed. Chrysler pioneered rubber engine mounts to reduce vibration; Oilite bearings; and superfinishing for shafts.|$|E
5000|$|At the Daimler engine company, Max Friz {{had tried}} {{in vain to}} develop an oversized, <b>high-compression</b> <b>engine,</b> but Paul Daimler had firmly {{committed}} himself to supercharger technology. Not until he had moved to Munich was Friz able to put his own ideas for a high-altitude engine into practice. In the space of a few weeks he designed a new aero-engine, which, with an innovative carburettor {{and a variety of other}} technical details, was superior to any other German aero-engine. Later, this engine would gain world renown under the designation [...] "BMW IIIa".|$|E

5000|$|All Pontiacs were {{powered by}} various {{renditions}} {{of the new}} 389 cubic-inch Tempest V8, which was later renamed from 1961 as the Trophy V-8, which was basically a stroked version to 3.75" [...] of the 370 cubic-inch V8 used in 1958-model Pontiacs {{and based on the}} same Pontiac V8 design introduced in 1955. Catalinas came standard with a [...] version of the 389 with two-barrel carburetor and 8.6 to 1 compression mated to the three-speed manual transmission. When the optional four-speed Hydramatic transmission was ordered, the standard engine was [...] version of the same engine with higher 10.5 to 1 compression ratio. Available as a no-cost option with the Hydramatic transmission was the 215-horsepower 389 (dubbed the Economy V8) with 8.6 to 1 compression ratio which burned cheaper regular gasoline, instead of the premium and super-premium fuels required for the <b>high-compression</b> <b>engines,</b> and capable of achieving more than 20 MPG on the highway. Optionally available at extra cost were higher-power of the 389 V8 with four-barrel carburetion rated at [...] with stick shift or 303 with Hydramatic, or [...] "Tri-Power" [...] options with three two-barrel carburetors and horsepower ratings of 318 and 330 4bbl and [...] tri power.|$|R
40|$|Techniques were {{evaluated}} {{to determine if}} simple combustor modifications {{could be used to}} reduce the engine ground idle emissions of a double annular combustor designed for Mach 3. 0 cruise operation. These techniques were radial fuel staging, the use of radial-inflow rather than axial-flow air swirlers, and the optimization of fuel-nozzle spray angle and differential pressure. Radial fuel staging and the use of radial-inflow air swirlers significantly improved performance at two ground idle test conditions simulating both low- and <b>high-compression</b> ratio <b>engines...</b>|$|R
50|$|That is a final {{temperature}} of 753 K, or 479 °C, or 896 °F, {{well above the}} ignition point of many fuels. This is why a <b>high-compression</b> <b>engine</b> requires fuels specially formulated to not self-ignite (which would cause engine knocking when operated under these conditions of temperature and pressure), or that a supercharger with an intercooler to provide a pressure boost but with a lower temperature rise would be advantageous. A diesel engine operates under even more extreme conditions, with compression ratios of 20:1 or more being typical, {{in order to provide}} a very high gas temperature which ensures immediate ignition of the injected fuel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{four-cylinder engine}} was {{promoted}} for its economy, but Pontiac also saved money {{because it could}} run the engine down the same assembly line as the 389. There were three versions of the engine: an 8.6:1, low compression, single-barrel carburetor; a 10.25:1 high-compression with single barrel; and a <b>high-compression</b> <b>engine</b> with a four-barrel carburetor. While the single-barrel version produced , the four-barrel was capable of [...] (SAE gross) at 4,800 rpm and [...] of torque at 2,800 rpm. All three versions had a fuel economy ranging from 18-22 mpg, and the engine was generally reliable though it {{had a reputation as}} the [...] "Hay Baler", a derogatory label applied by dealer mechanics (ostensibly from farm states) who experienced the violent kicks it could produce when out of tune. Popular Mechanics reported 21.3mpg at 60 mph. There were quite a few options, including air conditioning, transistor radios, windshield washers, a parking brake warning light, padded safety dash, child-proof door locks, and seat belts.|$|E
40|$|Mixtures of {{gasoline}} and alcohol when used in internal combustion engines designed for gasoline {{have been found to}} possess the advantage of alcohol in withstanding high compression without "knock" while retaining advantages {{of gasoline}} with regard to starting characteristics.

5000|$|After {{the onset}} of World War II in 1939, Texaco's rogue CEO, Torkild Rieber, an admirer of Hitler, hired pro-Nazi assistants who cabled Berlin “coded {{information}} about ships leaving New York for Britain and what their cargoes were.” This espionage easily enabled Hitler to destroy the ships. In 1940, Rieber {{was forced to resign}} when his connections with German Nazism, and his illegal supply of oil to the fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War were made public by the Herald Tribune through information produced by British Security Coordination.
