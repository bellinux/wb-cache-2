50|$|<b>Grinder</b> <b>pumps</b> {{should not}} require {{preventive}} maintenance. However, <b>grinder</b> <b>pumps</b> that use floats {{to sense the}} level in the holding tank are prone to grease buildup that may turn the pump on unnecessarily, or not turn on the pump at all, causing the tank to fill up and sewage to possibly back up into the home or yard. To prevent this, <b>grinder</b> <b>pumps</b> that use floats are often hosed down to remove the grease from the floats.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grinder</b> <b>pumps</b> can be {{installed}} in the basement or in the yard. If installed in the yard, the holding tank must be buried deep enough that the pump and sewage pipes are below the frost line.|$|R
5000|$|Disposable wipes {{that are}} made by {{cleaning}} companies for personal use, cleaning toilets, etc. are causing problems in communities around the United States. Not only do people clog their household plumbing, they are causing problems with household <b>grinder</b> <b>pumps,</b> lift stations, and sewage treatment plants. Some wipe companies say [...] "flush one at a time," [...] some say [...] "not for pump systems," [...] some say [...] "safe for sewers." [...] As recommended by Consumer Reports, wipes should be put into a garbage can instead of the toilet. [...] The National Association of Clean Water Agencies has {{compiled a list of}} articles and municipal documents regarding wipes.|$|R
50|$|A <b>grinder</b> <b>pump</b> is {{different}} from a sump pump or effluent pump. There {{are two types of}} grinder pumps, semi-positive displacement (SPD) and centrifugal.|$|E
50|$|The holding tank, likely {{constructed}} of fiberglass, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or fiberglass-reinforced polyester (FRP), has an inlet opening and a discharge opening. The pipes {{from the home}} {{are connected to the}} inlet; the pipe that leads to the sewer main is connected to the discharge. Often, more than one home or restroom (in a park, for example) can be connected to one <b>grinder</b> <b>pump</b> station. In this case, more than one inlet can be installed. It {{is a good idea to}} consult the manufacturer or factory representative before purchasing a <b>grinder</b> <b>pump</b> station to ensure that more than one inlet hole can be drilled.|$|E
50|$|In large {{sewage pump}} stations, {{clogging}} problems are often avoided by installing a chopper pump in the tank. A chopper pump {{is able to}} handle larger/tougher solids than a residential <b>grinder</b> <b>pump,</b> including hair balls, diapers, sanitary napkins, clothing, etc.|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} an analysis and formalization of existing methods for calculating {{the performance of}} different equipment for mechanical processing of raw materials with screw working body (<b>grinders,</b> mixers, <b>pumps).</b> It is noted that these methods do not consider the presence of counterpressure at the exit, where the reverse flow of the processed raw material is observed. Thus, the calculation of performance (e. g. <b>grinders</b> and <b>pumps)</b> is carried out more simply {{through the use of}} single empirical coefficient linking the design parameters, structural and mechanical properties of raw materials and the value of counterpressure with performance. It is shown that the existing calculation methods are developed for a homogeneous medium using Newtonian isothermal models and that their adjustment to experimental data was carried out by introducing the relevant empirical coefficients. These recommendations are widely used, but they do not allow the calculation of performance based on the counterpressure. The study was conducted mathematically by the method based on the technique of «deployment of the screw channel» {{in the form of a}} rectangle covered by plate (wall of the working cylinder) and moving at a constant speed. The main attention is drawn to the assumption that the screw channel has the form of a rectangle, one side of which is equal to the depth of thread and the second side is equal to the pitch of thread. The equation linking volumetric performance with the geometric parameters of the screw, the formula for determining the volumetric performance of the reverse flow and the equation linking the actual performance of the screw with its geometrical parameters, rotation speed, counterpressure and the rheological characteristics of raw materials are developed. The value of performance loss for the screw press is calculated considering reverse flow of meat through the gap. For the first time, a method for calculating the performance of mechanical deboning screw presses is developed allowing to consider the effect of the gaps between the tip of the screw and the chamber, as well as the effect of «sleeve-screw» gaps on the value of the performance loss...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} types of drills: some are powered manually, others use {{electricity}} (electric drill) or compressed air (pneumatic drill) as the motive power, and a minority are driven by an internal combustion engine (for example, earth drilling augers). Drills with a percussive action (hammer drills) are mostly used in hard materials such as masonry (brick, concrete and stone) or rock. Drilling rigs are used to bore holes in the earth to obtain water or oil. Oil wells, water wells, or holes for geothermal heating are created with large drilling rigs. Some types of hand-held drills are also used to drive screws and other fasteners. Some small appliances that have no motor of their own may be drill-powered, such as small <b>pumps,</b> <b>grinders,</b> etc.|$|R

50|$|The <b>grinder</b> <b>pump</b> “station” {{consists}} of the pump, a tank, and an alarm panel. A pump for household use is usually 1 hp, 1.5 hp or 2 hp. A cutting mechanism macerates waste and grinds items that are not normally found in sewage, but may get flushed down the toilet. The pump has a level sensor either built into the pump, called “sensing bells,” or attached externally to the pump, called “floats.” (The level sensing devices vary among <b>grinder</b> <b>pump</b> manufacturers.)If the pump malfunctions and the waste level in the holding tank rises above a certain level, the alarm panel should alert the homeowner that the pump is experiencing problems. The alarm panel should have both a buzzer and an indicator light.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>grinder</b> <b>pump</b> is a {{wastewater}} conveyance device. Waste from water-using {{household appliances}} (toilets, bathtubs, washing machines, etc.) {{flows through the}} home’s pipes into the grinder pump’s holding tank. Once the wastewater inside the tank reaches a specific level, the pump will turn on, grind the waste into a fine slurry, and pump it to the central sewer system or septic tank.|$|E

In August 2012, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection invited comments on its proposed Total Maximum Daily Load plan for Dalmatia Creek. However, no public comments were received.|$|E
50|$|In low-lying communities, {{wastewater}} may be {{conveyed by}} vacuum sewer. Pipelines {{range in size}} from pipes of six inches (150 mm) in diameter to concrete-lined tunnels of up to thirty feet (10 m) in diameter. A low pressure system uses a small <b>grinder</b> <b>pump</b> located at each point of connection, typically a house or business. Vacuum sewer systems use differential atmospheric pressure to move the liquid to a central vacuum station.|$|E
50|$|A chopper pump is {{operated}} by a drive unit (e.g. electric motor, hydraulic motor, PTO), which turns the impeller and the cutting system. An open impeller design is used to successfully pass the macerated solids or thick slurry. A set of hardened steel cutters is installed externally to the pump suction in order to macerate all solids prior to entering the hydraulic parts of the pump. A chopper pump {{should not be confused}} with a <b>grinder</b> <b>pump,</b> which uses its impeller as part of the cutting mechanism. Grinder pumps are typically used for light weight sewage applications, whereas chopper pumps are used for tough solids handling applications. The chopping system consists of a set of rotating cutters that are keyed to the shaft and work in conjunction with the stationary cutters, which are bolted to the suction plate. A system of mechanical seals are used to prevent the pumped liquid from entering the motor. The pump can either be connected to a pipe, flexible hose or lowered down a guide rail so that the pump sits on a coupling foot (aka base elbow), thereby connecting it to the discharge pipe.|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{explores the}} {{performance}} of pressurized sewage systems {{and its effect on}} self-cleansing of distribution pipes. Pressure sewage systems are mostly applied in non-urban areas where these systems connect and distribute wastewater from household to the main sewage pipeline. The biggest concern for these distribution systems is the possible accumulation of sediments in the sewer pipes, although it is a common phenomenon. The main goal of this thesis is to demonstrate that pressurized sewage systems can achieve the self-cleansing process even with velocities that are lower than defined by standards. The test was conducted at Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) in Ås, Norway. In this project, observation of wastewater distribution through Environment One (E/One) <b>grinder</b> <b>pump</b> and pressurized pipes was conducted and analyzed. This project was designed to reproduce the real setting as close as possible from the wastewater tank, which represents wastewater source in this case, to the gravitational sewer as a final recipient. Through the analysis, the thesis argues that pressurized sewer system represents a potentially good solution for wastewater distribution in non-urban areas. These systems are achieving self-cleansing effect in pipes, which makes them efficient, self- sustainable and safe for the purpose of distributing wastewater from household to the main sewer.
