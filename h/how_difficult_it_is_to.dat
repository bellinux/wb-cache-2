5|$|Presently, the {{porcupine}} ray {{is caught}} incidentally in trawls, tangle nets, and beach seines. Its skin {{continues to be}} highly valued, while the meat and cartilage may also be utilized. In the Farasan Islands and some {{other places in the}} Red Sea, its liver is eaten as a seasonal dish. However, the economic importance of this ray is limited by <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> handle. The multi-species coastal fisheries that catch the porcupine ray are largely unregulated, which seems to have resulted in its dramatic decline or local extinction in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Thailand, and likely elsewhere in its range. Potential additional threats to this species include habitat degradation from coastal development, and depletion of its food supply from overfishing. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

In this way, complex pictures with much detail may demand a higher bitrate at one instant and this can result in the bitrate allocated to another channel in the same multiplex being reduced if the second channel is currently transmitting pictures which are easier to encode, with less fine detail.|$|E

25|$|Using these variables, {{the optimal}} diet model can predict how predators choose between two prey types: big prey1 with energy value E1 and {{handling}} time h1, and small prey2 with energy value E2 and handling time h2. In order to maximize its overall rate of energy gain, a predator {{must consider the}} profitability of the two prey types. If {{it is assumed that}} big prey1 is more profitable than small prey2, then E1/h1 > E2/h2. Thus, if the predator encounters prey1, it should always choose to eat it, because of its higher profitability. It should never bother to go searching for prey2. However, if the animal encounters prey2, it should reject it to look for a more profitable prey1, unless the time it would take to find prey1 is too long and costly for it to be worth it. Thus, the animal should only eat prey2 if E2/h2 > E1/(h1+S1), where S1 is the search time for prey1. Since it is always favorable to choose to eat prey1, the choice to eat prey1 is not dependent on the abundance of prey2. But since the length of S1 (i.e. <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find prey1) is logically dependent on the density of prey1, the choice to eat prey2 is dependent on the abundance of prey1.|$|E

Unsure how to approach the role, Morrissey was advised by his friend, director Paul Greengrass, to get Collins' job as politician right. Morrissey contacted State of Play producer Hilary Bevan Jones, who set up meetings between Morrissey and select committee members Kevin Barron and Fabian Hamilton.

500|$|On {{multiple}} occasions, numerous gaming magazines {{have chosen}} Sephiroth {{as one of}} the best villains from both the Final Fantasy series in specific and in all of video games in general. GameSpy placed him eighth in their 2014 list of top villains in games, commenting on <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> defeat him in Final Fantasy VII. In 2005, Sephiroth was the winner in a GameFAQs character battle involving only villains. IGN listed him at number two in its 2006 list of most memorable villains, as well as the fourth top video game villain. He has been named the number one villain in an episode of G4's Filter. PC World placed him second in their 2008 list of most diabolical video game villains of all time. That same year, Sephiroth was listed at the top of IGN's list of Final Fantasy VII top characters, with Dave Smith calling him the [...] "heavyweight champion of Final Fantasy villains," [...] and praising his appearance and backstory. He would take the same spot in the list of top 25 Final Fantasy characters by the same site. In IGN's Final Fantasy reader's choice, also written by Smith, Sephiroth was placed fourth, with commentary focusing on his activities in the game's plot. In a retrospective on Final Fantasy antagonists, GamesRadar listed Sephiroth as their top pick, citing his developed motives and acts of evil. GamesRadar also put Sephiroth in their 2013 list of the best villains in video game history at number six.|$|E

Nerissa tells Gregor she believes Sandwich purposely made it [...] "difficult to read" [...] in order to emphasize <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> understand, and Gregor later hypothesizes that Sandwich forced the humans to read it using mirrors so that, as a person read, [...] " [...] would see [...] ".

In Gregor and the Code of Claw, when the [...] "Prophecy of Time" [...] calls for a [...] "princess" [...] to crack a cryptogram, Boots is immediately assigned the role because of her importance to the last two prophecies, despite the fact that she is still a toddler.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Boston Globe, John Freeman observes that Clarke's fantasy, {{like that of}} Franz Kafka and Neil Gaiman, is imbued with realism. He argues that the {{footnotes}} in particular lend an air of credibility to the narrative: for example, they describe a fictional biography of Jonathan Strange and list where particular paintings in Norrell’s house are located. In an interview, Clarke describes how she creates this realist fantasy: [...] "One way of grounding the magic is by putting in lots of stuff about street lamps, carriages and <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get good servants." [...] To create this effect, the novel includes many references to real early-nineteenth century people and things, such as: artists Francisco Goya, Cruikshank, and Rowlandson; writers Frances Burney, William Beckford, Monk Lewis, Lord Byron, and Ann Radcliffe; Maria Edgeworth's Belinda and Austen's Emma; publisher John Murray; politicians Lord Castlereagh and George Canning; The Gentleman's Magazine and The Edinburgh Review; Chippendale and Wedgwood furnishings; and the madness of King George III. Clarke has said that she hopes the magic is as realistic as that in Le Guin's Earthsea trilogy. This realism has led other reviewers, such as Polly Shulman, to argue that Clarke's book {{is more of an}} historical fiction, akin to the works of Patrick O'Brian. As she explains, [...] "Both Clarke's and O'Brian's stories are about a complicated relationship between two men bound together by their profession; both are set during the Napoleonic wars; and they share a dry, melancholy wit and unconventional narrative shape." [...] Shulman sees fantasy and historical fiction as similar because both must follow rigid rules or risk a breakdown of the narrative.|$|E

500|$|... "Next" [...] {{was written}} by Jenna Bans and Kevin Murphy and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. While developing storylines for the second season, series creator Marc Cherry stated, [...] "I want to keep {{finding new ways to}} talk about issues that relate to everyday women," [...] explaining that the show needs to focus on [...] "small, real, everyday issues" [...] {{in order to keep the}} audience interested. Cherry cited the Lynette storyline as an example of this strategy: [...] "Lynette will have a job next season (returning to her advertising roots), so I want to address <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> go to work all day and then come home and be expected to also take care of your house." [...] Huffman recognized that her character's storylines needed a change of pace, but hoped that Lynette's domestic life would still play an integral role this season. [...] "My hope is to not get lost in the corporate world; that it's still a home and family/husband and children story," [...] she explained. [...] "But how many times can you go, 'Kids, clear your plates!'" [...] The episode also introduced Joely Fisher as Lynette's new boss, Nina Fletcher. Fisher describes her character as [...] "nasty," [...] elaborating: [...] "Lynette suddenly has to come up against this tiger lady who never stops reminding Lynette that she's childless by choice. Even though Nina is not a housewife, she is desperate in her own way." [...] Due to the death of his character, Steven Culp did not return to the series for the second season. For the open casket scene in [...] "Next", producers created a life mask of the actor. Savant was promoted to series regular after appearing as a recurring guest star throughout the first season.|$|E

Japanese magazine Gamest ranked Rugal 48th {{on their list}} of the top 50 video game characters introduced in 1994, sharing the spot with Chang Koehan. Video games publications have commented on Rugal's character, adding praise and criticism. Retro Gamer praised the character, stating he [...] "rocks hard...harder than Street Fighters M. Bison". GameAxis Unwired compared Rugal with Street Fighters Akuma in regards to their significacies to their respective developers, with Rugal called the [...] "cheapest [...] in SNK's games."

However, they mentioned {{that one of the}} good points from KOF '96 was the absence of Rugal. Eurogamer reviewer Matt Edwards also commented that Rugal was very hard to defeat and that he started [...] "a trend in the KOF series of notoriously overpowered bosses who are hard to take down". IGN's Jeremy Dunhan praised Rugal, describing how his character developed the new rules for the King of Fighters tournament, and noted the difficulty in defeating Rugal himself. Listing him as one of the [...] "12 unfair fighting game bosses that (almost) made us rage quit", GamesRadar claimed that Rugal's difficult as a boss led gamers to coin the term [...] "SNK Boss syndrome." [...] In retrospective, Gaming Age writer Jeff Keely found Rugal and Orochi as difficult bosses but not as difficult as Krizalid from The King of Fighters '99. Den of Geek listed Rugal's upgraded form from Capcom vs. SNK 2 as the best altered character due to how it takes Akuma's special moves as well as other traits. The same site also listed him as the sixth best character from the KOF complimenting him as a good villain based on his traits. Complex listed him {{as one of the most}} challenging bosses in gaming, citing how overpowered were some of his moves most notably his [...] "Genocide Cutter". Despite criticizing most of the live-action movie based on the series, Derek Elley from Film Biz found Rugal's role enjoyable.|$|E
500|$|Webb {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a story about a kid who grows up looking for his father and finds himself." [...] Both Webb and star Garfield described Parker as an outsider by choice, someone hard to get close to. As in the early comic books, the character [...] "is a science whiz. If you look {{back to the early}} Stan Lee and Steve Ditko comics, he's a nerd with big glasses," [...] said Webb. He explained [...] "the idea of what a nerd is has changed in 40 or 50 years. Nerds are running the world. Andrew Garfield made a movie [...] about it. ... What was important in those early comics was this notion that Peter Parker is an outsider and how we define that in a contemporary context." [...] Garfield compared his Spider-Man façade as a metaphor for internet anonymity, saying, [...] "You feel the power of it, the power of not being seen, the power of the mask. Peter becomes witty when he's got that protective layer. It's like he's on a message board. He's got the anonymity of the Internet within that suit, and he can say whatever the [...] @#!*% [...] he likes, and he can get away with anything." [...] Garfield tried to explore Parker as an orphan, whom he feels [...] "are the strongest human beings on the planet." [...] He said Parker is [...] "a human hero [...] goes through all of the same struggles that we all have gone through, especially the skinny ones [...] want more power than they feel they have." [...] He believes Parker represents [...] "a very inspiring, aspirational character that symbolizes goodness—and <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be good—but how worth it it is." [...] Rhys Ifans compared this film to William Shakespeare's Hamlet on the grounds that Spider-Man can be redone over and over in different ways. He felt that they are similar in that they both represent meaningful archetypal young men grappling with the loss of their father. Critics like Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that Garfield's character as the superhero [...] "embodies the nerdy Parker, the anguished fatherless teen and the cocky super-hero in equal doses". Boyd Hoij of Variety noted that Garfield's character as Spider-Man makes an interesting hero in the film because of how it establishes early on that Peter's growing pains along with his search for an identity are common to any teenager and that [...] "his struggles involve real people—and real lives." ...|$|E
