5|$|Contact with <b>extraterrestrial</b> civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} rights of the <b>extraterrestrial</b> beings. An <b>extraterrestrial</b> {{arriving}} on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might <b>extraterrestrial</b> beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an <b>extraterrestrial</b> civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of <b>extraterrestrial</b> culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an <b>extraterrestrial</b> civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an <b>extraterrestrial</b> message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to radio-based methods, some projects, such as SEVENDIP (Search for <b>Extraterrestrial</b> Visible Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations) at the University of California, Berkeley, are using {{other regions of}} the electromagnetic spectrum to search for <b>extraterrestrial</b> signals.

5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of <b>extraterrestrial</b> contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese {{university}} students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that <b>extraterrestrial</b> life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that <b>extraterrestrial</b> contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered <b>extraterrestrial</b> contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for <b>extraterrestrial</b> intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} {{impact of}} <b>extraterrestrial</b> contact is the corpus of changes to terrestrial science, technology, religion, politics, and ecosystems resulting from {{contact with an}} <b>extraterrestrial</b> civilization.

5|$|The {{potential}} {{changes from}} <b>extraterrestrial</b> contact could vary greatly in magnitude and type, {{based on the}} <b>extraterrestrial</b> civilization's level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity. The medium through which humanity is contacted, be it electromagnetic radiation, direct physical interaction, <b>extraterrestrial</b> artefact, or otherwise, may also influence the results of contact. Incorporating these factors, various systems have been created to assess the implications of <b>extraterrestrial</b> contact.|$|E

40|$|Peer reviewedToday, {{human beings}} are venturing into deep space. As {{questioning}} beings who continuously seek to transcend ourselves, and as the scientific quest for <b>extraterrestrials</b> continues, we are prompted to philosophise about <b>extraterrestrials</b> {{in the event of}} detection. The search for <b>extraterrestrials</b> is also a search for ourselves. What is it to be human? This question is highlighted in arguments for and against this quest and in the discussion about communication with <b>extraterrestrials.</b> Constraints and convergence in our evolutionary context and a galaxy with so many similarities make a too different alien science unlikely. Aliens cannot be too alien. Strict protocols are in place before sightings can be confirmed. Some results seem very promising, others not.

5|$|Even if {{an ancient}} and {{advanced}} <b>extraterrestrial</b> civilization wished to help humanity, humans could {{suffer from a}} loss of identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the <b>extraterrestrial</b> civilization. However, a friendly civilization may calibrate its contact with humanity {{in such a way}} as to minimize unintended consequences. Michael A. G. Michaud suggests that a friendly and advanced <b>extraterrestrial</b> civilization may even avoid all contact with an emerging intelligent species like humanity, to ensure that the less advanced civilization can develop naturally at its own pace; this is known as the zoo hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Extraterrestrial</b> {{technology}} could have profound {{impacts on the}} nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide variety of}} political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an <b>extraterrestrial</b> technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of <b>extraterrestrial</b> technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an <b>extraterrestrial</b> civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.|$|E
5|$|Michaud {{suggests}} that humanity could be impacted by {{an influx of}} <b>extraterrestrial</b> science and technology {{in the same way}} that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists. Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the human species, and might even feel inferior to the <b>extraterrestrial</b> species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced <b>extraterrestrial</b> civilization.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{pathogens}} and invasive species of <b>extraterrestrial</b> origin might differ enough from terrestrial organisms in their biology {{to have no}} adverse effects.

5|$|The {{confirmation}} of <b>extraterrestrial</b> intelligence {{could have a}} profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of <b>extraterrestrial</b> intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of <b>extraterrestrial</b> intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the Catholic Church would be likely to welcome <b>extraterrestrial</b> visitors warmly.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>extraterrestrial</b> intelligence would have various impacts on biology and astrobiology. The {{discovery of}} <b>extraterrestrial</b> life in any form, intelligent or non-intelligent, would give humanity greater {{insight into the}} nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how the tree of life is organized. Human biologists could learn about <b>extraterrestrial</b> biochemistry and observe how it differs from that found on Earth. This knowledge could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which are specific to Earth.|$|E

5|$|To detect <b>extraterrestrial</b> civilizations {{with radio}} telescopes, one must {{identify}} an artificial, coherent signal {{against a background}} of various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California. Various programs to detect <b>extraterrestrial</b> intelligence have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate {{the most effective way to}} search for signals from intelligent <b>extraterrestrial</b> sources, but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent <b>extraterrestrial</b> beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} {{astronomer}} Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory considered the cultural impact of <b>extraterrestrial</b> contact by analyzing events of similar {{significance in the}} history of science. The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received, if any. It distinguishes short-term and long-term impact. Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from <b>extraterrestrial</b> spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of European colonization of the Americas as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by <b>extraterrestrial</b> contact.|$|E
