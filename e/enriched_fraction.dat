Plants were grown in glass chambers to allow non-destructive viewing of roots and mycorrhizal hyphae, which were visualized using autofluorescence microscopy after excitation with blue light. Exposure to garlic mustard extracts containing glucosinolates for five months lowered jewelweed germination by almost 50 % compared to controls. Uncolonized jewelweed root systems grown in soil amended by activated carbon were longer, larger, and better at exploring the soil than those grown without activated carbon, regardless of the extract they were exposed to. Uncolonized root systems exposed to a whole plant extract grew faster than other treatments. After four weeks of exposure during the symbiosis formation phase of growth, mycorrhizal colonization was lowest in roots exposed to either the whole plant extract or the glucosinolate <b>enriched</b> <b>fraction.</b> In contrast, a whole plant extract stimulated mycorrhizal hyphae production in the soil more than either a glucosinolate or flavonoid glycoside <b>enriched</b> <b>fraction.</b> The secondary metabolites produced by garlic mustard interact in complex ways, even stimulating some phases of growth, to affect surrounding plants and mycorrhizae...|$|E

The specific activity (expressed as nanomoles of protoporphyrin formed per hour per milligram protein) in the mitochondrial fraction was 8 and in the plasma membrane <b>enriched</b> <b>fraction</b> was 4 to 6. The plasma membrane <b>enriched</b> <b>fraction</b> exhibited minimal cytochrome oxidase activity and no carotenoid content, indicating little contamination with mitochondrial or plastid membranes. Etioplasts from etiolated barley leaves exhibited a protoporphyrinogen oxidase specific activity of 7 to 12. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity in the barley root mitochondrial fraction and etioplast extracts was more than 90 % inhibited by assay {{in the presence of}} the diphenyl ether herbicide acifluorfen methyl, but the activity in the plasma membrane <b>enriched</b> <b>fraction</b> exhibited much less inhibition by this herbicide (12 to 38 % inhibition) under the same assay conditions. Acifluorfen-methyl inhibition of the organellar (mitochondrial or plastid) enzyme was maximal upon preincubation of the enzyme with 4 mm dithiothreitol, although a lesser degree of inhibition was noted if the organellar enzyme was preincubated in the presence of other reductants such as glutathione or ascorbate. Acifluorfen-methyl caused only 20 % inhibition if the enzyme was preincubated in buffer without reductants. Incubation of barley etioplast extracts with the earlier tetrapyrrole precursor coproporphyrinogen and acifluorfen-methyl resulted in the accumulation of protoporphyrinogen, which could be converted to protoporphyrin even {{in the presence of the}} herbicide by the addition of the plasma membrane <b>enriched</b> <b>fraction</b> from barley roots. These findings have implications for the toxicity of diphenyl ether herbicides, whose light induced tissue damage is apparently caused by accumulation of the photoreactive porphyrin intermediate, protoporphyrin, when the organellar protoporphyrinogen oxidase enzyme is inhibited by herbicides. Our results suggest that the protoporphyrinogen that accumulates as a result of herbicide inhibition of the organellar enzyme can be oxidized to protoporphyrin by a protoporphyrinogen oxidizing activity that is located at sites such as the plasma membrane, which is much less sensitive to inhibition by diphenylether herbicides...|$|E

However, compared with the lymphocyte fractions, small and large monocytes displayed greater antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity against human B erythrocytes. These results indicate that NK found to have activity against both tumour cells lines were larger lymphocytes, not small monocytes.

Cytogenetic analysis performed at presentation did not reveal distinctive karyotype features in metaphases arising in the blast <b>enriched</b> cell <b>fraction,</b> as compared with those obtained from the fraction containing erythroblasts and promyelocytes [...] myelocytes. These findings suggest that in the initial phase of MDS blast cells may lack distinctive cytogenetic features and may thus represent part of a clonal preleukemic proliferation.

In a previous paper we reported that the supernatant of Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125 presents an anti-biofilm activity against S. epidermidis and preliminary physico-chemical characterization of the supernatant suggested that this activity is due to a polysaccharide.

We exposed the herbaceous annual Impatiens pallida, which is native to North America, to fractionated A. petiolata extracts at four developmental stages (germination, presymbiosis growth, symbiosis formation, and symbiosis growth) by using exposure levels expected to be similar to field levels. Surprisingly, we found strong direct effects on I. pallidagermination and growth, but no indirect effects on I. pallida growth mediated by AMF. We also observed strong synergistic effects with a complete A. petiolata extract that inhibited I. pallidagermination and presymbiosis root growth more than either a glucosinolate or flavonoid <b>enriched</b> <b>fraction</b> alone. In fact, the flavonoid <b>enriched</b> <b>fraction</b> tended to stimulate germination and presymbiosis root growth. In contrast to these strong direct effects, I. pallidaplant growth during both the symbiosis formation and symbiosis growth phases was unaffected by A. petiolata extracts. We also found no inhibition of AMF colonization of roots or soils by A. petiolata extracts. We show that AMF can actually ameliorate allelopathic effects of an invasive plant, and suggest that previously observed allelopathic effects of A. petiolata may be due to direct inhibition of plant and fungal growth before symbiosis formation...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} a double {{polyethylene}} glycol (PEG) precipitation and PRIST technique IgE was detected in 3 % PEG precipitates and in the immune complex <b>enriched</b> <b>fractions</b> purified by solid-phase Clq adsorption from sera of 11 of 20 patients with Felty's syndrome. No correlation {{was found between the}} occurrence of complexed IgE and total protein content of the immune complex enriched material. IgE rheumatoid factor and anti-IgE antibody activity were detected in some of the immune complex fractions. Serum levels of complement C 3, C 4, and factor B were low in IgE immune complex positive cases. Only 4 of 20 patients with articular rheumatoid arthritis had IgE-containing immune complexes...|$|R

Arsenic {{has been associated with}} multiple harmful effects at the cellular level. Indirectly these defects could be related to impairment of the integrity of the immune system, in particular in lymphoid population. To characterize the effect of Arsenic on redox status on this population, copper smelter workers and arsenic unexposed donors were recruited for this study.

40|$|In {{the present}} study three {{techniques}} for obtaining outer membrane <b>enriched</b> <b>fractions</b> from Yersinia pestis were evaluated. The techniques analysed were: differential solubilization of the cytoplasmic membrane with Sarkosyl or Triton X- 100, and centrifugation in sucrose density gradients. The sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of outer membrane isolated by the different methods resulted in similar protein patterns. The measurement of NADH-dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase (inner membrane enzymes) indicated that the outer membrane preparations obtained by the three methods were pure enough for analytical studies. In addition, preliminary evidences on the potential use of outer membrane proteins for the identification of geographic variants of Y. pestis wild isolates are presented...|$|R
