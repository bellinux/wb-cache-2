50|$|A three-surface {{aircraft}} {{or sometimes}} three-lifting-surface aircraft has a foreplane, a central wing and a tailplane. The central wing surface always provides lift {{and is usually}} the largest, while {{the functions of the}} <b>fore</b> and aft <b>planes</b> may vary between types and may include lift, control and/or stability.|$|R
50|$|The {{jointer plane}} (also {{known as the}} try plane or trying plane) {{is a type of}} hand plane used {{primarily}} to straighten the edges of boards in the operation known as jointing. A jointer plane may also be used to flatten the face of a board. Its long length is designed to 'ride over' the undulations of an uneven surface, skimming off the peaks, gradually creating a flat surface. In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the jointer plane is usually preceded by the <b>fore</b> <b>plane</b> or jack plane and followed by the smoothing plane.|$|E

Hoff is seated in his {{aircraft}} at center and has both hands on a steering wheel in front of him. He is wearing a dark, long-sleeved shirt and a hard helmet. There is a ring on his finger at left. The canvas-covered upper wing of the airplane is visible behind and above the pilot's head, and a canard <b>fore</b> <b>plane</b> is visible in front of him. There is a man leaning on the plane at left and another man in a suit standing behind the plane at right. Photoprint reads: "He placed 2 nd or 3 rd in every event he entered"...|$|E

It is a biplane with a biplanar tail and a canard <b>fore</b> <b>plane.</b> There {{is no real}} fuselage, and the aircraft is held together with wooden beams. A large crowd is gathered and is seated in bleachers at right. There is an American flag hanging {{at the top of}} the grandstands. A small group of people is standing around at table in the foreground at right.; "Following the Reims International Air Meet of 1909 (France) enthusiasm for aviation began to increase in the United States. At an aviation meet in St. Louis fellow enthusiasts discussed the possibility of holding an air meet in Los Angeles. This group, which included Charles Willard, Roy Knabenshue, and Glenn Curtiss, followed through on the proposed project and sent Dick Ferris to Los Angeles to make the preliminary contacts and finalize the plans for the proposed Air Meet. After arriving in Los Angeles Ferris met with various contacts and an International Air Meet was proposed which would include Louis Paulhan-a renowned French aviator. The location was selected, Dominguez Field, which was part of one of the original Spanish land grants-The Rancho San Pedro. Publicity was begun, grandstands were erected and an expanded passenger platform was constructed at the Pacific Electric Station located closest to the Air Meet site to accommodate the large number of spectators expected to attend the event. Dates for the Air Meet were agreed upon. Commencing on January 10 th, 1910 and lasting ten days until January 20 th the air meet would invite a variety of participants and would include not only aeroplanes but also hot air balloons and dirigibles. Cash prizes would be awarded to those participating in scheduled events, which would include altitude, speed, and endurance competitions. " [...] Peter Bergen (part 1 of 2).; "Over the ten-day period of the air meet spectators were thrilled by the performances of aviators Louis Paulhan, Glenn Curtiss, Charles Willard, and others. Paulhan was the 'star attraction' at the air meet. Invited by the organizers to participate, Paulhan brought with him to the event two Bleriot Monoplanes, Two Farman Biplanes, and an entourage, which included his wife and black poodle dog. At the air meet he set a new altitude record (4164 ft.), endurance record (64 miles in 1 hr. 49 mins. 40 secs.), and won $ 14, 000 in prize money. Glenn Curtiss won two events-fastest speeds with a passenger (55 mph) and quickest start (6 2 / 5 secs. covering 98 ft.). Curtiss took home $ 6500 in prize money. Charles Willard was credited with the most accurate take off and landing skills for which he receive a prize totaling $ 250. Attendance at the air meet reached and surpassed all expectations. During the ten-day period of the air meet an estimated 226, 000 spectators converged on Dominguez Field. Gate receipts for the event equaled over $ 137, 500. The air meet was considered a phenomenal success and helped to alleviate a perceived economic drought in the Los Angeles area. " [...] Peter Bergen (part 2 of 2) ...|$|E
5000|$|But canard {{behaviour}} was {{not properly}} understood and other European pioneers—among them, Louis Blériot—were establishing the tailplane as the {{safer and more}} [...] "conventional" [...] design. Some, including the Wrights, experimented with both <b>fore</b> and aft <b>planes</b> on the same aircraft, {{now known as the}} three surface configuration.|$|R
50|$|Delfino was {{a single}} hull design, powered by a 65 hp Savigliano {{electric}} motor driving a single screw, giving a surface speed of 6 knots and a submerged speed of 5 knots, {{with a range of}} 24 nautical miles cruising at 2 knots.. She was controlled by vertical rudders two aft and unusually one forward) and horizontal <b>planes</b> <b>fore</b> and aft. She also had two vertical axis propellers to power vertical movement underwater, but these proved to give little advantage. She was armed with one 350mm torpedo tube and had a complement of 8 crewmen.|$|R
500|$|Her hull {{was divided}} into nine {{compartments}} and she was fitted with five internal trim tanks, an internal central ballast tank and three external ballast tanks. She had a test depth of [...] Mariotte had two rudders, one above the waterline for submerged use and the other below the waterline for regular use. She had two sets of diving <b>planes,</b> <b>fore</b> and aft, to control her depth below the water. The boat was evaluated in 1914 and the commission {{felt that she was}} generally successful except for her surface speed and range. It noted that she had problems with a following sea as the superstructure rapidly filled with water, but drained slowly so that she was much heavier by the bow and would tend to wallow. It also felt that she was insufficiently buoyant and had mediocre stability on the surface.|$|R
5000|$|In a statically stable {{aircraft}} {{of conventional}} (tail in rear) configuration, the tailplane force may act {{upward or downward}} depending on the design and the flight conditions. In a typical canard aircraft both <b>fore</b> and aft <b>planes</b> are lifting surfaces. The fundamental requirement for static stability is that the aft surface must have greater authority (leverage) in restoring a disturbance than the forward surface has in exacerbating it. This leverage {{is a product of}} moment arm from the center of mass and surface area. Correctly balanced in this way, the partial derivative of pitching moment with respect to changes in angle of attack will be negative: a momentary pitch up to a larger angle of attack makes the resultant pitching moment tend to pitch the aircraft back down. (Here, pitch is used casually for the angle between the nose and the direction of the airflow; angle of attack.) This is the [...] "stability derivative" [...] d(M)/d(alpha), described below.|$|R
