5|$|Endemic to Africa, the bohor reedbuck is {{native to}} Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Togo. The animal is {{possibly}} extinct in Ivory Coast and Uganda. Formerly widespread in western, central and eastern Africa, its present range extends from Senegal {{in the west to}} Ethiopia in the east. Among the three reedbuck species, bohor reedbuck is the most widespread in Tanzania. Its status in Burundi, Eritrea, Ghana and Togo is uncertain, while it is rare <b>in</b> <b>Niger</b> and Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Nigersaurus {{is known}} from the Elrhaz Formation of the Tegama Group in an area called Gadoufaoua, located <b>in</b> <b>Niger.</b> It {{is one of the}} most {{commonly}} found vertebrates in the formation. The Elrhaz Formation consists mainly of fluvial sandstones with low relief, much of which is obscured by sand dunes. The sediments are coarse- to medium-grained, with almost no fine-grained horizons. Nigersaurus lived in what is now Niger about 115 to 105 million years ago, during the Aptian and Albian ages of the mid-Cretaceous. It likely lived in habitats dominated by inland floodplains (a riparian zone).|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{is considered}} to be very aggressive and has frequently been reported as charging and attacking boats. Small boats can be capsized by hippos and passengers can be injured or killed by the animals or drown. In one case <b>in</b> <b>Niger,</b> a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed. As hippopotamuses will often engage in raiding nearby crops if the opportunity arises, humans may also come in conflict with them on these occasions, with potential for fatalities on both sides.|$|E

40|$|Poor community-company {{relations}} <b>in</b> the <b>Niger</b> Delta {{have drawn}} {{attention to the}} practice of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the region. Since the 1960 s, transnational oil corporations operating <b>in</b> the <b>Niger</b> Delta have adopted various CSR strategies, yet community-company relations remain adversarial. This article examines community expectations of CSR and the influence of the traditional, political, and administrative systems on community expectations of CSR <b>in</b> the <b>Niger</b> Delta region. An overview of CSR, oil industry CSR practices <b>in</b> the <b>Niger</b> Delta, and the methodology used is presented. The findings show that community expectations were framed through the lens of underdevelopment and its implications for the social and economic wellbeing of the indigenes. The implications of the traditional, political, and administrative systems and the network of organizations for CSR <b>in</b> the <b>Niger</b> Delta are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Northwest African cheetah (A. j. hecki) (Hilzheimer, 1913): Also {{called the}} Saharan cheetah. Found in northwestern Africa; the IUCN {{confirms}} {{its presence in}} only four countries: Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. Small populations are known {{to exist in the}} Ahaggar and Tassili N'Ajjer National Parks (Algeria); a 2003 study estimated a population of 20 to 40 individuals in Ahaggar National Park. <b>In</b> <b>Niger,</b> cheetahs have been reported from the Aïr Mountains, Ténéré, Termit Massif, Talak and Azaouak valley. A 1993 study reported a population of 50 from Ténéré. In Benin, the cheetah still survives in Pendjari National Park and W National Park. The status is obscure in Burkina Faso, where individuals may be confined to the southeastern region. With the total world population estimated at less than 250 mature individuals, it is listed as Critically Endangered.|$|E
5|$|Today {{there are}} over 600 addax in Europe, Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve (Israel), Sabratha (Libya), Giza Zoo (Egypt), North America, Japan and Australia under captive {{breeding}} programmes. There are 1000 more in private collections and ranches in United States and the Middle East. Addax is legally protected in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria; hunting of all gazelles is forbidden in Libya and Egypt. Although enormous reserves, such as the Hoggar Mountains and Tasilli in Algeria, the Ténéré <b>in</b> <b>Niger,</b> the Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve in Chad, and the newly established Wadi Howar National Park in Sudan, cover areas where addax previously occurred, some do not keep addax at present because they lack the resources. The addax has been reintroduced in Bou-Hedma National Park (Tunisia) and Souss-Massa National Park (Morocco). Reintroductions in the wild are ongoing in Jebil National Park (Tunisia) and Grand Erg Oriental (Sahara), and another is planned in Morocco.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the attitudinal influence of political administrators toward development projects <b>in</b> the <b>Niger</b> Delta region of Nigeria. Purposefully, the study assessed the attitude of political administrators towards development projects <b>in</b> the <b>Niger</b> Delta region; the attitudinal influence behind the successive development agencies towards development projects <b>in</b> the <b>Niger</b> Delta region; and the restiveness of Niger Delta region associated with the attitude of political administrators. The researcher used descriptive and survey designs {{to carry out the}} study. The respondents were eighty (80) political analysts and economist drawn from Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross-Rivers, and Delta states. The data obtained was facilitated by administering a research questionnaire of twenty (20) items to seventy-five (75) political analysts and economists, having a response rate of 93 %. Among other things, the findings of the study revealed that there is no positive attitude of political administrators toward development projects <b>in</b> the <b>Niger</b> Delta region; there is attitudinal influence behind the successive development agencies toward development projects <b>in</b> the <b>Niger</b> Delta region; and restiveness <b>in</b> the <b>Niger</b> Delta region is associated with the attitude of political administrators. In light of this, the study concluded that there is no positive attitudinal influence of political administrators toward development projects <b>in</b> the <b>Niger</b> Delta region of Nigeria...|$|R
