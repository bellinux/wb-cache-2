5|$|Although the {{exchange}} rate stability sustained by the Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade. The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its <b>gold</b> <b>backing.</b> During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London than in the United States, signaling to market participants that the dollar was overvalued. Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin defined this problem {{now known as the}} Triffin dilemma, in which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency.|$|E

25|$|As {{head of the}} Department of the Treasury, McAdoo confronted a major {{financial}} crisis on the eve and at the outbreak of World War I, July – August 1914. During {{the last week of}} July, 1914, British and French investors began to liquidate their American securities holdings into U.S. currency. Many of these foreign investors then converted their dollars into gold, as was common practice in international monetary transactions at the time, in order to repatriate their holdings back to Europe. If they had done this, they would have depleted the <b>gold</b> <b>backing</b> for the dollar, possibly inducing a depression in American financial markets and in the American economy as a whole. They might then have been able to buy American goods and raw materials (for their war effort) at greatly depressed prices, which the Americans would have had to accept in order to restart the economy from a consciously (albeit inadvertently) caused depression.|$|E

2500|$|All {{attempts}} {{to maintain the}} peg collapsed in November 1968, and a new policy program attempted to convert the Bretton Woods system into an enforcement mechanism of floating the gold peg, which would be set by either fiat policy or by a restriction to honor foreign accounts. The collapse of the gold pool and the refusal of the pool members to trade gold with private entities—on 18 March, [...] 1968 the Congress of the United States repealed the 25% requirement of <b>gold</b> <b>backing</b> of the dollar—as well as the US pledge to suspend gold sales to governments that trade in the private markets, led {{to the expansion of}} the private markets for international gold trade, in which the price of gold rose much higher than the official dollar price.|$|E
2500|$|One {{reason why}} the Federal Reserve did not act to limit {{the decline of the}} money supply was the gold standard. At that time, the amount of credit the Federal Reserve could issue was limited by the Federal Reserve Act, which {{required}} 40% <b>gold</b> <b>backing</b> of Federal Reserve Notes issued. By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession. This credit was in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes. A [...] "promise of gold" [...] is not as good as [...] "gold in the hand", particularly when they only had enough gold to cover 40% of the Federal Reserve Notes outstanding. During the bank panics a portion of those demand notes were redeemed for Federal Reserve gold. Since the Federal Reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit, any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a greater reduction in credit. On April 5, 1933, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 making the private ownership of gold certificates, coins and bullion illegal, reducing the pressure on Federal Reserve gold.|$|E

2500|$|Breaking the {{symmetry}} of the helmet are subtle {{differences in the}} two eyebrows, and in the methods employed to fashion the cloisonné garnets. The dexter and sinister eyebrows, though at first glance identical, may have been [...] "manufactured in different ways while being intended to look essentially the same." [...] The dexter brow is approximately 5 millimeters shorter than the sinister, and contained 43 rather than 46 inlaid silver wires {{and one or two}} fewer garnets. Gilding on the dexter eyebrow was [...] "reddish in colour" [...] against the [...] "yellowish" [...] hue of the sinister, while the latter contains both trace amounts of mercury and a tin corrosion product which are absent from its counterpart. Moreover, while the individual bronze cells into which the garnets are set, both on the dexter brow and on three of the four remaining dragon eyes, are underlain by small pieces of [...] "hatched gold foil," [...] those on the sinister side, and the sinister eye of the upper dragon head, have no such backing. The <b>gold</b> <b>backing</b> served to reflect light back through the garnets, increasing their lustre and deepening their colour.

2500|$|..... he {{proximate}} {{cause of the}} world depression was a structurally flawed and poorly managed international gold standard. ... For a variety of reasons, including a desire of the Federal Reserve to curb the US stock market boom, monetary policy in several major countries turned contractionary in the late 1920s—a contraction that was transmitted worldwide by the gold standard. What was initially a mild deflationary process began to snowball when the banking and currency crises of 1931 instigated an international [...] "scramble for gold". Sterilization of gold inflows by surplus countries , substitution of gold for foreign exchange reserves, and runs on commercial banks all led to increases in the <b>gold</b> <b>backing</b> of money, and consequently to sharp unintended declines in national money supplies. Monetary contractions in turn were strongly associated with falling prices, output and employment. Effective international cooperation could in principle have permitted a worldwide monetary expansion despite gold standard constraints, but disputes over World War I reparations and war debts, and the insularity and inexperience of the Federal Reserve, among other factors, prevented this outcome. As a result, individual countries were able to escape the deflationary vortex only by unilaterally abandoning the gold standard and re-establishing domestic monetary stability, a process that dragged on in a halting and uncoordinated manner until France and the other Gold Bloc countries finally left gold in 1936. —Great Depression, B.

50|$|These gold {{deposits}} {{would become}} known as Federal Reserve Deposits and quickly lost their 100% <b>gold</b> <b>backing.</b> During the Fed's inception, the Fed needed only to back gold deposits by 35%. This created a very dangerous situation because if more than 35% of banks demanded their Federal Reserve Deposits as gold, then the Fed would be insolvent. Such a crisis did happen in 1933 and Federal Reserve Deposits (as well as Federal Reserve Notes) lost their <b>gold</b> <b>backing.</b> Foreign governments were still allowed {{to be on the}} gold standard and their Federal Reserve Deposits were still redeemable in gold. But these too were only fractionally backed. This inevitably led to another gold run in 1971, led by heavy withdrawals by Switzerland (51 million) and France (191 million). Nixon chose instead of heavily devaluing the dollar against gold, to simply remove the US from the international gold standard.|$|E
50|$|The gold {{standard}} is a monetary {{system in which}} a region's common media of exchange are paper notes that are normally freely convertible into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold.

The currency itself has no innate value, but is accepted by traders {{because it can be}} redeemed for the equivalent specie.

50|$|The main {{rationale}} behind {{the order was}} actually to remove the constraint on the Federal Reserve which prevented it from increasing the money supply during the depression; the Federal Reserve Act (1913) required 40% <b>gold</b> <b>backing</b> of Federal Reserve Notes issued.

This process is well documented in English history as far back as prior to the founding of the Bank of England and before that in the Netherlands. The process works well with or without a central bank and with or without <b>gold</b> <b>backing.</b> The details are also manipulated from time to time as needed to satisfy popular rage or apathy.|$|E
50|$|The film {{argues that}} the Federal Reserve System manipulates what is {{sometimes}} referred to as the business cycle of economic expansion and retraction by putting new notes into circulation to increase the ease of obtaining credit, which devalues the currency, then compounds inflation by increasing interest (prime) rates. The movie argues that this manipulation is responsible for a 96% devaluation of American currency, since it was made possible to increasingly sever the link with <b>gold</b> <b>backing</b> by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The film says that this process of creating new money and adding it to the money supply is known as debasement and is a cause of inflation. In this way, the film concludes that the Federal Reserve System simultaneously controls the supply of money and its value.|$|E
