40|$|In {{studies of}} crystal {{formation}} by the generation and spreading of layers, <b>equidistant</b> <b>step</b> trains are considered unstable [...] -bunches and other spatiotemporal {{patterns of the}} growth steps are viewed as ubiquitous. We provide an example to the opposite. We monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of steps and the resulting step patterns during crystallization of the proteins ferritin and apoferritin using the atomic force microscope. The variations in step velocity and density are not correlated, indicating {{the lack of a}} long-range attraction between the steps. We show that (i) because of its coupling to bulk transport, nucleation of new layers is chaotic and occurs at the facet edges, where the interfacial supersaturation is higher; (ii) step bunches self-organize via the competition for supply from the solution; and, (iii) bunches of weakly interacting steps decay as they move along the face. Tests by numerical modeling support the conclusions about the mechanisms underlying our observations. The results from these systems suggest that during crystallization controlled by transport, with weakly or noninteracting growth steps, the stable kinetic state of the surface is an <b>equidistant</b> <b>step</b> train, and step bunches only arise during nucleation of new layers. Since nucleation only occurs at a few sites on the surface, the surface morphology may be controllably patterned or smoothened by locally controlling nucleation...|$|E
40|$|In situ {{high-resolution}} interferometry on horizontal {{facets of}} the protein lysozyme reveal that the local growth rate R, vicinal slope p, and tangential (step) velocity v fluctuate by up to 80 % of their average values. The time scale of these fluctuations, which occur under steady bulk transport conditions through the formation and decay of step bunches (macrosteps), is {{of the order of}} 10 min. The fluctuation amplitude of R increases with growth rate (supersaturation) and crystal size, while the amplitude of the v and p fluctuations changes relatively little. Based on a stability analysis for <b>equidistant</b> <b>step</b> trains in the mixed transport-interface-kinetics regime, we argue that the fluctuations originate from the coupling of bulk transport with nonlinear interface kinetics. Furthermore, step bunches moving across the interface in the direction of or opposite to the buoyancy-driven convective flow increase or decrease in height, respectively. This is in agreement with analytical treatments of the interaction of moving steps with solution flow. Major excursions in growth rate are associated with the formation of lattice defects (striations). We show that, in general, the system-dependent kinetic Peclet number, Pe(sub k), i. e., the relative weight of bulk transport and interface kinetics in the control of the growth process, governs the step bunching dynamics. Since Pe(sub k) can be modified by either forced solution flow or suppression of buoyancy-driven convection under reduced gravity, this model provides a rationale for the choice of specific transport conditions to minimize the formation of compositional inhomogeneities under steady bulk nutrient crystallization conditions...|$|E
40|$|Step {{bunching}} {{results in}} striations even at relatively {{early stages of}} its development and in inclusions of mother liquor at the later stages. Therefore, eliminating step bunching is crucial for high crystal perfection. At least 5 major effects causing and influencing step bunching are known: (1) Basic morphological instability of stepped interfaces. It is caused by concentration gradient in the solution normal to the face and by the redistribution of solute tangentially to the interface which redistribution enhances occasional perturbations in step density due to various types of noise; (2) Aggravation of the above basic instability by solution flowing tangentially to the face in the same directions as the steps or stabilization of <b>equidistant</b> <b>step</b> train if these flows are antiparallel; (3) Enhanced bunching at supersaturation where step velocity v increases with relative supersaturation s much faster than linear. This v(s) dependence {{is believed to be}} associated with impurities. The impurities of which adsorption time is comparable with the time needed to deposit one lattice layer may also be responsible for bunching; (4) Very intensive solution flow stabilizes growing interface even at parallel solution and step flows; (5) Macrosteps were observed to nucleate at crystal corners and edges. Numerical simulation, assuming step-step interactions via surface diffusion also show that step bunching may be induced by random step nucleation at the facet edge and by discontinuity in the step density (a ridge) somewhere {{in the middle of a}} face. The corresponding bunching patterns produce the ones observed in experiment. The nature of step bunching generated at the corners and edges and by dislocation step sources, as well as the also relative importance and interrelations between mechanisms 1 - 5 is not clear, both from experimental and theoretical standpoints. Furthermore, several laws controlling the evolution of existing step bunches have been suggested, though unambiguous conclusions are still missing. Addressing these issues is the major goal of the present project. The theory addressing the above problem, experimental methods, several figures which include: (1) the spatial wave numbers at which the system is neutrally stable as a function of growth velocity for linear kinetics and supersaturation for nonlinear kinetics; (2) a schematic of the experiment of lysozyme crystal growing under conditions of natural convection; (3) fluctuations in time, t, of the normal growth rate, R(t), vicinal slope, p(t) and Fourier Spectra of R(t), discussions and conclusions are presented...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} pioneer works of Bekenstein and Hawking, black hole entropy {{has been known}} to have a quantum origin. Furthermore, it has long been argued by Bekenstein that entropy should be {{quantized}} in discrete (<b>equidistant)</b> <b>steps</b> given its identification with horizon area in (semi-) classical general relativity and the properties of area as an adiabatic invariant. This lead to the suggestion that black hole area should also be quantized in <b>equidistant</b> <b>steps</b> to account for the discrete black hole entropy. Here we shall show that loop quantum gravity, in which area is not quantized in <b>equidistant</b> <b>steps</b> can nevertheless be consistent with Bekenstein's equidistant entropy proposal in a subtle way. For that we perform a detailed analysis of the number of microstates compatible with a given area and show consistency with the Bekenstein framework when an oscillatory behavior in the entropy-area relation is properly interpreted.

40|$|The step model {{introduced}} by Burton, Cabrera and Frank {{is known to}} give a good description of the surface processes, when growth spirals are available {{as a consequence of}} screw dislocations. Their model is based on an infinite sequence of equidistant steps. In {{the first part of the}} research presented in this thesis, some understanding has been gained into the role of steps by means of computed simulations. The step model has been generalized to allow for nonequidistant steps. The behaviour of a train of steps with large deviations from their equidistant positions has been studied systematically by introducing the normal modes of vibrations which can occur in a step train. The general results agree with the stability theory derived for small deviations. On the other hand, the time which is needed for steps to coincide is much larger than the stability theory predicts. During a perturbation the local flux of steps can be reduced considerably. However, the difference between the mean growth rate of a randomly distributed and an <b>equidistant</b> <b>step</b> train is very small, when no piling up effects are present. A stepped surface has also been studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. A comparison between these results and the results based on the extended step model of Burton, Cabrera and Frank shows good agreement between both models. In order to include the effects of volume diffusion into the simulations of the extended step model of Burton, Cabrera and Frank, a concentration gradient along a step train of 150 steps has been introduced. It appears that only when there is a sharp change in the concentration gradient, coincidences of steps develop which can in turn finally lead to the formation of macro-steps. In the second part of this thesis, investigations on the rate of mass transfer in the fluid phase in crystal growth processes are presented. The influence of volume diffusion on the form of theoretical growth rate equations has been studied, taking two models of combined volume and surface diffusion into consideration. It appears that the model putting volume and surface diffusion in series is a good approximation for most cases of crystal growth from solution. Thereafter the methods of quantifying the effect of volume diffusion on the growth process have been studied. One of these methods has been developed experimentally using a rotating disc system. This system is especially appropriate for measuring growth and dissolution kinetics because of the associated uniform boundary layer thickness. Further attention has been paid to the problems of fitting theoretical equations to experimental growth data. Finally the influence of the hydrodynamic environment on the growth phenomena of large potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystals has been investigated. It has been shown from flow visualisation experiments that veils of liquid inclusions in these crystals are not a result of starvation in the laminar boundary layer, but of depletion in the stable eddies formed at the rear (downstream) faces of the crystals.

40|$|Psychoacoustic {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} for schizophrenic patients with auditory hallucinations in their case history and for reference subjects. The aim of the thesis has been to assess {{differences between the two}} groups of subjects. The experiments consisted of tests on perceptual grouping mechanisms measuring how sound with high and low pitches is separated into perceptual streams (Study I), how sound, interrupted by noise, is restored into a meaningful percept (Study II), and how localisation of components of sound is influenced by frequency spectrum and amplitude (contralateral induction,Study III). In one study (Study IV) eight click-sounds were used in an illusion test, normally perceived as a train of events with <b>equidistant</b> <b>steps</b> from left to right. The last study (Study V) concerned the influence of pre-test learning on streaming appearing by pitch and amplitude. The schizophrenic patients reported fewer and aberrant experiences of streaming and restoration as compared to reference subjects. They were more directed by frequency content than the reference subjects in the contralateral induction experiment. In the directional illusion test, they did not, as the reference subjects, perceive the stimulus as passing in <b>equidistant</b> <b>steps,</b> but as being directed towards the right position. Learning was found to normalize the perception of streaming for the chronic, but not for the more acutely ill schizophrenics. The results are discussed in relation to the psychoacoustic mechanisms involved and with reference to symptoms and neuropathophysiology in schizophrenia. It is concluded that schizophrenics form aberrant streams and utilize restoration to a lesser extent. Their localization perception is also aberrant. Pre-test learning exerts an ameliorating effect on perception of streaming for schizophrenics. Intraindividual variation is great among them, with patchy patterns of deficient function of various psychoacoustic systems.

The analysis of the amplitudes of the state at half the step time with the elements of this set (the anticipation amplitudes) shows, that for randomly chosen states measurements of the state at half-step time reveal information about the states at full step time, anticipating future states and reflecting past states with significant probability. For fixed N and p to infinity, the probability to measure a state which is N steps apart in future or past exceeds a constant lower bound.

40|$|Abstract. Planar {{laminography}} is {{a method}} to obtain spatial information for objects whose geometrical dimensions disallow measurements with classical computed tomography. In coplanar translational laminography, the radiation source is moved relatively to the object and/or to the detector in a plane parallel to the detector plane. A 3 D-image of the studied object can be reconstructed from the measured projections by filtered backprojection. Classical rotational tomographic scans include projections from all sides of an object from equidistant angles. In contrast, laminography is restricted by several distinct geometric limitations. This results {{in a number of}} artifacts interfering in the reconstructed image with real object structures. Projections obtained from different positions are not equally weighted because of the changing distance between radiation source and detector and due to different angles of incidence. A motion of the source in <b>equidistant</b> <b>steps</b> results in non <b>equidistant</b> angular <b>steps</b> which also influence the results. Especially, overshoots close to the boundaries of death angle zones disturb the resulting image of the object. The influences of the different geometric effects on the results of a reconstruction process are discussed here. Several correction approaches to reduce the resulting artifacts are presented. These methods include several angular corrections applied at different steps in the filtering and reconstruction process. A number of artificial phenomena can be reduced considerably with these methods. SNR analysis is used for optimization of 3 D-image quality 1...|$|R

In Exp. 1, we studied adaptation processes that occur during such a dose-response study in meal-fed pigs, and in Exp. 2, we studied the accuracy of this simplified technique to estimate changes in Lys requirement estimates of pigs following changes in energy intake. In Exp. 1, {{the effect of the}} Lys supply strategy on the Lys requirement was assessed in 14 barrows fed an increasing [low to high (LH) ] or decreasing [high to low (HL) ] total Lys supply, with total Lys levels varying from 0. 36 to 1. 06 g/MJ DE in 7 <b>equidistant</b> <b>steps</b> of 4 d each. Urinary urea and ammonia excretion and whole body N turnover were measured. In Exp. 2, the accuracy of the dose-response technique to determine a shift in Lys requirement was assessed in 20 barrows fed at either 2. 2 [low energy (LE) ] or 2. 7 [high energy (HE) ] times the energy requirements for maintenance, with total Lys supply decreasing from 1. 10 to 0. 37 g Lys/MJ DE in 9 <b>equidistant</b> <b>steps</b> of 3 d each. In Exp. 1, a lower increment in protein synthesis, breakdown, and whole body N turnover with increasing dietary Lys supply was observed in LH pigs than HL pigs (P < 0. 01) and the estimated Lys requirement was 0. 06 g/MJ DE greater (P = 0. 01) in LH pigs than HL pigs.

The key idea of our model (J. S. & M. L.) is that the low-lying excitations form a sequence of rotational bands, i. e., for each such band the excitation energies depend quadratically on the total spin quantum number. For temperatures below 50 mK we predict that the magnetisation is described by a staircase with 75 <b>equidistant</b> <b>steps</b> as the magnetic field is increased up to a critical value and saturated for higher fields. For higher temperatures thermal broadening effects wash out the staircase and yield a linear ramp below the critical field, {{and this has been}} confirmed by our measurements (R. M.).

40|$|Abstract Common {{concepts}} for autonomous on-board navigation systems rely on {{the numerical}} integration of a spacecraft trajectory between subsequent measurements of a navigation sensor such as GPS. In combination with a Kalman filter, a predicted state vector becomes available at discrete, but not necessarily <b>equidistant</b> time <b>steps.</b> When used for real-time attitude control or geo-coding of image data, the on-board navigation system has to provide continuous dense output at <b>equidistant</b> time <b>steps,</b> which usually conflicts with the natural stepsize of the relevant integration methods and the non-equidistant measurement times. To cope with this problem, the integrator has to be supplemented by an interpolation scheme of compatible order and accuracy. After presenting a representative formulation of an on-board navigation system and deriving related timing and accuracy requirements, suitable Runge–Kutta methods and associated interpolants are selected and evaluated. Promising results are obtained for the classical RK 4 method in combination with Richardson extrapolation and 5 th-order Hermite interpolation. The 5 th-order Fehlberg method with interpolation due to Enright and, for drag-free scenarios, the 5 th-order Runge–Kutta–Nystrom method with 5 th-order Hermite interpolation provide a good performance in terms of position interpolation. However, as both methods exhibit significant errors for the velocity interpolation, they are not recommended for use with the outlined navigation filter. 2001 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SA...|$|R
40|$|Imagine a {{sequence}} of <b>equidistant</b> <b>steps</b> {{parallel to one another}} on a crystal face growing from solution. Steps may be one or part of a lattice spacing high. With such ideal morphology, the most perfect material is expected to be produced. Sometimes this happens. Much more often, however, steps form bunches, acquire wavy shapes and interlace. With time, these spontaneous perturbations may be increased in amplitude, i. e. the stepped surface becomes morphologically unstable. Interferometric studies of Y. G. Kuznetsov, L. N. Rashkovich, P. G. Vekilov and N. A. Booth and the author demonstrated that the step bunching depends at least on direction and rate of solution flow over the interface, supersaturation and presence of impurities. In particular, if solution and step flow are parallel to one another, the steps convene into bunches. If these flows are antiparallel, the bunches disappear. As the step train propagates, the overall bunch height often increases infinitely. However, we have found recently that if the flow rate is large enough, (approximately 1 meter per second), the bunch height may be limited. All these phenomena come from interaction between steps. The interaction mechanisms are still not fully understood.

Usage of the zones depends on aspects of performance {{as well as}} on melodic context. The central pitches and pitch zones corresponding to musical scale steps can be determined from frequency histograms. This approach, however, is generally not applicable in the case of floating tonality, i. e., if the pitch of the reference tone (e. g., pitch of the tonic) is slightly altered in the course of performance. Background in ethnomusicology. Archaic traditional solo singing features pre-diatonic scales which deviate from equal temperament. For instance, Alexeyev classifies embryonic scales of solo singing into three groups based on (a) contrast of voice registers and timbre (alpha-type), (b) gliding pitches (beta-type), and (c) made of approximately <b>equidistant</b> <b>steps</b> (gamma-type). Similar conceptions are also well known from early comparative musicology studies. There have been many acoustical investigations of musical scales; however, scales of archaic traditional solo singing, characterized by wide zones of intonation as well as somewhat floating tonality, have not yet been thoroughly studied. Aims. This paper aims (1) to develop mathematical-statistical models based on regularities of scale perception (categorical perception and neglect of floating tonality) to quantitatively describe of an insider's emic musical scale; and (2) to study, by means of the models, the regularities of musical scales in one idiolect. Method. Three mathematical-statistical models based on different assumptions of the nature of floating tonality were developed. Pitches of tones in songs belonging to one idiolect of Lithuanian traditional male solo singing were measured and reevaluated by means of the models. Results and conclusions.

The amount of apparent ileal digestible Lys in the diet decreased stepwise from 1. 74 to 0. 5 g/MJ DE in 8 <b>equidistant</b> <b>steps</b> of 3 d each. From 48 -h urinary nitrogen excretion, the optimal Lys to energy ratio was estimated for each pig using a linear-plateau model. Feces were collected quantitatively over 27 d to determine apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients. The DE to ADG ratio, but not DE intake and ADG, tended (P < 0. 1) to be 4 % lower in the high-starch group than in the high-fat group. The ATTD of energy and CP tended (P < 0. 1) to be lower (0. 8 % and 0. 9 % units, respectively) at the high DE level. The ATTD of energy was 2. 2 % units greater (P < 0. 001) for pigs fed the high-starch diet, but the ATTD of CP was not affected by ES. Estimates for the intercept (21. 2 % to 22. 8 %), slope (57. 4 to 59. 6), transition point (0. 84 to 0. 86 g Lys/MJ DE), and plateau (70. 6 % to 72. 3 %) of the linear-plateau Lys titration curves were not affected by the dietary treatments. In conclusion, ES does not affect Lys requirements in growing pigs regardless the level of DE intake...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a sequential approach for {{the solution of}} an elliptic-hyperbolic system of partial differential equations, which models a flow of two incompressible phases in porous media. The elliptic equation describes the pressure distribution in the domain, and the hyperbolic equation is the mass conservation equation {{for one of the}} phases. We propose to estimate an optimal number of the pressure updates using an analytical solution to a special 1 D initial boundary value problem (IBVP) for the coupled system. We provide two procedures aimed at the estimation of an optimal set of time steps, and show that the resulting distribution of time steps yields better results than using <b>equidistant</b> time <b>steps.</b> We also show that the degree of coupling of the 1 D IBVP can be quantitatively estimated using a normalized difference of the exact solution and its sequential approximation with a single time step...|$|R

Measurements were performed at photon energies of 45 and 48  keV. 1, 441 projections with <b>equidistant</b> angular <b>steps</b> over 360 ° with asymmetric rotation axis were acquired. Because of the parallel beam, one can combine the two related projections [42] to reconstruct the data with a standard filtered back-projection algorithm as the data recorded with the symmetric rotation axis. Pixel sizes of 3.3 and 4.6  μm, respectively, were chosen. The radiographs were binned {{by a factor of}} two before reconstruction to improve the photon statistics and thereby the contrast [43]. The spatial resolution of the entire experimental setup was determined by the 10 % value of the modulation transfer function of a radiograph from a highly X-ray absorbing edge [44]. It corresponded to 4.2 and 6.2  μm, respectively.|$|R
40|$|We {{carry out}} Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{and study the}} dependence of the behaviors of steps on impurities on a vicinal face. We assume that the impurities are immobile and the lifetime of them is much longer than that of adatoms. During growth, the impurities {{in front of a}} step prevent the step from advancing. If a wide terrace appears due to the fluctuations of step positions, the number of impurities on the terrace is more than other terraces. The step at the upper side of the wide terrace is slower than other steps, so that an <b>equidistant</b> train of <b>steps</b> becomes unstable. In our Monte Carlo simulations, with steps gathering and separating repeatedly, the bunches of steps are formed on the unstable surface. © 2011 American Physical Society...|$|R
40|$|For the {{self-test}} of semiconductor gas sensors, we combine two multi-signal processes: temperature-cycled operation (TCO) {{and electrical}} impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This combination {{allows one to}} discriminate between irreversible changes of the sensor, i. e., changes caused by poisoning, as well as changes in the gas atmosphere. To integrate EIS and TCO, impedance spectra should be acquired {{in a very short}} time period, in which the sensor can be considered time invariant, i. e., milliseconds or less. For this purpose we developed a Fourier-based high-speed, low-cost impedance spectroscope. It provides a binary excitation signal through an FPGA (field programable gate array), which also acquires the data. To determine impedance spectra, it uses the ETFE (empirical transfer function estimate) method, which calculates the impedance by evaluating the Fourier transformations of current and voltage. With this approach an impedance spectrum over the range from 61 kHz to 100 MHz is acquired in ca. 16 μs. We carried out TCO–EIS measurements with this spectroscope and a commercial impedance analyzer (Agilent 4294 A), with a temperature cycle consisting of six <b>equidistant</b> temperature <b>steps</b> between 200 and 450 °C, with lengths of 30 s (200 °C) and 18 s (all others). Discrimination of carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH 4) is possible by LDA (linear discriminant analysis) using either TCO or EIS data, thus enabling a validation of results by comparison of both methods...|$|R

Probab. 43, 2 (2015), 468 [...] 527] that there exists a system of stochastic differential equations (SDE) on the time interval [0,T] with infinitely often differentiable and bounded coefficients such that the Euler scheme with <b>equidistant</b> time <b>steps</b> converges to the solution of this SDE at the final time in the strong sense but with no polynomial rate. Even worse, in [Jentzen, A., Müller-Gronbach, T., and Yaroslavtseva, L. On stochastic differential equations with arbitrary slow convergence rates for strong approximation, Commun. Math.

In the present article we generalize the latter result to the case when the approximations may choose the location as well as the number of the evaluation sites of the driving Brownian motion in an adaptive way dependent on the values of the Brownian motion observed so far...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand of}} small size {{electronic}} systems {{has been increasing}} for several decades. The physical size of systems is reduced due to advancements in integrated circuits. With reduction in size of electronic systems, {{there is also an}} increasing demand of small and low cost antennas. Patch antennas {{are one of the most}} attractive antennas for integrated RF front end systems due to their compatibility with microwave integrated circuits. To fulfil the demand of integrated RF front end systems, a design of microstrip patch antenna with optimum performance at 70 GHz is investigated. The procedure could be extended to design other planar antennas that act in a similar way. In this work, three different design methods to design patch antennas for applications at 70 GHz are investigated that include use of analytical models, numerical optimization, and numerical variation of dimensions. Analytical models provide a basic understanding of the operation of a patch antenna and they also provide approximate dimensions of a patch antenna for a targeted frequency without using numerical simulations. However, as the operating frequencies of RF systems reach mm-wave frequencies, we expect that the accuracy of analytical models become less accurate. For example, the excitation of substrate modes and effect of ground size are not predicted in simple analytical models. Due to these expected limitations of the analytical design methods, the accuracy of these models is investigated by numerical electromagnetic field simulations. In this work, CST Microwave Studio Transient Solver is used for that purpose. In order to make sure that the appropriate settings of the solver are applied, the simulation settings such as mesh density, boundary conditions and the port dimensions are investigated. The simulation settings may affect computation time and convergence of the results. Here, in this work, the accuracy of the simulator for a specific design of inset feed rectangular patch antenna is verified. The patch dimensions obtained from analytical calculations are optimized at 70 GHz by using the optimizer of the transient solver. The patch dimensions obtained from optimizer are verified by varying the patch dimensions in <b>equidistant</b> <b>steps</b> around the found result of the optimizer. In a rectangular microstrip patch antenna design, the use of a width of 1. 5 times the length is an approximate rule of thumb [1] for low dielectric constant substrates. It is also investigated how the performance properties of a microstrip patch antenna are affected by varying the width to length ratio of the patch. There are occasions where a different ratio is required because of space limitations, or to change the input impedance. The patch designs having various width to length ratios were optimized with the feed location. The analytically calculated dimensions provided good initial values of the rectangular patch antenna for further optimization using more accurate techniques. The design have been optimized at 70 GHz for the investigated mesh density, boundary conditions and the port dimensions. The numerical variation of dimensions is found to be most reliable among the investigated design methods but it is more complicated with many parameters...|$|R
40|$|The last {{deglaciation}} (21 - 9 kyr BP), which {{marked the}} transition between the last glacial and present interglacial period, was punctuated {{by a series}} of rapid (centennial and decadal) climate changes. Numerical climate models are useful for investigating mechanisms that underpin these events, especially now that – due to availability of increased computational power – some of the complex models can be run over the period of multiple millennia. In phase 1 of the Palmod project, we aim to perform transient simulations of the last deglaciation in order to quantify contributions of different climatic factors using complementary models and coupling strategies, including a setup in which the climate models are fully coupled to land-ice sheet models. In a 2 nd phase also the full interaction with biogeochemical cycles is envisaged. Within PalMod continuous time series of the three greenhouse gases CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O have now been constructed, based on a state-of-the-art compilation of available ice core data, which have been carefully selected, partially corrected and spline-smoothed to an <b>equidistant</b> time <b>step</b> of 1 year. The full data sets, including uncertainty estimates, are covering the last 156 kyr and are supported by instrumental measurements until the year 2016 CE. These data might be used for the deglaciation and other PMIP 4 related experiments covering parts of the last 150 kyr, We suggest that other PMIP participants use the same GHG data sets to force their models, which might then facilitate the intercomparisons.
