40|$|The {{imaging and}} <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> <b>industry</b> {{is one of}} the higher GDP (Gross Domestic Product) {{generating}} industries in the UK. Generally, the quality of imaging and <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> products depends on the properties of the imaging fluids, which are, in turn, determined by the physico-chemical interactions within the fluid, the imaging system and the imaging substrate. Despite the fact that the imaging and <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> <b>industry</b> has been in existence for over one hundred years, it has thus far been difficult to understand many fundamental aspects of the physico-chemical interactions involved with the imaging process. To some extent, this has hindered the development of high quality imaging fluids, especially for more challenging imaging and <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> work.

40|$|Before {{entering}} the Computer Graphic Design program at Rochester Institute of Technology, I {{had been a}} graphic designer for a good many years. The introduction of the computer drastically {{changed the nature of}} the <b>graphics</b> <b>arts</b> <b>industry,</b> and in watching the rapidly changing technology, I realized that these new developments broadened and diversified the range of design possibilities. Embracing the computer as a design tool, and as a new means of communicating, I set about selecting a thesis topic that would allow me to explore and master these new tools. In selecting a topic, I was intrigued by the ability of the computer to allow a user to interact with, and absorb information. I became interested in a multimedia approach to educational materials, and originally chose to develop a prototype for an interac tive multimedia program accompanied by a companion magazine that would challenge my skills as a designer in a new area, and develop sensitivities as an educator...|$|R
40|$|Members of the <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> <b>industries</b> {{are slowly}} {{becoming}} aware of undercolor reduction techniques used {{in the attempt to}} help stabilize high speed wet printing. Undercolor removal is a color correction method which follows this line of thought as it reduces the amount of ink coverage by the process-color inks and increases ink coverage of the black printer in the darker neutral areas of a reproduction. The advantages realized by this technique are carried even further with gray-component replacement (GCR). GCR removes the process color inks that make up a dark tone and replaces them with black ink in both neutral and color regions of a reproduction. This separation method provides technical and cost benefits to the printer. An investigation of this reproduction technique forms the basis of this research project. A comparison was made between the quality performance of gray-component replacement techniques and the traditional four-color reproduction method. It was found through visual subjective testing, while not all the tone reproduction criteria favored the traditional four-color reproduction method, color and print contrast were affected by the use of gray-component replacement...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study, {{concerned}} with the <b>graphics</b> <b>arts</b> <b>industry,</b> were to identify: (1) skills and technical knowledges needed by employees, (2) processes and types of equipment in use, (3) sources of labor, and (4) opinions of employers concerning personnel training. Data were obtained describing the industry in the Carolinas and Georgia by a postcard survey for general information and a long form for technical information. Fifty-nine company representatives were interviewed for opinions and desires in terms of manpower training. It was found that: (1) 52 percent of the companies employed fewer than 10 employees, (2) The greatest shortage of qualified workers was in the pressroom, followed by layout and design, composition and imposition, and reproduction photography, (3) The industry desired more post-high school formal trade training, and (4) School programs were desired in which students could obtain {{a broad range of}} experiences. Conclusions include: (1) Production employees should be prepared with a background in the overall reproductions processes, and (2) The disadvantages of production printing by school classes were numerous.

40|$|This thesis evaluates how {{the social}} capital {{embodied}} in social networks influences {{the performance of}} small businesses. Specifically, it assesses whether the use of social networks is beneficial or detrimental {{to the development of}} the business. It is based on the analysis of a sample of 42 Portuguese small business partnerships in the furniture and <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> <b>industries.</b> To assess the social determinants of failure and success, I sampled a population of businesses according to their perfonnance, and systematically compared their histories. The method of data collection, the narrative interview, focused on the development of businesses from their start-up in 1993 until 2000, when the data were collected. I find that the use of social ties is essential for the start-up and survival of businesses. Once this first stage of business development is overcome, however, there are two negative impacts of social networks. At the second stage of development, the dependence on social networks stifles growth. Ventures that desire to grow have to become independent from their social network, and have to rationalize production. A further negative effect arises from malfeasance within the partnership, which often condemns the business to failure. The thesis concludes that while social networks are essential in the early stages of a business, they later often become detrimental to its development, and can even be the leading cause behind a business's demise...|$|R

L’Instant Durable has created the concept of the livre-maquette (model-book) : the printed sheets to cut out are assembled in a book which includes an historic text on the monument to build. It is always translated into several languages. The authors are qualified architects and artists who use the latest reproduction techniques. All the monuments are represented at a similar scale (generally 1/250 or, more rarely, 1/500), which allows comparison between them.|$|R
40|$|The L&W Elrepho d/ 0 and the Spectrolino 45 / 0 {{instruments}} are examined using paper samples with different properties. External {{factors that influence}} the measurements such as the sample background, the instrument calibration and the sample inhomogeneity are studied, and a methodology for their minimization is presented. Experimental measurements show that such external factors, if not minimized by proper routines, affect the inter-instrument differences far more (up to 4 - 5 Delta E-ab(star)) than the instrument geometry (the effect of which is small and of order 0. 1 Delta E-ab(star)). The DORT 2002 radiative transfer model is used to simulate differences caused by instrument geometry. The simulated and measured differences are found to agree in magnitude, and the differences are mapped against sample properties. It is observed that the 45 / 0 instrument detects higher reflectance from paper samples with negligible absorption and transmittance. When there is considerable absorption (dyed samples) or transmittance (thin samples), the d/ 0 instrument detects higher reflectance. The physical mechanism behind this behavior is studied and explained using DORT 2002, and the instrument differences are shown {{to depend on the}} anisotropy of the reflected light. The model/measurement agreement is satisfactory as the characteristic behavior is captured in almost all cases studied. This new understanding is important for facilitating accurate data exchange between the paper and <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> <b>industries,</b> but also for interpretation of reflectance measurements in general...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} developing a comprehensive picture {{of the implications of}} digital technology in the <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> <b>industries</b> in Kuwait. The purpose of the study is twofold: (1) to explore the meaning of the outcomes of recent technological change processes for the traditional prepress occupations in Kuwait; and, (2) to examine the impact of technology on Arabic layout and design. The study {{is based on the assumption}} that technological change is a chain of interactions among the sociological, cultural, political and economic variables. The prepress area in Kuwait has its own cultural, social, economic, and political structure. When a new technology is introduced it is absorbed and shaped by the existing structure. Based on such a dialectical conceptualisation, four major levels of analysis can be distinguished in this study: (1) technological change in the <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> industries; (2) the typographic evolution of the Arabic script; (3) the workers themselves as individuals and occupational collectives; and, (4) technology's impact on Arabic publication design. The methodological approach selected for this study can be defined as a dialectical, interpretive exploration. Given the historical perspective and the multiple levels of analysis, this approach calls for a variety of data gathering methods. Both qualitative and quantitative data were sought. A combination of document analysis, participant observation and interviewing allow to link the historical and current events with individual and collective actions, perceptions and interpretations of reality. The findings presented in this study contradicts the belief that the widespread adoption of new production processes is coincidental with continuous advances in scientific knowledge which provide the basis for the development of new technologies. Instead, the changes have been hindered by the lack of untrained personnel, the Arabic software incompatibility, and the lack of informed decisions to successfully implement the technology. Without any doubt, the new technology has influenced Arabic calligraphy, but this does not mean the decay of Arabic calligraphy as an art. As this study shows, the challenge is not to the art, but to the artist...|$|R
40|$|More {{and more}} print jobs are {{delivered}} from customer to printer digitally over the Internet. Although Internet-based job delivery {{can be highly}} efficient, companies in the <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> and printing <b>industry</b> often suffer unnecessary costs related {{to this type of}} inflow of print jobs to their production workflows. One of the reasons for this is the lack of a well-defined infrastructure for delivering print jobs digitally over the Internet. This thesis presents INFLOW - a prototype for a print job delivery system for the <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> and printing <b>industry.</b> INFLOW is a web-based job delivery system that is hosted on an Internet-connected server by the organization receiving the print jobs. Focus has been on creating a system that is easy to use, highly customizable, secure, and easy to integrate with existing and future systems from third-party vendors. INFLOW has been implemented using open standards, such as XML and JDF (Job Definition Format). The requirements for ease-of-use, high customizability and security are met by choosing a web-based architecture. The client side is implemented using standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript while the serverside is based on J 2 EE, Java Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP). Using a web browser as a job delivery client provides a highly customizable user interface and built in support for encrypted file transfers using HTTPS (HTTP over SSL). Process automation and easy integration with other print production systems is facilitated with CIP 4 ’s JDF (Job Definition Format).
