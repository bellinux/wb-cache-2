40|$|A {{survey in}} New York State {{revealed}} 210 medically stable technology-dependent children retained inappropriately in acute-care hospitals. They remained in hospitals {{primarily because of}} a shortage of skilled home <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> in the communities where they lived, family problems that prevented their care at home, and a shortage of beds in appropriate skilled nursing facilities. Most {{of the children were}} younger than one year of age, most had disorders of the central nervous system or respiratory system, and most needed respiratory support. The average child needed more than 13 hours of skilled <b>nursing</b> care per <b>day.</b> With adequate <b>nursing</b> <b>services,</b> many of these children could be cared for in their homes. For some, family care was not feasible because of social, psychological, and economic problems.

It is {{explicit}} {{that the}} change in the South African government since 1994 accompanied by the transformation of <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> with its new policies and practices is inevitable, and poses challenges for the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers in Gauteng hospitals. The transformation of <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> can be a difficult process creating a period of fear, uncertainty, stress and role ambiguity for the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers. The transformation has been so extensive that the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager's role responsibilities have changed {{to such an extent that}} they are now required to manage grossly reduced levels of resources, multicultural societies with different values, beliefs and attitudes and increased numbers of patients, resulting in overcrowded hospitals. The transformation of <b>nursing</b> <b>services</b> demands the demonstration of appropriate <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> management. The abilities of the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers are critical to the effectiveness of the future. Most <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers are unprepared for their new roles and the present concern is for the quality of the management of the transformation process. No written standards for transformation management in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> are available in Gauteng public hospitals. Consequently, <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers find themselves making major decisions about <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> transformation with little information about the effectiveness of alternative approaches.

40|$|M. Cur. (Professional Nursing) It is {{important}} that the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> exercises a participative managerial style in order to promote staff retention and job satisfaction of the professional nurse. No guidelines exist on what is participative management or how it can be implemented in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service.</b> Little evidence exists of any nursing research having been conducted on participative management in South Africa, nor has research been done from the Judeo-Christian approach. This study, participative management in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service,</b> was conducted in three phases in order to answer the following questions: a) what is participative management? b) how does participative management work? c) what guidelines can be formulated to implement participative management in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service?</b> The first phase of concept identification was effected by means of interviews with management specialists and a literature control. In the second phase a conceptual definition of participative management was formulated. In the third phase the process of participative management was identified and described by means of interviews with management specialists and a literature control. Through this process guidelines were formulated to implement participative management in <b>nursing</b> <b>services.</b> During a workshop with <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers in charge posts in the public sector hospitals in Transvaal, guidelines for the implementation of participative management were streamlined and verified with a managerial specialist. Participative management in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> is a dynamic process of creative problernsolving and mutual decision-making within the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> between the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager and the professional nurse. It is a process of information exchange and consultation between the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager and the nurse, and undergoes three phases during implementation: namely the prepajgtory, the implementation and the evaluation phase. During these phases the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager acts as a facilitator in optimising the professional maturity level of the nurse. This promotes a co-responsibility and co-accountability within the decision-making process in order to promote wholeness in the <b>nursing</b> <b>service.</b> The managerial style of the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager promotes the mission and goals of the <b>nursing</b> <b>service,</b> improves job satisfaction, personnel management and quality nursing care. This facilitates wholeness, in the sense of total well-being, within the professional nurse and the patient. Recommendations forthcoming from this study should address nursing practice, nursing education and nursing research. It is recommended that participative management should be implemented, by means of the guidelines that have been formulated, in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service.</b> A <b>nursing.</b> model for particjnativ:e management in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> should be developed. Further recommendations are that the effect of participative management in a <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> on professional <b>nurses,</b> quality nursing care, nursing management, job satisfaction experienced by nurses within a multi-cultural context and personnel turnover be examined...|$|R

40|$|D. Cur. (Professional Nursing) As {{a result}} of the dynamic changes and {{developments}} which have taken place over the past years in the <b>nursing</b> and health <b>services</b> it has become imperative that attention should be paid to the leadership abilities and skills of <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers who are in control of such services. It is essential for <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers to develop leadership qualities, because the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager is responsible for the management of <b>nursing</b> <b>services.</b> The <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager is responsible for rendering quality nursing to the individual, families and the community. Therefore <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers cannot afford to lag behind where development and handling of changes in health services are concerned. As the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager develops and grows personally and professionally he/she is enabled to facilitate the professional nurses' quest for wholeness. They, in their turn, can facilitate the patients' quest for wholeness. This research originated because of the needs and shortcomings with regard to inadequate management skills that became evident in conversations with <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers on various management levels in practice, and also because of existing research by <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> management experts. Research and discussion with nursing management experts showed {{that there is a need}} for leadership development in <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers and that the need becomes more pronounced as {{a result of}} the dynamic changes that are taking place in the <b>nursing</b> and health <b>services.</b> These changes in their turn are brought about by the political and socia-economic demands and pressure on health services. The question arose of how to address the problem of leadership development of the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager in the best possible way. It was decided to address the problem directly through research, in order to determine how <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers could and should be educated in leadership development, in order to satisfy the demands made on them. Due to the nature of the problem, it was decided to follow a qualitative, explorative and descriptive design in the research, with a theory generating approach based on the model of theory generation of Dickoff, James and Wiedenbach (1968 : 415 / 435). The first related and three levels viz factor isolation, factor related and situation related theories were generated. In phase one of the research an explorative, descriptive, contextual design, where a focus group technique of interviewing was used, was followed. It was done in order to investigate the leadership dimensions of <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers, to address level one factor isolation of theory generation and to identify the specific concepts with regard to leadership development. After the results had been transcribed validation discussions were conducted with some of the participants, in order to enhance the credibility of the research. A control of literature was done, in order to compare the results of the study with existing literature and research on the topic. Six main concepts in the process of leadership development were identified by means of concept-identification, and concept classification (level one factor isolation theory). They are role model,· values, participating leadership, change management, self management and interpersonal skills. These concepts contribute to answering research question viz: To what extent can the exploring and description of the <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> manager's leadership practice serve as foundation for the generation of a leadership development model and for the provision of guidelines for leadership development. The reliability of the research was constantly ensured by careful discussion of the methodology. The conceptualized model for leadership development of <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers was validated by three nursing model experts and three nursing management experts. Following on clarifying discussions with model and nursing management experts the model was refined and hypotheses/relation statements were identified. Factors are not seen in isolation any more. The research therefor now moves to a level two factor related theory. The description of the model takes the research up to a level three situation related theory. The description of the model implies a description of the structure and process. Hypotheses are stated after the recommendations because discussions is only taken up to a level three situation theory. As a result the model for leadership development of <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers can be validated by subsequent research. Thereafter formulated hypotheses of theory generation can be taken to theory verification. The model for leadership development is evaluated on previously stated criteria and the research succeeds to conceptualize a model for leadership development of <b>nursing</b> <b>service</b> managers in a logical, systematic way.
