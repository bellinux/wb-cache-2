QoS-based service {{selection}} mechanisms {{will play}} {{an essential role}} in service-oriented architectures, as e-Business applications want to use services that most accurately meet their requirements.

We will give a formal description of our approach and validate it with experiments which demonstrate that our solution yields high-quality results under various realistic cheating behaviors. ...|$|E

Many machine intelligence techniques are developed to overcome these challenges. One of the essential elements in those techniques is the representation of data, especially for ID-type data, e. g. item ID, product ID, store ID, brand ID, category ID etc. The classical one-hot encoding suffers sparsity problems due to its high dimension. Moreover, it cannot reflect the relationships among IDs, either homogeneous or heterogeneous ones. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical embedding model to jointly learn low-dimensional representations for different types of IDs from the implicit <b>feedback</b> <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> Our approach incorporates the structural information among IDs and embeds all types of IDs into a semantic space.

A collaborative filtering recommender system can use this feedback {{in order to identify}} people and resources more strictly related to a specific topic of interest. Such a collaborative filtering approach can compute similarities among tags in order to select resources associated to tags relevant for a specific interest of the user. Several research works try to infer these similarities by evaluating co-occurrences of tags over the entire set of annotated resources discarding, in this way, information about the personal classification provided by users. This paper, on the other hand, proposes an approach aimed at observing only the set of annotations of a single user in order to identify his topic of interests and to produce personalized recommendations. More specifically, following the idea that each user may have several distinct interests and people may share just some of these interests, our approach adaptively filters and combines the <b>feedback</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> according to a specific topic of interest of a user. © 2011 Springer-Verla...|$|E

40|$|Understanding user {{preference}} {{is essential to}} the optimization of recommender systems. As a <b>feedback</b> <b>of</b> <b>user's</b> taste, rating scores can directly reflect the preference <b>of</b> a given <b>user</b> to a given product. Uncovering the latent components <b>of</b> <b>user</b> ratings is thus of significant importance for learning user interests. In this paper, a new recommendation approach, called LCR, was proposed by investigating the latent components <b>of</b> <b>user</b> ratings. The basic idea is to decompose an existing rating into several components via a cost-sensitive learning strategy. Specifically, each rating is assigned to several latent factor models and each model is updated according to its predictive errors. Afterwards, these accumulated predictive errors of models are utilized to decompose a rating into several components, each of which is treated as an independent part to retrain the latent factor models. Finally, all latent factor models are combined linearly to estimate predictive ratings for users. In contrast to existing methods, LCR provides an intuitive preference modeling strategy via multiple component analysis at an individual perspective. Meanwhile, it is verified by the experimental results on several benchmark datasets that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.
