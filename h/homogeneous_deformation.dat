50|$|One main {{failure mode}} {{is caused by}} tearing of the material. This is typical for sheet-forming applications.A neck may appear at a certain forming stage. This is an {{indication}} of localized plastic deformation. Whereas more or less <b>homogeneous</b> <b>deformation</b> takes place in and around the subsequent neck location in the early stable deformation stage, almost all deformation is concentrated in the neck zone during the quasi-stable and instable deformation phase. This leads to material failure manifested by tearing. Forming-limit curves depict the extreme, but still possible, deformation which a sheet material may undergo during any stage of the stamping process. These limits depend on the deformation mode and the ratio of the surface strains. The major surface strain has a minimum value when plane strain deformation occurs, which means that the corresponding minor surface strain is zero. Forming limits are a specific material property. Typical plane strain values range from 10% for high-strength grades and 50% or above for mild-strength materials and those with very good formability.Forming limit diagrams are often used to graphically or mathematically represent formability. It is recognized by many authors that the nature of fracture and therefore the Forming limit diagrams are intrinsically non-deterministic, since large variations might be observed even within a single experimental campaign.|$|E

40|$|The elastic Ericksen’s problem {{consists}} of finding deformations in isotropic hyperelastic solids {{that can be}} maintained for arbitrary strain-energy density functions. In the compressible case, Ericksen showed that only <b>homogeneous</b> <b>deformations</b> are possible. Here, we solve the anelastic {{version of the same}} problem, that is we determine both the deformations and the eigenstrains such that a solution to the anelastic problem exists for arbitrary strain-energy density functions. Anelasticity is described by finite eigenstrains. In a nonlinear solid, these eigenstrains can be modeled by a Riemannian material manifold whose metric depends on their distribution. In this framework, we show that the natural generalization of the concept of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>deformations</b> is the notion of covariantly <b>homogeneous</b> <b>deformations</b> —deformations with covariantly constant deformation gradients. We prove that these deformations are the only universal deformations and that they put severe restrictions on possible universal eigenstrains.

40|$|Is {{classification}} of the singularities of the potential, concerning the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>deformations</b> in Finite Elasticity, an important material property? The present study {{demonstrates that the}} answer to the question is positive. Since the type of singularity prescribes Maxwell's sets in the neighborhood of a singularity, the emergence of multiphase strain states depends on the performed classification. Bifurcation analysis and singularity classification for <b>homogeneous</b> <b>deformations</b> of any hyperelastic, anisotropic, homogeneous material under any type of conservative quasi-static loading is performed. Critical conditions for branching of the equilibrium paths are defined and their post-critical behavior is studied. Singularities corresponding to simple and compound branching are classified according to Arnold's classification. Unconstrained materials are only considered. Special attention is given to the compound branching (D-k) cases requiring elaborate mathematical techniques. The geometry of the umbilics is described with the equilibrium paths and the cusp lines. With the help of Maxwell's sets in the neighborhood of the umbilics, the emergence of discontinuous strain fields is demonstrated. The theory is applied to orthotropic and transversely isotropic materials as well. The proposed method may directly be applied to crystals stability problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
