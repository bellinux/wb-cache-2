The Centres of Innovation (COI) programme provides a unique opportunity for research into effective leadership in quality services that can contribute to our knowledge and understanding of leadership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sector as a whole. This study, exploring how leadership is defined and enacted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>COI,</b> found that although not all educators were comfortable with being identified as leaders, individuals and the centres as a whole were demonstrating leadership in ways that fitted their service contexts. Leadership across <b>the</b> <b>COI</b> was characterised by courage, commitment and collaboration. The innovative approaches of <b>the</b> <b>COI</b> appear to be due in no small part to the collaborative centre cultures in which innovation is encouraged, educators feel valued and supported, and there is regular reflection and a commitment to continuous improvement. Those in leadership positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>COI</b> have promoted these collaborative cultures and through their example teacher leadership has been encouraged. <b>The</b> <b>COI</b> not only provide case studies of educative leadership (Meade, 2003 a) but also case studies of learning communities.

40|$|The {{phytotoxin}} coronatine and {{the plant}} growth regulator methyl jasmonate (MeJA) caused similar growth-inhibitory effects on Arabidopsis seedlings. To test whether these two compounds have similar action, 14 independent coi 1 (coronatine-insensitive) mutants of Arabidopsis were selected. The mutants segregated as single recessive Mendelian markers, and all were alleles at <b>the</b> <b>coi</b> 1 locus. All coi 1 mutants were also insensitive to MeJA and were male sterile. Both coronatine and MeJA inhibited root growth, stimulated anthocyanin accumulation, and increased the level of two proteins of ~ 31 and ~ 29 kD detected in SDS-polyacrylamide gels of wild-type Arabidopsis but caused none of these effects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coi</b> 1 mutant.

40|$|Local {{endemic species}} with their unique {{evolutionary}} history always stirred {{the interest of}} scientists. One such area especially rich in endemics is northern Italy. In case of pill millipedes of the genus Glomeris Latreille, 1803, only a single species is found in northern Europe, while 22 country-endemics alone are known from Italy. Many of these endemics, however, have not been studied in several decades; therefore we aimed to determine whether this diversity {{is the result of}} overlooked synonymies or natural processes. A focus was placed on the local endemics that are in some aspects morphologically similar to the widespread and variable G. klugii Brandt, 1833. The local endemics Glomeris larii Verhoeff, 1921, G. primordialis Verhoeff, 1930, G. oblongoguttata Verhoeff, 1894, G. oropensis Verhoeff, 1936, G. transalpina Koch, 1836, G. romana Verhoeff, 1900, G. ligurica Latzel, 1884 and G. apuana Verhoeff, 1911 were included in a molecular analysis incorporating ribosomal nuclear (28 S) and mitochondrial (COI) genes. Individuals were sequenced and compared to 31 specimens from 18 localities of G. klugii. The final dataset included 657 base pairs for 56 terminals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>COI,</b> and 14 terminals with 1068 base pairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> combined 28 S and COI analysis. Our analysis shows intraspecific distances of up to 5 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>COI</b> gene <b>in</b> G. klugii that are not strictly correlated to geography or color pattern. G. larii is discovered to be genetically and morphologically identical to G. klugii and is synonymised with the latter. Interspecific distances in our dataset vary between 6. 7 to 15. 9 %, with the lowest (6. 7 - 9. 0 %) between G. primordialis and G. klugii. Our analysis confirms the species status of the local endemics G. primordialis, G. oblongoguttata, G. oropensis, G. transalpina, G. ligurica and G. apuana. We also confirm the synonymy of G. undulata Koch, 1844 under G. klugii. G. genuensis Latzel, 1886 is indistinguishable from G. ligurica...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the genetic {{diversity of the}} acanthocephalan Profilicollis altmani from three species of Emerita mole crabs. This study aimed to determine if genetic data supported the morphological distinction of two geographically isolated acanthocephalan species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern and southern hemispheres, to identify if there were cryptic species of this parasite between Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins, and examine the spatial structure of genetic diversity within this parasite. The low genetic diversity observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>COI</b> and ITS loci of this marine species in comparison to cryptic species of freshwater acanthocephalans {{suggests that there are}} not cryptic species of this marine acanthocephalan. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> lack of geographic patterning in haplotype diversity of this parasite indicates high gene flow between coasts. This study finds that the acanthocephalan P. altmani is a cosmopolitan parasite that is most likely distributed between coasts by the seabirds that serve as definitive hosts...|$|R
