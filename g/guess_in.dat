500|$|Instead of {{calculating the}} midpoint, {{interpolation}} search estimates {{the position of}} the target value, taking into account the lowest and highest elements in the array as well as length of the array. This is only possible if the array elements are numbers. It works on the basis that the midpoint is not the best <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> many cases. For example, if the target value is close to the highest element in the array, {{it is likely to be}} located near the end of the array. When the distribution of the array elements is uniform or near uniform, it makes [...] comparisons.|$|E
500|$|Critics of {{evolution}} assert that evolution is [...] "just a theory," [...] which emphasizes that scientific theories are never absolute, or misleadingly presents it {{as a matter}} of opinion rather than of fact or evidence. This reflects a difference of the meaning of theory in a scientific context: whereas in colloquial speech a theory is a conjecture or <b>guess,</b> <b>in</b> science a theory is an explanation whose predictions have been verified by experiments or other evidence. Evolutionary theory refers to an explanation for the diversity of species and their ancestry which has met extremely high standards of scientific evidence. An example {{of evolution}} as theory is the modern synthesis of Darwinian natural selection and Mendelian inheritance. As with any scientific theory, the modern synthesis is constantly debated, tested, and refined by scientists, but there is an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that it remains the only robust model that accounts for the known facts concerning evolution.|$|E
500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t know if I can say! That’s a hard {{question}} {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful when you know the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Today" [...] was {{the first}} song Corgan wrote for Siamese Dream. Corgan said, [...] "The day after I wrote 'Today,' my manager heard it and said, 'It's a hit,' and I <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> a way, it was." [...] Corgan played the self-recorded demo to {{producer}} Butch Vig and {{to the rest of}} his band, all of whom responded positively. [...] "Today" [...] already had a chord progression and a melody, but Corgan felt there needed to be an opening riff to the song. One day, [...] "out of the blue, I heard the opening lick note for note in my head", Corgan said. [...] "When I added the opening riff, it completely changed the character of the song. Suddenly, I had a song that was starting out quiet and then got very loud." [...] Soon afterwards, Virgin Records executives were sent to check up on the band after hearing about their problems, but were pleased with the demo. The reaction from the executives only served to put more stress on Corgan; as a result, he recorded most of the guitar and bass guitar parts himself, including on the finished version of [...] "Today".|$|E
500|$|Waltrip, {{who failed}} {{to qualify for the}} Daytona 500 after {{crashing}} on lap 52, said he felt he had let everyone down but was thankful his team and his sponsor Aaron's had given him an opportunity to race in the Duels.

I <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> these situations, I just have to be glad that I'm a small driver and that I've got room. Kinda hug it in and let it rip." [...] She also said the crash was [...] "a blessing in a big disguise". Patrick, along with Gilliland, Montoya and Menard, were required to drive their backup cars for the Daytona 500. After the wreck on lap nine, Gilliland cut his thumb on his helmet; the thumb required one stitch but he was confident about driving his backup car. According to Menard, who was involved in the lap nine wreck, [...] "Somebody turned (David) Gilliland; I saw him get sideways underneath me. I was three lanes up and I tried to clear him and didn’t quite make it.” It took 56 minutes and 34 seconds to complete the first race; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E

40|$|A {{guessing}} wiretapper’s {{performance on}} a Shannon cipher system is analyzed for a source with memory. Close relationships between guessing functions and length functions are first established. Subsequently, asymptotically optimal encryption and attack strategies are identified and their performances analyzed for sources with memory. The performance metrics are exponents of guessing moments and probability of large deviations. The metrics are then characterized for unifilar sources. Universal asymptotically optimal encryption and attack strategies are also identified for unifilar sources. <b>Guessing</b> <b>in</b> the increasing order of Lempel-Ziv coding lengths is proposed for finite-state sources, and shown to be asymptotically optimal. Finally, competitive optimality properties of <b>guessing</b> <b>in</b> the increasing order of description lengths and Lempel-Ziv coding lengths are demonstrated...|$|R

2500|$|Level 7, head of Munitions. Walter is {{the oldest}} {{operative}} in Section One. He is responsible for creating new and necessary gadgets, tools, and weapons for use on Section operatives' various missions. While he was sexually attracted to Nikita upon her arrival at Section, Walter becomes her loyal friend and confidante, even participating in a cover-up to hide the ongoing romantic status of Nikita and Michael. Walter's nickname for Nikita, [...] "Sugar", and his bandana were details added by the actor himself. Walter's brief marriage to, and loss of, Belinda, an [...] "abeyance operative" [...] (one who {{is scheduled to be}} eliminated or [...] "cancelled" [...] by Section One) -- is ample motivation for his willingness to do anything for revenge for what Walter perceives as Operations' cruelty. However, Operations continues to spare Walter's life, likely because of a long-standing relationship that began in Vietnam and may have included a period where Walter was Operations' Section trainer, though this is informed speculation. In the series finale, after Operations' death, Walter reveals to Quinn that he once saved Operations' life. Operations did not thank him, but also did not cancel him, even though he had many reasons to do so over the years. Walter states: [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> the end, we both came out about even".|$|E
2500|$|Guess {{began in}} 1981 {{as a book}} of styles by Georges Marciano. [...] Maurice, Georges brother, was first sought by Georges to help with product development. Armand and Paul, also Georges' brothers, {{were in charge of}} {{distribution}} and advertising, respectively. [...] Armand ran distribution. Paul created the advertising, all of it in-house. Georges designed the clothes, burnishing Guess' signature style: stonewashed denim, lighter in color, softer and more form-fitting than the competitors. This initial chain of command later led to the earlier break-up of the brothers' cooperation with Georges selling his share of the Guess company to his other brothers due to a disagreement in a choice of product distribution strategy. Georges wanted to keep <b>Guess</b> <b>in</b> only the more exclusive stores, such as Bloomingdales. The remaining brothers in the disagreement wanted a larger distribution in KMart. Georges hated the idea. Different camps formed within the company, with each pledging allegiance to either Georges or the other three. Georges eventually gave in and sold his stake to his brothers in 1993 for $214.2 million. To finance the purchase, they had to borrow $210 million, and $105 million was still outstanding three years later. To raise money, the brothers decided to take Guess public. [...] Paul was the only remaining brother to ultimately lead Guess on his own.|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2016 {{interview}} with Bleeding Cool, Galligan again spoke {{about a third}} film saying that [...] "Warner Bros. definitely wants it, Chris Columbus {{wants to do it}} because he’d like to undo the Gremlins 2 thing as he wasn’t thrilled with it, and Spielberg wants to do it I imagine – because he’s Spielberg – and why wouldn’t he want to do it." [...] He said that Columbus was now in control of the franchise and once confirmed {{that there will be no}} remake or reboot, only a sequel. He also said that that Columbus [...] "has been aggressively working on a Gremlins 3" [...] and Columbus even went into some detail about what the third film would be about. Gremlins 3 takes place in present day. He tantalizingly says there will be some new characters and some old characters – I <b>guess</b> <b>in</b> the style of a [...] type sequel. One thing we know for sure is they have a writer on board. The only insight I can give is the following: There was a 6-year gap between Gremlins and Gremlins 2; most of that time was spent with them writing and rejecting ideas and re-writing. One of the ideas that was rejected was ‘gremlins in Vegas.’ They went with that for 18 months and felt it was too expensive. Eventually they came up with the tower idea, where essentially I’m working for Donald Trump, our new President! That took six years to happen. Carl Ellsworth has been apparently working on the script for a year and a half now." [...] Galligan said. It is unknown if Joe Dante will return to direct the third film.|$|E
