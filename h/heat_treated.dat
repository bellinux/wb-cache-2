It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E
5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E

5|$|Since moulds {{have been}} {{expensive}} to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production {{where thousands of}} parts were being produced. Typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in general, steel moulds cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel moulds are <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> after machining; these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts. Beryllium copper is used in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most shear heat generated.

25|$|As {{for many}} of the {{aluminium}} alloys, Yalloy age hardens spontaneously at normal temperatures after solution heat treating.

For R.R.56 the solution treatment is to quench from 530°C and ageing is carried out at 175°C. For R.R.50, the solution treatment may be omitted and the metal taken directly to precipitation hardening (155°C-170°C).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Selecting and {{correctly}} <b>heat</b> <b>treating</b> {{an appropriate}} tool steel for {{production of a}} die {{is not a simple}} task. This paper points out defects which are encountered most frequently in dies when a poor-quality material or an inadequate <b>heat</b> <b>treating</b> schedule was selected or when the prescribed <b>heat</b> <b>treating</b> schedule was not followed. The most common deficiencies in semi-finished products from tool steels for die making include carbide banding and non-uniform microstructure with substantial variance in grain size. Incorrect tempering parameters are often used and the materials are thus treated in the region of temper brittleness. Cases of the above kind have been investigated by the laboratory at COMTES FHT in recent years and their summary is given in the text below...|$|R

25|$|Finally, infant {{formulas}} are <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> {{to maintain}} the bacteriologic quality of the product. This can be done traditionally by either retort sterilization or high-temperature short-time (HTST) treatment. Recently, ultrahigh-temperature treated formula has become more commonly used. If powdered formula is made, then spray drying would be required in addition. Retort sterilization is a traditional retort sterilization method that uses 10-15mins treatment at 118°C. Ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) is a method that uses a brief (2–3 seconds) treatment at 142°C. Because of the short time used, there is little protein denaturation, but the process still ensures sterility of the final product.|$|E
25|$|Billet Steel: When a {{high quality}} {{camshaft}} or low volume production is required, engine builders and camshaft manufacturers choose steel billet. This {{is a much more}} time consuming process, and is generally more expensive than other methods. However, the finished product is far superior. CNC lathes, CNC milling machines, and CNC camshaft grinders will be used during production. Different types of steel bar can be used, one example being EN40b. When manufacturing a camshaft from EN40b, the camshaft will also be <b>heat</b> <b>treated</b> via gas nitriding, which changes the micro-structure of the material. It gives a surface hardness of 55-60 HRC. These types of camshafts can be used in high-performance engines.|$|E
25|$|Steel blades are {{commonly}} shaped by forging or stock removal. Forged blades {{are made by}} heating {{a single piece of}} steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. Stock removal blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be <b>heat</b> <b>treated.</b> This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and stock removal processes. Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from stock removal product lines by the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.|$|E

Annealing, as an example, involves heating a metallic material to, and holding it at, a suitable temperature, followed by furnace cooling at an appropriate rate. Steel castings may be annealed to facilitate cold working or machining to improve mechanical or electrical properties, or to promote dimensional stability. Gray iron castings may be annealed to soften them, or to minimize or eliminate massive eutectic carbides, thus improving their machinability.
