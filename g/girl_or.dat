5|$|Jack is {{the most}} common name used in English-language nursery rhymes and {{represented}} an archetypal Everyman hero by the 18th century, while Jill or Gill had come to mean a young <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> a sweetheart {{by the end of the}} Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The word mermaid is a {{compound}} of the Old English mere (sea), and maid (a <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> young woman). The equivalent term in Old English was merewif. They are conventionally depicted as beautiful with long flowing hair. As cited above, they are sometimes equated with the sirens of Greek mythology (especially the Odyssey), half-bird femmes fatales whose enchanting voices would lure soon-to-be-shipwrecked sailors to nearby rocks, sandbars or shoals.|$|E
5|$|The walrus {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies, and the animal appears frequently in legends. For example, in a Chukchi version of the widespread myth of the Raven, in which Raven recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she drops into the water, she turns into a walrus – possibly the original walrus. According to various legends, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the weeping <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> her long braids. This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess Sedna. Both in Chukotka and Alaska, the aurora borealis is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence, the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a walrus head.|$|E

25|$|For monastics, the {{abstention}} from sensual misconduct means strict celibacy, states Christopher Gowans, {{while for}} lay Buddhists this prohibits adultery {{as well as}} other forms of sensual misconduct. Later Buddhist texts, states Bhikkhu Bodhi, state that the prohibition on sexual conduct for lay Buddhists includes any sexual involvement with someone married, a <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> woman protected by her parents or relatives, and someone prohibited by dhamma conventions (such as relatives, nuns and others).|$|E
25|$|Maharis were Oriya devadasis or temple girls, {{their name}} {{deriving}} from Maha (great) and Nari (<b>girl),</b> <b>or</b> Mahri (chosen) particularly {{those at the}} temple of Jagganath at Puri. Early Maharis performed Nritta (pure dance) and Abhinaya (interpretation of poetry) dedicated to various Hindu gods and goddesses, as well as Puranic mythologies and Vedic legends. Later, Maharis especially performed dance sequences based on the lyrics of Jayadev's Gita Govinda. This style is more sensuous {{and closer to the}} classical Sanskrit texts on dance, music and performance arts.|$|E

25|$|The hymen is a {{membrane}} {{of tissue}} that surrounds or partially covers the vaginal opening. The effects of vaginal intercourse and childbirth on the hymen are variable. If the hymen is sufficiently elastic, it may return to nearly its original condition. In other cases, {{there may be}} remnants (carunculae myrtiformes), or it may appear completely absent after repeated penetration. Additionally, the hymen may be lacerated by disease, injury, medical examination, masturbation or physical exercise. For these reasons, {{it is not possible}} to definitively determine whether or not a <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> woman is a virgin by examining her hymen.|$|E
25|$|The word molly (also spelt as molley, mollie, mally) is a pet-form of {{the female}} {{forename}} Mary, and had two main connotations in 18th century English. The first one {{is close to the}} word moll, designating a lower-class <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> woman, occasionally a prostitute. The second one is classified as slang, defining an effeminate, usually homosexual, male. Along with the possible perception of intrinsic female features deriving from the association with the name Mary, another possible origin of this denomination for a homosexual man could be found in the Latin form mollis, indicating the supposed passive-effeminate partner in male homosexual relationships.|$|E
25|$|There is no set rule on {{what kind}} of person a Bond girl will be or what role she will play. She may be an ally or an enemy of Bond, pivotal to the mission or simply eye candy. There are female {{characters}} such as Judi Dench's M, and Camille Montes, a Bolivian intelligence agent who teams up with Bond in Quantum of Solace, who are not romantic interests of Bond, and hence not strictly Bond girls. However, {{it has been argued that}} M's pivotal role in the plot of Skyfall qualifies her as a Bond <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> Bond woman.|$|E

25|$|This favored {{arrangement}} occurred {{primarily because}} of what some men considered their conflict with the matrilineal system. Under this kinship system, children were considered born into the mother's clan and took their status from her family. Generally her eldest brother served as mentor to her children, particularly for the boys. She was protected by her family. Some Ashanti men felt more comfortable taking a slave <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> pawn wife in marriage, as she would have no abusua (older male grandfather, father, uncle or brother) to intercede on her behalf when the couple argued. With an enslaved wife, the master and husband had total control of their children, as she had no kin in the tribe.|$|E
25|$|Dodd {{stayed with}} his aunt, Mrs. Susan Dodd, in Little Rock. Except for some Union soldiers, {{there were very}} few teenage boys in the city, and Dodd was popular with the city's younger girls. He even became popular with some of the younger {{servicemen}} at the arsenal, especially because he usually was accompanied by a local <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> two. In addition to his father's letters, he also delivered letters to several people he knew. Dodd attended some holiday dances with at least two girls, Mary Swindle and Minerva Cogburn. He also spent some time with 16-year-old Mary Dodge at her home, where Union officers were quartered. Mary supported the Southern cause; her father, R. L. Dodge, was a Vermont native on friendly terms with the Northern troops.|$|E
25|$|Chang's {{eventual}} downfall {{was caused}} by his association with Violet Payne, also known as Mary Deval or Ruby Duval. Payne was a chorus <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> actress and a drug addict living in Maple Street, near Tottenham Court Road. On 23 February 1924, police saw Payne in the Commercial Tavern, Pennyfields, with packets of an unknown substance. She {{was taken to the}} police station, searched, and found to have cocaine hidden in the lining of her coat. There were marks on her body indicating the use of a hypodermic syringe. Payne made a statement to the police and Chang's home was searched at 11.30 pm the same day. A single bag of cocaine was found behind a loose board in a cupboard. Chang was subsequently arrested and charged with possessing and supplying cocaine.|$|E

25|$|A <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> woman goes {{early in}} the morning to a {{resource}} of water, as a well, spring, or stream. After she puts by the water an ear of maize and a bunch of basil which she has brought from home, she collects water with a bucket, and takes it home to her family. This water collected on early Christmas morning is called the strong water, and is believed to possess a special beneficial power. Each member of the family washes the face with it, and drinks it before breakfast; infants are bathed in it. On her way back home, the girl who carries the strong water picks several cornel or willow twigs, with which children are lightly struck that morning. This is intended to strengthen their health.|$|E
25|$|Shakta {{practitioners}} {{are said to}} have a theophany of the Goddess, {{in the form of a}} young <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> woman or in the sky or she may possess the corpse. The Shakta practitioner is considered to be a child of the Divine Mother, who is surrounded by fear, tormented by ghosts and demons and overcome with love towards her and needs to be rescued by the Mother. When the Goddess is said to possess the corpse, the corpse is considered sacred as a murti or vessel of the divine spirit. The head of the corpse is said to turn towards the devotee and begins speaking affectionately (or sometimes terrifyingly) with him. The devotee then asks for a boon (spiritual or worldly) that the Goddess is compelled to grant. Some practitioners regard that his own body becomes a corpse while performing the ritual. The Goddess fills life into him by possessing him.|$|E
25|$|While {{most of the}} Millennium Development Goals face a {{deadline}} of 2015, the gender parity target was set to be achieved a full ten years earlier - an acknowledgement that equal access to education is the foundation for all other development goals. In countries where resources and school facilities are lacking, and total enrollments are low, a choice must often be made in families between sending a <b>girl</b> <b>or</b> a boy to school. Until equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, {{it will be impossible}} to build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger, combat disease and ensure environmental sustainability. Millions of children and women will continue to die needlessly, thus placing the rest of the development agenda at risk. It is extremely important that girls have access to an education. For every additional year girls go to school, they receive 20 percent higher wages and suffer 10 percent fewer child deaths. Women with some formal education are more likely to seek medical care, ensure their children are immunized, be better informed about their children’s nutritional requirements, and adopt improved sanitation practices. As a result, their infants and children have higher survival rates and tend to be healthier and better nourished. According to The International Center for Research on Women, the education that a girl receives is the strongest predictor of the age she will marry and is a critical factor in reducing the prevalence of child marriage. The World Bank estimates that an additional year of schooling for 1,000 women helps prevent two maternal deaths. Also, each additional year of formal education that a mother completes translates to her children staying in school an additional one-third to one-half of a year.|$|E
