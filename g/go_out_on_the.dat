5|$|Lewis Hamilton did <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> softer tyres in Q2, {{setting the}} fastest {{time of the}} session, the first to lap in under 1 minute, 20 seconds. Behind him Vettel was second ahead of Rosberg. Räikkönen {{went out on the}} harder {{compound}} tyre, but aborted his running after spinning in turn one, leaving him fifteenth fastest with a grid penalty for his gearbox change yet to come. Max Verstappen put in a fast lap {{towards the end of the}} session, demoting his teammate Sainz, Jr. out of the top ten. Also eliminated were both Lotus and the second Sauber of Ericsson.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, NBC {{has hired}} {{recently}} laid off investment bankers (Patrick Heusinger, Greg Tuculescu, and Doug Mand) from Lehman Brothers as interns on TGS with Tracy Jordan. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{is invited to}} <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town with them, but finds that he is incapable of keeping up with their lifestyle. Tracy fears that if the public were to learn {{that he no longer}} lives a fast lifestyle, his image would be severely compromised and he would be forced to change from a comedic actor to a dramatic actor. Tracy refuses to allow this to happen, so he buys out Lehman Brothers and sends the interns back to their old jobs on Wall Street.|$|E

25|$|In {{winter when}} the lake freezes, many {{fishermen}} <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice, cut holes, and fish. It is even possible to build bonfires on the ice. But venturing on Lake Erie ice can be dangerous. In a freak incident in 2009, warming temperatures and winds of 35 {{miles per hour}} and currents pushing eastward dislodged a miles-wide ice floe which {{broke away from the}} shore, trapping more than 130 fishermen offshore; one man died while the rest were rescued by helicopters or boats.|$|E
25|$|Henry and Ellen Smith are {{a middle-aged}} married couple who have {{settled into a}} routine life {{in the suburbs of}} New York. Henry feels that the spice has gone out of their marriage, while Ellen is more content with their lot in life. When the couple comes into a {{financial}} windfall, Henry suggests that they take separate vacations. Reluctantly, Ellen agrees, and Henry departs to test the waters of New York City's nightlife. In the city, he meets up with Skeets, and the two <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town, eventually ending up pursuing Gloria Dawn and her friend Merle, Broadway dancers. After sitting at home and bemoaning her fate with her housekeeper, Whiffen, for a several days, eventually Ellen decides what is good for the goose is good for the gander, and she also departs to have some fun in New York.|$|E
500|$|The reply by Engel for the USPTO {{acknowledged}} the routine {{use of the}} word, and simultaneously asserted its scandalous nature: [...] "Although the word is frequently used, it still is considered shocking in most formal or polite situations. For example, the word is bleeped out on basic cable, and broadcasters can be fined by the FCC for letting the word <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airwaves." [...] He argued that the word was restricted {{in the workplace and}} by government regulations.|$|E

500|$|Ed O'Brien {{described}} the lyrics, saying [...] "They were universal. There wasn't a political agenda. It's being human." [...] The song [...] "Bodysnatchers" [...] {{is inspired by}} Victorian ghost stories, the 1972 novel The Stepford Wives and Yorke's feeling of [...] "your physical consciousness trapped {{without being able to}} connect fully with anything else." [...] "Jigsaw Falling into Place" [...] is about a set of observations and different experiences, partly of the chaos witnessed by Yorke when he used to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> weekend in Oxford. Yorke said [...] "The lyrics are quite caustic—the idea of 'before you're comatose' or whatever, drinking yourself into oblivion and getting fucked-up to forget ... is partly this elation. But there's a much darker side." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first stop}} after Olympia for [...] "The Old Oregon Trail Monument Expedition" [...] was Tenino, Washington, where Meeker went ahead by train on February 20, 1906 to make {{arrangements}} for the first monument of the trip. [...] He still had no driver, and had his wagon pulled to Tenino by horses, with the oxen trailing behind. [...] He appealed to a local quarry for a suitable stone, which was carved and was dedicated in Tenino at a ceremony on the 21st. He had less success as he journeyed south towards Portland; at none of the remaining Washington stops was a monument erected, and although Meeker placed wooden posts where monuments should go, most of the designated towns did not follow through. [...] The lack of enthusiasm about Meeker's mission continued in Portland, where the Unitarian church elders voted against allowing Meeker {{the use of the}} building to give a fundraising lecture, pledging to do nothing to [...] "encourage that old man to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Plains to die".|$|E
500|$|Love {{has also}} participated with LGBT youth charities, {{specifically}} with the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, {{where she has}} taken part in performances at the center's [...] "An Evening with Women" [...] events. The proceeds of the event help provide food and shelter for homeless youth; services for seniors; legal assistance; domestic violence services; {{health and mental health}} services, and cultural arts programs. Love participated with Linda Perry for the event again in 2012, and performed alongside Aimee Mann and comedian Wanda Sykes. Speaking on her collaboration on the event, Love said: [...] "Seven thousand kids in Los Angeles a year <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street, and forty percent of those kids are gay, lesbian, or transgendered. They come out to their parents, and become homeless... for whatever reason, I don't really know why, but gay men have a lot of foundations—I've played many of them—but the lesbian side of it doesn't have as much money and/or donors, so we're excited that this has grown to cover women and women's affairs." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's {{opening track}} [...] "Airbag" [...] was {{inspired}} by the music of DJ Shadow and is underpinned by an electronic drum beat programmed from a seconds-long recording of Selway's drumming. The band sampled the drum track with a digital sampler and edited it with a Macintosh computer, but admitted to making approximations in emulating Shadow's style due to their programming inexperience. The bassline in [...] "Airbag" [...] stops and starts unexpectedly, achieving an effect similar to 1970s dub. The song's references to automobile accidents and reincarnation were inspired by a magazine article titled [...] "An Airbag Saved My Life" [...] and The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Yorke wrote [...] "Airbag" [...] about the illusion of safety offered by modern transit, and [...] "the idea that whenever you <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road you could be killed." [...] The BBC wrote of the influence of J. G. Ballard, especially his 1973 novel Crash on the song's lyrical content. Music journalist Tim Footman notes the song's technical innovations and lyrical concerns demonstrate the [...] "key paradox" [...] of the album: [...] "the musicians and producer are delighting in the sonic possibilities of modern technology; the singer, meanwhile, is railing against its social, moral, and psychological impact.... It's a contradiction mirrored in the culture clash of the music, with the 'real' guitars negotiating an uneasy stand-off with the hacked-up, processed drums." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pictures}} were taken almost entirely in Super 8 format, {{and most of}} the photo shoots took place in New York City and Miami. Locations in New York City included the Hotel Chelsea and Times Square's all-male burlesque Gaiety Theatre (dancers from theatre participated in one of the book's photo sessions), whereas in Miami the majority of the sessions were shot at a house Madonna had purchased just before starting the project, and in several beaches and streets. One morning during the four-day Florida shoot Madonna was prancing around her 14-bedroom house in Miami completely naked, when someone jokingly suggested she <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street, then, according to Baron [...] "the next thing we're in the street" [...] where allegedly [...] "cars screeched to a halt, motorists whistled, and one entranced cyclist fell off his bike." [...] This {{was just one of the}} many crazy episodes that took place during the shooting of the book. According to Baron, during the photo shoots [...] "'d do something crazy and then we'd come up with something even crazier". One of the most shocking photographs made for the book, which featured two women in post-punk attire flanking Madonna with one of them holding a knife to Madonna's crotch, was dismissed as it was considered too violent. At some point, while the book was being produced, some of the photographs were stolen, but were quickly recovered by the FBI. According to New York magazine, there were approximately 80,000photographs taken for the book, but only a handful made the final cut. The printing of the book was extended for 15days making the total production process last about eight months.|$|E

2500|$|On 9 October, the {{government}} cancelled {{the meeting with}} student leaders that had been scheduled for 10 October.
