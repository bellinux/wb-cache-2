5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, <b>grapefruit,</b> fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. <b>Grapefruit</b> juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E

5|$|There {{are various}} climatic areas in Israel and areas it has settled that allow {{a variety of}} {{products}} to be grown. Citrus trees such as orange, lemon and <b>grapefruit</b> thrive on the coastal plain. Figs, pomegranates and olives also grow in the cooler hill areas. The subtropical climate near the Sea of Galilee and in the Jordan River Valley is suitable for mangoes, kiwis and bananas, while the temperate climate of the mountains of the Galilee and the Golan is suitable for grapes, apples and cherries.|$|E

About 80% of the <b>grapefruit</b> and nearly 25% of the orange crop were lost there. Two deaths were observed: one man was killed when his boat capsized in rough seas, while a second man was mauled to death by a jaguar that escaped after a tree mangled its cage. The damage cost topped $80 million.|$|E

5|$|Riesling {{wines are}} often {{consumed}} when young, {{when they make}} a fruity and aromatic wine which may have aromas of green or other apples, <b>grapefruit,</b> peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.|$|E

The passage of the hurricane results in 2,156destroyed homes, 3,903severely damaged houses, and 281 boats destroyed or left with major damage.

5|$|Some {{crop plants}} are hybrids from {{different}} genera (intergeneric hybrids), such as Triticale, × Triticosecale, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) and <b>grapefruit</b> (Citrus × paradisi) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as peppermint (Mentha × piperita), and trees {{such as the}} London plane (Platanus × acerifolia).

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate the antioxidant properties of some citrus fruits. The contents of dietary fibre, total polyphenols, essential phenolics, ascorbic acid and some trace elements of lemons, oranges and <b>grapefruits</b> were determined and compared with their total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP). There {{were no significant differences in}} the contents of total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre in the studied peeled fruits or their peels. The contents of total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre in peels were significantly higher than in peeled fruits (P< 0. 05 in all cases). The peeled lemons, oranges and grape-fruits contain 16410. 3; 15410. 2 and 13510. 1 and their peels 19010. 6; 17910. 5 and 15510. 3 mg/ 100 g of total poly-phenols, respectively. The content of total polyphenols in peeled lemons and their peels was significantly higher than in peeled oranges and <b>grapefruits</b> and their peels, respectively. The content of total polyphenols in the peels was significantly higher than in peeled fruits (P< 0. 05 in all cases). The same results were obtained in the investigation of essential phenolics and ascorbic acid.
