40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>incomplete</b> vector-meson <b>dominance</b> and Regge models {{is applied to}} the {{transition}} form factor of the pion. First, we argue that variants of the chiral quark model fulfilling the chiral anomaly may violate the Terazawa-West unitarity bounds, as these bounds are based on unverified assumptions for the real parts of the amplitudes, precluding a possible presence of polynomial terms. A direct consequence is that the transition form factor need not necessarily vanish at large values of the photon virtuality. Moreover, in the range of the BaBar experiment, the Terazawa-West bound is an order of magnitude above the data, thus is of formal rather than practical interest. Then we demonstrate how the experimental data may be properly explained with <b>incomplete</b> vector-meson <b>dominance</b> in a simple model with one state, as well as in more sophisticated Regge models. Generalizations of the simple Regge model along the lines of Dominguez result in a proper description of the data, where one may adjust the parameters {{in such a way that}} the Terazawa-West bound is satisfied or violated. We also impose the experimental constraint from the Z -> pi 0 gamma decay. Finally, we point out that the photon momentum asymmetry parameter may noticeably influence the precision analysis.

The fitness cost was recessive in all but the young, high expression cotton.

50|$|Blending {{inheritance}} {{is similar}} to the modern legitimate idea of <b>incomplete</b> <b>dominance</b> and the terms are rarely, but incorrectly, used interchangeably by some. However, <b>incomplete</b> <b>dominance</b> results in blending only of the phenotype, keeping the alleles within the heterozygote distinct (and, thus still inheritable in successive generations), whereas the theory of blending inheritance referred to an actual blending of the genetic material (i.e. in modern terms, alleles would blend together to form a completely new allele).|$|E
50|$|<b>Incomplete</b> <b>{{dominance}}</b> (also called partial dominance or semi-dominance) {{occurs when}} the phenotype of the heterozygous genotype is distinct from and often intermediate to the phenotypes of the homozygous genotypes. For example, the snapdragon flower color is homozygous for either red or white. When the red homozygous flower is paired with the white homozygous flower, the result yields a pink snapdragon flower. The pink snapdragon {{is the result of}} <b>incomplete</b> <b>dominance.</b> A similar type of <b>incomplete</b> <b>dominance</b> is found in the four o'clock plant wherein pink color is produced when true-bred parents of white and red flowers are crossed. In quantitative genetics, where phenotypes are measured and treated numerically, if a heterozygote's phenotype is exactly between (numerically) that of the two homozygotes, the phenotype is said to exhibit no dominance at all, i.e. dominance exists only when the heterozygote's phenotype measure lies closer to one homozygote than the other.|$|E
50|$|The {{sickle cell}} trait {{can be used}} to {{demonstrate}} the concepts of co-dominance and <b>incomplete</b> <b>dominance.</b> An individual with the sickle cell trait shows <b>incomplete</b> <b>dominance</b> when the shape of the red blood cell is considered. This is because the sickling happens only at low oxygen concentrations. With regards to the actual concentration of hemoglobin in the circulating cells, the alleles demonstrate co-dominance as both 'normal' and mutant forms co-exist in the blood stream. It {{is interesting to note that}} unlike the sickle-cell trait, sickle-cell disease is passed on in a recessive manner.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in the MSTN gene cause myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy. The MSTN gene {{provides}} {{instructions for}} making a protein called myostatin, which is active in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) {{both before and after}} birth.

Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy has a pattern of inheritance known as <b>incomplete</b> autosomal <b>dominance.</b> People with a mutation in both copies of the MSTN gene in each cell (homozygotes) have significantly increased muscle mass and strength.

40|$|We {{explore the}} BaBar puzzle within the Regge approach.

Consequently, the transition form factor need not vanish at large values of the photon virtuality. Then we show that the experimental data may be properly explained with <b>incomplete</b> vector-meson <b>dominance</b> in a simple model with one state, as well as in more sophisticated radial Regge models including infinitely many states. We also consider the experimental constraint from the rare Z -> pi 0 gamma decay, which is comfortably satisfied in our approach.

40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} {{conducted}} in the period 2014 – 2015 in the experimental field of the Maize Institute, Knezha by using an agro technique adopted for the region. For {{the purposes of the}} study four maize hybrids Kn 307, Kn 435, Kn 509 and Kn 625 М are included at different degree of maturity - FAO 300 - 399; 400 - 499; 500 - 599 and FAO above 600. The hybrids together with their parental forms are studied in competitive variety trials under conditions without irrigation at three densities of the crop 45000 pl/ha; 55000 рl/ha and 65000 рl/ha. From the presented results obtained based on the data of manifestation of heterosis and the degrees of dominance of the hybrids clearly expressed heterosis is established for the traits grain yield, length of cob and number of grains per row. For the trait number of rows in the cob both presence and absence of heterosis is observed. The degrees of dominance in F 1 also vary widely, from intermediate inheritance to <b>incomplete</b> positive <b>dominance</b> and over-dominance...|$|R
50|$|Co-dominance, where allelic {{products}} co-exist in the phenotype, {{is different}} from <b>incomplete</b> <b>dominance,</b> where the quantitative interaction of allele products produces an intermediate phenotype. For example, in co-dominance, a red homozygous flower and a white homozygous flower will produce offspring that have red and white spots. When plants of the F1 generation are self-pollinated, the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the F2 generation will be 1:2:1 (Red:Spotted:White). These ratios {{are the same as}} those for <b>incomplete</b> <b>dominance.</b> Again, note that this classical terminology is inappropriate - in reality such cases should not be said to exhibit dominance at all.|$|E

40|$|Reciprocal {{recurrent}} selection (RRS), which assumes overdominant loci to be important, alters two genetically different populations {{to improve their}} crossbred mean. Individual plants from two populations (A and B) are selfed and also crossed with plants from the reciprocal female tester population (B and A, respectively). Selection {{is based on the}} mean of crossbred families, and the selected individuals are randomly mated within A and B to form new populations. —We propose two alternatives to RRS. The first (RRS-I) uses, as the tester of population A, a population (LB) that is derived from population B by family selection for low yield. The second (RRS-II) is similar to RRS-I, but also uses, as the tester of B, a population (LA) that is derived from population A by family selection for low yield. —The expected crossbred means of RRS, RRS-I, and RRS-II were compared, assuming equal σP, at several cycles of selection for <b>incomplete</b> and complete <b>dominance,</b> and for several cases of overdominance (depending on the gene frequencies in A and B, and on the equilibrium gene frequency). —The choice of selection method depends on the importance of the effects of overdominant loci compared to loci exhibiting <b>incomplete</b> or complete <b>dominance.</b> If overdominance is unimportant, RRS-II is the best selection method, followed by RRS-I and RRS. If overdominance is important, both RRS and RRS-I are superior to RRS-II; RRS is preferred to RRS-I if the effects of overdominant loci are sufficiently important.

One player knows which stage game is played while the other knows only the associated probabilities. When players engage in a prisoner’s dilemma each player prefers unilateral entry. When payoffs form a stag-hunt game, the outcome where neither enters Pareto dominates the outcome where both enter. We ask whether cheap talk aids coordination on the Pareto dominant outcome and whether the informed player can use cheap talk to engineer her preferred outcome.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a review and {{critique}} of several sustainability reporting (SR) frameworks from the perspective of the public and third sectors. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs a literature-based analysis and also critiques several of the major SR frameworks. The current study examines patterning of SR criteria in a group of selected SR guidelines. The research applied content analysis to these frameworks using a number of criteria for coding. Findings – The paper demonstrates that the current SR frameworks are <b>incomplete.</b> Also, the <b>dominance</b> of European based frameworks was noted. Most of the SR frameworks analysed are generic in nature, as they provide broad principles and recommend organisations to specify their indicators, allowing flexibility to organisations in developing the content of their reports. Research implications/limitations – The paper only examines six international and national SR frameworks. Originality/value – There is little prior critical research on the field of SR frameworks for public and third sector organisations. 33 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Reading {{disability}} (dyslexia) {{is introduced}} {{as a failure}} in learning to optimize the coordination of the subfunctions involved in reading with the consequence of errors or delays in integrating reading related information represented in working memory (Functional Coordination Deficit model). Within this multicausal model, so-called reversal errors, such as those typically found in beginning readers and in a subgroup of reading disabled children, are explained {{as a result of}} a failure in optimally integrating visual and auditory information during reading. “Symmetry generalization ” is introduced to describe a mechanism in visual object recognition. It is argued that symmetrically related objects (all axis) are represented in the brain by similar patterns of neural activity (cell assembly). Symmetry generalization, as an result of evolutionary and individual development, is assumed to be learned as an infant to warrant behavioral advantages (object constancy). However, this mechanism may be a hindrance in reading, because graphemes are visual symbols, and as such they have to have a non-ambiguous relation to the respective verbal information (label) they represent. It is argued that learning to read is comprised of learning to treat graphemes as symbols instead of objects, which is assumed to be learned very early during the first stage of reading acquisition. A failure in complete suppression of visually symmetrical information in the representation of visual symbols during reading produces ambiguous relations between visual and phonological information and disturbs the functional coordination, and thus may cause problems in learning to read. It is emphasized that reversal errors do not reflect a visual deficit, an <b>incomplete</b> hemispheric <b>dominance</b> nor the one and only cardinal symptom of dyslexia...|$|R
40|$|Four hundred nine {{first graders}} {{were asked to}} name {{the letters of the}} {{lowercase}} alphabet presented in fixed, nonalphabetical order. In going from the weak to the average to the strong groups of letter namers, the proportion of correct responses for each letter increased. However, an examination of their errors showed that the more competent the group was in letter naming, the higher the proportion of reversal errors in wrong responses (p <. 001). It was concluded that letter reversal errors are not necessarily indicators of a basic perceptual or cognitive deficit. Areversal error in letter recognition occurs when a child looks at a symbol and assigns it the name of its inverted, rotated, or mirror image. The error occurs most frequendy with the complex of symbols b-d-p-q, but also with other easily confused symbols such as u-n and m-w. A reversal error can interfere with a child's ability to read, {{but it can also be}} diagnostic of underlying neurological problems and is thought to carry the prognosis of long-term reading disability. Reversals were seen by Orton (1937) as the major symptom of strephosymbolia. He attributed this problem to a failure of one cerebral hemisphere to establish a clear dominance over the other. While his theory of <b>incomplete</b> hemispheric <b>dominance</b> is no longer accepted (Myers & Hammill 1976), many influential diagnosticians and reading therapists seem to be influenced by its implications. For example, Gillingham (1970) sees reversals as characteristic of children with specific learning disabilities. Gattegno (1966) observes that stu-dents who exhibit reversals are often referred for examination for indications of brain damage. Eisenberg (1966) demonstrates both the rejection of Orton's theory and the legacy of his thinking when he states, "Delayed establishment of laterality and reading defect are probably not causally related but may have a common underlying antecedent. " Not only is the literature replete with associa-tions between reversal errors and neurological disorder, but many psychological tests for organicity also include the premise that rotation...|$|R
40|$|The self-incompatible {{composite}} Senecio Jacobaea (ragwort) exhibits geographic {{variation in}} the frequency of rayed and discoid (rayless) individuals. Hybrid progenies from within- and between-morph crosses were established in a seminatural (garden) environment to determine whether patterns of segregation conform to single-gene predictions (as found in other Senecio species), whether the direction of dominance is conducive to rapid evolutionary change in ray morphology, and whether geographically distant populations of the discoid morph utilize the same or different genes to suppress ray development. Data from segregating F- 2 and BC families were consistent with a genetic model involving one major locus and an unknown number of modifiers. Analysis of F- 1 progenies from different intermorph crosses using the same rayed plant as a seed parent revealed a variable and <b>incomplete</b> pattern of <b>dominance,</b> with a trend toward partial dominance in some crosses.

The F1 generation produced by a cross between red-flowered (RR) and white flowered (WW) Mirabilis jalapa plants consists of pink-colored flowers (RW). Which allele is dominant in this case? Neither one. This third phenotype results from flowers of the heterzygote having less red pigment than the red homozygotes.

This study investigates how the spectral cue of F 0 is processed in neurons of the primary auditory cortex (A 1) with sustained-response properties. We found F 0 -sensitive and-insensitive cells: the former discriminated be-tween harmonics and noise, while the latter did not. F 0 -sensitive cells preferred F 0 s corresponding to the best frequency (BF) and 0. 5 3 BF. The F 0 -sensitivity to F 0 5 0. 5 3 BF was preserved for missing F 0, but abolished by eliminating both F 0 and the second harmonic. The inhibitory subfield of the frequency-receptive field was restricted to the spectral region between the preferred har-monics in F 0 -sensitive cells, while it was frequency unspecific in F 0 -insensitive cells. We conclude that (i) A 1 is well organized for discrimination between harmonics and noise; (ii) pitch-height is represented along with the tonotopic axis; (iii) {{all aspects of the}} sustained neural responses to harmonic and noise stimuli are con-sequences of spectral filtering; and (iv) although the observed cell behavior explains some psychophysical pitch perception behaviors, such as pitch-chroma (helical pitch perception with frequency elevation), pitch-level tolerance and adaptive behavior, F 0 -encoding in A 1 remains at the <b>incomplete</b> perceptual level (<b>dominance</b> of the third to fifth harmonics for pitch strength is unexplainable by the cell behavior) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{inheritance}} and interrelationships between wool, growth and carcass traits was carried out {{as part of the}} development of a large lean white-faced sire breed. Cross-bred progeny, from three sire breeds (Romney, Dorset, and Border Leicester) mated to Romney ewes, provided information on carcass fatness and composition, liveweight, ultra-sonic backfat depth, fleeceweight and objective measures of fleece characteristics. An overall total a total of 28 sires and 765 progeny were used to collect this information. The analysis of half-sib records was carried out under an assumption of positive assortive mating on ultra-sonic backfat depth. It was considered that any bias, relative to random mating, was minimal due to <b>incomplete</b> assortment, <b>dominance,</b> epistasis and crossbreeding influences. It was assumed that the progeny were only half-sibs in relation to breed, and thus the between-breed component only estimated one-quarter of the between-breed variance. Further, the sires were nested within their respective breeds. The data corrected for the significant non-genetic effects before the variance and covariance components were estimated. In general, the estimates of the Within-breed heritability for the wool and growth traits ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 6 and were similar to literature values. The carcass estimates were higher than literature values in most cases. The incorporation of the between-breed component resulted in the between-breed heritability being larger in magnitude. This was may of been due to non-additive genetic effects, such as heterosis, in the between-breed component. The ratio of the between-breed genetic variance to the total genetic variance indicated that there was large between-breed variation in liveweight and wool traits and sma 1 l variation in the carcass traits. The total genetic and total phenotypic correlations presented here suggest that selection for lean growth and wool production can be accomplished by the joint selection of liveweight and greasy fleeceweight. Expected correlated responses in the other traits would include: a) increase liveweight and fleeceweight at all ages, increase ultra-sonic fat depth, GR measurerment, lean content, clean fleeceweight, staple length, mean fibre diameter, clean scoured yield, and b) decrease the carcass C measurement, decrease bone and fat contents, and loose wool bulk. Selection against ultra-sonic backfat depth would result in leaner animals at a constant weight. But the moderately positive correlations with liveweight and fleeceweight would appear to negate the associated advantage of a reduction in carcass fatness...|$|R

With the increasing availability of various data sources, the preference queries {{are essential to}} find the relevant results to users. Several preference functions has been introduced in literature including: top-k [1], skylines [2], distributed skyline [3], spatial skyline [4], multi-objective [5], k-dominance [6], k-frequency [7], and ranked skylines [8], k-representative dominance [9], distance-based dominance [10], -skylines [11], top-k dominance [12], and stochastic skyline [13]. With {{the growing number of}} applications that generate imprecise data, e. g., sensor readings, human reading errors, and data imperfection, it has become essential to support preference queries of various types over imprecise data. Imprecise data can be classified into two categories: incomplete and uncertain data. Unfortunately, existing work for preference queries for the imprecise data are limited and isolated. This thesis addresses efficiently extending DBMS to be preference-aware over imprecise data. First, we address the problem of skyline queries over incomplete data where multi-dimensional data items are missing some values of their dimensions. We show that with <b>incomplete</b> data, the <b>dominance</b> relation among data points may not be transitive, thus, almost all existing techniques for skyline queries are not applicable. We propose an efficient algorithm to compute the skyline over incomplete data. Then, we define preference queries over uncertain data, represented as a continuous range. We propose a novel, efficient framework to answer these preference queries. Then, we present PrefJoin, an efficient preference-aware join query operator, designed specifically to deal with preference queries where the set of preferred attributes reside in more than one relation. The main idea of PrefJoin is to make the join operator aware of the required preference functionality. Finally, we extend PrefJoin framework to realize an efficient preference-aware operator which support imprecise data. The extended framework is denoted as PrefJoin*...|$|R

The intermediate interaction occurs where the heterozygous genotype produces a phenotype intermediate between the two homozygotes. Depending on which of the two homozygotes the heterozygote most resembles, one allele is said to show <b>incomplete</b> <b>dominance</b> over the other. For example, in humans the Hb gene locus is responsible for the Beta-chain protein (HBB) {{that is one of the}} two globin proteins that make up the blood pigment hemoglobin Many people are homozygous for an allele called HbA; some persons carry an alternative allele called HbS, either as homozygotes or heterozygotes. The hemoglobin molecules of HbS/HbS homozygotes undergo a change in shape that distorts the morphology of the red blood cells, and causes a severe, life-threatening form of anemia called sickle-cell anemia. Persons heterozygous HbA/HbS for this allele have a much less severe form of anemia called sickle-cell trait. Because the disease phenotype of HbA/HbS heterozygotes is more similar to but not identical to the HbA/HbA homozygote, the HbA allele is said to be incompletely dominant to the HbS allele.|$|E
