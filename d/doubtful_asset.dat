Using the the Two-Step Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) {{described}} by Arellano and Bond (1991) for dynamic panels, this paper analyzes {{the profitability of}} 25 commercial banks in Turkey over the period from 2003 to 2011. Our profitability determinants include bank-specific characteristics as well as industry-specific and macroeconomic factors, {{some of which have}} not been considered in previous studies. We conclude that the high bank profitability during these years is associated with a large percentage of loans in total assets, a low proportion of liquid asset, good efficiency and a low <b>doubtful</b> <b>assets</b> ratio. In addition, higher capital ratios also increase the bank’s return, but only when return on assets and return on equities is used as the profitability measure. We find evidence of economies of scale in the Turkish banking sector. Empirical results show that there is a negative relationship between financial development and profitability. We find also there is a positive relationship between bank concentration and bank performance in Turkish banking industry, consisting with the structure-conduct-performance (SCP) hypothesis. The results also suggest that there is a negative relation between the foreign ownership and profitability, indicating that foreign banks do not in general make relatively higher profit, at least during the period under the consideration...|$|R

Regional Rural Banks are the youngest members in the family of rural banking in India. RRBs are mandated to purvey credit in rural areas, especially to the weaker sections of society. This innovation in rural credit institutions has a unique role in the enormous rural development. Thus, the RRBs in India normally depend on the internal guidance and functioning support in devising an effective policy and strategies for NPAs management. The present study is confined from 2006 – 2007 to 2010 – 2011 further the study depends mainly on secondary date obtained from the bank both published and unpublished. The NPA details of the Pandyan Grama bank were collected from the higher officials of the bank. This study is mainly analyses the three categories (D 1, D 2 &D 3) of <b>Doubtful</b> <b>Assets.</b> The simple statistical tools like percentage and trend line techniques have been adopted for the study. It may be concluded from the analysis that the recovery performance better in Education Loans, Small Scale loans to the industries, Crop loan and Kisan Credit. But the recovery performance is very poor in Loans given to the Self Help Groups...|$|R

40|$|The recent Global Economic {{meltdown}} {{triggered by}} the subprime mortgage crisis of United States in 2007 and its adverse effect on financial markets and participants in the financial industry worldwide {{have resulted in a}} capital management crisis in most financial institutions especially banks. This study is a case for the Nigerian banking industry, focusing on factors affecting risk management efficiency in banks. For empirical investigation, we employed Panel regression analysis taking a stratum of time series data and cross-sectional variants of macro and bank-specific factors for period covering 2003 to 2009. Result for panel regression indicates that risk management efficiency in Nigerian banks is not just affected by bank-specific factors but also by macroeconomic variables. This describes the pro-cyclicality of bank performance in the Nigerian banking sector. As it stands, the sufficiency of Basel principles for risk management is <b>doubtful</b> because <b>asset</b> quality varies with business cycles. ...|$|R
2500|$|After the London branch failed, it {{was turned}} into a accomando and placed {{under the control of the}} Bruges branch, managed by the third of the Portinari brothers, Tommaso Portinari. This branch, too, would soon fail. Portinari had managed the Bruges branch for decades, and had {{steadily}} proven himself to be a poor managerhe engaged in business dealings on the side, ingratiated himself with the Burgundian court by excessive loans (first to secure the farming of the toll of Gravelinewhich was never very profitableand then to mingle socially and elevate himself), made poor business deals like purchasing two galleys (which would be partially sold off at a loss; the rest would be lost to shipwreck and piracy). The debts from the London branch were assumed by the Bruges branch. After Piero's death, Portinari managed to get articles of partnership so favorable that he lived in Florence, only visiting the Low Countries for business. The end-period of the branch would be marked by chaos and possibly fraud. Portinari would refuse to return some deposits, claiming that the monies had really been invested in partnership. He would also claim Angelo Tani as a full partner (and thus liable in the losses), despite the fact that Tani never signed the articles or written with his approval. The magnitude of the financial failures is hard to state. In a surviving memorandum, Lorenzo the Magnificent gives the bad debts to Charles the Bold alone as the sum of 16,150 pounds groat. The articles of partnership, incidentally, strictly forbade Portinari to lend more than the total of 6,000 pounds groat. In another memorandum, Lorenzo faults Portinari for the clever ruse of shifting all the London branch's business to the Bruges branchexcept for the profitable wool business. Portinari bought into the separate partnership to the tune of 45%, whereas his share in the Bruges branch was only 27.5%. The branch was liquidated in 1478 with staggering losses. The failure of the Bruges branch meant that not only the debts of that branch had to be handled somehow, but also the outstanding debts of the former London branch. In total, upwards of 70,000 gold florins were lost. This figure is optimistic, since it assumes most book assets were worth the recorded value. As Lorenzo remarked, [...] "These are the great profits which are accruing to us through the management of Tommaso Portinari." [...] Lorenzo refused to take this loss lying down, and dispatched a trusted agent to Bruges to audit the books and dissolve the partnership. Portinari ironically found himself hoisted by his own petard; he could not refuse the dissolution, since the maggiore Lorenzo had given the proper notice, and he further had to accept his own cooked books because he claimed that the books were accurate and the rather <b>doubtful</b> <b>assets</b> listed were indeed worth what they were worth. The agent Ricasoli was aided in this task by Angelo Tani, who came all the way from Florence to settle the matter of his supposed partnership in the London branch through the Bruges branch.|$|R
