Urbanization brings about fundamental {{changes in the way}} people live and work and has profound implications for the health of those who live in cities. Along with chronic and degenerative diseases in the developed nations, the expeditious spread of infectious diseases in the developing world threatens the very cohesion of society. In 2002, twenty six percent of all worldwide deaths were the result of communicable disease infection. Around 90 per cent of infections in developing countries are attributed to water borne diseases resulting from concentrated urbanization and industrialised agricultural practices. This paper will address health problems associated with the built environment in areas of rapid urbanization and poverty, and in particular the health impacts of marginalization, social exclusion, and inequity associated with built form and <b>dispersed</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns.</b> It argues that the accelerated pace of urbanization requires that infectious disease is understood as a global challenge of improving public health, securing socio-economic well-being, and advancing sustainable development...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} shift in human societies has been the change from <b>dispersed</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> toward a complex urban pattern. Prior to the industrialization {{there were only a}} few urban places scattered throughout the world and none could compare with numerous cities of today with respect to size and complexity. In recent decades the growth of cities in Asia has been particularly remarkable as there has been an increase in the number of medium sized cities and the growth of a number of mega cities. This urbanization of the worlds population has corresponded with other fundamental changes in human society although the relationship between urbanization and other social changes differ for time periods and regions of the world. Among the other changes were the transition from an agricultural toward a diverse economic structure and tremendous increases in population size along with declines in birth and death rates. Many researchers view these changes as being interlocked in a complex set of reciprocal causal relationship. This paper reviews explanations of urbanization with a focus on the emergence of mega cities and their relationship to smaller cities and to national levels of economic development. Special attention is given to literature on primate cities and to whether such cities hinder economic development for Asian societies...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to make an {{assessment}} on the socio-economic impacts of low population density, peripherality and cold climate in the Northern regions of Sweden and in Northern and Eastern regions of Finland. The study has focused on demographic sparsity as a core element for understanding of the specific needs of these regions. Sparsity has indeed been defined as characterising regions where extremely low population densities and <b>disperse</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> create specific challenges for economic activity and public service provision. A central question is the scale at which one should approach demographic sparsity in order to give the most accurate account of economic challenges connected to low population densities. A second main characteristic of these regions is peripherality, as reflected by the distance to the main European markets. This induces additional transport costs both for individuals and industries, and makes it difficult to access good and services produced in European core areas. Cold climate constitutes an additional challenge for these Northern Nordic regions, which can easily be observed at the scale of individual persons or companies. While it is generally not meaningful to seek to quantify the general macroeconomic impact of this factor, some narrower economic approaches of cold climate have been developed...|$|R

50|$|Salem Village was a {{contentious}} {{place to live}} and was known to be quarrelsome by neighbouring towns and villages. Its <b>dispersed</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> may have resulted in a lack of a sense of common purpose that may have united more orderly and arranged communities. Parris was the fourth minister appointed in a series of unsuccessful attempts to keep a permanent minister. James Bayley (1673-79) and George Burroughs (1680-83), each stayed only a few years, departing after the congregation failed to pay their full rates. Deodat Lawson (1684-88) left with less contention. Further tension was caused by Parris' delay in accepting the position and his inability to resolve his parishioners' disputes. There were disputes over Parris' compensation. In October 1691 the town decided to stop paying his wages. The issue was further antagonized by Parris' perceived arrogance when he purchased gold candlesticks for the meetinghouse and new vessels for the sacraments. These issues, and others that were more personal between the villagers, continued to grow unabated.|$|E

40|$|Human <b>settlement</b> {{and travel}} <b>patterns</b> are closely interrelated. Given that both have major {{implications}} for natural resources (land, soil, energy) and substantial environmental impacts (emissions, noise, threat of accidents, barriers in urban environments), they are factors of major {{significance for the}} sustainability of towns and regions. The continuing expansion of human settlements is attributable not only to growing space demands arising from almost all forms of urban land use. The use of private motor vehicles in particular consumes immense areas of land and fuels urban sprawl. Increasingly <b>disperse</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns,</b> or the suburbanization of the environs of cities, further expand travel demand and dependence on private cars. The result is a self-perpetuating, spiralling growth of settlements and traffic volumes. In the new Laender, this process is concentrated in an unusually short time frame, with all the attendant repercussions such as loss of open landscapes, higher energy consumption and continuing emissions. It is clear, if only for the reasons stated above, that the problem cannot be solved merely by improving traffic management and by switching to greener modes of transport alone, but that the traffic volume needs to be reduced by appropriate regional planning. The universally accepted formula for a traffic policy which is environmentally sound and relieves urban stress is therefore: avoid traffic, shift traffic flows, reduce the impacts of traffic on the environment. The choice of sequence is deliberate and intended to express an order of priorities. However, traffic avoidance in practice {{is still in its}} infancy. (orig.)

50|$|Archaeologists {{believe that}} the Plaquemine culture {{builders}} were the ancestors of the historic Natchez, who inhabited the area and used Emerald Mound site as their main ceremonial center at time of first European contact. At its height, Emerald {{would have been the}} center of religious and civic rituals for the area, with the ceremonial center located on top of Emerald Mound, an unusual feature rarely seen in other mound centers. The secondary mounds were the bases of a temple and residence of a priest or ruler and other elites. By the late 1730s, the Natchez had abandoned Emerald, possibly because of social upheaval that followed extensive fatalities from European diseases introduced to the American Southeast by the de Soto expedition in the 1540s. By the time of the La Salle Expedition of 1682, the tribe's main ceremonial center was located at the Grand Village of the Natchez or Fatherland site, 12 mi to the southwest. Emerald was abandoned during the French colonial period, and the hereditary chief lived at the Grand Village.

40|$|The mode {{share of}} public {{transportation}} in North America has generally not increased despite the continued influx of substantial public subsidies. <b>Dispersed</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns</b> are largely to blame for persistently low ridership. But even in densely populated metropolitan areas transit’s mode share remains below par. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) promises to become a public investment strategy that can considerably increase transit’s mode share in North America with relatively low capital and operating costs. The concept of BRT has first been developed in Curitiba, Brazil in 1972. Two years later Curitiba started its first 12 -mile-long BRT service. Since then, other South and Central American cities (e. g., Bogotá, Quito, Santiago) have introduced BRT {{as a way to}} move a large number of passengers without having to build or expand light rail or underground rail facilities. 1 BRT facilities have also emerged in North American cities such as in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Richmond-Berkeley-Oakland, and Vancouver, BC, and several new BRT systems are in the planning stage. In order to establish itself as a convincing alternative to the private automobile, BRT in North America has to provide fast, reliable, and comfortable service. In addition to providing superior service regarding time and comfort, BRT, I am going to argue, has {{to play a major role}} as place maker. Clearly defined bus ways and stations that function as attractive neighborhood anchors announce a new chapter of urban mobility and livability. BRT vehicles, in appearance and comfort, are to reflect this high design and service standard. A wide-ranging use of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) makes it possible that all BRT elements work together efficiently and reliably. This paper is a review of studies of existing BRT systems. With a special focus on blending urban design, art, and ITS, I want to spell out imperatives for successful BRT implementation through the application of the following essential design principles: 1.

With {{a population of}} less than 10, 000, Telugus are a sub-minority group living predominantly in the Hounslow and Newham areas, {{and the majority of}} them working in IT-related jobs. Based on their time of arrival (pre- and post- 2000), two waves of participants, 109 in total, participated in this first sociological study of language in the UK. Using surveys, interviews and field observations, language use in domains and social networks, ethnolinguistic vitality, and perceptions about language and identity were studied. Restricted use of the heritage language and a low vitality towards the own language group suggest that there is a rapid language shift within the second generation. The early first-generation migrants (wave 1) showed more integration into the dominant society and language shift is complete among their children. This was due to the <b>dispersed</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>patterns,</b> a small heritage language network, length of residence and favourable attitudes towards the dominant language and culture. The first generation of wave 2 was observed to be more active as a group and have favourable attitudes towards the maintenance of their heritage language. Reasons for this include increased networking opportunities with the Telugus in London/UK, opportunities to live as cohesive communities, increased contact with India and advances in communication technology. Children of wave 2 were observed to have oracy skills; however, the high vitality assigned to the dominant group and the use of English among same-language friends suggests subtractive rather than additive bilingualism. The new communication technologies, travels, kinship ties, media and cultural associations are allowing people to get together and celebrate their identity through festivals, films and cultural events. The study finds that there has been an increase in Telugu cultural activities around London in recent years. However, they do not seem to influence the language maintenance of the second generation of each wave. Findings suggest that language shift rather than maintenance is dominant. However, the identity of being a Telugu is maintained, regardless of linguistic ability...|$|R

Pollen record of two small palaeoecological sites (Mlaka and Griblje) indicates that human impact on the vegetation at circa 4150 calBC was intensive (forest cutting/burning, beech decline and formation of fields, pastures, meadows) and can be associated with numerous Neolithic/Eneolithic sites, located in the Lahinja river basin and the Kolpa lowlands. Human pressure on the (lowland/riverine) environment slightly decreased between c. 3750 – 2850 calBC. This coincides with the appearance of a more <b>dispersed</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern,</b> including the formation of short-term settlement/activity areas on the karst plateau.

The diachronic perspective of these surveys {{has led to a}} serious treatment of the medieval material, which was frequently dismissed in the past. This work presents the results of the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project, a multi-period intensive regional survey of a small region of approximately 80 sq. Kms. centered on the Nemea valley in the Northeast Peloponnese. The pattern and development of the medieval settlement system in the Nemea area is reconstructed {{on the basis of the}} archaeological evidence recovered by the survey. The archaeological evidence of the 11 th- 13 th centuries A. D. reveals a <b>pattern</b> of <b>dispersed</b> <b>settlement,</b> a <b>pattern</b> which must reflect the intense level of agricultural activity in the countryside at this time. There are two large residential sites with archaeological material of this period and a substantial number of small sites, most probably the remains of farmsteads, scattered throughout the survey area. Intensive farming appears to be the preferred strategy in the Medieval period. Documentary evidence from other areas in Greece supports this interpretation. The 11 th and 12 th centuries A. D. are viewed as a time of prosperity, a period of economic and demographic expansion. The archaeological evidence from Nemea supports this trend of economic expansion. In particular, the 12 th and 13 th centuries A. D. were periods of dense settlement and intensive cultivation in the area. This picture changes in the 14 th century A. D. In the Nemea region there is lack of widespread archaeological material from the 14 th century onwards. <b>Dispersed</b> <b>settlement</b> ceases and is replaced by nucleated settlement and the emergence of a fortified town on a precipitous mountain known as Polyphengi.

As a result, the settlements of the Orochon as hunter-gatherers in many cases consisted of several households from 1900 to 1940.

So far the residential mobility has been found in the world hunter-gatherer societies, such as those of the San, Mbuti Pygmie, Hadza, Hare Indian, Inuit, and Ainu.

The thesis makes an important contribution to Oman studies by addressing this gap through the study of the urban pattern and architecture of two vernacular foothill settlements – Ḥarāt al- Ḥamrā and Ḥarāt as-Saybānī in Birkat al- Mawz in the Dākhliya (Interior) region of central Oman.

In this period, migrants were attracted into the region and new small communities were created. After a period of <b>dispersed</b> <b>settlement</b> <b>pattern</b> communities, some of the communities developed large, aggregated settlements.

In spite of these social integrative forces, community dissolution and abandonment sooner or later came to all of these settlements. The technology of daily life is one means of exploring these social organizational forces. Chipped stone studies have been behind the times in the American Southwest when addressing social organization research through the examination of Pueblo chipped stone assemblages. Technological organization is a creation of households and suprahousehold groups. Technological organization changes as community organization changes. This study examines the chipped stone tools and debitage from ten east-central Arizona pueblos, forming inferences about how the organization of chipped stone tool production, distribution, consumption, and discard was arranged in each community. Each community studied was a product of migrants and resident families, social exchanges, social integration, and social dissolution.
