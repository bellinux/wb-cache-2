50|$|The Seamen's Compensation Act was {{a uniform}} law that {{applied to all}} seamen on Australian {{registered}} ships and to Australian seamen on British and foreign ships engaged in the Australian <b>coasting</b> <b>trade.</b> The <b>coasting</b> <b>trade</b> was defined as carrying cargo from one port in Australia to another, even if those ports {{were in the same}} State. Because the trade and commerce power is limited to overseas and inter-state trade, there needed to be some other head of federal power to support its validity in providing for intrastate trade. The Commonwealth argued this power was found in sections 76(iii) and 98 of the Constitution.|$|R

Barton J held that the definition of <b>coasting</b> <b>trade</b> was unambiguous {{and it was not}} the role of the Court to re-write the definition to make it constitutional. O'Connor J held that the provisions of the Act could not be separated, such that the entire Act was invalid. Isaacs J held that Parliament had made no distinction between inter-State and intra-State trade and that the enactment was therefore invalid.|$|R
