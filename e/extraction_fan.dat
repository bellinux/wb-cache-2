It was decided that the use of an <b>extraction</b> <b>fan</b> and tunnel doors would be sufficient to allow diesel operation, and so {{the decision was made to}} decommission the Otira electrification which was no longer capable of meeting modern requirements, and was also largely worn out after 74 years of heavy use.|$|E
50|$|Certain plants (e.g. most {{strains of}} cannabis) emit a {{distinctive}} odor during their reproductive phase. This presents difficulties {{to those who}} are cultivating in places where it is illegal, or for growers who may prefer discretion for other reasons. The most common way of eliminating odor is by pulling odorous air through a carbon filter. Many cultivators simply attach a large carbon filter to their air extraction system, thereby filtering any smell before the air is expelled from the grow-room. Another way of eliminating odor is by installing an ozone generator in the extraction ducting. The air is forced past the ozone generator by the <b>extraction</b> <b>fan,</b> and the odorous air is neutralized as it mixes with the ozone; however the cultivator must ensure that the air is thoroughly mixed before it is expelled outside, lest some odor escape. Care must be taken to prevent excessive ozone concentrations in the garden itself, or where it might be inhaled by the grower or his/her family. Ozone itself has a distinctive smell and is harmful to living things, although the molecule breaks down quickly (20 minutes to an hour) in atmospheric conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} of double-skin facade (DSF) systems, ranging between their aesthetic architectural benefits, acoustic benefits {{and ability to}} decrease the heating demand of the internal environment, have increased their popularity in Europe since the mid- 1980 s.

40|$|Abstract: Displacement {{ventilation}} is a {{low cost}} ventilation technique used in distributing conditioned air in Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This is a ventilation strategy well suited to significantly reduce building energy consumption {{in this age of}} high energy costs, global warming and climate change. This is achieved through the leveraging of natural buoyancy driven flow in the conditioned space in a way that minimizes energy expenditure in supply and <b>extraction</b> <b>fans.</b> In addition, the conditioned air is supplied at higher temperature implying lower energy demand for cooling units. The global legislative move towards greener buildings demands the use of sustainable and energy efficient air conditioning systems of which displacement ventilation makes a major contribution. One of the challenges in using displacement ventilation is the stratified temperature distribution in the conditioned space. The temperature gradients between the ceiling and the floor can lead to decreased comfort conditions. One approach to overcome this problem is to use the chilled ceiling. How does one size the chilled ceiling system in such cases? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a detailed design analysis of a displacement ventilation chamber that includes chilled ceiling.

40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{automate}} terrain feature mapping so that to make the process more objective and less time consuming by using proper feature extraction techniques. The objective of this study was the use of object-oriented image analysis methods for the automatic <b>extraction</b> of alluvial <b>fan</b> terrain units. The study area was located in the Death Valley, Nevada, USA. The data used included an ASTER L 1 satellite image and the 1 o Digital Elevation Model. The methodology developed for alluvial <b>fan</b> <b>extraction</b> included preprocessing of the digital data: filtering of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for noise removal, a Fourier Transform Wedge filter for the elimination of striping in the ASTER data and geometric co-registration of the satellite and DEM data. A multiresolution segmentation technique was then developed, delivering object primitives at four resolution levels. At the first and finest level, three physiographic feature types (basins, piedmonts and mountains) were extracted from the DEM {{to be used in the}} rule-based fuzzy classification of the following levels. Then, a knowledge base including definitions of Alluvial materials, Mountains, Basin floor salt deposits and Basin floor sediments was implemented. The second level was classified by the nearest neighbour classifier using spectral information for the first iteration of the classification procedure. For a second iteration, the knowledge base was further expanded primarily with heuristics concerning contextual information of the alluvial materials related to the geomorphological features extracted at the first level. Finally, in the last level, a projection was made, classifying the image into two classes: Alluvial Fans and Not Alluvial fans. The method gave good results in detecting alluvial fan units, working best for large shape alluvial fans. Some minor problems were encountered for the smaller alluvial fans, due to the difficulty of their boundar...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{welfare is}} a matter of {{increasing}} interest due to ethical and economical worries regarding animal rights and the sustainability of meat production. Ammonia, carbon dioxide, and methane can be produced in the livestock buildings and, if not adequately controlled by ventilation, can be dangerous for animals and farmers. The aim of the present paper is to study the effects of different ventilation systems in rabbit buildings based on the temporal patterns and the spatial distribution of these noxious gases. The experimental measurements were conducted in two rabbit farms with genetically homogeneous animals subjected to the same diet. Two buildings with different forced ventilation layouts (cross ventilation - building A and longitudinal ventilation - building B) were subjected to the monitoring of indoor environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity, ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane) over a whole year. In both the buildings, ventilation was adjusted automatically by means of electronic control units, which were controlled by temperature sensors, located at the centre of the buildings. Gas concentrations inside the buildings followed clearly defined sinusoidal patterns on a daily basis with the highest values reached in winter during the morning hours for ammonia and during the night hours for carbon dioxide and methane. In particular, ammonia revealed a maximum concentration of 30. 7 mg m – 3 in building A (cross ventilation) and 12. 9 mg m – 3 in building B (longitudinal ventilation), whereas the minimum values were 6. 0 and 4. 2 mg m – 3, in building A and B, respectively. As a consequence, daily mean concentrations of noxious gases, solely could not be considered representative of the actual conditions of air quality in the buildings. The airflow direction clearly influenced the spatial concentration of ammonia, which showed different patterns in the two buildings. In building A, the highest ammonia concentration was in a diffuse central area, whereas in building B, it was determined to be less extended and located in the proximity of the wall equipped with <b>extraction</b> <b>fans.</b> The results of this study provide important indications for the planning and management of housing systems for rabbits including: the correct positioning of gas sensors for regulating ventilation systems must be central in case of cross ventilation, but close to the suction fans in case of longitudinal ventilation; the cross ventilation can lead to ammonia concentration higher than longitudinal ventilation, which is caused by the close and prolonged contact of airflow with manure surface in the channels; fans for longitudinal ventilation must be positioned in {{the same side of the}} building where scrapers discharge manure; furthermore, manure scraping has to be performed daily in winter during the hours of the day when ventilation rate is at its maximum...|$|R
