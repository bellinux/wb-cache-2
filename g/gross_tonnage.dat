5|$|At 18:00, {{with the}} rest of the pursuit far behind, Paulet succeeded in {{bringing}} Gloire within range of the cannon on his ship's quarterdeck. Opening fire with these guns brought a response from Beens' sternchaser guns, the frigates exchanging cannon shot for four and a half hours as Astraea slowly caught up with its elusive opponent. At 22:30, Paulet was finally close enough to lay Astraea alongside Gloire and the two frigates exchanged fire at close range for the next 58 minutes, Paulet concentrating his gunnery on the hull of the French ship while Beens' ordered his men to disable the British ship's rigging and masts. Gloire was a substantially larger ship than Astraea, both in weight of shot and <b>gross</b> <b>tonnage,</b> and the battle was fiercely contested: Beens suffered a head injury and all three of Astraeas topmasts taking serious damage, so much so that the main topmast collapsed in the aftermath of the action. However at 23:28, with two British ships of the line visible in the distance, Beens surrendered his ship to Paulet.|$|E
