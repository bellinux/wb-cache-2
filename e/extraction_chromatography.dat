5|$|Another {{method to}} isolate {{mendelevium}} exploits the distinct elution properties of Md2+ {{from those of}} Es3+ and Fm3+. The initial steps {{are the same as}} above, and employs HDEHP for <b>extraction</b> <b>chromatography,</b> but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1Mhydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury. The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with 2Mhydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6Mhydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium). It is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc amalgam, using 1Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant, reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals. Thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium hexafluoroacetylacetonate: the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile.|$|E
