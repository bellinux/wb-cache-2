In 1891, an inclined plane was installed at Stanley Ferry to connect the colliery directly to the canal. The 15 ft wide compartments carrying 35 tons of coal were balanced on standard gauge railway wagons. Despite the precarious nature of this operation, no accidents were recorded.Because of the success of the system, by 1913 there were over 1,000 Tom Puddings in use and they were transporting 1500000 LT of coal per year, which compares well with Warde-Aldam's original estimate of 45,000 tons per year.|$|R

Since d was <b>free</b> <b>on</b> Fx before the inversion and Fx is on the path, Fx is an endpoint of the cdu path and c will be <b>free</b> <b>on</b> Fx after the inversion. The inversion will change the color of (u, F+ 1) from d to c. Thus, since c is now <b>free</b> <b>on</b> Fx and (1) holds, F remains a fan.
