5|$|The most {{frequent}} symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, tremors, agitation, fearfulness, and muscle spasms. The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, depersonalization, derealization, hypersensitivity to stimuli, depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, seizures, and <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens.</b> Severe symptoms usually {{occur as a}} result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal. Abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous, therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended.|$|E
5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens,</b> hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
5|$|Her {{mother died}} from {{diphtheria}} on December 7, 1892, and Elliott Jr. {{died of the}} same disease the following May. Her father, an alcoholic confined to a sanitarium, died on August 14, 1894 after jumping from a window during a fit of <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens.</b> He survived the fall but died from a seizure. Eleanor's childhood losses left her prone to depression throughout her life. Her brother Hall later suffered from alcoholism. Before her father died, he implored her {{to act as a}} mother towards Hall, and it was a request she made good upon for the rest of Hall's life. Eleanor doted on Hall, and when he enrolled at Groton School in 1907, she accompanied him as a chaperone. While he was attending Groton, she wrote him almost daily, but always felt a touch of guilt that Hall had not had a fuller childhood. She took pleasure in Hall's brilliant performance at school, and was proud of his many academic accomplishments, which included a master's degree in engineering from Harvard.|$|E
5|$|Most of Rainilaiarivony's {{children}} {{failed to}} achieve their full potential. One son, Rafozehana, died young of <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens,</b> and sons Ratsimandresy and Ralaiarivony both met violent ends while still in their youth. Randravalahy, to whom Rainilaiarivony later ascribed the name Radilifera, was sent to France to study but returned before earning his diploma and faded into obscurity among the upper classes of Imerina. Ramangalahy studied medicine and {{was on his way}} to becoming a successful doctor, but died of illness in his twenties. Three brothers turned to crime: Rajoelina, who violated the laws of his country to enrich himself by selling contraband gold to an English company; Penoelina, who studied in England before health issues recalled him to Madagascar, where he and his friends engaged in sexual assault and theft; and Ramariavelo (Mariavelo), who organized a group of bandits to rob the houses of common citizens. One of Rainilaiarivony's daughters died in her twenties following a self-induced abortion, and the rest married and lived quiet lives out of public view.|$|E
5|$|Severe acute {{withdrawal}} {{symptoms such as}} <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase {{can be defined as}} lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the post-acute withdrawal syndrome; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years. These post-acute {{withdrawal symptoms}} have also been demonstrated in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal. A kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview {{while at the same time}} retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.|$|E

25|$|<b>Delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> due {{to alcohol}} {{withdrawal}} {{can be treated}} with benzodiazepines. High doses {{may be necessary to}} prevent death.

25|$|<b>Delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> {{is mainly}} caused by {{a long period of}} {{drinking}} being stopped abruptly. Withdrawal leads to a biochemical regulation cascade. It may also be triggered by head injury, infection, or illness in people with a history of heavy use of alcohol.|$|E
25|$|The {{committee}} {{recommended that}} withdrawal from benzodiazepines be gradual, as abrupt withdrawal from {{high doses of}} benzodiazepines may cause confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens.</b> Abrupt withdrawal from lower doses may cause depression, nervousness, rebound insomnia, irritability, sweating, and diarrhea.|$|E

25|$|Less {{common side}} effects may include: Hypotension, faintness, palpitation, rash or pruritus, {{gastrointestinal}} disturbances, {{and changes in}} libido are less common. Very infrequently, paradoxical reactions may occur, for example, excitement, stimulation, hallucinations, hyperactivity, and insomnia. Also, depressed or increased dreaming, disorientation, severe sedation, retrograde amnesia, headache, hypothermia, and <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> are reported. Severe liver toxicity has also been reported.|$|E
25|$|<b>Delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> (DTs) is a rapid {{onset of}} {{confusion}} usually caused by withdrawal from alcohol. When it occurs, {{it is often}} three days into the withdrawal symptoms and lasts {{for two to three}} days. Physical effects may include shaking, shivering, irregular heart rate, and sweating. People may also see or hear things other people do not. Occasionally, a very high body temperature or seizures may result in death. Alcohol {{is one of the most}} dangerous drugs from which to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{treating}} withdrawal symptoms. If <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> occurs, aggressive treatment improves outcomes. Treatment {{in a quiet}} intensive care unit with sufficient light is often recommended. Benzodiazepines are the medication of choice with diazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and oxazepam all commonly used. They should be given until a person is lightly sleeping. The antipsychotic haloperidol may also be used. The vitamin thiamine is recommended. Mortality without treatment is between 15% and 40%. Currently death occurs in about 1% to 4% of cases.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause of}} <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> is abrupt {{stopping}} of tranquilizer drugs of the barbiturate or benzodiazepine classes {{in a person}} with a relatively strong addiction to them. Because these tranquilizers' primary pharmacological and physiological effects stem from their manipulation of the GABA chemical and transmitter somatic system, the same neurotransmitter system affected by alcohol, <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> can occur upon abrupt decrease of dosage in those who are heavily dependent. These DTs are much the same as those caused by alcohol and so is the attendant withdrawal syndrome of which they are a manifestation. That is the primary reason benzodiazepines are such an effective treatment for DTs, despite also being the cause of them in many cases. Because ethanol and tranquilizers such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines function as positive allosteric modulators at GABAA receptors, the brain, in its desire to equalize an unbalanced chemical system, triggers the abrupt stopping of the production of endogenous GABA. This decrease becomes more and more marked as the addiction becomes stronger and as higher doses are needed to cause intoxication. In addition to having sedative properties, GABA is an immensely important regulatory neurotransmitter that controls the heart rate, blood pressure, and seizure threshold among myriad other important autonomic nervous subsystems.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{withdrawal}} syndrome {{is a set}} of symptoms that can occur following a reduction in alcohol use after a period of excessive use. Symptoms typically include anxiety, shakiness, sweating, vomiting, fast heart rate, and a mild fever. More severe symptoms may include seizures, seeing or hearing things that others do not, and <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> (DTs). receptors. The mechanism behind kindling is sensitization of some neuronal systems and desensitization of other neuronal systems which leads to increasingly gross neurochemical imbalances. This in turn leads to more profound withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, convulsions and neurotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{mechanism}} of action with various sedative compounds that act by enhancing the GABAA receptor. Cross tolerance means that one drug will alleviate the withdrawal effects of another. It also means that tolerance of one drug will result in tolerance of another similarly-acting drug. Benzodiazepines are often used for this reason to detoxify alcohol-dependent patients and can have life-saving properties in preventing or treating severe life-threatening withdrawal syndromes from alcohol, such as <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens.</b> However, although benzodiazepines can be very useful in the acute detoxification of alcoholics, benzodiazepines in themselves act as positive reinforcers in alcoholics, by increasing the desire for alcohol. Low doses of benzodiazepines were found to significantly increase the level of alcohol consumed in alcoholics. Alcoholics dependent on benzodiazepines should not be abruptly withdrawn but be very slowly withdrawn from benzodiazepines, as over-rapid withdrawal is likely to produce severe anxiety or panic, which {{is well known for}} being a relapse risk factor in recovering alcoholics.|$|E
500|$|Newspapers at {{the time}} {{reported}} Poe's death as [...] "congestion of the brain" [...] or [...] "cerebral inflammation", common euphemisms for deaths from disreputable causes such as alcoholism. The actual cause of death remains a mystery. Speculation has included <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens,</b> heart disease, epilepsy, syphilis, meningeal inflammation, cholera, and rabies. One theory dating from 1872 suggests that cooping {{was the cause of}} Poe's death, a form of electoral fraud in which citizens were forced to vote for a particular candidate, sometimes leading to violence and even murder.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{other causes}} of death have been {{proposed}} over the years, including several forms of rare brain disease or a brain tumor, diabetes, various types of enzyme deficiency, syphilis, apoplexy, <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens,</b> epilepsy and meningeal inflammation. A doctor named John W. Francis examined Poe in May 1848 and believed Poe had heart disease, which Poe later denied. A 2006 test of a sample of Poe's hair provides evidence against the possibility of lead poisoning, mercury poisoning, and similar toxic heavy-metal exposures. Cholera has also been suggested. Poe had passed through Philadelphia in early 1849 during a cholera epidemic. He got sick during {{his time in the}} city and wrote a letter to his aunt, Maria Clemm, saying that he may [...] "have had the cholera, or spasms quite as bad".|$|E
500|$|In 1861, at {{the height}} of his fame, Wills joined his father on an eight-month trek into the Queensland outback to {{establish}} a family property. Two weeks after their arrival, Wills' father and 18 others were murdered in the largest massacre of settlers by Aborigines in Australian history. Wills survived and resumed playing sport upon his return to Victoria in 1864, and in 1866–67, led an Aboriginal cricket team on an Australian tour as its captain-coach. In a career marked by controversy, Wills challenged cricket's amateur-professional divide, and was frequently accused of bending rules to the point of cheating. An admitted [...] "chucker", Wills was no-balled out of major cricket in 1872. He failed in an 1876 comeback attempt, by which time his glory years belonged to a colonial past that seemed [...] "like a distant land". The rest of his life was characterised by social alienation, flights from creditors, and heavy drinking, likely as a means to self-medicate what is now termed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In 1880, destitute and suffering from <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens,</b> he committed suicide by stabbing himself in the heart.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's legacy as the [...] "doomed poet" [...] was {{cemented}} {{with the}} publication of Brinnin's 1955 biography Dylan Thomas in America, which focuses on his last few years and paints a picture of him as a drunk and a philanderer. Later biographies are critical of Brinnin's view, especially his coverage of Thomas's death. David Thomas in Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas? claims that Brinnin, along with Reitell and Feltenstein, were culpable. FitzGibbon's 1965 biography ignores Thomas's heavy drinking and skims over his death, giving just two pages in his detailed book to Thomas's demise. Ferris in his 1989 biography includes Thomas's heavy drinking, but is more critical of those around him in his final days and does not draw the conclusion that he drank himself to death. Feltenstein's role and actions have been criticised by many sources, especially his incorrect diagnosis of <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> and the high dose of morphine he administered. Dr B. W. Murphy and Dr C. G. de Gutierrez-Mahoney, the doctors who treated Thomas while at St. Vincents, concluded that Feltenstein's failure to see that Thomas was gravely ill and have him admitted to hospital sooner, [...] "was even more culpable than his use of morphine".|$|E
500|$|Isolated and disowned {{by most of}} his family, Wills had become, in {{the words}} of cricket {{historian}} David Frith, [...] "a complete and dangerous and apparently incurable alcoholic". An oft-repeated story that Wills was housed at Kew Lunatic Asylum {{near the end of his}} life is not supported by substantive evidence. He and Barbor abruptly stopped drinking on 28 April 1880; it is presumed that they ran out of money to buy more alcohol. Two days later, Wills started to show signs of alcohol withdrawal, and Barbor, fearing that a calamity was at hand, admitted him to the Melbourne Hospital on 1 May to be kept under restraint. His physician treated him for <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens,</b> but he absconded soon after, returned home and the next day, in the grip of paranoid delusions, committed suicide by stabbing a pair of scissors into his heart three times. The inquest, on 3 May, presided over by coroner Richard Youl, found that Wills [...] "killed himself when of unsound mind from excessive drinking". Wills was buried the next day in an unmarked grave in Heidelberg Cemetery at a private funeral attended by only six people: his brother Egbert, sister Emily and cousin Harrison; Harrison's sister Adela and her son Amos; and cricketer Verney Cameron. His death certificate declared that his parents were unknown. When asked by a journalist about her late son, Elizabeth Wills is reported to have denied that Tom ever existed.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> is a {{component}} of alcohol withdrawal hypothesized {{to be the result}} of compensatory changes in response to chronic alcohol abuse. [...] Alcohol positively allosterically modulates the binding of GABA, resulting in disinhibition of neurons projecting into the nucleus accumbens, as well as inhibiting NMDA receptors. [...] This combined with desensitization of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, results in a homeostatic up regulation of these systems in chronic alcohol use. [...] When alcohol use ceases, the unregulated mechanisms result in hyper excitability of neurons as natural GABAergic systems are down regulated and excitatory glutamatergic systems are unregulated. [...] This combined with increased noradrenergic activity results in the symptoms of <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Alcoholism. Hypomagnesemia {{occurs in}} 30% of alcohol abusers and in 85% of <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> inpatients, due to {{malnutrition}} and chronic diarrhea. [...] Alcohol stimulates the kidneys' excretion of magnesium, {{which is also}} increased because of alcoholic and diabetic ketoacidosis, low blood phosphate levels, and hyperaldosteronism resulting from liver disease. Also, hypomagnesemia is related to thiamine deficiency because magnesium is needed for transforming thiamine into thiamine pyrophosphate.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{symptoms}} of <b>delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> are nightmares, agitation, global confusion, disorientation, visual and auditory hallucinations, tactile hallucinations, fever, high blood pressure, heavy sweating, and {{other signs of}} autonomic hyperactivity (fast heart rate and high blood pressure). These symptoms may appear suddenly, but typically develop {{two to three days}} after the stopping of heavy drinking, being worst on the fourth or fifth day. Also, these [...] "symptoms are characteristically worse at night". In general, DT is considered the most severe manifestation of alcohol withdrawal and occurs 3–10 days following the last drink. Other common symptoms include intense perceptual disturbance such as visions of insects, snakes, or rats. These may be hallucinations, or illusions related to the environment, e.g., patterns on the wallpaper or in the peripheral vision that the patient falsely perceives as a resemblance to the morphology of an insect, and are also associated with tactile hallucinations such as sensations of something crawling on the subject—a phenomenon known as formication. <b>Delirium</b> <b>tremens</b> usually includes extremely intense feelings of [...] "impending doom".
