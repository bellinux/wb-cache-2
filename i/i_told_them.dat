5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, {{in the sense that}} it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E

25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and I asked him if he really wanted the truth. He assured me that he did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth. Now, when I was being forced to lie to save myself. It made me angry...so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> the truth, and everyone got very upset.|$|E

Killswitch Engage made sure to have written in their {{contract}} with Roadrunner that D'Antonio would produce all of the band's artwork. D'Antonio stated about the cover of Alive or Just Breathing, [...] "I wanted something that looked 'old school cut-and-paste' for the cover.

500|$|Theron Patterson, {{a friend}} of Moore's and former classmate at California Institute of the Arts, was working in Istanbul, Turkey and invited Moore to visit.

[...] "They've been really great {{supporting}} this; they sent me out to Turkey when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> I wanted to record out there, basically supporting the whole process," [...] he said. The first project Moore worked on after he moved to Istanbul was Ghost Book, the soundtrack to the Turkish film Okul. Moore enjoyed the experience and decided to write the third Chroma Key album as an alternate soundtrack to an already-existing film.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} the captains of the merchant ships of all countries which carry the lifeblood of the U.K., I {{made it a point}} to attend the briefing conference of all captains and chief engineers before their departure.

500|$|Altogether, Meessen's {{photographic}} {{ventures in}} the Indies {{and the resulting}} albums cost some 34,000Netherlands Indies gulden, which included camera equipment (though {{it is not known}} what model(s) he used), chemicals, transportation, and accommodations. Meessen worked alone, never taking a partner while in the Indies, and documented the land and people in the colony in his albumen prints. In his ethnographic photography of the indigenous peoples of the Indies, he often had to overcome superstitions which, the Bataviaasch Handelsblad wrote, [...] "made taking images of the people outside Java almost impossible". Others were more enthusiastic, including the villagers of Nias: [...] "Upon arrival I fired a few shots and flew the Dutch flag. Soon the villagers came and asked what I wanted.

[...] That's Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. [...] He says he'd take you tomorrow if he could turn you white." [...] Stung by the comments, Carnegie resolved to excel at the game. He was offered a tryout with the Rangers in 1950, then a spot on their lowest minor league team.

Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us.

Edwards and Farley also received an honorary city council membership from Jones, who had previously appeared on The Political Cesspool.

After a reporter informed him of the program's agenda, Jones initially refused to apologize. However, after another reporter confronted him with more details about the show's ideology, he changed his view, saying that he probably would not appear again. Carol Chumney, {{another member of the}} Memphis City Council, was also invited to appear on The Political Cesspool, but ultimately declined the invitation after listening to an episode of the show; Chumney said, [...] "what I heard was about advocating for prostitution...

500|$|Ultimately, Fellini {{drew his}} three leading players from people {{associated}} with the 1954 film Donne Proibite (Angels of Darkness), directed by Giuseppe Amato, in which Masina played the very different role of a madam. Anthony Quinn was also acting in the film, while Richard Basehart was often on the set visiting his wife, actress Valentina Cortese. When Masina introduced Quinn to her husband, the actor was disconcerted by Fellini's insistence that the director had found his Zampanò, later remembering: [...] "I {{thought he was a}} little bit crazy, and I told him I wasn't interested in the picture, but he kept hounding me for days." [...] Not long afterwards, Quinn spent the evening with Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, and after dinner they watched Fellini's 1953 Italian comedy-drama I Vitelloni. According to Quinn: [...] "I was thunderstruck by it. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> the film was a masterpiece, and that the same director was the man who had been chasing me for weeks." ...|$|E

Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored.

[...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement.
