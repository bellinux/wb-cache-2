40|$|<b>Fats</b> <b>and</b> oils play a {{prominent}} role in U. S. dietary patterns. Recent concerns over the negative health consequences associated with <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils have led many to suspect structural change in demand conditions. Our analysis considers short run (monthly) demand relationships for edible <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils. In that monthly quantities of <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils are likely to be relatively fixed, an inverse almost ideal demand system specification is used. A smooth transition function is used to model a switching inverse almost ideal demand system that assesses short-run demand conditions for edible <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils in the United States. The results suggest that short-run demand conditions for <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils experienced a gradual structural shift that began in the late 1980 s or early 1990 s and persisted into the mid- 1990 s. Although this shift generally made price flexibilities more elastic, differences in scale flexibilities across regimes were modest in most cases. The results suggest that decreases in marginal valuations for most <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils in response to consumption increases are rather small. Scale flexibilities are relatively close to - 1, suggesting near homothetic preferences for <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils. <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils, inverse demand system, structural change, Q 0, D 1,...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fats</b> <b>and</b> oils play a {{prominent}} role in U. S. dietary patterns. Recent concerns over the negative health consequences associated with <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils have led many to suspect structural change in demand conditions. We consider short run (monthly) demand relationships for edible <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils. In that monthly quantities of <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils are likely to be relatively fixed, we utilize an inverse AIDS specification. Our analysis consists of two components. In the first, we utilize a smooth transition function to model a switching inverse almost ideal demand system (IAIDS) that assesses short-run demand conditions for edible <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils in the U. S. Our results suggest that short-run demand conditions for <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils experienced a rather rapid structural shift in the early 1990 s. Although this shift generally made price flexibilities more elastic, differences in flexibilities across regimes are modest in most cases. Our results suggest that decreases in marginal valuations for most <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils in response to consumption increases are rather small. Scale flexibilities are relatively close to - 1, suggesting near homothetic preferences for <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils. An important distinction occurs for lard and tallow, which exhibit a very elastic scale response. This suggests that scale increases in the consumption of edible <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils will significantly decrease consumers' marginal valuation of these animal fats. A second segment of our analysis considers dynamic extensions to the IAIDS model that recognize habit effects. Although nested hypothesis testing supports the dynamic specification over the static IAIDS model, price and scale flexibilities are quite similar to the static case.

This study shows that <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils were used properly in 86 % of cooking in mass feeding facilities and in 72 % in private homes. Twelve types of <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils were used in mass feeding facilities compared with 15 in private homes. Survey results indicate that soybean oil was used most frequently in 88 %of the mass feeding facilities, sesame oil in 76 %, butter in 64 %, margarine in 52 %and rapeseed oil in 32 %. Both olive oil and sesame oil were used most frequently in 48 % of home cooking sites, margarine and butter in 41 %and 40 %, respectively, and both rapeseed oil and corn oil in 38 %. Reasons for selecting cooking <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils in the mass feeding facilities were "good for health" and "adhere to the brand of manufacturer", whereas the home cooking sites specified "good for health" and "in use from a long time ago" as the major reasons. In the selection of <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils. their reasonable prices were common considerations. Both the mass feeding facilities and home cooking sites were careful about reasonable prices of <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils for their selection, and also careful about preventing oxidation and deterioration of the oils.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the consumption of}} added <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils across the European centres and countries participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). DESIGN AND SETTING: 24 -Hour dietary recalls were collected by means of standardised computer-guided interviews in 27 redefined EPIC centres across 10 European countries. SUBJECTS: From an initial number of 36 900 subjects, single dietary recalls from 22 924 women and 13 031 men in the age range of 35 - 74 years were included. RESULTS: Mean daily intake of added <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils varied between 16. 2 g (Varese, Italy) and 41. 1 g (Malmö, Sweden) in women and between 24. 7 g (Ragusa, Italy) and 66. 0 g (Potsdam, Germany) in men. Total mean lipid intake by consumption of added <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils, including those used for sauce preparation, ranged between 18. 3 (Norway) and 37. 2 g day- 1 (Greece) in women and 28. 4 (Heidelberg, Germany) and 51. 2 g day- 1 (Greece) in men. The Mediterranean EPIC centres with high olive oil consumption combined with low animal fat intake contrasted with the central and northern European centres where fewer vegetable oils, more animal <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> {{a high proportion of}} margarine were consumed. The consumption of added <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils of animal origin was highest in the German EPIC centres, followed by the French. The contribution of added <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils to total energy intake ranged from 8 % in Norway to 22 % in Greece. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate a high variation in dietary intake of added <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils in EPIC, providing a good opportunity to elucidate the role of dietary fats in cancer aetiology...|$|R
40|$|The {{purchase}} {{dynamics of}} {{a subset of}} food <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils are investigated using event-history analysis applied to a panel of U. S. households. The consumer behavior examined is the switching between purchases of butter, margarine, and butter/margarine blends across purchase occasions. We find that price, previous purchases, seasonality, and household size and composition affect product-switching probability. Key words: event-history analysis, <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils, hazard rates, panel data. The relationship between dietary <b>fat</b> intake <b>and</b> increased risk of chronic diseases {{has been the subject}} of considerable debate since the early 1960 s. Nutrition education programs that have arisen from this debate have in-creased awareness of such linkages (Putler and Frazao). With food <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils account-ing for more than 50 % of total and 40 % of saturated fat intake, the structure of <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils demand has been examined in light of this increased awareness. For example, Chern, Loehman and Yen use a system framework to model the impact of health information on such demand. They found that increased knowledge of the link between cholesterol <b>and</b> <b>fat</b> intake <b>and</b> coronary heart disease resulted in a 13 % reduction in butter and 15 % increase in per capita margarine intake for 1988. Their analysis represents an extension of previous research which included advertising, prices, and household characteristics as determinants of food <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils demand (Yet and Chern; Goddard; Gould, Cox, and Perali). These analyses have been based on time-series data and have been limited in their abil-ity to examine the microeconomic structure of <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> oils demand.
