40|$|The {{abundance}} of data, gathered by farm accounting bureaux, offered ample opportunities for economic research. Vondeling advocated {{the use of}} such data to compare farm efficiencies, because research in this field would enable farmers to examine more thoroughly the efficiency of their management decisions to improve the net results of their efforts in farming. Opinions of other workers were considered, and the possibilities and pitfalls of the method were carefully discussed. The statistical part of this study was based upon groups of data which could be taken from 17, 735 farm accounts made by the Cooperative Central Farm Accountant in Friesland in the period 1923 - 40 initially for 527 (in 1923) and finally for 1452 farms (in 1940) per year. The analysis was by the <b>Hollerith</b> <b>system.</b> The results of the studies led to a discussion of aspects of farming in the period 1923 - 40, of structural differences between types of farming in this period and of differences in organization and in financial results between farms of similar type. An outline was given of {{what had to be done}} to make comparisons of farm efficiency generally accepted in advisory services and in practical farming. <p/...|$|E
40|$|The International Association of Wood Anatomists in {{the early}} years of its {{existence}} has undertaken to standardize the nomenclature used in describing woods. Later the classes of dimensions have been added thereinto. In the same way it should be possible now to standardize one or two identification methods. Universal schemes in the first place will fit for this purpose. In the introduction it is explained which requirements should be fulfilled in such schemes. The advantages and drawbacks of an English and a Dutch identification method are compared mutually. It is suggested, that a procedure according to the <b>Hollerith</b> <b>system</b> will allow of a synthesis of both methods mentioned, thus combining advantages and eliminating their drawbacks. The restriction in the applicability of the Hollerith scheme is determined by the fact, that complicated devices are necessary the costs of which can only be justified, if they are constantly employed at full capacity. Thus the method can only be used in a central office. It will especially yield good results if a close international collaboration is established. A standardized codification and centralized multiplication and distribution of cards are indispensable requirements for realising this purpose. A short general survey is given of the Universal Decimal Classification and it is explained according to which principles wood species have been included in this scheme. The decimal codes of the U. D. C. can be used for indicating botanical and geographical data in the Hollerith identification. In this way, the great advantage is achieved, that a literature card index on wood species can be compiled with the same figure combinations. In doing so these figures get a wider field of application than when independant classifications are made for identification and documentation purposes...|$|E
50|$|Fredrik Bull {{was sent}} abroad to study <b>Hollerith's</b> <b>systems,</b> {{returning}} with {{the conviction that}} <b>Hollerith's</b> <b>systems</b> were expensive and unstable. He was convinced that he could develop a device that was cheaper and more efficient than Hollerith's. As a result, Bull convinced his employer, Storebrand, to pay him an advance of $10,000 {{to develop a new}} machine. The terms of the deal required the advance to be repaid in full if the machine was not successful.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{automatic}} {{data processing}} was applied to operations performed by means of unit record equipment, such as Herman Hollerith's application of punched card equipment for the 1890 United States Census. [...] "Using Hollerith's punchcard equipment, the Census Office was able to complete tabulating most of the 1890 census data in 2 to 3 years, compared with 7 to 8 years for the 1880 census.... It is also estimated that using Herman <b>Hollerith's</b> <b>system</b> saved some $5 million in processing costs" [...] (in 1890 dollars) even with twice as many questions as during 1880.|$|R
50|$|Powers {{managed to}} invent his own system which bore no {{resemblance}} to <b>Hollerith's</b> one. The <b>system</b> included the whole set of machines, necessary for tabulating, namely, the electric card punch, card verifier, sorting machine, and printing tabulator.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hollerith's</b> {{original}} <b>system</b> used an ad-hoc {{coding system}} for each application, with groups of holes assigned specific meanings, e.g. sex or marital status. His tabulating machine had up to 40 counters, {{each with a}} dial divided into 100 divisions, with two indicator hands; one which stepped one unit with each counting pulse, the other which advanced one unit every time the other dial made a complete revolution. This arrangement allowed a count up to 10,000. During a given tabulating run, each counter was typically assigned a specific hole. Hollerith also used relay logic to allow counts of combination of holes, e.g. to count married females.|$|R
25|$|Hollerith {{initially}} {{did business}} {{under his own}} name, as The <b>Hollerith</b> Electric Tabulating <b>System,</b> specializing in punched card data processing equipment. He provided tabulators and other machines under contract for the Census Office, which used them for the 1890 census. The net effect of the many changes from the 1880 census: the larger population, the data items to be collected, the Census Bureau headcount, the scheduled publications, {{and the use of}} Hollerith's electromechanical tabulators, was to reduce the time required to process the census from eight years for the 1880 census to six years for the 1890 census.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of the technology were immediately apparent for accounting and tracking inventory. Hollerith started his own business as The <b>Hollerith</b> Electric Tabulating <b>System,</b> specializing in punched card data processing equipment. In 1896 he incorporated the Tabulating Machine Company. In that year he introduced the Hollerith Integrating Tabulator, which could add numbers coded on punched cards, not just {{count the number of}} holes. Punched cards were still read manually using the pins and mercury pool reader. 1900 saw the Hollerith Automatic Feed Tabulator used in that year's U.S. census. A control panel was incorporated in the 1906 Type 1.|$|R
50|$|Herman Hollerith {{initially}} {{did business}} {{under his own}} name, as The <b>Hollerith</b> Electric Tabulating <b>System,</b> specializing in punched card data processing equipment. In 1896 he incorporated as the Tabulating Machine Company and in 1905 reincorporated as The Tabulating Machine Company. Hollerith's series of patents on tabulating machine technology, first applied for in 1884, drew on {{his work at the}} U.S. Census Bureau from 1879 to 82. Hollerith was initially trying to reduce the time and complexity needed to tabulate the 1890 Census. His development of punched cards in 1886 set the industry standard for the next 80 years of tabulating and computing data input.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a series {{examining}} the fundamental nature of informatics: a term used as a convenient umbrella term to stand for the overlapping disciplinary areas of information systems, information management and information technology. The aim of the current paper is to consider some of the universal features of information technology. This is accomplished in terms of a conceptual framework established in previous work. We ground the discussion in a significant historical case: that of <b>Hollerith's</b> electric tabulating <b>system</b> which constituted one of the earliest examples of automatic data processing. Through examination of this case and the technologies used we establish an interpretation of the essence of information technology in terms of formative acts of data representation and processing...|$|R
