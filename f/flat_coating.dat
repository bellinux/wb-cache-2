40|$|The dynamic {{nature of}} the first water adlayers on solid {{surfaces}} at room temperature has made the direct detection of their microscopic structure challenging. We used graphene as an atomically <b>flat</b> <b>coating</b> for atomic force microscopy to determine {{the structure of the}} water adlayers on mica at room temperature as a function of relative humidity. Water adlayers grew epitaxially on the mica substrate in a layer-by-layer fashion. Submonolayers form atomically flat, faceted islands of height 0. 37 ± 0. 02 nanometers, in agreement with the height of a monolayer of ice. The second adlayers, observed at higher relative humidity, also appear icelike, and thicker layers appear liquidlike. Our results also indicate nanometer-scale surface defects serve as nucleation centers for the formation of both the first and the second adlayers...|$|E
40|$|A {{range of}} {{coatings}} from a water based suspension of anatase has been prepared by suspension high velocity oxy-fuel spraying {{with the aim}} to study effects of heat power of the flame on phase composition, microstructure and surface topography. Three most commonly used approaches of quantitative phase analysis have been scrutinized {{with respect to their}} applicability and as some of the coatings showed presence of preferred orientation and it was argued that quantitative Rietveld refinement is the most accurate method for phase composition determination. Coatings had a layered duplex anatase/rutile microstructure with fraction of rutile increasing exponentially with heat power. Spraying at the lower heat power led to a lower surface roughness and higher power resulted in surfaces with pronounced humps, which were distributed homogeneously on the surface. The emergence of humps is related to an increase in macroscopic surface area of up to 30 % with respect to the <b>flat</b> <b>coating...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recently, we have {{suggested}} dielectric metamaterial composed as {{an array of}} submicron dielectric spheres located {{on top of an}} amorphous thin-film solar cell. We have theoretically shown that this metamaterial can decrease the reflection and simultaneously can suppress the transmission through the photovoltaic layer because it transforms the incident plane wave into a set of focused light beams. This theoretical concept has been strongly developed and experimentally confirmed in the present paper. Here we consider the metamaterial for oblique angle illumination, redesign the solar cell and present a detailed experimental study of the whole structure. In contrast to our precedent theoretical study we show that our omnidirectional light-trapping structure may operate better than the optimized <b>flat</b> <b>coating</b> obtained by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Comment: We are sure that our paper is extremely important on the background of a huge body of modern literature claiming the necessity of resonant nanostructures for thin-film solar cell...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Flat</b> <b>Coated</b> Retriever is a {{breed at risk}} of {{development}} of histiocytic sarcoma (HS), but {{in contrast to the}} disseminated form of disease recognized in the Bernese Mountain Dog, most reports of HS in <b>Flat</b> <b>Coated</b> Retrievers describe a localized lesion affecting the musculature or fascia of limbs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to review data and material received though an ongoing <b>Flat</b> <b>Coated</b> Retriever tumor survey to better define the presentation of HS in the breed and to determine the utility of subclassification of tumors arising at different sites by histology and immunohistologic phenotyping. Data on 180 dogs bearing HS-like tumors were available for review, which showed that although the majority (101 lesions, 57 %) were primary limb lesions, 47 dogs (26 %) had visceral, mainly splenic lesions with no peripheral primary tumor. A detailed histologic and immuno-histologic review of 20 limb tumors and 20 splenic tumors showed that 2 distinct phenotypic subtypes could be identified: a histiocytic subtype, most prevalent in the splenic tumors, and a histiocytic–spindle–pleomorphic subtype, mainly seen in the limb tumors. Despite their variable morphology, all tumors expressed major histocompatibility complex class II and the leukocyte anti-gen CD 18, but only those tumors in the spleen consistently expressed CD 11 d. The majority of tumors also contained a mild to moderate infiltrate of T lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|Enhancing the {{hydrophobicity}} {{of organic}} coatings retards their interaction {{with water and}} often leads to better protectiveness over metal corrosion. In this study, a soft lithography method was used to prepare epoxy coatings which showed surface microstructures in high replication to sandpapers. The effect of microstructures on coating’s hydrophobicity and barrier property was investigated. Compared to flat coatings, the microstructured coatings showed much higher water contact angles, which further increased with finer sandpapers. Determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the <b>flat</b> <b>coating</b> exhibited a higher anticorrosive performance than the microstructured coatings. With the use of finer sandpaper, the groove size of the corresponding microstructured coating was reduced. And a lower anticorrosive performance was observed since more defects might be formed in a given area of coating during the imprinting process. As the groove size of the coatings was further decreased to 5. 7 [*]µm, the microstructures became too small for water to easily penetrate through. Therefore, trapped air acted as an additional barrier and contributed to an increased anticorrosive performance compared to other microstructured coatings...|$|E

This report describes the clinical signs, the laser technique and the postoperative aspect for a <b>Flat</b> <b>Coated</b> Retriever with iris cysts. A 6 year-old, neutered male <b>Flat</b> <b>Coated</b> Retriever {{was referred to}} the Animal Medical Centre {{with a history of}} two pigmented masses in the anterior chamber. Ophthalmic examination of the right eye showed the presence of two highly pigmented iris cysts attached at the pupillary margin to the posterior iris. Nonsteroidal eye drops (ketorol tromethamine) and a course of oral meloxicam were initiated a week before the procedure. Under general anaesthesia the diode laser was used with an indirect ophthalmoscope headset and a 20 diopter lens. Preoperative atropine and proxymetacaine eye drops were applied. Diode laser was used to deflate the cysts. Initial pigment dispersion in the anterior chamber and {{on the surface of the}} lens was noted. Topical nonsteroidal, steroidal and antibiotics (dexamethasone, polymyxin and neomycin) eye drops were continued to control the secondary uveitis.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{experimental and}} numerical {{investigation of the}} thermal contact resistance across two nominally <b>flat,</b> <b>coated</b> metallic engineering surfaces in contact is presented. The model consists of a surface deformation computation, which determines the actual contact area and number of contacting asperities at a joint, and a constriction resistance analysis, which determines the constriction resistance through each individual contacting asperity. Predictions from the model are validated against experiments conducted for the purpose. The experiments are performed according to a “design of experiments” approach and evaluated using statistical regression. Three substrates (copper, brass, and aluminum) and three coatings (silver, nickel, and tin) are considered {{with a variety of}} coating thicknesses and substrate roughnesses. The contact load is also varied. The experimental measurements show that the best choice of a coating for contact resistance mitigation depends on the substrate material and roughness, and it cannot be prescribed in general. A regression equation developed for the experimental results offers a useful tool for the design of coated contacts. The measured results agree well with predicted values from the numerical model, especially in cases of a rough substrate or hard coating...|$|R
