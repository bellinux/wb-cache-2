Two designs were developed based on the stator dimensions of the 18. 5 kW induction machine and they were compared by analyzing those designs analytically in Matlab to implement the most viable design for detecting lamination failure in the machine. The injection probe for analyzing the lamination failure was demonstrated for two separate cases; Initially, lamination failure in a test stack was studied through experimentation by operating the probe at various range of frequencies and flux densities to select an optimal point of operation of the probe {{and then it was}} compared with the simulations in FEMM. Later, the experiments and simulations were done on the 18. 5 kW induction machine at selected operating point from previous case to study the effect of fault on the probe. The simulations show a promising result for implementing this method for detecting the lamination failure in machine at higher frequencies. However, the results obtained from experiment were affected due to various inaccuracies caused during the construction of the probe. When the <b>flux</b> <b>injection</b> probes are manufactured with industrial standards, the factors causing these inaccuracies can be eliminated making the new <b>flux</b> <b>injection</b> method more reliable for detecting the lamination failure in an electrical machine...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of gaseous pollutants in soils has stimulated many experimental activities, including forced ventilation {{in the field}} as well as laboratory transport experiments with gases. The dispersion coefficient in advective-dispersive gas phase transport is often dominated by molecular diffusion, {{which leads to a}} large overall dispersivity gamma. Under such conditions it is important to distinguish between flux and resident modes of solute injection and detection. The influence of the inlet type oil the macroscopic injection mode was tested in two series of column experiments with gases at different mean flow velocities nu. First we compared infinite resident and flux injections, and second, semi-infinite resident and flux injections. It is shown that the macroscopically apparent injection condition depends on the geometry of the inlet section. A reduction of the cross-sectional area of the inlet relative to that of the column is very effective in excluding the diffusive solute input, thus allowing us to use the solutions for a <b>flux</b> <b>Injection</b> also at rather low mean flow velocities nu.

At first, comparing Pariat’s helicity flux equation (2005, A&A, 439, 1191) with Longcope’s (2007, ApJ, 668, 571), {{we find that}} the Pariat’s helicity injection equation shows helicity evolution of continuous magnetic field lines, which is an extreme case of the Longcope’s multiple flux tube model. Next, we investigated Berger’s helicity flux density (1984, J.

40|$|We {{address a}} primary {{question}} regarding the physical mechanism that triggers the energy release and initiates {{the onset of}} eruptions in the magnetar magnetosphere. A self-consistent stationary, axisymmetric model of the magnetar magnetosphere is constructed based on a force-free magnetic field configuration which contains a helically twisted force-free flux rope. Given the complex multipolar magnetic fields at the magnetar surface, we also develop a convenient numerical scheme to solve the GS equation. Depending on the surface magnetic field polarity, there exist two kinds of magnetic field configurations, inverse and normal. For these two kinds of configurations, variations of the flux rope equilibrium height in response to gradual surface physical processes, such as <b>flux</b> <b>injections</b> and crust motions, are carefully examined. We find that equilibrium curves contain two branches, one represents a stable equilibrium branch, the other an unstable equilibrium branch. As a result, {{the evolution of the}} system shows a catastrophic behavior: when the magnetar surface magnetic field evolves slowly, the height of flux rope would gradually reach a critical value beyond which stable equilibriums can no longer be maintained. Subsequently the flux rope would lose equilibrium and the gradual quasi-static evolution of the magnetar magnetosphere will be replaced by a fast dynamical evolution. In addition to <b>flux</b> <b>injections,</b> the relative motion of active regions would give rise to the catastrophic behavior and lead to magnetic eruptions as well. We propose that a gradual process could lead to a sudden release of magnetosphere energy on a very short dynamical timescale, without being initiated by a sudden fracture in the crust of the magnetar. Some implications of our model are also discussed. Comment: 26 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

The thermoelectric transport properties of the proposed heat engine are studied in the linear-response regime, using an example system where a narrow band gap semiconductor is used to absorb the injected thermal radiation. By analyzing the absorption of radiation, carrier conduction, and parasitic heat conduction, we find considerably large thermopower, figure of merit and power factor. The outstanding thermopower and figure of merit originate from effective energy filtering via the band gap.

40|$|The flux-injection {{hypothesis}} {{for driving}} coronal mass ejections (CMEs) requires {{the transport of}} substantial magnetic energy and helicity flux through the photosphere concomitant with the eruption. Under the magnetohydrodynamics approximation, these fluxes are produced by twisting magnetic field and/or flux emergence in the photosphere. A CME trajectory, observed 2000 September 12 and fitted with a flux-rope model constrains energy and helicity budgets for testing the flux-injection hypothesis. Optimal velocity profiles for several driving scenarios are estimated by minimizing the photospheric plasma velocities for a cylindrically symmetric flux-rope magnetic field subject to the flux budgets required by the flux-rope model.

Yumoto Abstract: The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) may be continuously southward for many hours during magnetic storms. The geomagnetic field at middle and low latitudes often shows periodic (∼ 3 hour) increases {{in association with}} the storm-time sawtooth-like oscillations of energetic plasma particle flux at geosynchronous orbit. Recent studies have demonstrated that the sawtooth oscillations represent <b>flux</b> <b>injections</b> of substorms. However, there is a significant controversy as to whether the periodic geomagnetic disturbances are caused by magnetospheric substorms or by solar wind pressure enhancements. In order to find a solution to this controversy, we perform a statistical study of the low-latitude geomagnetic response to solar wind pressure enhancements during southward IMF. Our result shows that the change of the geomagnetic field is proportional to the change of the square root of the solar wind pressure, and an empirical formula is derived. We may use this quantitative relationship to estimate the possible effect of the solar wind pressure on the geomagnetic field. This method is useful for identification and interpretation of magnetospheric-ionospheric disturbances related to storm-time periodic substorms during a prolonged interval of southward IMF. We apply the empirical formula to two storm cases in which periodic substorms occur. It is found that the periodic increases of the geomagnetic field are related to the substorm onsets but not to solar wind pressure variations...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} and {{evolution}} of the photospheric helicity flux transfer {{is a key to}} reveal the role of magnetic helicity in coronal dynamics of solar active regions. Using SDO/HMI photospheric vector magnetograms and the derived flow velocity field, we computed boundary driven helicity flux with a 12 minute cadence during the emergence of AR 11928. Accounting the foot point connectivity defined by non-linear force-free magnetic extrapolations, we derived and analyzed the corrected distribution of helicity flux maps. The photospheric helicity <b>flux</b> <b>injection</b> is found to changes sign during the steady emergence of the AR. This reversal is confirmed with the evolution of the photospheric electric currents and with the coronal connectivity as observed in EUV wavelengths with SDO/AIA. During about the three first days of emergence, the AR coronal helicity is positive while later on the field configuration is close to a potential field. As theoretically expected, the magnetic helicity cancelation is associated to enhanced coronal activity. The study suggests a boundary driven transformation of the chirality in the global AR magnetic structure.

In apparent violation of the physical requirement for flux balance, 94 % of the features containing newly detected flux are unipolar at a resolution of 1. 200. We analyze 2619 of these apparent unipolar emergences in an image sequence from the SOHOMDI magnetograph and compare the ensemble average to a model of asymmetric bipolar emergence that could in principle hide opposing flux under the noise floor of MDI. We examine the statistical consequences of this mechanism and find that it cannot be responsible {{for more than a}} small fraction of the unipolar emergences. We conclude that the majority of the newly detected flux in the quiet Sun is instead due to the coalescence of previously existing but unresolved flux into con-centrations that are large and strong enough to be detected. We estimate the rate of coalescence into arcsecond-scale magnetic features averaged over the solar surface to be 7; 1021 Mx hr 1, comparable to the reported <b>flux</b> <b>injection</b> rate due to ephemeral regions. This implies that most flux in the solar network has been processed by very small scale shredding, emergence, cancellation, and/or coalescence that is not resolved at 1. 200, and it suggests that currently un-resolved emergences may be at least as important as ephemeral region emergences to the overall flux budget.

The transport velocity of a solute moving within a fracture network is inversely related to the {{fracture porosity}}. Since fracture porosity is often one or two orders of magnitude smaller than matrix porosity, and fracture permeability is often orders of magnitude greater than matrix permeability, solutes may travel significantly faster in the fracture network than in the surrounding matrix. This dissertation introduces a new methodology for conducting gas tracer tests using a field portable mass spectrometer along with analytical tools for estimating fracture porosity using the measured tracer concentration breakthrough curves. Field experiments were conducted at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, consisting of air-permeability transient testing and gas-tracer-transport tests.

Here, we present three-dimensional (3 D) ideal MHD simulations of the Caltech plasma jet experiment using a magnetic tower scenario as the baseline model. Magnetic fields consist of an initially localized dipole-like poloidal component and a toroidal component that is continuously being injected into the domain. This <b>flux</b> <b>injection</b> mimics the poloidal currents driven by the anode-cathode voltage drop in the experiment. The injected toroidal field stretches the poloidal fields to large distances, while forming a collimated jet along with several other key features. Detailed comparisons between 3 D MHD simulations and experimental measurements provide a comprehensive description of the interplay among magnetic force, pressure, and flow effects. In particular, we delineate both the jet structure and the transition process that converts the injected magnetic energy to other forms. With suitably chosen parameters that are derived from experiments, the jet in the simulation agrees quantitatively with the experimental jet in terms of magnetic/kinetic/inertial energy, total poloidal current, voltage, jet radius, and jet propagation velocity. Specifically, the jet velocity in the simulation is proportional to the poloidal current divided by the square root of the jet density, in agreement with both the experiment and analytical theory. This work provides a new and quantitative method for relating experiments, numerical simulations, and astrophysical observation, and demonstrates the possibility of using terrestrial laboratory experiments to study astrophysical jets...|$|E

It {{is well known that}} the energetic particles flux are varied during geomagnetic disturbances. Many researchers have studied about the flux variation of radiation belt, but the mechanism of the variation has not been understood in detail. A radial diffusion model can reproduce a basic structure of the radiation belts. Radiation belt particles are supplied from the outer boundary of the radiation belt, and the flux is arranged by the balance of intensity of the diffusion and the loss due to pitch-angle scattering. An intensity and a distribution of the electrostatic field and the whistler waves which determine the magnitude of the diffusion and the loss of radiation belt particles are uncertain. Cornwall (1968) derived the radial diffusion coeffcient due to substorm convection electrostatic field. Brautigam and Albert (2000) derived the root mean square of electrostatic field which is a linear function of Kp index from observations. Lyons et al.

Here, we present a comprehensive theory of linear analysis for nonequilibrium steady-state (NESS) biochemical reaction networks that unites these disparate approaches in a common mathematical framework and thermodynamic basis. Results: In this theory a number of relationships between key matrices are introduced: the matrix A obtained in the standard, linear-dynamic-stability analysis of the steady-state can be decomposed as A = SR T where R and S are directly related to the elasticity-coefficient matrix for the fluxes and chemical potentials in MCA, respectively; the control-coefficients for the fluxes and chemical potentials can be written in terms of R T BS and S T BS respectively where matrix B is the inverse of A; the matrix S is precisely the stoichiometric matrix in FBA; and the matrix e A t plays a central role in CMC. Conclusion: One key finding that emerges from this analysis is that the well-known summation theorems in MCA take different forms depending on whether metabolic steady-state is maintained by <b>flux</b> <b>injection</b> or concentration clamping. We demonstrate that if rate-limiting steps exist in a biochemical pathway, they are the steps with smallest biochemical conductances and largest flux control-coefficients.

We present the detailed jet properties and show that far from the jet launching region, a substantial amount of magnetic energy has been transformed into kinetic energy and thermal energy, producing a jet magnetization number σ < 1. In addition, we have also studied the effects of a gas pressure supported "disk" surrounding the injection region and qualitatively similar global jet behaviors were observed. We stress that jet collimation, CDIs, and the subsequent energy transitions are intrinsic features of current-carrying jets. Comment: 49 pages, 22 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|E
40|$|A viscous shock-layer {{analysis}} for calculating high energy equilibrium flow fields about blunt axisymmetric bodies {{is applied to}} the problem of massive ablation injection with radiation transport. A nongray radiation model is used that accounts for both line and continuum radiation. The solution method is direct and provides both stagnation and downstream solutions. Results for shock heated air show that phenolic-nylon injection is substantially more effective in reducing the wall radiant <b>flux</b> than air <b>injection.</b> Also, for large included body angles, the wall radiative flux and the coupled phenolic-nylon injection rate do not continue to decrease with increasing distance downstream...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOn 20 February 2005, Cluster in {{the outer}} {{magnetosphere}} and Double Star- 2 (TC- 2) at mid-altitude are situated {{in the vicinity of}} the northern cusp/mantle, with Cluster moving sunward and TC- 2 anti-sunward. Their magnetic footprints come very close together at about 15 : 28 UT, over the common field-of-view of SuperDARN radars. Thanks to this conjunction, we determine the velocity, the transverse sizes, perpendicular and parallel to this velocity, and the shape of three magnetic flux tubes of magnetosheath plasma injection. The velocity of the structures determined from the Cluster four-spacecraft timing analysis is almost purely antisunward, in contrast with the antisunward and duskward convection velocity inside the flux tubes. The transverse sizes are defined from the Cluster-TC- 2 separation perpendicular to the magnetic field, and from the time spent by a Cluster spacecraft in one structure; they are comprised between 0. 6 and 2 RE in agreement with previous studies. Finally, using a comparison between the eigenvectors deduced from a variance analysis of the magnetic perturbation at the four Cluster and at TC- 2, we show that the upstream side of the <b>injection</b> <b>flux</b> tubes is magnetically well defined, with even a concave front for the third one giving a bean-like shape, whereas the downstream side is far more turbulent. We also realise the first quantitative comparison between field-aligned currents at Cluster calculated with the curlometer technique and with the single-spacecraft method, assuming infinite parallel current sheets and taking into account the velocity of the <b>injection</b> <b>flux</b> tubes. The results agree nicely, confirming the validity of both methods. Finally, we compare the field-aligned current distribution of the three <b>injection</b> <b>flux</b> tubes at the altitudes of Cluster and TC- 2. Both profiles are fairly similar, with mainly a pair of opposite field-aligned currents, upward at low-latitude and downward at high-latitude. In terms of intensity, the field-aligned currents at Cluster are two to three times less intense than at TC- 2 for the first two flux tubes, in agreement with magnetic field line convergence. For the third flux tube, the intensity is equal, which is explained by the fact that TC- 2 crosses the tube on its edge. Finally, the analysis of the ion and electron moments at Cluster shows that the field-aligned currents result from a small difference between upward ion and electron fluxes...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} current-voltage {{characteristics}} of Fe(Se,Te) thin films deposited on CaF_ 2 substrates {{in form of}} nanostrips (width w∼λ, λ the London penetration length). In view of a possible application of these materials to superconductive electronics and micro-electronics we focus on transport properties in small magnetic field, the one generated by the bias current. From the characteristics taken at different temperatures we derive estimates for the pinning potential U and the pinning potential range δ. Since the sample lines are very narrow, the classical creep flow model provides a sufficiently accurate interpretation of the data only when the attractive interaction between magnetic flux lines of opposite sign is taken into account. The observed voltages and the induced detriment of the critical current of the nanostrips are compatible {{with the presence of}} few tens of magnetic field lines at the equilibrium and a strongly inhomogeneous current density distribution. In particular, we argue that the sharp corners defining the bridge geometry represent points of easy magnetic <b>flux</b> lines <b>injection.</b> The results are relevant for creep flow analysis in superconducting Fe(Se,Te) nanostrips.
