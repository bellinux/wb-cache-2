25|$|However, in cities, {{where the}} {{population}} {{tends to be}} much higher, informal interactions between ethnic groups might {{not be sufficient to}} prevent violence. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> need many more links to connect everyone and therefore it is much more difficult to form and strengthen inter-ethnic ties. In cities, formal inter-ethnic associations like trade unions, business associations and professional organizations are more effective in encouraging inter-ethnic interactions that could prevent ethnic violence in the future. These organizations force ethnic groups to come together based on shared economic interests that overcomes any pre-existing ethnic differences. For example, inter-ethnic business organizations serve to connect the business interests of different ethnic groups which would increase their desire to maintain ethnic harmony. Any ethnic tension or outbreak of violence will go against their economic interests and therefore, over time, the salience of ethnic identity diminishes.|$|E

[...] Lindsey showed Mars and Jeff Bhasker (who Mars met through Mike Lynn) the ins and outs of writing pop music, and acted as a mentor helping them to hone their craft. Bhasker explained that Lindsey would [...] "mentor us, and kind of give us lectures as to what a hit pop song <b>is,</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> can have talent and music ability, but understanding what makes a hit pop song is a whole other discipline."

500|$|After Carey premiered [...] "Obsessed" [...] on June 16, 2009, {{the media}} frenzied and began speculating {{the song was}} {{targeting}} at Eminem, due to its lyrics and overall message.

2500|$|Lighting {{challenges}} were abound for Greenberg {{as most of}} {{the film}} took place at night. One of the simplest techniques for lighting employed by Greenberg was using a car's headlights to dramatically produce a scene of terror. Greenberg explained, [...] "We had a scene on Zuma Beach where the bad guys are dragging somebody into the ocean. I wanted to have a very hard, but very natural, and strong look. So, I used the car headlights. It was nice because everything behind the villains fell into darkness. It had a surrealistic look." [...] Greenberg also remarked how he had a close working relationship with DeLuxe lab in getting the correct color for the extensive night shooting in the film by bluntly saying, [...] "In a movie like this I wanted the blacks to be very black, so I worked closely with DeLuxe lab ..." [...] He felt the daily challenges of night shooting visibly enhanced the appeal of Alien Nation by figuratively mentioning, [...] "as a cameraman, you can create a lot more at night.

2500|$|During the trial, Evans was cross-examined by Irving. The {{cross-examination}} of Evans by Irving {{was noted}} {{for the high}} degree of personal antagonism between the two men. Such was the degree of antagonism that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting that a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote was fair. A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a 1942 memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellory Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the [...] "Jewish Question" [...] on the [...] "back-burner" [...] until after the war. Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s; Irving chose to interpret the memo literally, and taunted Evans, saying [...] "t is a terrible problem, is it not, that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item {{that we do not have}} to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which... quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?". In response, Evans stated [...] "No, I do not accept that at all. It <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> want to interpret euphemisms as being literal and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of... the way you manipulate and distort the documents".|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 2008, {{creator of}} the {{original}} Todd and Marty rape storyline, Malone, shared his thoughts with TV Guide about the romance controversy.

[...] "He’s also a great lover of the form, and {{has worked in the}} form for a long time. Ron loves the conventions and traditions of the form. So, my first reaction is, I’m surprised." [...] Malone said that the character (Marty) having amnesia [...] "literally erases the real moral consequences and the real spiritual journey Marty has embarked on. It’s like telling Othello he’s White and Desdemona doesn’t really die. Presumably, Marty will gain her memory, and what will happen? She will be horrified". Malone agreed that Todd had now [...] "raped Marty in the worst possible way" [...] but that this type of story [...] coming out of nowhere". [...] "In this genre, General Hospitals Luke and Laura have a long history. This kind of story is profoundly founded on hope, forgiveness and redemption," [...] he said. [...] "That’s why it goes to its most radical narrative position. That someone can forgive this ultimate crime is redemptive both for the person forgiven, and the forgiver." [...] Malone said he had faith in Carlivati's storytelling but that the story would have been different and possibly not romantic if he himself had been writing it. [...] "Anyone can tell a story, {{and one of the reasons}} people mock soaps <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> can only read plot," [...] he said.
