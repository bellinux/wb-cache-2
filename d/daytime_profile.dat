In the 50 - 60 km region the positive ion conductivity is relatively constant with altitude and correlates well with atmospheric temperature down to 35 km.

40|$|The {{impact of}} surface flux {{boundary}} conditions and geostrophic forcing on multiday evolution of {{flow in the}} atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) was assessed using large-eddy simulations (LES). The LES investigations included several combinations of surface boundary conditions (temperature and heat flux) and geostrophic forcing (constant, time varying, time and height varying). The setup was based on ABL characteristics observed during a selected period of the Cooperative Atmosphere–Surface Exchange Study— 1999 (CASES- 99) campaign. The LES cases driven by a constant geostrophic wind achieved the best agreement with the CASES- 99 observations specifically in terms of daytime surface fluxes and <b>daytime</b> and nighttime <b>profiles.</b> However, the nighttime fluxes were significantly overestimated. The LES cases with the surface temperature boundary condition and driven by a time- and height-varying geostrophic forcing showed improved agreement with the observed nighttime fluxes, but there was less agreement with other observations (e. g., <b>daytime</b> <b>profiles).</b> In terms of the surface boundary condition, the LES cases driven by either surface temperature or heat fluxes produced similar trends {{in terms of the}} <b>daytime</b> <b>profiles</b> and comparisons with data from soundings. However, in reproducing the fluxes and nighttime profiles, the agreement was better with imposed temperature because of its ability to interact dynamically with the air temperature field. Therefore, it is concluded that surface temperature boundary condition is better suited for simulations of temporally evolving ABL flow as in the diurnal evolution of the AB...|$|R

40|$|Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a {{disorder}} {{characterized by a}} sudden attack of severe anterograde memory disturbance that is frequently preceded by emotional or physical stress and resolves within 24 hours. By using MRI following the acute episode in TGA patients, small lesions in the hippocampus have been observed. Hence it has been hypothesized that the disorder {{is caused by a}} stress-related transient inhibition of memory formation in the hippocampus. To study the factors that may link stress and TGA, we measured the cortisol day-profile, the dexamethasone feedback inhibition and the effect of experimental exposure to stress on cortisol levels (using the socially evaluated cold pressor test and a control procedure) in 20 patients with a recent history of TGA and in 20 healthy controls. We used self-report scales of depression, anxiety and stress and a detailed neuropsychological assessment to characterize our collective. We did not observe differences in mean cortisol levels in the cortisol day-profile between the two groups. After administration of low-dose dexamethasone, TGA patients showed significantly stronger cortisol suppression in the <b>daytime</b> <b>profile</b> compared to the control group (p = 0. 027). The mean salivary cortisol level was significantly higher in the TGA group prior to and after the experimental stress exposure (p = 0. 008; p = 0. 010 respectively), as well as prior to and after the control condition (p = 0. 022; p= 0. 024 respectively). The TGA group had higher scores of depressive symptomatology (p = 0. 021) and anxiety (p = 0. 007), but the groups did not differ in the neuropsychological assessment. Our findings of a stronger pharmacological suppression and higher cortisol levels in anticipation of experimental stress in participants with a previous TGA indicate a hypersensitivity of the HPA axis.

40|$|The high power, {{broadband}} {{very low}} frequency (VLF, 3 [...] 30 kHz) and extremely low frequency (ELF, 3 [...] 3000 Hz) electromagnetic waves generated by lightning discharges and propagating in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide {{can be used to}} measure the average electron density profile of the lower ionosphere (D region) across the wave propagation path due to several reflections by the upper boundary (lower ionosphere) of the waveguide. This capability makes it possible to frequently and even continuously monitor the D region electron density profile variations over geographically large regions, which are measurements that are essentially impossible by other means. These guided waves, usually called atmospherics (or sferics for short), are recorded by our sensors located near Duke University. The purpose of this work is to develop and implement algorithms to derive the variations of D region electron density profile which is modeled by two parameters (one is height and another is sharpness), by comparing the recorded sferic spectra to a series of model simulated sferic spectra from using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) code. In order to understand the time scales, magnitudes and sources for the midlatitude nighttime D region variations, we analyzed the sferic data of July and August 2005, and extracted both the height and sharpness of the D region electron density profile. The heights show large temporal variations of several kilometers on some nights and the relatively stable behavior on others. Statistical calculations indicate that the hourly average heights during the two months range between 82. 0 km and 87. 2 km with a mean value of 84. 9 km and a standard deviation of 1. 1 km. We also observed spatial variations of height as large as 2. 0 km over 5 degrees latitudes on some nights, and no spatial variation on others. In addition, the measured height variations exhibited close correlations with local lightning occurrence rate on some nights but no correlation with local lightning or displaced lightning on others. The nighttime profile sharpness during 2. 5 hours in two different nights was calculated, and the results were compared to the equivalent sharpness derived from International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) models. Both the absolute values and variation trends in IRI models are different from those in broadband measurements. Based on sferic data similar to those for nighttime, we also measured the daytime D region electron density profile variations in July and August 2005 near Duke University. As expected, the solar radiation is the dominant but not the only determinant source for the daytime D region profile height temporal variations. The observed quiet time heights showed close correlations with solar zenith angle changes but unexpected spatial variations not linked to the solar zenith angle were also observed on some days, with 15 % of days exhibiting regional differences larger than 0. 5 km. During the solar flare, the induced height change was approximately proportional to the logarithm of the X-ray fluxes. During the rising and decaying phases of the solar flare, the height changes correlated more consistently with the short (wavelength 0. 5 - 4 Å), rather than the long (wavelength 1 - 8 Å) X-ray flux changes. The <b>daytime</b> <b>profile</b> sharpness during morning, noontime and afternoon periods in three different days and for the solar zenith angle range 20 to 75 degrees was calculated. These broadband measured results were compared to narrowband VLF measurements, IRI models and Faraday rotation base IRI models (called FIRI). The estimated sharpness from all these sources was more consistent when the solar zenith angle was small than when it was large. By applying the nighttime and daytime measurement techniques, we also derived the D region variations during sunrise and sunset periods. The measurements showed that both the electron density profile height and sharpness decrease during the sunrise period while increase during the sunset period. Dissertatio...|$|E

Methods: Nine patients with diet treated type 2 diabetes were investigated with <b>daytime</b> <b>profiles</b> of ADMA (8 am- 5 pm) before and during treatment with rosiglitazone for 8 weeks.

However, the nature of postprandial responses in circulating resistin in humans is unknown. Therefore, we investigated postprandial resistin concentrations in a pilot study in 19 healthy subjects and 19 controls matched for age and body mass index (BMI). Serum resistin, insulin and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations as well as plasma glucose and triglycerides were repeatedly assessed before and after ingestion of an isocaloric standardized liquid meal during a 300 min period. After consumption of liquid meal, serum resistin levels increased compared to fasting control (p= 0. 037). Postprandial plasma glucose and serum insulin increased (p&# 60; 0. 001) with lower glucose responses in females (p= 0. 001) and lower insulin responses in males (p= 0. 012).

Mixing ratios of O 3 and CO were enhanced in planetary boundary layer (PBL) being highest in winter followed by summer and wet seasons. The <b>daytime</b> <b>profiles</b> of O 3 show higher values compared to nighttime observations in PBL region, but little differences were observed in the free troposphere. The decreasing mixing ratios of O 3 in the lower and upper troposphere were associated with shallow and deep convections, respectively. Back trajectory and fire count data indicate that the seasonal variations in trace gases were caused mainly by the regional shift in long-range transport and biomass-burning patterns. In wet season, flow of oceanic air and negligible presence of local biomass burning resulted in lowest O 3 and CO, while their high levels in dry season were due to extensive biomass burning and transport of continental air masses. The Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers (MOZART) underestimated both O 3 and CO in the PBL region but overestimated these in the free troposphere.

With a little over 800 meteorological stations available, we obtained a cross-validation {{root mean square error}} of 1. 0 to 1. 2 °C, while the interpolation error is lower, at 0. 5 to 0. 7 °C. A polynomial fit was applied to estimate the <b>daytime</b> temperature <b>profile</b> (assuming only time from sunrise to sunset) from the interpolated three-hour measurements for each month. The curve-fit coefficients make it possible to calculate a number of derived data, such as average daytime temperature, maximum daytime temperature and time of its occurrence within the region.

As an alternative to the polynomial fitting, a double-cosine method was applied to enable calculation of daily (24 -hours) temperature profiles for each month using interpolated minimum and maximum temperatures.

Objective: To {{examine the impact of}} restricted sleep on <b>daytime</b> <b>profiles</b> of ACTH and cortisol concentrations. Methods: Thirteen subjects participated in 2 laboratory sessions (2 nights of 10 h in bed versus 2 nights of 4 h in bed) in a randomized cross-over design. Sleep was polygraphicallyrecorded. After the second night of each session, blood was sampled at 20 -min intervals from 09 : 00 to 24 : 00 to measure ACTH and total cortisol. Saliva was collected every 20 minutes from 14 : 00 to 24 : 00 to measure free cortisol. Perceived stress, hunger and appetite were assessed at hourly intervals by validated scales. Results: Sleep restriction was associated with a 19 % increase in overall ACTH levels (p< 0. 03) that was correlated with the individual amount of sleep loss (rSp= 0. 63, p< 0. 02). Overall total cortisol levels were also elevated (+ 21 %; p= 0. 10). Pulse frequency was unchanged for both ACTH and cortisol. Morning levels of ACTH were higher after sleep restriction (p< 0. 04), without concomitant elevation of cortisol. In contrast, evening ACTH levels were unchanged while total and free cortisol increased by respectively, 30 % (p< 0. 03) and 200 % (p< 0. 04). Thus, the amplitude of the circadian cortisol decline was dampened by sleep restriction (- 21 %; p< 0. 05). Sleep restriction was not associated with higher perceived stress but resulted in an increase in appetite that was correlated with the increase in total cortisol. Conclusion: The impact of sleep loss on HPA activity is dependent on time of day. Insufficient sleep dampens the circadian rhythm of cortisol, a major internal synchronizer of central and peripheral clocks. JOURNAL ARTICLESCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{carried out}} by the University of Basilicata Raman lidar system (BASIL) are {{reported}} to demonstrate the capability of this instrument to characterise turbulent processes within the convective boundary layer (CBL). In order to resolve the vertical profiles of turbulent variables, high-resolution water vapour and temperature measurements, with a temporal resolution of 10  s and vertical resolutions of 90 and 30  m, respectively, are considered. Measurements of higher-order moments of the turbulent fluctuations of water vapour mixing ratio and temperature are obtained based on the application of autocovariance analyses to the water vapour mixing ratio and temperature time series. The algorithms are applied to a case study (11 : 30 – 13 : 30  UTC, 20 April 2013) from the High Definition Clouds and Precipitation for Climate Prediction (HD(CP) 2) Observational Prototype Experiment (HOPE), held in western Germany in the spring 2013. A new correction scheme for the removal of the elastic signal crosstalk into the low quantum number rotational Raman signal is applied. The noise errors are small enough to derive up to fourth-order moments for both water vapour mixing ratio and temperature fluctuations. To the best of our knowledge, BASIL is the first Raman lidar with a demonstrated capability to simultaneously retrieve <b>daytime</b> <b>profiles</b> of water vapour turbulent fluctuations up to the fourth order throughout the atmospheric CBL. This is combined with the capability of measuring <b>daytime</b> <b>profiles</b> of temperature fluctuations up to the fourth order. These measurements, in combination with measurements from other lidar and in situ systems, are important for verifying and possibly improving turbulence and convection parameterisation in weather and climate models at different scales down to the grey zone (grid increment [*]∼[*]  1  km; Wulfmeyer et al., 2016). For the considered case study, which represents a well-mixed and quasi-stationary CBL, the mean boundary layer height is found to be 1290  ±  75  m above ground level (a. g. l.). Values of the integral scale for water vapour and temperature fluctuations {{at the top of the}} CBL are in the range of 70 – 125 and 75 – 225  s, respectively; these values are much larger than the temporal resolution of the measurements (10  s), which testifies that the temporal resolution considered for the measurements is sufficiently high to resolve turbulent processes down to the inertial subrange and, consequently, to resolve the major part of the turbulent fluctuations. Peak values of all moments are found in the interfacial layer in the proximity of the top of the CBL. Specifically, water vapour and temperature second-order moments (variance) have maximum values of 0. 29  g 2  kg − 2 and 0. 26  K 2; water vapour and temperature third-order moments have peak values of 0. 156  g 3  kg − 3 and − 0. 067  K 3, while water vapour and temperature fourth-order moments have maximum values of 0. 28  g 4  kg − 4 and 0. 24  K 4. Water vapour and temperature kurtosis have values of [*]∼[*]  3 in the upper portion of the CBL, which indicate normally distributed humidity and temperature fluctuations. Reported values of the higher-order moments are in good agreement with previous measurements at different locations, thus providing confidence in the possibility of using these measurements for turbulence parameterisation in weather and climate models. In the determination of the temperature profiles, particular care was dedicated to minimise potential effects associated with elastic signal crosstalk on the rotational Raman signals. For this purpose, a specific algorithm was defined and tested to identify and remove the elastic signal crosstalk and to assess the residual systematic uncertainty affecting temperature measurements after correction. The application of this approach confirms that, for the present Raman lidar system, the crosstalk factor remains constant with time; consequently an appropriate assessment of its constant value allows for a complete removal of the leaking elastic signal from the rotational Raman lidar signals at any time (with a residual error on temperature measurements after correction not exceeding 0. 18  K) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} in situ {{measurements}} of ion composition and horizontal winds, taken from equatorial orbiting Atmosphere Explorer E in eccentric orbit during 1975 - 1976 {{to investigate the}} bottomside ionosphere at altitudes 140 - 200 km. Representative <b>daytime</b> altitude <b>profiles</b> of ionization were stable against wide variations in horizontal wind patterns. Special features that sometimes appeared in the structured nightside ionization were apparent ion composition waves, intermediate layers of enhanced ionization, and ionization depletions similar to equatorial ionization bubbles. Apparent ion composition waves displayed a horizontal wave length of about 650 km. Enhanced layers of ionization appeared to be newly separated from the bottomside midnight F layer; its ions were primarily NO(+) and O 2 (+) without significant densities of metallic ions, an indication that metallic ions {{are not required to}} produce the layers at altitudes above 140 km. Equatorial ionization depletions were observed at lower altitudes than previously reported and displayed molecular ion depletions as well as O(+) depletions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAnisoplanatism in Adaptive Optics or Differential Astrometry as in {{ground-based}} solar diameter measurement {{needs the}} knowledge of atmospheric turbulence profiles. MISolFA is a monitor dedicated to statistically estimate <b>daytime</b> turbulence <b>profiles</b> C-{n}**{ 2 }(h) from solar limb agitation measurements. In {{order to understand the}} statistics of the system performance, an accurate numerical simulation of multi-layer anisoplanatic Angle-of-Arrival fluctuations simultaneously measured over different lines of sight is performed. The method developed for this purpose could also be used to simulate other anisoplanatic optical effects of turbulence like phase distortions for imaging. It is based on a modified approach to the Fourier-based methods. Comparing the theoretical and the simulation statistics verifies the validity of the simulation method and its high efficiency. The simulation is then used to test the accuracy of the inversion methods applied to the Angle-of-Arrival statistics to retrieve the turbulence profiles. The method and some results of the simulation will be presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} <b>daytime</b> vertical <b>profiles</b> of the NO[x] concentration, and {{the number}} concentration and size distribution of fine particles near a major road in urban Tokyo during spring 2011. No significant height dependence was observed in the NO[x] concentration, presumably due to rapid diffusion. In contrast, the number concentration of particles under 0. 5 µm diameter demonstrated an exponential decrease with increasing height above ground level. Vertical profiles derived from this study differ from those presented in previous studies, however, these differences may potentially {{be explained by the}} different tailpipe positions of Japanese and US heavy vehicles, as well as the meteorological conditions. This study demonstrates that in Tokyo, the fine particle concentration at 0. 5 m above ground level was about 2. 9 times higher than that at 2. 0 m. The higher fine particle concentration immediately above ground level implies that children may be at greater risk of experiencing pollutant-related respiratory symptoms than adults...|$|R
40|$|The GCOS (Global Climate Observing System) Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN) data {{processing}} for the Vaisala RS 92 radiosonde {{was developed to}} meet the criteria for reference measurements. These criteria stipulate the collection of metadata, the use of well-documented correction algorithms, and estimates of the measurement uncertainty. An important and novel aspect of the GRUAN processing is that the uncertainty estimates are vertically resolved. This paper describes the algorithms that are applied in version 2 of the GRUAN processing to correct for systematic errors in radiosonde measurements of pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, as well as how the uncertainties related to these error sources are derived. Currently, the RS 92 is launched on a regular basis at 13 out of 15 GRUAN sites. An additional GRUAN requirement for performing reference measurements with the RS 92 is that the manufacturer-prescribed procedure for the radiosonde's preparation, i. e. heated reconditioning of the sensors and recalibration during ground check, is followed. In the GRUAN processing however, the recalibration of the humidity sensors that is applied during ground check is removed. For the dominant error source, solar radiation, laboratory experiments were performed to investigate and model its effect on the RS 92 's temperature and humidity measurements. GRUAN uncertainty estimates are 0. 15 K for night-time temperature measurements and approximately 0. 6 K at 25 km during daytime. The other uncertainty estimates are up to 6 % relative humidity for humidity, 10 – 50 m for geopotential height, 0. 6 hPa for pressure, 0. 4 – 1 m s − 1 for wind speed, and 1 ° for wind direction. <b>Daytime</b> temperature <b>profiles</b> for GRUAN and Vaisala processing are comparable and consistent within the estimated uncertainty. GRUAN <b>daytime</b> humidity <b>profiles</b> are up to 15 % moister than Vaisala processed profiles, of which two-thirds is due to the radiation dry bias correction and one-third is due to an additional calibration correction. Redundant measurements with frost point hygrometers (CFH and NOAA FPH) show that GRUAN-processed RS 92 humidity profiles and frost point data agree within 15 % in the troposphere. No systematic biases occur, apart from a 5 % dry bias for GRUAN data around − 40 °C at night...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{re-analysis}} of upper stratospheric ClO measurements from the ground-based millimeter-wave instrument from January 1992 to February 2012. These measurements are made {{as part of}} the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) from Mauna Kea, Hawaii, (19. 8 ° N, 204. 5 ° E). Here, we use daytime and nighttime measurements together to form a day-night spectrum, from which the difference in the day and night profiles is retrieved. These results are then compared to the day-night difference profiles from the UARS and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instruments. We also compare them to our previous analyses of the same data, in which we retrieved the <b>daytime</b> ClO <b>profile.</b> The major focus will be on comparing the year-to-year and long-term changes in ClO derived by the two analysis methods. We conclude that the re-analyzed data set has less short-term variability and exhibits a more constant long-term trend. Data from 1995 – 2012 indicate a linear decline of mid-stratospheric ClO of 0. 64 ± 0. 08 % yr− 1 ...|$|R

After a two week wash-out period, eight hypertensive patients were treated for two consecutive four week phases with 180 mg once daily or 90 mg twice daily of a sustained-release formulation of diltiazem. The sequence of the treatments was randomised and the trial carried out in a double-blind fashion. Ambulatory <b>daytime</b> BP <b>profiles</b> were obtained using a portable BP recorder (Remler M 2000). The average of all BP readings taken during the monitoring period was 159 / 104 +/- 21 / 10 mgHg (mean +/- SD) {{at the end of}} the wash-out period and 145 / 90 +/- 20 / 12 and 148 / 95 +/- 21 / 11 mmHg under treatment with diltiazem 180 mg once daily and 90 mg twice daily, respectively. These data indicate that 180 mg of a slow-release formulation of diltiazem are as effective in lowering the BP of hypertensive patients when administered daily in a single dose as when divided into two doses...|$|R

The scope of this research is to investigate the efficiency of data mining techniques in estimating minimum, maximum and mean temperature values. For this reason, a number of experiments have been conducted with well-known regression algorithms using temperature data from the city of Patras in Greece. The performance of these algorithms has been evaluated using standard statistical indicators, such as Correlation Coefficient, Root Mean Squared Error, etc. Keywords—regression algorithms, supervised machine learning...|$|R

We report a 1994 balloon‐based measurement of the <b>daytime</b> stratospheric HBr <b>profile</b> between 20 and 36. 5 km altitude. The average concentration result of 1. 31 ± 0. 39 parts per trillion in volume (pptv) and an analysis for the concentration versus altitude profile are consistent with previously reported measurements.

30|$|Each {{ozonesonde}} profile {{with the}} new correction factor applied was complemented by the O 3 climatology profile above the balloon burst height. The O 3 climatology profiles were made per month by averaging the O 3 profiles and geopotential heights from the MLS observations between 2005 and 2013 (Livesey et al. 2011) within a ± 5 ° latitude and ± 15 ° longitude box centered on Rikubetsu. The climatological monthly profiles were produced separately for daytime (solar zenith angle (SZA) ≤  98 °) and nighttime (SZA >  98 °) data. The O 3 concentrations above the balloon burst height were provided by linearly interpolating in time the <b>daytime</b> climatology <b>profiles</b> arranged at the middle of each month. Note that since the ozonesonde observations at Sapporo were limited to daytime, only the daytime climatology was used here. If the total O 3 column derived from the ozonesonde profile complemented by the climatology did not agree to within ± 15  % with those derived from the Brewer spectrophotometer at Rikubetsu, we considered that the two instruments observed a different air mass and the ozonesonde data were not used.|$|R

Overall good agreement between radiosonde- and aerosol-derived boundary layer heights was found for all methods.

A comparison of the least squares method (LSM) with the regularization (REG) scheme was carried out using computer simulations. It is shown that LSM results {{are very sensitive to}} random errors in virtual heights. This fact leads to an unpredictably large deviation of the reconstructed N(h) profile from the real one. The application of REG methods makes the results more stable to random errors in measurements and allows us to decrease the deviation of the restored real height and valley depth from their model values by several times in comparison with LSM results...|$|R
