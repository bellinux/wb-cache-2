40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{possible}} relationships between participation in extracurricular activities and student achievement, participation in extracurricular activities and attendance, and participation in extracurricular activities and behavior.

40|$|Although {{there are}} several {{educational}} benefits resulting from participation in high school sports, African American students do not always experience the positive outcomes that other populations share. The purpose of this causal comparative {{study was to investigate}} the effect of athletic participation on the academic achievement of African American high school female students. The sample consisted of 100 female African American 12 th-grade students. Descriptive statistics were collected and analyzed. Analysis involved archival data to determine the <b>grade</b> <b>point</b> <b>averages</b> and graduation rates of student athletes and non-athletes in two urban high schools in Georgia. The study sought to determine if there was a statistically significant disparity between the <b>grade</b> <b>point</b> <b>averages</b> and graduation rates of student athletes and non-athletes and between single sport athletes and multiple sport athletes. Results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference in the <b>grade</b> <b>point</b> <b>averages</b> and graduation rate of student athletes and non-athletes. They also indicate that there is no statistically significant difference in the <b>grade</b> <b>point</b> <b>averages</b> and graduation rate of student athletes who participate in a single sport and those that participate in multiple sports. Findings suggest that participation in athletics should continue to be an area of focus for educational stakeholders as it relates to academic achievement.
