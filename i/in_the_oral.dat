5|$|Most of {{the basic}} laws of kashrut are derived from the Torah's Books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Their details and {{practical}} application, however, are set down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> law (eventually codified in the Mishnah and Talmud) and elaborated on in the later rabbinical literature. Although the Torah does not state the rationale for most kashrut laws, some suggest that they are only tests for man's obedience, while others have suggested philosophical, practical and hygienic reasons.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E
5|$|Although no fossil {{evidence}} has been dated within the last 1,000 years, the hippopotamus has been surprisingly common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> legends of the Malagasy. In 1648, Ã‰tienne de Flacourt became the French governor of Madagascar and {{he wrote in his}} Histoire de la grande isle de Madagascar about hearing stories from the Malagasy about an animal called the mangarsahoc which closely resembled the hippopotamus. In different regions of Madagascar, stories were recorded of the tsy-aomby-aomby, the omby-rano, and the laloumena, all animals that resembled hippopotami, but few other animals on the island. In 1902, a colonial administrator named Raybaud asserted that stories he heard in the highlands could only be about Malagasy hippos still living as late as 1878. The strength of these oral traditions led the IUCN to classify the Malagasy hippopotami as recent extinctions.|$|E

In another version, {{at least some of}} the five sons and eight daughters issued from the king's marriage, and his son Rakotomavo was adopted from a woman called Rangorimanana. The remaining four sons were named Andriantoarana, Andriamohara, Ratsimanjaka and Andriampalimana.

5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries.

5|$|Phips, whose motives {{continue}} to be debated by historians today, claimed this {{was a violation of}} the terms of capitulation, and consequently declared the agreement void.

He had the fortifications destroyed, removing all of their weaponry. Before he left, he convinced a number of Acadians to swear oaths of allegiance to the English crown, appointed a council of locals to administer the town, and then sailed back to Boston, carrying Meneval and his garrison as prisoners of war. Phips received a hero's welcome and was lavished with praise, although he was criticized in some circles (and has been vilified in French and Acadian histories) for allowing the sacking of Port Royal.|$|E

5|$|Scientists have {{estimated}} {{that there have been}} at least 13significant earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone in the last 6,000years. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, was recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island. It caused considerable tremors and a massive tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean. The significant shaking associated with this earthquake demolished houses of the Cowichan Tribes on Vancouver Island and caused several landslides. Shaking due to this earthquake made it too difficult for the Cowichan people to stand, and the tremors were so lengthy that they were sickened. The tsunami created by the earthquake ultimately devastated a winter village at Pachena Bay, killing all the people that lived there. The 1700 Cascadia earthquake caused near-shore subsidence, submerging marshes and forests on the coast that were later buried under more recent debris.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Zahir and the rural sheikhs of the Druze of Mount Lebanon under the Shihab dynasty were mixed. While Sheikh Mansur Shihab of Chouf allied himself with Zahir, his nephew and rival, Yusuf Shihab of the Tripoli region remained {{supportive of the}} Ottomans. Owing largely to the conflict between Zahir and the Druze emirs of Mount Lebanon, he Druze of Galilee did not fare well under Zahir and his Zaydani clan. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> traditions of Galilee's Druze inhabitants, Zahir's reign was synonymous with oppression. During this period, many Druze villages were either destroyed or abandoned {{and there was a}} partial Druze exodus from Galilee, particularly from the villages around Safad, to the Hauran region east of the Jordan River.|$|E
5|$|Andriamanelo was {{the oldest}} son of the reigning Vazimba queen (alternately given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> {{histories}} as Rafohy or Rangita) and her Hova husband Manelobe, who may have had origins in the Zafiraminia people of Anosy. At {{the time of the}} marriage between Rafohy and Manelobe, the Hova were a minority clan who had recently moved into the Vazimba-dominated highlands from their ancestral homeland in the southeast. The marriage produced two sons, Andriamanelo and his younger brother Andriamananitany, as well as a sister named Rafotsindrindramanjaka. In a bid to counteract further fracturing of their kingdom, Rafohy and Rangita decided that while the Vazimba had historically been ruled by queens, Andriamanelo would inherit the crown upon his mother's death and would be succeeded not by his own child but by his younger brother. This system of succession, ordered by the queens to be followed for all time, was called fanjakana arindra ("organized government") and applied to families as well: in any instance where there was an elder child and a younger one, the parents would designate an elder child to assume authority within the family upon their death, and that authority would be handed to the designated younger child in the event of the death of the elder child. The queen gave the village of Alasora to Andriamanelo to rule as his territory while she still lived, while Andriamananitany was given the village of Ambohitrandriananahary.|$|E

5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E
5|$|Rudimentary botanical science {{began with}} empirically-based plant lore passed from {{generation}} to generation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> traditions of paleolithic hunter-gatherers. The first written records of plants were made in the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago as writing was developed in the settled agricultural communities where plants and animals were first domesticated. The first writings that show human curiosity about plants themselves, rather than the uses that could be made of them, appears in the teachings of Aristotle's student Theophrastus at the Lyceum in ancient Athens in about 350 BC; this is considered the starting point for modern botany. In Europe, this early botanical science was soon overshadowed by a medieval preoccupation with the medicinal properties of plants that lasted more than 1000 years. During this time, the medicinal works of classical antiquity were reproduced in manuscripts and books called herbals. In China and the Arab world, the Greco-Roman work on medicinal plants was preserved and extended.|$|E

25|$|Surviving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> cavity, S. mutans is {{the primary}} causal agent and the {{pathogenic}} species responsible for dental caries (tooth decay or cavities) specifically in the initiation and development stages.|$|E
25|$|During its evolution, S. mutans {{acquired}} {{the ability to}} increase the amount of carbohydrates it could metabolize, and consequently more organic acid was produced as a byproduct. This is significant in the formation of dental caries because increased acidity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> cavity amplifies the rate of demineralization of the tooth, which leads to carious lesions. It is thought that the trait evolved in S. mutans via lateral gene transfer with another bacterial species present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> cavity. There are several genes, SMU.438 and SMU.1561, involved in carbohydrate metabolism that are up-regulated in S. mutans. These genes possibly originated from Lactococcus lactis and S. gallolyticus, respectively.|$|E
