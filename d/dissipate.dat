5|$|Currently, it {{is unclear}} whether waves are an {{efficient}} heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves have been found to <b>dissipate</b> or refract before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily <b>dissipate</b> in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>dissipated</b> spaces form a {{class of}} compacta which {{contains}} both the scattered compacta and the compact LOTSes (linearly ordered topological spaces), {{and a number of}} theorems true for these latter two classes are true more generally for the <b>dissipated</b> spaces. For example, every regular Borel measure on a <b>dissipated</b> space is separable. The standard Fedorčuk S-space (constructed under ⋄) is <b>dissipated.</b> A <b>dissipated</b> compact L-space exists iff there is a Suslin line. A product of two compact LOTSes is usually not <b>dissipated,</b> but it may satisfy a weakening of that property. In fact, the degree of dissipation of a space can be used to distinguish topologically a product of n LOTSes from a product of m LOTSes...|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed {{from a low}} level circulation on July 11, well {{to the east of}} the Windward Islands. It attained a maximum strength of 30mph (45km/h), with a pressure of , though vertical wind shear from a subtropical ridge to the north caused it to <b>dissipate</b> on July 12.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, a {{circulation}} {{associated with an}} area of disturbed weather acquired convection and was designated Tropical Depression Nineteen-E. Upon formation, the depression was forecast to <b>dissipate</b> because of strong wind shear. Moving little, its development was constantly hindered by wind shear. The depression had difficulty organizing, and on October 9, it became so disorganized that advisories were discontinued.|$|E

5|$|The storm then {{continued}} north {{for twenty minutes}} over the North Shore suburbs of Sydney before regaining strength and veering northnorthwest again, redeveloping severe thunderstorm characteristics.

5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it {{should be}} {{expected}} that industry will lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state {{that it is an}} empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the large amounts of money involved, encourage non-productive rent-seeking behaviour and lobbying of governments, activities that <b>dissipate</b> economic value.|$|E
30|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} {{with high}} volumes/pressures induces ventilatory induced lung injury (VILI). During each breath, {{part of the}} energy transmitted from ventilator to respiratory system is given back as elastic recoil and part is <b>dissipated</b> into the respiratory system; this amount of energy {{is measured by the}} hysteresis area of the pressure-volume (PV) curve of the respiratory system.

5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to <b>dissipate.</b> When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.|$|E
5|$|Bats may avoid flying {{during the}} day to prevent {{overheating}} in the sun, since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation. Bats {{may not be able}} to <b>dissipate</b> heat if the ambient temperature is too high. Unlike birds which have air sacs or other mammals which have sweat glands, bats have no means to cool themselves by evaporation, though they may use saliva to cool themselves in an emergency.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons that}} remain obscure, the planet's {{thermosphere}} {{is at an}} anomalously high temperature of about 750K. The planet is {{too far from the}} Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that <b>dissipate</b> in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.|$|E

5|$|Further downstream, {{the creek}} passes through Fair Oaks Ranch and Bulverde. The steady flow begins to <b>dissipate</b> {{in certain areas}} as it {{approaches}} Camp Bullis in northern San Antonio, leaving dry patches that reveal a rocky bottom.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather <b>dissipate</b> {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones like Gonu {{are extremely}} rare over the Arabian Sea, and most storms {{in this area}} tend to be small and <b>dissipate</b> quickly. The cyclone caused 50deaths and about $4.2billion in damage (2007USD) in Oman, where the cyclone was considered the nation's worst natural disaster. Gonu dropped heavy rainfall near the eastern coastline, reaching up to 610mm (24inches), which caused flooding and heavy damage. In Iran, the cyclone caused 28deaths and $ in damage (2007USD).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an active damage {{reduction}} control strategy for wind turbines based on <b>dissipated</b> energy. To this end we rely on the equivalences relating both damage in the rainflow counting sense and <b>dissipated</b> energy to the variations of Preisach hysteresis operators. Since dissipation theory is well suited for control systems, we adopt the <b>dissipated</b> energy of a Duhem hysteresis model that is described by a differential equation. Accordingly, we incorporate the <b>dissipated</b> energy into the optimal control problem formulation as a proxy to the damage. Lastly, the proposed strategy is evaluated with NREL’s FAST high-fidelity non-linear wind turbine...|$|R
