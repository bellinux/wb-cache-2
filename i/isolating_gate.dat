Coreless printed-circuit-board (PCB) transformers {{have been shown}} to have desirable characteristics from a few hundreds of Hertz to a few Mega-Hertz and can be used for both power and signal transfer at low-power level. At low operating frequency, the magnetizing inductance has such low impedance that the driving power requirement could become excessive.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{new family}} of zero-current {{switching}} (ZCS) BBR with high power factor using only two active switches is proposed. The proposed BBR {{is based on a}} totem-pole BBR (TPBBR) configuration which allows the current to flow from high side to low side and vice versa during resonance. Hence, no auxiliary active switch is needed to provide soft-switching for all semiconductor devices. The soft-switching also reduces the body diode reverse recovery problem hence allows the TPBLB to operate in continuous conduction mode (CCM). Design considerations and parameter values calculations are given. An experimental prototype is developed and tested to verify the converter performance. The proposed FTBBR is based on an H-bridge rectifier configuration. Only two out of the four switches are needed to be working in order to ensure the continuity of the converter operation. A detailed analysis of the FTBBR operation under all open-circuit faults of the switches is presented. In addition, adding resonant networks to the FTBBR is also analysed. The FTBBR is controlled using similar PWM controller as proposed in the new ZCS BBR. An experimental prototype is developed and tested to verify the converter performance. The TPBBR requires a special switching techniques and sequences, where <b>isolated</b> <b>gate</b> driver is the best solution which allows both high and low side switches to be turned on simultaneously during resonance.
