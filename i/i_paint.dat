5|$|On February 6, 1977, Amtrak {{announced}} plans to spend $24.4 million to overhaul all 61 cars {{as part of a}} larger fleet renewal program. In early 1977, some cars were repainted in Amtrak's Phase <b>I</b> <b>paint</b> scheme with red, white and blue ends and a small Amtrak logo. On September 28, the Amtrak board approved a more limited overhaul program of 16 Metroliners, as well as the purchase of the first 8 AEM-7 electric locomotives. On November 7, Amtrak released a specification for overhauling the 57 unmodified cars. It awarded a $20 million overhaul contract to GE that month.|$|E

Bell argued that [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Paint</b> My Masterpiece" [...] is the better song {{as it is the}} funnier of the two. Bell heard Dylan mocking both his admirers and his own reputation in this composition, while he detected in [...] "Watching The River Flow" [...] an admission that [...] "If creativity is a habit, Dylan was all but cured." ...|$|E

500|$|Borland {{is known}} for {{performing}} in costumes and body paint during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits, and painted as a skeleton and {{what he describes as}} a [...] "burnt match". Describing the character, he stated, [...] "I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots on, and <b>I</b> <b>paint</b> my whole head black—from the neck up—and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth." [...] Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series Babylon 5.|$|E
500|$|On November 17, 2008, {{at the age}} of 92, deHavilland {{received}} the National Medal of Arts, the highest honor conferred to an individual artist on behalf {{of the people of the}} United States. The medal was presented to her by President George W. Bush, who commended her [...] "for her persuasive and compelling skill as an actress in roles from Shakespeare's Hermia to Margaret Mitchell's Melanie. Her independence, integrity, and grace won creative freedom for herself and her fellow film actors." [...] The following year, deHavilland narrated the documentary I Remember Better When <b>I</b> <b>Paint</b> (2009), a film about the importance of art in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{mentioned}} {{his admiration for}} Bob Dylan in several interviews, citing him as an early musical influence. He once commented: [...] "My father {{taught me how to}} play 'Don't Think Twice, It's All Right'. I love Dylan's words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words." [...] Smith covered Dylan's [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Paint</b> My Masterpiece" [...] several times in concert. Smith has also been compared to folk legend Nick Drake, due to his fingerpicking style and vocals. Darryl Cater of AllMusic called references to [...] "the definitive folk loner" [...] Drake [...] "inevitable", and Smith's lyrics have been compared to those in Drake's minimalist and haunting final album.|$|E
500|$|Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan {{reserved}} {{three days}} at Blue Rock, a small studio in Greenwich Village, to record with Leon Russell. These sessions resulted in [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] {{and a new}} recording of [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Paint</b> My Masterpiece". On November 4, 1971, Dylan recorded [...] "George Jackson", which he released a week later. For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of Black Panther George Jackson in San Quentin State Prison that year. Dylan contributed piano and harmony to Steve Goodman's album, Somebody Else's Troubles, under the pseudonym Robert Milkwood Thomas (referencing the play Under Milk Wood by Dylan Thomas and his own previous name) in September 1972.|$|E
500|$|New Seasons {{met with}} WNA {{and offered to}} {{reproduce}} the painting, either {{on the east side}} of the Red Fox Vintage building or the west side of the planned grocery store. Luening said the latter option was more practical, because the artist could paint on panels in her studio instead of working outside. New Seasons hired Dan Cohen of Dan Cohen Creative Labs to duplicate the mural using a method similar to one he uses in his work as a [...] "mega mural" [...] painter. He said of the process: <b>I</b> <b>paint</b> giant advertising murals all over the country. I do about one mural a month. We create the pattern using the original image, and paint on top of it. We use a special machine [...] that works like an arc welder.|$|E

500|$|Heylin {{heard in}} the {{composition}} Dylan's admission that in 1971 he felt uninspired about writing lyrics and had no specific ideas he wanted to voice. The biographer placed this avowal {{in the context of}} changing, polarized critical estimates of Dylan's work in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In June 1970, Dylan had released Self Portrait, an album that received very negative reviews; Dylan's next album that year, New Morning, was viewed much more favorably by critics, and Ralph Gleason declared [...] "We've got Dylan back again!" [...] For Heylin, Dylan's assertion in the song that he does not have any particular message to express, is an attempt to subvert critics like Gleason. Heylin wrote that both [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] and [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Paint</b> My Masterpiece" [...] discuss Dylan's professed lack of inspiration at the time in an honest and satisfying way. Pointing to the fact that Dylan made no attempt to record either a single or an album in the following year of 1972, he commented that [...] "Dylan had now concluded that he must simply sit by that bank of sand and await [...] return." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cahoots {{is notable}} for its cover of Bob Dylan's [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Paint</b> My Masterpiece", {{as well as}} for {{featuring}} the concert favorite [...] "Life Is a Carnival". [...] The inclusion of [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Paint</b> My Masterpiece" [...] came about when Bob Dylan stopped by Robertson's home during the period the band was recording Cahoots. Robertson asked if he might have any songs to contribute that would be appropriate, which led to Dylan playing an unfinished version of [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Paint</b> My Masterpiece" [...] for him. Dylan completed the song soon afterward, and The Band recorded it for the album. [...] "Life Is a Carnival" [...] features horn parts written by producer and arranger Allen Toussaint. It would be the only track from Cahoots the group would keep in their set list through to The Last Waltz concert and film.|$|E

On Rock of Ages, they were bolstered by the addition of a horn section, with arrangements written by Toussaint.

2500|$|He was {{the oldest}} of four {{brothers}} who spent much time hunting, fishing, and enjoying other outdoor pursuits, and doing chores on their farm.

2500|$|Despite {{mounting}} {{problems among}} the group members, The Band forged ahead with their next album, Cahoots (1971). Cahoots featured Bob Dylan's [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Paint</b> My Masterpiece," [...] "4% Pantomime" [...] (with Van Morrison), and [...] "Life Is a Carnival," [...] the last featuring a horn arrangement by Allen Toussaint. Toussaint's contribution was a critical addition to the Band's next project, and the group would later record two songs written by Toussaint: [...] "Holy Cow" [...] (on Moondog Matinee) and [...] "You See Me" [...] (on Jubilation).|$|E
2500|$|The Band {{appeared}} at Bob Dylan's 30th anniversary concert in New York City in October 1992, where they performed {{their version of}} Dylan's [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Paint</b> My Masterpiece".

2500|$|Throughout his life, Curtis enjoyed {{painting}} and, {{since the}} early 1980s, painted as a second career. His work commands more than $25,000 a canvas now.

[...] "I still make movies but I'm not that interested in them any more. But <b>I</b> <b>paint</b> all the time."
