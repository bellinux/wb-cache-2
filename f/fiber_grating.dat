5000|$|A long-period <b>fiber</b> <b>grating</b> couples {{light from}} a guided mode into forward {{propagating}} cladding modes where it is lost due to absorption and scattering. The coupling from the guided mode to cladding modes is wavelength dependent so we can obtain a spectrally selective loss.It is an optical fiber structure with the properties periodically varying along the fiber, such that the conditions for the interaction of several copropagating modes are satisfied. The period of such a structure is {{of the order of}} a fraction of a millimeter. In contrast to the fiber Bragg gratings, LPFGs couple copropagating modes with close propagation constants; therefore, the period of such a grating can considerably exceed the wavelength of radiation propagating in the fiber. Because the period of an LPFG is much larger than the wavelength, LPFGs are relatively simple to manufacture. Since LPFGs couple copropagating modes, their resonances can only be observed in transmission spectra. The transmission spectrum has dips at the wavelengths corresponding to resonances with various cladding modes (in a single-mode fiber).|$|E

According to the working principle, <b>fiber</b> <b>grating</b> laser sensors can be classified into two types: wavelength encoding sensor and polarimetric heterodyning sensor. The former responds to external perturbations in terms of shift in the operation wavelength of the fiber laser, {{which is similar to}} that of <b>fiber</b> <b>grating</b> sensor.

This paper provides a brief overview of some of the techniques that have been used to support high speed measurements using <b>fiber</b> <b>grating</b> sensors over frequency ranges from 10 s of kHz, to MHZ and finally toward frequencies approaching the GHz regime. Very early in the development of <b>fiber</b> <b>grating</b> sensor systems it was realized that a high speed <b>fiber</b> <b>grating</b> sensor system could be realized by placing an optical filter that might be a <b>fiber</b> <b>grating</b> in front of a detector so that spectral changes in the reflection from a <b>fiber</b> <b>grating</b> were amplitude modulated.
