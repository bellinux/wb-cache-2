It {{has been found}} that AFCs operating at higher temperature do not show a reduction in performance, whereas at around room temperature, a significant drop in performance has been shown. The carbonate poisoning at ambient temperature is thought to be a result of the low solubility of K2CO3 around room temperature, which leads to precipitation of K2CO3 that blocks the electrode pores. Also, these precipitants gradually decrease the hydrophobicity of the electrode backing layer leading to structural degradation and <b>electrode</b> <b>flooding.</b>|$|E

NPMCs present an opportunity to dramatically reduce the cost of PEFC electrodes by removing the costly Pt catalyst. To address the significant transport losses in thick NPMC cathodes (ca. > 60 µm), we developed a hierarchical electrode model that resolves the unique structure of the NPMCs we studied. A unique feature of the approach is the integration of the model with morphology data extracted from nano-scale resolution X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT) imaging of the electrodes.

40|$|At present, most {{fuel cells}} employ porous gas {{diffusion}} (PGD) electrodes. Although much {{effort has been}} spent on their development, the performance and cost of PGD electrodes are still major obstacles to the successful commercialization of fuel cells. As a means to bypass the drawbacks associated with PGD electrodes, several researchers have taken an alternative approach to electrode design by considering fluidized bed electrodes (FBEs), a type of <b>flooded</b> <b>electrode</b> that relies on convective rather than diffusive mass transport. Several reviews and past studies claim that FBEs {{have the potential for}} reaching high power density at a low cost due to several inherent advantages. However, the results so far of fluidized bed electrodes applied to fuel cells have been poor, and the past studies have not offered effective explanations for the discrepancy between expected and actual performance. A fluidized bed electrode model has been developed and applied to the data obtained by previous researchers in order to explain the poor performance of these past designs. As points of comparison, models have also been developed to predict the performance of packed bed electrodes and screen <b>electrodes</b> (two other <b>flooded</b> <b>electrode</b> designs). (cont.) Separate models have been developed to consider both ionic and mass transport. Upper bounds on the performance of all three electrodes have been established, and then compared to the performance of PGD electrodes. The results of the models indicate that the PGD electrodes perform better than the packed bed or screen electrodes by at least a factor of two, unless the <b>flooded</b> <b>electrodes</b> are very short (on the order of millimeters). Both mass transfer and the saturation concentration of oxygen in the electrolyte serve as limitations in the flooded designs.

In this case oxygen from a separate gas tank is fed to the fuel cell system. To prevent the loss of oxygen by the exhaust, the cathode gas can be fed back by cathode gas recirculation while oxygen is injected. Thereby the opportunity to feed back the humidity of the exhaust air for additional fuel cell humidification becomes available. The humidification of a PEFC is essential to ensure high protonic conductivity and reduce voltage losses.

The electrical power output of a PEMFC stack is influenced by several independent variables (factors). In order to analyse their reciprocal influence, an experimental design methodology was adopted in a previous experimental session, to determine which factors deserve particular attention. In this work, a further experimental analysis has been carried out on a very signicant factor: cathode stoichiometry. Its effects on the electrical power of the PEMFC stack have been investigated. The tests were performed on a 3. 5 kWel ZSW stack using the GreenLight GEN V I FC Test Station. The stack characteristics have been obtained running a predened loading pattern. Some parameters were kept constant during the tests: anode and cathode inlet temperature, anode and cathode inlet relative humidity, anode stoichiometry and inlet temperature of the cooling water. The experimental analysis has shown that an increase in air stoichiometry causes a signicant positive effect (increment) on electric power, especially at high-current density, and up to the value of 2 stoichs.

However, newer AFC designs operate at much lower temperatures ranging from 23 °C to 70 °C. Another {{advantage is that}} higher reaction kinetics at the electrodes results in higher cell voltages. This high electrical efficiency permits the use of lower quantities of a noble expensive metal catalyst like platinum [9]. AFCs produce potable water in addition to electricity. Therefore, they have been a logical choice for spacecrafts. Most of the AFCs have been designed for transport applications [13]. One of the major drawbacks of the AFCs is that alkaline cells need very pure fuels [9]. It {{is related to the}} use of the liquid electrolyte [14, 15]. The KOH solution is very sensitive to the presence of CO 2. When air is used instead of oxygen, the hydroxyl ions may react with CO 2 contained in the air and an unwanted chemical reaction forms a solid K 2 CO 3 that interferes with the other chemical reactions inside the cell [14, 16, 17]. Another disadvantage is related to the amount of liquid electrolyte. If the liquid is higher or below the required level, it can lead to <b>electrode</b> <b>flooding</b> or electrode drying [9].|$|E

Among the different types, Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) seem at present {{one of the most}} promising choices. A very important component of a PEMFC is the gas diffusion layer (GDL), which has the primary role of managing water in the cell, allowing reactant gases transport to the catalyst layer while keeping the membrane correctly hydrated and preventing <b>electrode</b> <b>flooding.</b> Therefore, GDLs have to be porous and very hydrophobic.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model of the}} nickel hydrogen battery cell has been utilized to describe the chemical and physical changes during charge and overcharge in a recirculating stack nickel hydrogen cell. In particular, the movement of gas and electrolyte have been examined {{as a function of}} the amount of electrolyte put into the cell stack during cell activation, and as a function of flooding in regions of the gas screen in this cell design. Additionally, a two-dimensional variation on this model has been utilized to describe the effects of non-uniform loading in the nickel-electrode on the movement of gas and electrolyte within the recirculating stack nickel hydrogen cell. The type of nonuniform loading that has been examined here is that associated with higher than average loading near the surface of the sintered nickel electrode, a condition present to some degree in many nickel electrodes made by electrochemical impregnation methods. The effects of high surface loading were examined primarily under conditions of overcharge, since the movement of gas and electrolyte in the overcharging condition was typically where the greatest effects of non-uniform loading were found. The results indicate that significant changes in the capillary forces between cell components occur as the percentage of free volume in the stack filled by electrolyte becomes very high. These changes create large gradients in gas-filled space and oxygen concentrations near the boundary between the separator and the hydrogen electrode when the electrolyte fill is much greater than about 95 percent of the stack free volume. At lower electrolyte fill levels, these gaseous and electrolyte gradients become less extreme, and shift through the separator towards the nickel <b>electrode.</b> Similarly, <b>flooding</b> of areas in the gas screen cause higher concentrations of oxygen gas to approach the platinum/hydrogen electrode that is opposite the back side of the nickel electrode.

The fuel cell employed for the experiments is a single PEMFC with a 25 cm 2 Nafion 115 membrane. As expected, a higher cell temperature increases the membrane conductivity and the exchange current density with an improvement of the cell behaviour. An increase in the reactant saturation temperature also leads to a better performance, {{especially in the case of}} low and medium loads.

The main obstacles facing mass-market uptake are the high cost and the longevity of the units; as such, {{research is needed to}} enhance performance and understand the degradation mechanisms. In this study, dynamic compression is applied using a cell compression unit (CCU) to study the effect on performance of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and its individual components with dimension change. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to delineate the effect of compression on contact resistance, membrane resistance and mass transfer losses. Derived parameters such as the ‘displacement factor’ are used to characterise a representative range of commercial gas diffusion layers (GDLs). Increasing compaction pressure leads to a non-linear decrease in resistance for all GDLs. Different GDLs have different intrinsic resistance; however, all GDLs of the same class share a common compaction profile (change in resistance with pressure). Cyclic compression of Toray GDL leads to progressive improvement in resistance and reduction in thickness that stabilises after ~ 10 cycles. During initial hydration of Nafion membranes there is a direct relationship between membrane conductivity and dimensional change (swelling) of MEAs. <b>Electrode</b> <b>flooding</b> is found to result in membrane hydration and an increase in stress or strain, depending on the compression mode of the fuel cell.

Preliminary results validate {{the effectiveness of the}} design in achieving the above goals. A conventional proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) fuel cell con-sists of a membrane/electrode (MIE) assembly sandwiched between two flow fields. The M/E consists of a membrane that is hot pressed between two porous electrodes. The electrodes con-sist of two layers, the catalyst layer and the gas-diffusion layer to which Teflon ® is often added to make it hydrophobic. During operation, the reactant gas flows down the channels that were machined into the flow fields. From the channels, the reactant gases diffuse into the electrodes, through the diffusion layers, to the catalyst interfaces. Figure 1 shows a scheme of a PEM half-cell with a conventional flow-field plate. At high current densities, the reaction rate becomes mass-transfer limited by the transport rate of the reactantlproduct gases from/to the electrode and channel interface to/from the catalyst interface. 1 At the anode, the rate is limited by the transport rates of hydrogen and water vapor from the channels to the catalyst sites. Water vapor transport is needed to keep the membrane hydrated. At the cathode, the rate is limited by the transport of oxygen from the channel to the catalyst sites and water vapor from the catalyst sites to the channel. In addition to the gas-transport limitation, the cathode faces another problem called <b>electrode</b> <b>flooding.</b> The water generation rate at the cathode by reaction and electro-osmotic drag at high current densities often exceeds its removal rate from the inner porous electrode layers in the form of water vapor, resulting in condensation.

As the technology matures, durability, reliability and cost are amongst the most critical issues, so creating {{the need for a}} more comprehensive knowledge of material’s ageing mechanism. In this work, the Membrane-Electrode Assembly, MEA, is considered a key component subject to material’s ageing with considerable impact on fuel cell performance. As it contains the polymer electrolyte membrane, the active catalysts and the gas diffusion layers (GDL), the mechanisms of degradation are complex. Furthermore, performance is also link to components such as gas distributor plates, since the used design and flow channels dimensions (channel width, channel depth, rib width) allow minimization of the diffusion pathway for gases. Effective oxidant supply and water management is greatly affected by cell geometry and materials. In-situ and ex-situ evaluation of MEA degradation were conducted after fuel cell ageing in extreme testing conditions. Humidified and dry gas feeds were also examined and the effect on cell performance and membrane conductivity examined. Variations of membrane conductivity with temperature and water content were considered critical: drying during operation as a result of dragging of water by protons or over saturated conditions cause condensation at the <b>electrodes</b> causing <b>flooding</b> with the consequent voltage degradation. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy was found instrumental in the identification of flooding conditions using an equivalent circuit to model the interfaces at critical current densities, according to the location of identified irreversibility’s in the voltage-current domain of the fuel cell. Electrocatalyst surface area loss due to growth of catalyst particle size and particle agglomeration with the number of load cycles is suggested when using cyclic voltammetry of electrodes, this is thought to be due to a mechanism involving catalyst dissolution/precipitation. Cross sections of the membrane catalyst layers and GDLμs were examined under a FEG-SEM indicating that cathode thickness is considerably reduced as a result of ageing.

The lithium concentration gradients within electrodes {{are affected by the}} cell geometry. Two different geometries are investigated: extending the length of the electrolyte past the edges of the electrodes and extending the length of the cathode past the edge of the anode. It is found that the electrolyte extension has little impact on the behavior of the electrodes, although it does increase the effective conductivity of the electrolyte in the edge region. However, the extension of the cathode past the edge of the anode, and the possibility for electrochemical reactions on the <b>flooded</b> <b>electrode</b> edges, are both found to impact the concentration gradients of lithium in electrodes and the current distribution within the electrolyte during charging. It is found that concentration gradients of lithium within electrodes may have stronger impacts on electrolytic current distributions, depending on the level of completeness of cell charge. This is because very different gradients of electric potential are expected from similar electrode gradients of lithium concentrations at different levels of cell charge, especially for the LixC 6 cathode investigated in this study.

40|$|Direct ethanol {{fuel cells}} (DEFCs) {{have been paid}} more and more {{attention}} in recent years due to the following advantages of ethanol: low toxicity, renewability and easy production by the fermentation of agricultural products [1]. Based on the present status of the electrolyte development, Naifon® membrane series is the most commonly used. It {{is well known that}} its conductivity is dependent on the water content in the membrane in a more a less linear fashion [2]. This necessitates sufficient water in the polymer electrolyte. On the other hand, water content can not be so high that the <b>electrode</b> will be <b>flooded.</b> Proper management of water through the membrane is indispensable for the desirable cell performance. Furthermore, ethanol can also permeate across Nafion® membranes, leading to a mixed potential and catalyst poison at the cathode, consequently causing the decreased cell performance and fuel utilization [3]. These both issues make it necessary to investigate the ethanol/water permeation behavior through membrane electrode assembly in PEMFCs. In the present work, water and ethanol crossover rates through membrane electrode assembly (MEA) were determined in a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEMFC). The investigated MEA consisted of two Pt/C electrodes (40 wt. %) and a Nafion®- 115 membrane as the electrolyte. The anode compartment was pumped by ethanol aqueous solutions with different concentrations, and the cathode was supplied with high-purity helium at different flow rates to sweep off the permeated ethanol and water. The effluent from the cathode was on-line determined by gas Chromatograph (GC- 14 B, Shimadzu). The effect of the operation parameters such as the cell temperature, the carrier gas (He) flowrate at the cathode and the concentration of ethanol aqueous solutions on the ethanol/water permeation behavior was investigated. Based on the experimental results, {{it was found that the}} crossover rates of both water and ethanol increase with the increment of the operation temperature and the carrier gas (He) flow rate at the cathode. It was also found that the ethanol concentration had a significant effect on the crossover rates of ethanol and water. In the case of ethanol, the permeation rates presented a volcano behavior as the ethanol concentration increased, reaching a peak value when the ethanol concentration was 6. 0 mol/L, which could be attributable to the different swelling behavior of Nafion® membrane in different ethanol aqueous solutions...|$|R
40|$|Electrification of {{vehicles}} could enable the transportation sector {{to be more}} efficient with reduced emissions. Polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) vehicles powered by sustainably generated hydrogen fuel would be a viable replacement for internal combustion engines. PEFC powered vehicles are highly efficient and offer zero tailpipe emissions. State-of-the-art PEFCs rely on platinum (Pt) and platinum alloy catalyst nanoparticles supported on high surface area carbon black bound by ionomer. The high Pt loadings currently needed for the low-temperature acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) incur significant costs due to the Pt raw material. Degradation of conventional carbon supported Pt electrodes remains a challenge for the commercialization of PEFCs. In the cathode, the ORR is sluggish and results in a large overpotential loss and hence reducing the Pt utilization. The strategy to make PEFC commercially viable is by reducing the cost through either {{reducing the amount of}} Pt in the electrode or replacing the Pt catalyst with alternative low-cost catalysts. Ionomer binder in conventional electrodes needed for proton conduction introduces undesirable high oxygen transport resistance that further reduces the Pt efficacy. However, novel ionomer-free electrodes, which have an advantage of no ionomer film resistance, relies on water for proton conduction and thus hindering the performance and stability at dry conditions. Alternative electrode designs can potentially alleviate some of the problems in these high power density devices. This work presents an alternative composite Nafion nanofiber catalyst support electrode, in which the oriented nanofibers provide robust internal proton transport to a conformal Pt catalyst coating without impeding oxygen transport. The high-surface-area electrodes are prepared by solution casting Nafion onto a sacrificial template, and thin Pt films are deposited on the nanofibers using either physical vapor deposition or chemical vapor deposition. The electrochemical characterization of the nanofiber electrodes demonstrates the high current density and specific activity of this nanofiber approach relative to prior electrodes fabricated by depositing Pt directly onto other Nafion surfaces. Even with the improved electrode architecture, the Pt raw material cost is still an obstacle. Hence, Pt group metal-free (PGM-free) PEFC cathodes are of significant interest for low-temperature ORR since they have the potential to reduce PEFC costs dramatically. The activity and durability of PGM-free catalyst have significantly improved in vii the last 10 years. However, several challenges remain before they can become commercially viable. The PGM-free catalysts have lower volumetric activity and hence the PGM-free cathodes are thicker than Pt-based electrodes. Thus, they suffer from significantly greater gas and proton transport resistances that reduce the observed performance and robustness of operation. To better understand the efficacy of the catalyst and improve electrode performance, a detailed understanding of the correlation between electrode fabrication, morphology, and performance is crucial. This dissertation reports the characterization of PEFC cathodes featuring a PGM-free catalyst using nano-scale resolution X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT) and morphological analysis. In this work, the pore/solid structure and the Nafion distribution was resolved in three dimensions (3 D) using nano-CT for three PGM-free electrodes of varying Nafion loading. The particular PGM-free cathode being studied feature two distinct length scales of interest and was resolved using multi-resolution imaging in nano-CT. The associated transport properties were evaluated from pore/particle-scale simulations within the nano-CT imaged structure. These characterizations are then used to elucidate the microstructural origins of the dramatic changes in fuel cell performance with varying Nafion loading. The results show that this is primarily a result of distinct changes in Nafions spatial distribution. The significant impact of electrode morphology on performance highlights the importance of PGM-free electrode development in concert with efforts to improve catalyst activity and durability. To understand the potential distribution in the thick electrodes we utilize a novel experimental technique to measure the electrolyte potential directly at discrete points across the thickness of the catalyst layer and evaluate the ORR along the thickness of the catalyst layer. Using that technique, the electrolyte potential drop, the through-thickness reaction distribution, and the proton conductivity is measured and correlated with the corresponding Nafion morphology and cell performance. At this stage of PGM-free catalyst development, it is also necessary to optimize these thick electrodes along with the catalyst. To address the significant transport losses in thick PGM-free cathodes (ca. 3 ̆e 60 m), we developed a two-dimensional (2 D) hierarchical electrode model that resolves the unique structure of the PGM-free electrode. The 2 D computational model is employed to correlate the morphology and the electrochemical performance of the PGM-free electrodes. The model is a complete cell, continuum model that includes an agglomerate model representation of the cathode. A unique feature of the approach is the integration of the model with morphology and transport parameter statistics extracted from nano-CT imaging of the electrodes. The model was validated with experimental results of the PGM-free electrode with three levels of Nafion loading. We discuss the sensitivity of the PGM-free catalyst layer on the operating conditions and the morphological parameters to identify improved architectures for PGM-free cathodes. We employ the model to evaluate the targets for the volumetric activity of the catalyst. A notable finding is the impact of the liquid water accumulation in the electrode and the significant performance improvement possible if <b>electrode</b> <b>flooding</b> is mitigated...|$|E
40|$|Lithium-oxygen (Li-O 2) {{batteries}} are a potential alternative to conventional combustion technologies in the mobility sector. Two possible solvent systems {{are in the}} focus of extensive research at the moment. Namely, systems with aprotic and aqueous electrolyte. Major challenges {{in the development of}} Li-O 2 systems arise from the formation of solid discharge products. In the cathode of aprotic Li-O 2 batteries Li 2 O 2 is formed during discharge. Li 2 O 2 has a low electric conductivity and passivates active surfaces. Additionally it may block pore space and hamper the transport of reactants. In the case of a low solubility and diffusivity of O 2 in the liquid electrolyte, e. g. ionic liquids, this becomes an important capacity and power limitation. Aqueous electrolytes offer an interesting alternative as gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) allow to overcome O 2 transport limitations. During discharge the solid reaction product LiOH∙H 2 O precipitates at concentrations above the solubility limit (cs= 5. 3 mol/l). This causes capacity limitations due to restricted mass transport similar to the aprotic case. A main challenge is to find a stable protective layer for the Li metal electrode. Li reacts vigorously with water which causes major security risks and makes experimental studies on a full cell a difficult task. Therefore, the system is an ideal candidate to be studied in numerical simulations. Here we present a detailed numerical modeling and experimental validation study of aqueous Li-O 2 cells. The simulations are based on a 1 D multi-phase modeling framework presented previously. The framework is capable of describing the formation and transport of multiple gaseous, liquid and solid phases in aqueous and aprotic Li-O 2 batteries. We model capillary-pressure driven transport of the aqueous electrolyte in the GDE. The parameters stem from in-house half-cell experiments and from the literature. Cyclic voltammograms (Figure 1) and electrochemical impedance spectra (Figure 2) were measured with a three-electrode setup in LiOH solutions. Our transport and reaction model was successfully validated over a wide range of temperatures and concentrations (Figures 1 and 2). Precipitation of solid LiOH∙H 2 O is modeled via the classical theory of nucleation and growth. LiOH∙H 2 O can either form heterogeneously on the surface or homogenously on nucleation centers in the bulk of the solution. This gives rise to several possible electrode and cell designs which offer an improved battery capacity. We evaluate and optimize different cell design concepts, including <b>flooded</b> <b>electrode,</b> gas diffusion electrode, porous separator, and bulk separator, under various operation conditions (Figure 3) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{contributed to}} {{research}} on lithium-air batteries with aqueous {{as well as}} non-aqueous electrolytes on the pore level and the cell level. Based on the developed modeling methodologies, we study silicon-air and zinc-air batteries. In aqueous alkaline electrolytes, lithium ions react with oxygen to form lithium hydroxide in a gas diffusion electrode (GDE), where liquid and gas coexist in a porous structure. We model the electrochemical dynamics within a GDE including the effects of pressure-driven convection and multi-phase coexistence with continuum models and Lattice-Boltzmann theory [1, 2]. The lithium hydroxide concentration in alkaline lithium-air batteries is accumulating during discharge until it precipitates. We rationalize that this precipitation is inhomogeneous due to fundamental transport effects in alkaline electrolytes and discuss adjusted cell designs [1]. On a microscopic level, we study the elementary kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction on the active surfaces [3]. A second line of our research is devoted to aprotic solvents in lithium-air batteries. On a cell level, we found that slow oxygen transport in <b>flooded</b> <b>electrodes</b> is a limiting factor for power density [4]. On a pore level, we studied the nucleation of lithium peroxide on the active surfaces of the cathode [5]. The discharge product lithium peroxide is found in different morphologies inside lithium air batteries: either it forms films that passivate the active surface, or it forms particles that grow into the electrolyte pore space. We found out and explained that nucleation of lithium peroxide particles happens at discharge currents below the exchange current of the oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, we are performing research on metal-air batteries based upon zinc- or silicon-ions [6]. Our model explains the experimentally observed dependence of cell capacity on water content in the electrolyte of silicon-air batteries. The addition of water to the electrolyte affects the spatial distribution of the precipitation reaction and thus the balance between anode and cathode capacity.
