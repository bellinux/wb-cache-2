50|$|<b>Diflorasone</b> is a {{synthetic}} glucocorticoid corticosteroid which was never marketed. A diacetate ester of <b>diflorasone,</b> <b>diflorasone</b> diacetate, in contrast, has been marketed.|$|E
50|$|No {{long-term}} {{animal studies}} have been done to determine whether <b>diflorasone</b> diacetate could have carcinogenic properties.|$|E
50|$|Little data is {{available}} regarding whether <b>diflorasone</b> diacetate would {{be present in}} great enough quantities to cause harm to an infant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diflorasone</b> diacetate is {{a topical}} steroid {{that comes in}} the form of a cream. It is {{manufactured}} by E. Fougera & Co. and is used as an anti-inflammatory and anti-itching agent, like other topical corticosteroids. It is prescribed for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, among other conditions. With respect to potency, it is regarded as a Class I steroid (of classes I-IV).|$|E
40|$|<b>Diflorasone</b> diacetate, a new topical corticosteroid, was {{generally}} more potent than three high potency reference standards {fluocinonide, beta-metlwsone Π-valerate and fluocinolone acetonide) when the compounds were dissolved in 95 % alcohol and applied in vasoconstrictor assays in healthy volunteers. On {{the basis of}} additional vasoconstrictor assay results, a 0 · 05 % concentration of the steroid in a cream vehicle containing 15 % propylene glycol was developed for therapeutic evaluation. In a double-blind comparison in 384 patients with dermatoses, 0 - 05 % <b>diflorasone</b> diacetate cream was as eflfective as 0 · 05 % fluocinonide cream in the therapy of lesions of psoriasis or atopic/neurodermatitis. I n t r o d u c t i o n In systematic vasoconstrictor screening tests of new topical corticosteroids, <b>diflorasone</b> diacetate emerged as the best candidate for further clinical testing because of its high potency and optimal physico-chemical properties for topical action when applied with or without occlusion. Figure 1 shows the structure of <b>diflorasone</b> diacetate, which is 6 a-flurobetamethasone 17, 21 diacetate. This paper presents results in studies of vasoconstrictor potency and clinical efficacy of <b>diflorasone</b> diacetate. The vasoconstrictor assays in healthy men were designed to: (a) compare the potency of <b>diflorasone</b> diacetate and three reference standard compounds i...|$|E
40|$|The {{percutaneous}} absorption and disposition of tritium-labeled <b>diflorasone</b> diacetate (6 α, 9 α-difluoro- 16 β-methyl- 11 β, 17 α, 21 -trihydroxypregna- 1, 4 -diene- 3, 20 -dione 17, 21 -diacetate) was {{studied in the}} rat, monkey and man, after a single cutaneous application of the radioactive 0. 05 % steroid cream. The extent of {{percutaneous absorption}} (as measured by excretion) was high in both the rat and monkey, being 88. 2 % (SD = 6. 1 %; n = 8) and 49. 6 % (SD = 15. 5 %; n = 4) respectively, of the net administered dose. On the other hand, only 1. 1 % (SD = 0. 5 %; n = 6) of the net dose was excreted in man, a result compatible with similar data reported for other corticosteroids. The difference {{may be attributed to}} anatomical variation in skin structure (e. g., greater density of hair follicles and hence increased pilo-sebaceous penetration). Evidence for the retention of the unexcreted <b>diflorasone</b> diacetate in the well-known stratum corneum reservoir was provided by the recovery of small but significant quantities of radioactivity {{from the surface of the}} skin of the application sites of all the human volunteers at the termination of the study. The penetration of <b>diflorasone</b> diacetate- 3 H through abnormal skin (abraded to produce hyperemia) was compared with that through normal skin in the animals, but no significant differences were observed except for the prolonged retention of drug-related radioactivity on the abraded skin of the monkeys. The rate of combined urinary and fecal excretion of drug-related radioactivity reached a maximum during the 24 – 72 hr period after drug administration in the rat and monkey, and during the 48 – 96 hr period in man. The redistribution of the applied <b>diflorasone</b> diacetate- 3 H radioactivity from the application site to the rest of the skin was observed in the monkey...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{experiments}} {{in recent years}} have indicated differences in the bioavailability of corticosteroids from seemingly identical topical dosage forms. The human blanching assay was utilized in this study to assess the comparative blanching activities of various locally manufactured proprietary corticosteroid preparations. The first experiment was performed to assess the relative blanching activities of six semi - solid preparations containing the same concentration of betamethasone 17 -valerate. The preparations used were Betnovate cream and ointment, Persivate cream and ointment and Celestoderm-V cream and ointment. This was followed, in the second experiment, by the investigation of the blanching activities of two lotions containing betamethasone 17 -valerate (Betnovate and Celestoderm-V) and a lotion containing betamethasone 17, 21 - dipropionate (Diprosone). The third experiment involved a study of six semi-solid proprietary corticosteroid-containing formulations, viz. Dermovate (clobetasol propionate) cream and ointment, Betnovate (betamethasone 17 -valerate) cream and ointment and Eumovate (clobetasone butyrate) cream and ointment. This investigation was prompted by claims in advertisements in the medical media that Dermovate is therapeutically more efficacious than Betnovate which is more efficacious than Eumovate. The penultimate experiment in this study served the purpose of finding a corticosteroid-containing preparation that falls into the moderately potent group of corticosteroid formulations, as described in the United Kingdom MIMS. This preparation was used in the final experiment which was undertaken to ascertain the potency category of Florone (<b>diflorasone</b> diacetate) cream and ointment...|$|E
