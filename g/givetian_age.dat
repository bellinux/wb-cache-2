40|$|International audienceThe Re-Os {{distribution}} and isotopic composition {{have been studied}} within different ore facies, host-rocks and sediments from the Alexandrinka volcanogenic hydrothermal massive sulphide deposit, Southern Urals, Russia. The osmium contents increase and the initial 187 Os/ 188 Os isotopic compositions decrease in the ore facial range: sulphide chimneys-stockwork zone-seafloor massive and clastic sulphides-metalliferous sediments. This range reflects variable degrees of reduced hydrothermal fluid-oxidized seawater mixing during the hydrothermal ore-forming process. The Os isotopic composition of the hydrothermal sulphide chimney (187 Os/ 188 Os = 1. 3) {{is estimated to be}} a minimum value of the Devonian hydrothermal fluid, which is an intermediate between initial Os isotopic compositions of island-arc volcanics and interlayered sediments. The initial Os isotopic composition of metalliferous sediments (187 Os/ 188 Os ∼ 0. 17 - 0. 2) possibly reflects that of the Devonian seawater. The low rhenium concentrations in metalliferous sediments (about 1 - 2 ppb) could indicate oxic formation conditions. The Re-Os isotope data define a best-fit line corresponding to a Late Devonian age of 355 ± 15 Ma (2 σ) with initial 187 Os/ 188 Os of 0. 12 ± 0. 19. This age could indicate a late Os isotope reequilibration due to ongoing hydrothermal fluid flow from the <b>Givetian</b> (stratigraphic <b>age</b> ∼ 375 Ma) until the closure of the Ural paleoocean in the Late Devonian.

40|$|Fossil {{plants are}} {{described}} {{from the upper}} part of the Devonian Lolén Formation, Sierra de la Ventana, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, in the area of Estancia Las Acacias. The sequence is composed mainly of dark grey shales, and fossils were found in a single horizon where thin inter-layered beds of fine reddish-brown micaceous sandstones appear where the environment of marine deposition became more shallow. The age of the Lolén Formation is presently established on the basis of brachiopods, these being characteristic elements of the Malvinokaffric realm from the Gondwana Lower Devonian (Emsian). The fossil plants are remarkably preserved given that they are in rocks that have undergone intense deformation. The plants are identified as Haplostigma sp. and Haskinsia cf.

40|$|International audienceThis {{extended}} abstract describes well-preserved palynomorph assemblages {{recovered from}} Devonian strata in five shallow boreholes {{in the northern}} part of Saudi Arabia (Fig. 1). These fully cored holes overlap stratigraphically to form a 1, 640 ft composite section spanning the upper Tawil, Jauf and lower Jubah formations (Fig. 2). Only the Jauf and lower Jubah, represented by 188 samples taken over a 1, 300 ft stratigraphic interval, are addressed here as the sandy Tawil lithologies are unsuitable for palynological analysis. The 900 feet of alternating of siliciclastic and carbonate units, that together comprise the five members of the Jauf Formation, were sampled comprehensively. However, the Jubah Formation, like the Tawil Formation, is mostly sandstone and is productive palynologically at only two levels separated by a 300 ft barren interval. The age of the sampled succession is assessed using index species from the established Euramerican Devonian palynozonations of Richardson & McGregor (1986) and Streel et alii (1987), and is shown to span the late Early and Middle Devonian. Miospores dominate the palynological assemblages of most samples. Trilete spores are abundant, whereas monolete spores and cryptospores are less common. At certain levels within the Hammamiyat and Murayr members of the upper Jauf Formation, leiospheres and acritarchs predominate. A specific leiosphaerid typifies the D 3 B palynozonal event that occurs in both northern and eastern Saudi Arabia (Al-Hajri et alii, 1999). Moreover, within these assemblages there are other algal palynomorphs and perhaps a dinoflagellate-like cyst of uncertain affinity (? Arpylorus sp.). However, other specimen of this form must be found before a reliable determination can be made. Undescribed chitinozoans also occur at one level. Figure 2 depicts the palynostratigraphy of the Jauf-Jubah succession. The oldest productive samples are from the Sha'iba Member of the Jauf Formation in the BAQA- 2 borehole. These assemblages include the trilete spores Verrucosisporites polygonalis, Dictyotriletes emsiensis, D. subgranifer and Brochotriletes foveolatus (Fig. 3) and therefore can be referred to the west European Su Interval Zone of Streel et alii (1987). On that basis they are assigned a late Pragian age. Monolete spores (Fig. 3) occur in the upper part of the Sha'iba Member in BAQA- 2 and range to the top of the Jauf Formation. The overlying Qasr and Subbat members present in the BAQA- 1 borehole also contain trilete spores such as Emphanisporites schultzii, Synorisporites papillensis and Knoxisporites riondae (Fig. 3). As the upper limit of the ranges of these species is confined to the Emsian an early to middle Emsian age is proposed for the upper Sha'iba-Qasr-Subbat interval. Hence, the upper Sha'iba monolete spores are among the oldest known since the only other Early Devonian records found are from the early Emsian of Antarctica (Kemp, 1972) and late Emsian of Russia (Arkhangelskaya, 1985). The pseudosaccate miospore Rhabdosporites minutus occurs first in the upper Subbat Member of JNDL- 4. Its occurrence marks the base of the Interval Zone Min of Oppel Zone FD (Streel et alii, 1987). The same levels contain V. polygonalis and Clivosispora verrucata (Fig. 3) species that become extinct before the Emsian/Eifelian boundary. Camarozonotriletes sextantii (Fig. 3) makes its first inception in the overlying Hammamiyat Member of JNDL- 4. Miospore abundance and species diversity are low in the Hammamiyat Member of the JNDL- 3 section, so no palynozonal boundaries can be defined. The Murayr Member in JNDL- 3 is more productive and seems to be of late Emsian age, based on the extinction of C. sextantii, V. polygonalis and Retusotriletes maculatus (Fig. 3) in the upper part of this unit. The miospore assemblages show a marked increase in diversity, as well as a change in composition, in the lower part of the Jubah Formation as found in the JNDL- 1 borehole. This characteristic allowed early workers (Hemer & Nygreen, 1967) to recognize a Devonian (Givetian-Frasnian) section (now termed Jubah Formation) younger than the marine, lower Middle and Lower Devonian Jauf Formation known up to that time. Simple trilete spores like Retusotriletes and Apiculiretusispora are much less abundant in the lower part of the Jubah Formation than in the underlying succession, and more complexly structured and ornamented species such as Acinosporites apiculatus and Grandispora protea appear for the first time. They characterize the AP Oppel Zone of Streel et alii (1987) and in the sequences of western Europe appear just prior to the Emsian/Eifelian boundary. As C. verrucata is still present in the lower part of the Jubah Formation that portion of the formation may be of latest Emsian age. The distinctive camerate spores Geminospora lemurata, Grandispora protea, G. douglastownense and the zonate miospore Samarisporites eximius (Fig. 3) occur in the upper part of JNDL- 1. The first occurrence of G. lemurata defines the base of the Lem Interval Zone of Streel et alii (1987) within their AD Oppel Zone and for this reason the upper part of the JNDL- 1 succession is dated Givetian. Similar assemblages have been described from the Jubah Formation in well TRBH- 1, approximately 150 km north of the BAQA boreholes (Loboziak & Streel, 1995), and from borehole S- 462 located some 100 km north of the JNDL boreholes (Loboziak, 2000). Palynological events characterized by an abundance of a monospecific leiosphaerid (Fig. 4. 1 - 3) occur in the Hammamiyat and Murayr members of the Jauf Formation in JNDL- 3 and JNDL- 4. At some levels, this taxon constitutes almost the whole of the palynological assemblage. These leiosphaerid-rich, low-diversity assemblages can be related to Palynosubzone D 3 B defined by Al-Hajri et alii (1999). Here, this subzone is not as a unique event but is represented by a series of pulses that span some 400 ft of section. In the current study, assemblages of this kind may also include a variety of large aquatic palynomorphs (Fig. 4) that can comprise 10 - 30 % of an assemblage. Most are probably green algae and represent unnamed prasinophyte phycomata (Le Hérissé, pers. comm.). As recognized here, the D 3 B episode is restricted to the Min Interval Zone of western Europe and thus is middle to late Emsian in age. This palynological study determines with great precision the age of the Jauf Formation in northern Saudi Arabia (late Pragian to late Emsian). The Pragian/Emsian boundary is very probably in the upper part of the Sha'iba Member while the Emsian/Eifelian boundary could be in the lower part of the Jubah Formation. However, taxa characteristic of the Eifelian are absent probably because of the 300 ft sample gap in the lower Jubah section of JNDL- 1. The youngest samples from the Jubah Formation are <b>Givetian</b> in <b>age.</b> The D 3 B interval in the JNDL boreholes comprises a series of marine pulses throughout the Hammamiyat and Murayr members of the upper Jauf Formation. Palynostratigraphically they equate with the FD Min western European zones of middle Emsian age. The 400 ft stratigraphic span of the D 3 B episode is much thicker than it is in eastern Saudi Arabia where it is represented normally by but a few tens of feet. Moreover, in the JNDL boreholes the assemblage is accompanied by many other marine palynomorphs that are rarely evident in the east. Monolete spores appear in the upper Sha'iba Member and range to the top of the Jauf Formation. Their appearance in the earliest Emsian as reported here is among the oldest known global occurrences of this tracheophytic morphotype. The stratigraphic palynology presented here is mainly based on species that are common to the established Euramerican zonations. A palynostratigraphic scheme grounded on species endemic to western Gondwana is under development (Breuer et alii, in preparation) and should lead to more refined Early and Middle Devonian correlations in the Arabian Peninsula...|$|R

Our work provides an updated taxonomic treatment of the plant remains. The flora comprises two lycophytes (including Leclercqia complexa), the probable iridopterid Anapaulia moodyi, and two aneurophytalean progymnosperms: Rellimia sp. and "Aneurophyton" maroccanum. Our revision confirms the Termiers' main conclusions that this Devonian flora is to date the most diverse and best known from Africa. Based on the complete paleontological evidence available from this locality, a <b>Givetian</b> <b>age</b> is as likely as an Eifelian age for the flora.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the sedimentological analysis and the ostracod {{study of the}} upper part of the Rivière Fm. and of the stratotype of the Névremont Fm. in the Aisemont section, the reference section for the Eifelian-Givetian boundary (Devonian) in the southern border of the Namur Synclinorium, Belgium. Thirteen major microfacies types are defined. Their stratigraphic succession records the transition from a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate ramp (upper Eifelian) to a carbonate platform (lower Givetian). About 6, 350 ostracods were extracted. Forty species (19 in open nomenclature) are recognized in the Rivière Fm. and 48 species (27 in open nomenclature) in the Névremont Fm. They belong exclusively to the Eifelian Mega-Assemblage and their distribution is controlled mainly by water energy and salinity variations. The sedimentological analysis and the study of ostracods are in good agreement with recent conodont study of Gouwy & Bultynck (2003). Our work confirms the position of the Rivière and Névremont formations boundary and highlights a gap of the major part of the Hanonet and Trois-Fontaines formations of the southern Dinant Synclinorium. This hiatus is probably associated with the lowstand systems tract at the Eifelian-Givetian boundary interval in northern France and southern Belgium (Préat, 2004).

Recrystallisation phenomena that had affected particularly porous skeletons, especially those with small-sized intra-skeletal cavities (i. e. intra-tabular spaces of small-sized tabulate corallites, and inter-laminar spaces of stromatoporoid skeletons) often preclude reliable determination.

40|$|BP/Chevron well 14 / 6 – 1 {{drilled in}} the East Orkney Basin has {{penetrated}} Devonian sedimentary rocks {{which can be}} dated palynologically as within the latest Givetian to early Frasnian interval. This microflora contains the first substantiated record in Western Europe of Archaeoperisaccus, a spore hitherto regarded as restricted to northern Laurasia. Three grey-green intervals within the well contain marine microfossils which provide the first direct evidence for the movement of marine waters into {{the northern part of}} the Old Red Sandstone continent. Onshore an Eday Marls section in the Bay of Berstane, Orkney contains a marine microfauna which demonstrates the presence of a marine incursion of mid––late <b>Givetian</b> <b>age.</b> This is the first record of a Devonian marine incursion in Scotland. Combination of this palaeontological data with sedimentological studies of the Eday Marls and Upper Old Red Sandstone suggests that a wide flat sabkha plain extended eastwards from the onshore Orcadian Basin during the later stages of its infill, and was subjected to episodic marine incursions. These incursions are tentatively linked with marine transgressions into the Argyll area of the Central North Sea. Two orders of cyclicity occur within the dated Devonian interval of 14 / 6 – 1, and are interpreted as resulting from orbital cyclicity (at periodicities of 39. 5 and 413. 9 ky). This indicates that the control on the Devonian sea level maxima may have been orbital cyclicity. These marine incursions are speculatively correlated to high-stands on the Devonian sea-level curve. The Bay of Berstane marine incursion representing the Taghanic Onlap whilst those in 14 / 6 – 1 are the Rhinestreet, Middlesex and Genundewa transgressions. Reconsideration of the palaeogeography of the northern margin to the marine Devonian indicates that the sea entered the Orcadian Basin from the east along the Tornquist Zone at the margin of the Fenno-Scandian High...|$|E
40|$|Taphonomic {{attributes}} of brachiopod-dominated macroinvertebrate assemblages from the Cabeças Formation (Givetian - late Famennian) {{are described in}} the present study. The shelly fossils are restricted to the unit?s lowest part, the Passagem Member (of <b>Givetian</b> <b>age).</b> The member is only recognized on the eastern border of the Parnaíba Basin, Brazil, and consists mostly of sigmoidal clinoforms (sandstones with asymptotic cross-stratification and climbing ripples) and interbedded hummocky cross-stratified tabular sandstone lobes. Three taphofacies have been identified and characterized in outcrops near the villages of Pimenteiras (Oiti) and Picos (Br- 316, km 305), State of Piauí, on the basis of qualitative and quantitative analyses of the taphonomic signatures of macroinvertebrates and plant cuticles. Their origin is related to shallow-water turbidity currents (hyperpycnal flows) originated by a flooddominated fluvio-deltaic system entering shallow marine settings. The taphonomic {{attributes of}} taphofacies 1 indicate a proximal paleoenvironment, interpreted as the distal mouth-bar deposits of a flood-dominated fluvio-deltaic system. This taphofacies features the dominance of the brachiopod Pleurochonetes comstocki (Rathbun) (particularly in sandstones with asymptotic cross-stratification and climbing ripples), and results from the deceleration of highdensity turbidity currents, in which the unidirectional component of the hyperpycnal flow prevails. Basinward, the deposition of taphofacies 2 is related to the deceleration of low-density turbidity currents (in which the oscillatory component of the hyperpycnal flow prevails), characterizing tabular delta-front lobes with HCS, rich in terebratulid brachiopods. Lastly, taphofacies 3 has been originated by {{the upper part of the}} turbidity currents, charged with finegrained sediments, plant debris and mica flakes, deposited as laterally extensive silt/sand couplets at the end of the hyperpycnal flow. The integrated analysis of the taphofacies and composition of fossil assemblages corroborates the interpretation of the Passagem Member as the distal mouth-bar deposits and delta-front sandstone lobes of a flooddominated fluvio-deltaic system, as previously concluded by sedimentological studies.

40|$|Three {{members are}} informally {{distinguished}} in this formation (A, B, and C from base to top). They are {{present at the}} western part of the outcrop (thickness ca. 246 m). On the eastern and southeastern part, only member A and basal part of member B are present and the thickness is reduced to ca. 20 m. A sharp surface of discontinuity separates member A from member B. The Portilla Formation abounds in reef-building elements associated with other groups. Five major carbonate facies types are established that belong to a complex biostromal ‘reef’ facies. Vertical and lateral facies changes are demonstrated. The carbonate facies was deposited in a shallow-marine environment. Towards end of deposition of member A, sharp changes in depositional conditions occurred, soon followed by a notable influx of siliciclastics. A distinctive barrier ‘reef’ pattern was established during deposition of member B. It protected a back-reef area from the open shallow sea. This back-reef environment was separated from an area of dominantly siliciclastic deposition in the southeast by an extremely shallow marine or shoal area which might have been emergent. During deposition of member B there occurred a rhythmic alternation of the back-reef carbonates and the carbonates continuous with the ‘reef’ barrier, probably reflecting minor changes in sea level likely due to epeirogenetic movements of the bottom. Eventually organic growth and associated carbonate sedimentation exceeded the rate of subsidence and as a result the ‘reefs’ laterally shifted seawards, followed by the back-reef facies. The facies pattern suggests an increasingly emergent tendency of the marginal part of the carbonate basin due to bottom movements. The barrier ‘reef’ pattern of member B probably terminated due to changes in relative subsidence during deposition of member C. A strong supply of siliciclastics during the deposition of the Nocedo Formation brought an end to the carbonate sedimentation of the Portilla Formation. The variation in thickness in the Portilla Formation has been mainly due to a slow and prolonged differential subsidence of the carbonate depositional basin. The absence of a large part of member B and member C in the easterly and southeasterly directions is probably largely due to non-deposition of sediments. Seventeen species are described of rhynchonellid brachiopods, out of which four species are new. Three new genera are established. Wherever available some critical German rhynchonellid species have been sectioned for comparison. The rhynchonellid and atrypid brachiopod fauna from the Portilla Formation show a great affinity with the Middle Devonian fauna of Eifel region, Germany. The Spanish fauna could be assigned to the mixed or Eifel facies, or close to this type. Striking similarity exists also between the Spanish fauna and the Middle Devonian fauna from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland. The rhynchonellids and atrypids strongly suggest that the Eifelian — Givetian boundary lies in the basal part of member B. It is suggested that member A is of Eifelian age and that members B and C, apart from the basal part of member B are of <b>Givetian</b> <b>age...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{advent of}} {{reproduction}} by seeds {{was one of}} the most essential evolutionary steps in plant history: the vast majority of living plants are seed plants (spermatophytes). The seed habit includes the following set of defining characteristics: (1) heterospory, (2) occurrence of a single megaspore that germinates within an indehiscent megasporangium (nucellus) retained on the sporophyte, (3) enclosure of the megasporangium in an integument, and (4) capture of pollen before seed dispersal (Rothwell & Scheckler, 1988; Haig & Westoby, 1989). Contrasting hypotheses about the single / multiple, saltational / gradual origin of the seed habit (Chaloner, 1989; Galtier & Rowe, 1989; DiMichele et alii, 1989; Bateman & DiMichele, 1994), and identification of the closest relatives of seed plants (aneurophytalean or archaeopteridalean progymnosperms) (Rothwell & Erwin, 1987; Rothwell & Serbet, 1994; Marshall & Hemsley, 2003) are still matters of considerable debate. Early seeds did not possess the whole set of characters that define modern seeds. They lacked a true micropyle and an entire integument, and none has yet been discovered containing an embryo. Hence they are called preovules. A suite of characters observed in the Late Devonian preovules Moresnetia and Elkinsia and in a number of younger taxa define hydrasperman reproduction (Rothwell & Scheckler, 1988). In hydrasperman preovules, prepollen capture was realized by the modified apex of the nucellus. Prepollen were directed into a hollow lagenostome, then retained in a pollen chamber. A central column attached to the pollen chamber floor sealed the chamber to provide optimal conditions for prepollen germination. The hydrasperman syndrome has been presented as shared by all basal members of the seed plant clade (Rothwell & Scheckler, 1988). Discovery of the Lower Carboniferous preovule Coumiasperma challenged this view. Galtier and Rowe (1989, 1991) suggested that the possession of a massive nucellar tip and the lack of pollen chamber characterized another primitive seed organization that either preceded and was ancestral to the hydrasperman type, or evolved independently and was adaptated to wet habitats. At least six different types of Late Devonian (around 365 Ma) preovules or preovule-like structures are known (Prestianni, this volume). This diversity strongly suggests an earlier evolution of the seed habit. The Middle Devonian (around 385 Ma) Runcaria heinzelinii Stockmans 1968 has been recently redescribed on the basis of new specimens, and interpreted as a precursor of seed plants (Gerrienne et alii, 2004). Since then, more new specimens have been isolated from the original fossiliferous slab. Some of them are illustrated here. Hundreds of Runcaria preovules occur in a single large slab of sandstone from the Bois de Bordeaux Formation collected at the "Plan incliné de Ronquières" locality (Belgium) (Stockmans, 1968). Data regarding the age of the locality are numerous. All plant horizons at Plan incliné de Ronquières belong to the upper (but not the uppermost) part of the Bois de Bordeaux Formation, which from conodont evidence is regarded as Givetian or earliest Frasnian (Bultynck, 1991). Other plant remains collected from the same locality include the progymnosperm genera Protopteridium (= Rellimia) and Svalbardia and the cladoxylopsids Pseudosporochnus and Calamophyton (Stockmans, 1968). The concurrent range of those four genera is restricted to the Givetian (Edwards et alii, 2000). Runcaria is found in association with axes and dispersed leaves of the lycopsid genus Leclercqia, that ranges from late Emsian to late Givetian (Meyer-Berthaud et alii, 2003). Finally, palynological samples yielded more than 30 species of trilete micro- and megaspores that constrain a middle to late <b>Givetian</b> <b>age</b> (TA Oppel Zone; 385 Ma) (Gerrienne et alii, 2004). Specimens of Runcaria consist of 6. 5 to 8 mm long cupulate preovules (Pl. 1, fig. 1) borne singly at the tip of small axes bifurcating at 40 ° to 70 ° (Pl. 1, fig. 2). These stalks do not exceed 3 mm in length and 0. 4 mm in diameter. Each preovule is radially symmetrical (Pl. 1, fig. 3). Cupules form a short cup supporting a single preovule. They comprise four to five segments (Pl. 1, fig. 4) free from each other except at the base, each segment ranging from 1. 6 to 3 mm in length and 1. 1 to 1. 7 mm in width. Cupule segments divide in two halves; each half separates distally in two acute tips (Pl. 1, fig. 5). Lateral edges of the cupule segments are decurrent and form rims along the stalk. Preovules consist of a radially symmetrical megasporangium surrounded by a 4. 7 to 5. 2 mm long laciniate integument. The megasporangium comprises a sessile oval body bearing a distal extension that emerges above the integument and ends up in an enlarged head. The columnar extension is 4 to 5. 2 mm long and 0. 2 to 0. 4 mm wide; the proximal oval body, 1. 4 to 2 mm long and 0. 9 to 1. 3 mm wide. A faint oval mark in the oval body of some specimens may represent the imprint of a megaspore or a megagametophyte, two structures that cannot confidently be observed in ovules preserved as adpressions. The junction between the oval body and the distal extension does not show any bulge that would suggest the occurrence of a pollen chamber. The columnar extension is probably hollow and may be locally enlarged. Its surface is covered by longitudinal ribs separated by deep furrows and twisted counterclockwise. In contrast, the oval body shows a faint polygonal pattern on its surface (Pl. 1, fig. 6). The distal head ending the columnar extension is up to 470 µm wide and 780 µm long. It is made up of cells with thinner walls than those of other cells of the megasporangium. Its external surface is smooth and may show a distal projection. There is no evidence of an opening or dehiscence mark on any part of the megasporangium. The integument separates into a minimum of 16 lobes free from each other and from the megasporangium down to the base. The lobes converge distally, their tips appressed or wrapping around the columnar extension at about 2 / 3 of its length. Lobes either lie vertically along the megasporangium or separate from it in a counterclockwise spiral, to form the loose walls of a chamber surrounding the basal part of the megasporangium. Individual lobes are up to 100 µm wide and are comprised of elongate thickened cells. In the chamber, they are separated from each other by spaces exceeding 100 µm in width. Many microspores occur around the cupulate preovules and among the integumentary lobes, but none adhere to the distal head of the megasporangium or to the column. Despite the lack of evidence concerning its megaspore/megagametophyte content, Runcaria displays three characters (modified megasporangial apex, dissected integument, and a cupule) specific to early seed plants, that indicate its spermatophytic affinities (Rothwell & Scheckler, 1988). Salient features of the nucellar apex of Runcaria are its extensive length, probably hollow structure, lack of opening and an enlarged cellular tip. Based on that morphology, several scenarios are proposed for the pollination of this ancient seed. All assume that the distal extension of the megasporangium played a significant role because of the selective advantage that its length may have provided in the passive capture of airborne prepollen. If the Ronquières specimens were in a pre-pollination state of development, we are faced with the problem encountered in Coumiasperma where antherozoids must penetrate the wall of a closed megasporangium to reach the female gametophyte (Galtier & Rowe, 1989, 1991). The first scenario involves the lysigeneous dissolution of some nucellar cells, better realized at a site where they are thin-walled. This is the case at the enlarged extremity of the columnar extension, but this site occurs at some distance from the megagametophyte within the oval body. We cannot exclude, therefore, that microspores/ antherozoids caught on the nucellar extension reached the oval body and dissolved cells closer to the presumed site of archegonial development. An alternative mechanism to induce cell wall dissolution, also presented for Coumiasperma, involves siphonogamy. However, the earliest evidence for pollen tubes is much later, within the Late Carboniferous callistophytalean pteridosperms (Rothwell, 1972). If the Ronquières preovules were fossilized at a post-pollination stage, the distal head may represent a mass of cells produced to seal the columnar extension, open before pollination occurred. Available specimens of Runcaria do not provide any information relative to the occurrence of what could be interpreted as a hydrasperman pollen chamber. Furthermore, the mechanism proposed for sealing the preovule after pollination in this third scenario differs significantly from that involving a central column in hydrasperman structures (Rothwell & Scheckler, 1988). The nucellar extension of Runcaria thus differs from that of Coumiasperma and that of the hydrasperman preovules. It is currently premature to assume that the runcarian morphology, and the pollination mechanism attached to it, either is ancestral to all younger ovular morphologies and supports the monophyly of the Spermatophytes, or is divergent and represents an extinct group unrelated to Coumiasperma and to the hydrasperman seed plants. However, as has been already realized from younger evidence, the morphology of Runcaria confirms that pollination was an essential factor driving the evolution of early seed plants (Rothwell & Scheckler, 1988; Haig & Westoby, 1989; Bateman & DiMichele, 1994). An unexpected trait of Runcaria is related to the length of the integumentary lobes that leave the distal extremity of the megasporangium free and unprotected. Aerodynamic experiments (Niklas, 1981) showed that integument lobes projecting above the nucellar tip, a feature shared by most early preovules, created as many zones of turbulence around the lagenostome and decreased the probability that prepollen were specifically directed to this structure. Hypotheses predicting a similar morphology in the most primitive preovules were thus faced with the paradox that the development of such an integument appeared counter-selective for pollination, a naked nucellus being more efficient for that function (Haig & Westoby, 1989). With its integumentary lobes leaving the nucellar tip free and thus providing direct access for airborne prepollen, Runcaria sheds some light on the adaptive significance of the integument in earliest seeds. If adaptive, evolution of the integument was not driven by selective forces related to pollination but to other necessities yet to be identified, presumably related to protection, nutrition and/or dispersal. The late Middle Devonian Runcaria is a complex structure that already possessed the full set of attributes, including a cupule, that characterize younger seeds. It shows that the evolution of the integument was potentially involved in protection, nutrition and/or dispersal. The morphology of the nucellar apex of Runcaria differs from that of the hydrasperman preovules which therefore can no longer be presented as the single primitive type in the seed plant stem group. Runcaria evolved in the Givetian when progymnosperms were represented by the Aneurophytales and the earliest representatives of the Archaeopteridales (Beck & Wight, 1988). The Middle Devonian age of Runcaria closes the stratigraphical and evolutionary gap between the Aneurophytales and the oldest seed plants that, prior to this discovery, was presented as a major argument against a direct relationship between these two groups (Hilton, 1998; Marshall & Hemsley, 2003). Moreover, if seed characters were acquired sequentially, it implies an earlier, possibly early Middle Devonian, origin for the seed habit, when the only known representatives of the progymnosperms were aneurophytaleans...|$|E
