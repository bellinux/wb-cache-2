5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star {{at the very top}} of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star from the central figure, and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, {{suggests}} an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|At a <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> , <b>the</b> Japanese fleet {{began to}} {{fire on the}} Chaoyong. Within a few minutes, fires broke out, which quickly engulfed the central {{superstructure}} with its numerous wooden partitions covered with thick layers of flammable varnish applied over the years. Yangwei quickly suffered the same fate. As the Chaoyong attempted to make way to a nearby island to beach itself, it collided with the Chinese cruiser , before listing to starboard and sinking in shallow water nearby. Some of the crew were rescued by a Chinese torpedo boat engaged in the battle.|$|E
5|$|B. From the 2000 season, races stopped {{after two}} laps but before three-quarters race {{distance}} {{had been completed}} would be restarted with the cars lining up on the grid in the order {{they were at the}} end of the penultimate lap before the lap during which the red flag was shown. Only the race order and number of laps completed was taken into account for the new race, time differences between the cars were voided. The <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new race was the number of laps remaining from the original races, less three laps.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fish.|$|E

Bavetta lost the race despite a last-second dive and Barkley running the last portion of the race backwards. The dive resulted in an abrasion injury to Bavetta's right knee.|$|E

5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burst, but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Following the Babylonians, {{significant}} {{advances in}} astronomy {{were made in}} ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena. In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon and Sun, {{and was the first}} to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system. In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered precession, calculated the size and <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe. Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy. The Antikythera mechanism (c. 150–80 BC) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, Moon, and planets for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe.|$|E

5|$|In his 1698 book Cosmotheoros, Christiaan Huygens {{estimated}} {{the distance to}} Sirius at 27664 times the <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth to the Sun (about 0.437 light years, translating to a parallax of roughly 7.5 arcseconds). There were several unsuccessful attempts to measure the parallax of Sirius: by Jacques Cassini (6 seconds); by some astronomers (including Nevil Maskelyne) using Lacaille's observations made at the Cape of Good Hope (4 seconds); by Piazzi (the same amount); using Lacaille's observations made at Paris, more numerous and certain than those made at the Cape (no sensible parallax); by Bessel (no sensible parallax).|$|E

5|$|On June 2, 1775, Jones' ships {{arrived in}} the port at Machias. However, they were met with {{resistance}} from the townspeople when Jones refused to sell his pork and flour unless {{he was allowed to}} load lumber for Boston. In a meeting on June 6, 1775, the townspeople voted against doing business with Jones. The hostile climate forced Jones to take action by ordering Moore to bring the Margaretta within firing <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town. The threat prompted the townspeople to meet for a second time, and they voted to permit trade. The Unity was docked at the wharf to begin unloading the supplies.|$|E
