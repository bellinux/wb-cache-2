25|$|Mbeki {{devoted his}} life to the ANC and during his years in exile was given {{increased}} responsibility. Following the 1976 Soweto riots – a student uprising in the township outside Johannesburg – he initiated a regular radio broadcast from Lusaka, tying ANC followers inside the country to their exiled leaders. Encouraging activists to keep up the pressure on the apartheid regime was a key component in the ANC's campaign to liberate their country. In the late 1970s, Mbeki made a number of trips to the United States in search of support among US corporations. Literate and funny, he made a wide circle of friends in New York City. Mbeki was appointed head of the ANC's <b>information</b> <b>department</b> in 1984 and then became head of the international department in 1989, reporting directly to Oliver Tambo, then President of the ANC. Tambo was Mbeki's long-time mentor.|$|E
25|$|During World War II Paavolainen {{served at}} the <b>Information</b> <b>Department</b> of the Headquarters. He was posted after the {{outbreak}} of the Winter War to Mikkeli in eastern Finland, as adjutant to an infantry general and visited Vienola in 1944. His childhood home with its famous palm tree room was destroyed. It was the last time he saw his place of birth. Paavolainen's critical World War II diary Synkkä yksinpuhelu, published in 1946, was attacked domestically because of its opposition and surmounted opinions of the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, and Paavolainen's suggested anticipation of the defeat in the early war years. While Paavolainen was during 1940-1941 enthusiastic about an expected German victory and had contacts to the Nazi-inspired Suomen Kansallissosialistinen Työjärjestö (SKT, 'National Socialist Worker's Organization of Finland), he soon started to have reservations about Finland's alliance with Germany as the tide of the war turned against them. After Synkkä yksinpuhelu received major criticism in Finland, Paavolainen effectively ended his career as a publishing writer.|$|E
