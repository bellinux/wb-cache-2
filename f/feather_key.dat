5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the wafer tumbler lock in the United States is the patent in 1868 by Philo Felter. Manufactured in Cazenovia, New York, it used a flat double-bitted key. Felter's lock was patented only three years after Linus Yale, Jr. received a patent for his revolutionary pin tumbler mortise lock, {{considered to be the}} first pin tumbler lock of the modern era. That lock featured a flat steel key, referred to as a [...] "feather key" [...] because of the marked contrast with the heavy bit keys of the day. Just two years later, Hiram S. Shepardson produced a different type of wafer tumbler lock, which used a single-bitted flat steel key, similar to Yale's <b>feather</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E
40|$|In many bird species, the sex {{determination}} {{is very difficult}} in young birds and many adults. Nowa-days, sex identification of animals throughout their lives is possible by molecular genetic techniques. In the present study, the sex identification of canaries by PCR methods based on chromo helicase DNA binding protein CHD-Z and CHD-W genes were explained. Genomic DNA was extracted from feather bulb (old and young) of canary. PCR reaction was performed {{by a set of}} novel primers. The results showed two amplified fragments, about 345 and 306 bp for female, and only one 306 bp am-plified PCR product for male canaries. This result was shown for each sample. This sex identification system which presented for the first time, especially in canaries.

40|$|ABSTRACT Chickens from a {{commercial}} broiler stock were tested {{to ascertain whether}} presence of the sex-linked early (k +) and late (K) feathering alleles caused a difference in feather cover (weight of feathers) at 147 and 196 days of age. There were no differences between early and late feathering females for absolute feather weight or feather weight {{as a percentage of}} body weight. Early feathering males had heavier body weights and feather weights than early feathering females, but {{there was no difference between}} sexes for percent feather weight. Females at 147 days of age had greater percent feather weight than at 196 days of age due to an increase in body weight but not in <b>feather</b> weight.

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was carried out to compare the {{productivity}} and profitability of two exotic commercial layer strains commonly raised for egg production in Nigeria. They are brown (Isa Brown) and black (Bovan Nera) feathered layer strains. Inputs such as feeds, labor and drugs as well as income generated from eggs produced including money realized from culls (spent layers) were considered for comparative economic analyses. In terms of egg production, brown feathered layers produced 326 ± 51. 3 eggs/week and black recorded 273. 12 ± 36. 9 eggs/week and the difference was statistically different (p< 0. 01). Brown layers produced more eggs/bird/week during the observed period than black layers. In terms of net returns, brown layers also recorded higher (p< 0. 01) profitability level than their black counterparts. The brown birds had $ 4, 345. 1 per farm and black recorded $ 2, 229. 5 per farm. The difference was $ 2, 115. 5 in favor of brown layers. The result showed that brown layers are good converters of feeds to eggs, consumed less than black layers and yet produced more eggs than the latter. Brown feathered strain therefore, appeared commercially productive and profitable than black <b>feathered</b> ones. <b>Key</b> words: Strain, exotic, egg, feather, productivit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Feather {{constitutes}} over 90 % protein, {{the main}} component being beta-keratin, a fibrous and insoluble structural protein extensively cross linked by disulfide bonds. This renders them resistant to digestion by animal, insects and proteases leading to serious disposal problems. In addition to this, feather waste is produced {{at the rate}} of 22 million kg per year (US alone). Use of keratinolytic microorganisms for feather degradation is an economical, environmental friendly alternative. Keratinases which are produced by these keratinolytic organisms could be used to degrade feather waste and further the digested products could be an excellent material for producing animal feed, fertilizers or natural gas. A feather-degrading bacterium was isolated from poultry waste. This bacterium was grown in basal media with feathers as its primary source of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and energy. The organism is rod shaped, highly motile, endospore forming, catalase positive and gram negative. Phenotypic characterization carried out in our laboratory showed that this novel gram negative bacterium belongs to Bacillus genus. The organism is designated as Bacillus and named as Bacillus sp PW- 1. The isolated strain has activity of 50 U/ml. This novel keratinolytic isolate could be a potential candidate for degradation and utilization of <b>feather</b> keratin. <b>Key</b> words: <b>Feather,</b> keratin, feather degrading bacterium, poultry waste, keratinolytic activit...|$|R
40|$|Penguin {{feathers}} {{are highly}} modified {{in form and}} function, {{but there have been}} no fossils to inform their evolution. A giant penguin with feathers was recovered from the late Eocene (similar to 36 million years ago) of Peru. The fossil reveals that <b>key</b> <b>feathering</b> features, including undifferentiated primary wing feathers and broad body contour feather shafts, evolved early in the penguin lineage. Analyses of fossilized color-imparting melanosomes reveal that their dimensions were similar to those of non-penguin avian taxa and that the feathering may have been predominantly gray and reddish-brown. In contrast, the dark black-brown color of extant penguin feathers is generated by large, ellipsoidal melanosomes previously unknown for birds. The nanostructure of penguin feathers was thus modified after earlier macrostructural modifications of feather shape linked to aquatic flight...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The ephrin {{receptor}} (Eph) tyrosine kinases {{and their}} ephrin ligands {{are involved in}} morphogenesis during organ formation. We studied their role in feather morphogenesis, focusing on ephrin-B 1 and its receptor EphB 3. Early in feather development, ephrin-B 1 mRNA and protein {{were found to be}} expressed in the dermal condensation, but not in the inter-bud mesenchyme. Later, in feather buds, expression was found in both the epithelium and mesenchyme. In the feather follicle, ephrin-B 1 protein expression was found to be enriched in the feather filament epithelium and in the marginal plate which sets the boundary between the barb ridges. EphB 3 mRNA was also expressed in epithelia. In the feather bud, its expression was restricted to the posterior bud. In the follicle, its expression formed a circle at the bud base which may set the boundary between bud and inter-bud domains. Perturbation with ephrin-B 1 /Fc altered feather primordia segregation and feather bud elongation. Analyses revealed that ephrin-B 1 /Fc caused three types of changes: blurred placode boundaries with loose dermal condensations, incomplete follicle invagination with less compact dermal papillae, and aberrant barb ridge patterning in feather filament morphogenesis. Thus, while ephrin-B 1 suppression does not inhibit the initial emergence of a new epithelial domain, Eph/ephrin-B 1 interaction is required for its proper completion. Consequently, we propose that interaction between ephrin-B 1 and its receptor is involved in boundary stabilization during <b>feather</b> morphogenesis. <b>KEY</b> WORDS: skin appendage development, boundary formation, border formatio...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Broilers {{reared in}} cages {{have a high}} {{incidence}} of wing breakage during processing. Three trials were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} cage dimensions and floor types on bone breaking strength and wing breakage during processing. Broilers were fed commercial-type diets and processed through the pickers at a commercial processing plant or a research facility. Broken bones were detected by palpation, and humeri and tibia were removed. Breaking strength was determined for the humeri and tibia with a testing instrument. Incidence of breast blisters, crooked keels, follicle infection, fleshing downgrades, and slabsidedness were determined in one trial. Cage height was the major factor affecting wing breakage and humerus strength. Incidence of wing breakage for broilers on wire floors with cages. 64 m high was not significantly different from that of control broilers reared on litter with ceiling 2. 54 m high. Humerus breaking strength was significantly reduced in two of three trials by the, 64 -m-high ceiling. Cage rearing increased the incidence of crooked keels and <b>feather</b> follicle infections.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} floor types on the {{incidence}} of feather follicle infection and breast blisters in caged broilers was investigated in two trials. Broilers were reared on corn-soybean meal diets with warm-room brooding. Floor types included litter (control), wire, wire covered with vari-ous types of plastic mats, and wire woven with surgical tubing. In trial 1, {{the effect of a}} coccidio-stat (monensin, 120 mg/kg of feed) was investigated for broilers not on litter, and in trial 2, the effect of supplemental zinc was investigated. Broilers were processed in the laboratory processing plant when they were 51 (trial 1) and 53 days old (trial 2). Carcasses were evaluated for the occurrence of fleshing downgrades, crooked keels, feather follicle infection, and breast blisters. Incidence of feather follicle infection was low for broilers on litter or wire floor and high for broilers reared on plastic mats. Breast blister inci-dence was low for broilers on litter and plastic mats and was high for broilers on the wire floor. Overall carcass quality for litter (control) was superior to any of the cage treatments. Neither the coccidiostat nor supplemental zinc affected {{the incidence of}} breast blisters or <b>feather</b> follicle infection.
