50|$|One- and {{two-dimensional}} {{forms of}} nucleic acids (e.g., single strands, linear duplexes, and plasmids) are important biological machinery for the storage and transmission of genetic information (Fig. 1). Underlying this utility are the bioprogrammable interactions between complementary nucleotide bases. Scientists and engineers have been synthesizing and, in certain cases, mass-producing such structures for decades {{in an effort}} to understand and exploit this elegant recognition motif. The recognition abilities of nucleic acids are enhanced when arranged in a spherical geometry, which allows for polyvalent interactions. This polyvalency, along with the high density and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>orientation</b> described above, helps to explain why a three-dimensional nucleic acid structure fundamentally composed of linear, one-dimensional nucleic acids exhibits dramatically different properties than its lower-dimensional constituents (Fig. 2).|$|E

5000|$|Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is a monoamine {{neurotransmitter}} {{that plays}} a role in mood, eating, sleeping, arousal and potentially visual orientation processing. To investigate its function in visual orientation, researchers have utilised MDMA, or as it is commonly referred to, Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). [...] MDMA is known to affect serotonin neurons in the brain and cause neurotoxicity. Serotonin has been hypothesised to be involved in visual orientation because individuals who use MDMA exhibit an increase in the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect (TAE). The TAE is a visual illusion where viewing lines in one direction, {{for an extended period of}} time, produces the perception of a tilt in the opposite direction to vertical lines subsequently viewed. This effect is proposed to occur due to lateral inhibition to orientation sensitive neurons in the occipital lobe. Lateral inhibition is where neurons that become activated to a particular orientation send inhibitory signals to their neighbouring neurons. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>orientation</b> that each neuron becomes maximally excited to is referred to as the tuning bandwidth. Lateral inhibition consequently plays a pivotal role in each neuron's tuning bandwidth, such that if lateral inhibition no longer occurs, a greater number of neurons will become stimulated to the same orientation. This results in the activated neurons becoming adapted to the same orientation stimulus, if the stimulus is viewed for a period of time. As a consequence, if those neurons are subsequently 'shown' another stimulus that differs slightly in its orientation, those neurons are no longer able to achieve the same level of response as compared to other non-adapted neurons.|$|E

In this work, p-type Bi 0. 4 Sb 1. 6 Te 3 samples were prepared under various conditions (temperature, holding time, and ramp-rate) using spark plasma sintering (SPS). The effects of SPS conditions on the anisotropic thermoelectric properties and microstructure evolutions were systematically investigated. The change of sintering temperature showed stronger influence than other sintering parameters to the resulting thermoelectric properties. Samples sintered over the temperature range between 653 K and 773 K showed significant differences in the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>orientations.</b> The change was mainly caused by grain growth and re-orientation. Despite of the anisotropy, zT value as high as 1. 2 to 1. 3 was achieved over the temperature range of 300 to 360 K by directly using commercial power sintered at 723 and 773 K.

In {{order to}} study the orientational {{relationship}} between Ca(OH) ~ and CaO, the transformation {{was carried out in}} stages inside an electron microscope by condensing the electron beam, and the process was monitored by electron diffraction.

Intracellular spatial distribution of actin CSKs was visualized fluorescently by high Z-resolution cross-sectional observation of a cell on which indentation mapping analysis had been performed in advance.
