25|$|The {{underlying}} {{scientific basis}} for blood clotting and <b>hemostasis</b> {{is discussed in}} detail in the articles, Coagulation, <b>hemostasis</b> and related articles. The discussion here {{is limited to the}} common practical aspects of blood clot formation which manifest as bleeding.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hemostasis</b> is {{achieved}} with either cautery or digital pressure.|$|E
25|$|CD36 {{has also}} been implicated in <b>hemostasis,</b> thrombosis, malaria, inflammation, lipid {{metabolism}} and atherogenesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{usage of}} Roman numerals rather than eponyms or {{systematic}} names was agreed upon during annual conferences (starting in 1955) of <b>hemostasis</b> experts. In 1962, consensus was achieved on the numbering of factors I-XII. This committee {{evolved into the}} present-day International Committee on Thrombosis and <b>Hemostasis</b> (ICTH). Assignment of numerals ceased in 1963 after the naming of Factor XIII. The names Fletcher Factor and Fitzgerald Factor were given to further coagulation-related proteins, namely prekallikrein and high-molecular-weight kininogen, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Coagulation begins almost {{instantly}} after {{an injury to}} the blood vessel has damaged the endothelium lining the vessel. Leaking of blood through the endothelium initiates two processes: changes in platelets, and the exposure of subendothelial tissue factor to plasma Factor VII, which ultimately leads to fibrin formation. Platelets immediately form a plug {{at the site of}} injury; this is called primary <b>hemostasis.</b> Secondary <b>hemostasis</b> occurs simultaneously: Additional coagulation factors or clotting factors beyond Factor VII (listed below) respond in a complex cascade to form fibrin strands, which strengthen the platelet plug.|$|E
25|$|The early phase, {{which begins}} {{immediately}} following skin injury, involves cascading molecular and cellular events leading to <b>hemostasis</b> and {{formation of an}} early, makeshift extracellular matrix that provides structural staging for cellular attachment and subsequent cellular proliferation.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being the cellular effector of <b>hemostasis,</b> platelets are rapidly deployed to sites of injury or infection, and potentially modulate inflammatory processes by interacting with leukocytes and by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators.|$|E
25|$|Bernard-Soulier {{syndrome}} is a defect or deficiency in GPIb. GPIb, the receptor for vWF, can be defective {{and lead to}} lack of primary clot formation (primary <b>hemostasis)</b> and increased bleeding tendency. This is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder.|$|E
25|$|Thrombasthenia of Glanzmann and Naegeli (Glanzmann thrombasthenia) is {{extremely}} rare. It {{is characterized by}} a defect in GPIIb/IIIa fibrinogen receptor complex. When GPIIb/IIIa receptor is dysfunctional, fibrinogen cannot cross-link platelets, which inhibits primary <b>hemostasis.</b> This is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder.|$|E
25|$|Laser surgery {{offers a}} number of benefits, {{including}} reduced risk of infection, less post-operative pain and swelling, reduced bleeding and improved visibility of the surgical field. Better <b>hemostasis</b> and visibility can in some cases minimize the need for anesthesia and/or reduce overall surgical time.|$|E
25|$|Drug {{interactions}} with drotrecogin {{have not been}} systematically studied in patients with severe sepsis. Caution should be exercised when using other drugs that affect <b>hemostasis</b> concomitantly with drotrecogin (e.g. aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel). However, the use of low dose prophylactic Heparin did not affect safety when given concurrently with drotrecogin.|$|E
25|$|Some medical {{conditions}} {{can also make}} patients susceptible to bleeding. These are conditions that affect the normal hemostatic (bleeding-control) functions of the body. Such conditions either are, or cause, bleeding diatheses. <b>Hemostasis</b> involves several components. The main components of the hemostatic system include platelets and the coagulation system.|$|E
25|$|FRANCO, R. F., REITSMA, P. H., LOURENCO, D., MAFFEI, F. H., MORELLI, V., TAVELLA, M. H., ARAUJO, A. G., PICCINATO, C. E. and ZAGO, M. A. 1999. Factor XIII Val34Leu is {{a genetic}} factor {{involved}} in the aetiology of venous thrombosis. Thrombosis and <b>Hemostasis.</b> vol. 81, p. 676-679.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before the}} {{inflammatory}} phase is initiated, the clotting cascade occurs {{in order to}} achieve <b>hemostasis,</b> or stop blood loss by way of a fibrin clot. Thereafter, various soluble factors (including chemokines and cytokines) are released to attract cells that phagocytise debris, bacteria, and damaged tissue, in addition to releasing signaling molecules that initiate the proliferative phase of wound healing.|$|E
25|$|Von Willebrand disease (which behaves {{more like}} a {{platelet}} disorder except in severe cases), {{is the most common}} hereditary bleeding disorder and is characterized as being inherited autosomal recessive or dominant. In this disease, there is a defect in von Willebrand factor (vWF), which mediates the binding of glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) to collagen. This binding helps mediate the activation of platelets and formation of primary <b>hemostasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hypovolemia is {{a massive}} {{decrease}} in blood volume, and death by excessive loss of blood {{is referred to as}} exsanguination. Typically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 10–15% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties (by comparison, blood donation typically takes 8–10% of the donor's blood volume). The stopping or controlling of bleeding is called <b>hemostasis</b> and {{is an important part of}} both first aid and surgery.|$|E
25|$|In some contexts, {{the word}} {{thrombus}} is used interchangeably {{with the word}} clot, regardless of its composition (white, red, or mixed). In other contexts {{it is used to}} contrast a normal from an abnormal clot: thrombus arises from physiologic <b>hemostasis,</b> thrombosis arises from a pathologic and excessive quantity of clot. In a third context it is used to contrast the result from the process: thrombus is the result, thrombosis is the process.|$|E
25|$|The Sugiura {{procedure}} was originally developed to treat bleeding esophageal varices and consisted mainly of an esophagogastric devascularization. It {{was developed in}} Japan in 1973 as a nonshunting technique that achieved variceal bleeding <b>hemostasis</b> by interrupting the variceal blood flow along the gastroesophageal junction. The procedure consists primarily of paraesophagogastric devascularization achieved by dividing the perforating veins of the esophagus and the stomach while maintaining the plexus of collaterals that connect the coronary gastric vein to the azygous system.|$|E
25|$|Labial {{reduction}} can {{be performed}} under local anaesthesia, conscious sedation, or general anaesthesia, either as a discrete, single surgery, or in conjunction with another, gynecologic or cosmetic, surgery procedure. The resection proper is facilitated with the administration of an anaesthetic solution (lidocaine + epinephrine in saline solution) that is infiltrated to the labia minora to achieve the tumescence (swelling) of the tissues and the constriction of the pertinent labial circulatory system, the <b>hemostasis</b> that limits bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Thromboelastometry (TEM), {{previously}} named rotational thromboelastography (ROTEG) or rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), is {{an established}} viscoelastic method for <b>hemostasis</b> testing in whole blood. It is {{a modification of}} traditional thromboelastography (TEG). TEM investigates the interaction of coagulation factors, their inhibitors, anticoagulant drugs, blood cells, specifically platelets, during clotting and subsequent fibrinolysis. The rheological conditions mimic the sluggish flow of blood in veins. TEM is performed with the ROTEM whole blood analyzer (Tem Innovations GmbH, Munich) and is an enhancement of thrombelastography, originally described by H. Hartert in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Sutures may {{be passed}} through the rectus muscles before their {{disinsertion}} from the globe. Some surgeons also suture one or both oblique muscles. Traction sutures or clamps may {{be applied to the}} horizontal rectus muscle insertions to assist in rotating and elevating the globe during the ensuing dissection. Tenon’s capsule may be opened posteriorly to allow visualization of the optic nerve. The vortex veins and posterior ciliary vessels may be cauterized before dividing the nerve and removing the eye. Alternatively, the optic nerve may be localized with a clamp before transection. <b>Hemostasis</b> is achieved with either cautery or digital pressure.|$|E
25|$|Some drugs used {{to treat}} {{inflammation}} have the unwanted side effect of suppressing normal platelet function. These are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Aspirin irreversibly disrupts platelet function by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1), and hence normal <b>hemostasis.</b> The resulting platelets are unable to produce new cyclooxygenase {{because they have no}} DNA. Normal platelet function will not return until the use of aspirin has ceased and enough of the affected platelets have been replaced by new ones, which can take over a week. Ibuprofen, another NSAID, does not have such a long duration effect, with platelet function usually returning within 24 hours, and taking ibuprofen before aspirin prevents the irreversible effects of aspirin.|$|E
25|$|Under homeostatic conditions, {{the body}} is {{maintained}} in a finely tuned balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The activation of the coagulation cascade yields thrombin that converts fibrinogen to fibrin; the stable fibrin clot being the final product of <b>hemostasis.</b> The fibrinolytic system then functions to break down fibrinogen and fibrin. Activation of the fibrinolytic system generates plasmin (in the presence of thrombin), {{which is responsible for}} the lysis of fibrin clots. The breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin results in polypeptides called fibrin degradation products (FDPs) or fibrin split products (FSPs). In a state of homeostasis, the presence of plasmin is critical, as it is the central proteolytic enzyme of coagulation and is also necessary for the breakdown of clots, or fibrinolysis.|$|E
25|$|The work on {{interpretation}} {{and analysis of}} genome data {{is still in its}} initial stages. It is anticipated that detailed knowledge of the human genome will provide new avenues for advances in medicine and biotechnology. Clear practical results of the project emerged even before the work was finished. For example, a number of companies, such as Myriad Genetics, started offering easy ways to administer genetic tests that can show predisposition to a variety of illnesses, including breast cancer, <b>hemostasis</b> disorders, cystic fibrosis, liver diseases and many others. Also, the etiologies for cancers, Alzheimer's disease and other areas of clinical interest are considered likely to benefit from genome information and possibly may lead in the long term to significant advances in their management.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin {{secreted}} {{from the}} enterochromaffin cells eventually {{finds its way}} out of tissues into the blood. There, it is actively taken up by blood platelets, which store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, where it can serve as a vasoconstrictor and/or a vasodilator while regulating <b>hemostasis</b> and blood clotting. In high concentrations, serotonin acts as a vasoconstrictor by contracting endothelial smooth muscle directly or by potentiating the effects of other vasoconstrictors (e.g. angiotensin II, norepinephrine). The vasoconstrictive property is mostly seen in pathologic states affecting the endothelium such as atherosclerosis or chronic hypertension. In physiologic states, vasodilation occurs through the serotonin mediated release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells. Additionally, it inhibits the release of norepinephrine from adrenergic nerves. Serotonin is also a growth factor for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. There are various serotonin receptors.|$|E
25|$|The ABO antigen is also {{expressed}} on the von Willebrand factor (vWF) glycoprotein, which participates in <b>hemostasis</b> (control of bleeding). In fact, having type O blood predisposes to bleeding, as 30% {{of the total}} genetic variation observed in plasma vWF is explained by {{the effect of the}} ABO blood group, and individuals with group O blood normally have significantly lower plasma levels of vWF (and Factor VIII) than do non-O individuals. In addition, vWF is degraded more rapidly due to the higher prevalence of blood group O with the Cys1584 variant of vWF (an amino acid polymorphism in VWF): the gene for ADAMTS13 (vWF-cleaving protease) maps to the ninth chromosome (9q34), the same locus as ABO blood type. Higher levels of vWF are more common amongst people who have had ischemic stroke (from blood clotting) for the first time. The results of this study found that the occurrence was not affected by ADAMTS13 polymorphism, and the only significant genetic factor was the person's blood group.|$|E
25|$|For the {{mosquito}} {{to obtain a}} blood meal, it must circumvent the vertebrate's physiological responses. The mosquito, as with all blood-feeding arthropods, has mechanisms to effectively block the <b>hemostasis</b> system with their saliva, which contains a mixture of secreted proteins. Mosquito saliva negatively affects vascular constriction, blood clotting, platelet aggregation, angiogenesis and immunity, and creates inflammation. Universally, hematophagous arthropod saliva contains at least one anti-clotting, one anti-platelet, and one vasodilatory substance. Mosquito saliva also contains enzymes that aid in sugar feeding and antimicrobial agents to control bacterial growth in the sugar meal. The composition of mosquito saliva is relatively simple, as it usually contains fewer than 20 dominant proteins. Despite the great strides in knowledge of these molecules and their role in blood feeding achieved recently, scientists still cannot ascribe functions to {{more than half of}} the molecules found in arthropod saliva. One promising application is the development of anti-clotting drugs, such as clotting inhibitors and capillary dilators, that could be useful for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
2500|$|Kocher {{published}} {{works on}} a number of subjects other than the thyroid gland, including <b>hemostasis,</b> antiseptic treatments, surgical infectious diseases, on gunshot wounds, acute osteomyelitis, the theory of strangulated hernia, and abdominal surgery. The prize money, from the Nobel prize he received, helped him to establish the Kocher Institute in Bern.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{function}} of platelets is {{to contribute to}} hemostasis: the process of stopping bleeding {{at the site of}} interrupted endothelium. They gather at the site and unless the interruption is physically too large, they plug the hole. First, platelets attach to substances outside the interrupted endothelium: adhesion. Second, they change shape, turn on receptors and secrete chemical messengers: activation. Third, they connect to each other through receptor bridges: aggregation. Formation of this platelet plug (primary <b>hemostasis)</b> is associated with activation of the coagulation cascade with resultant fibrin deposition and linking (secondary <b>hemostasis).</b> These processes may overlap: the spectrum is from a predominantly platelet plug, or [...] "white clot" [...] to a predominantly fibrin clot, or [...] "red clot" [...] or the more typical mixture. The final result is the clot. Some would add the subsequent clot retraction and platelet inhibition as fourth and fifth steps to the completion of the process and still others a sixth step wound repair.|$|E
2500|$|Herophilus of Chalcedon and Erasistratus of Ceos {{were two}} great Alexandrians who laid the {{foundations}} for {{the scientific study of}} anatomy and physiology. Alexandrian surgeons were responsible for developments in ligature (<b>hemostasis),</b> lithotomy, hernia operations, ophthalmic surgery, plastic surgery, methods of reduction of dislocations and fractures, tracheotomy, and mandrake as anesthesia. Most of what we know of them comes from Celsus and Galen of Pergamum (Greek: Γαληνός) ...|$|E
2500|$|Von Willebrand factor (vWF) (...) is a blood {{glycoprotein}} {{involved in}} <b>hemostasis.</b> It is deficient or defective in von Willebrand disease and {{is involved in}} a large number of other diseases, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, Heyde's syndrome, and possibly hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Increased plasma levels in a large number of cardiovascular, neoplastic, and connective tissue diseases are presumed to arise from adverse changes to the endothelium, and may contribute to an increased risk of thrombosis.|$|E
2500|$|Coagulation (also {{known as}} clotting) {{is the process}} by which blood changes from a liquid to a gel, forming a blood clot. It {{potentially}} results in <b>hemostasis,</b> the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel, followed by repair. [...] The mechanism of coagulation involves activation, adhesion, and aggregation of platelets along with deposition and maturation of fibrin. Disorders of coagulation are disease states which can result in bleeding (hemorrhage or bruising) or obstructive clotting (thrombosis).|$|E
2500|$|Wound {{healing is}} classically divided into <b>hemostasis,</b> inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Although a useful construct, this model employs {{considerable}} overlapping among individual phases. A complementary model {{has recently been}} described where the many elements of wound healing are more clearly delineated. The importance of this new model becomes more apparent through its utility {{in the fields of}} regenerative medicine and tissue engineering (see Research and development section below). In this construct, the process of wound healing is divided into two major phases: the early phase and the cellular phase: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hemostasis</b> (blood clotting): Within {{the first}} few minutes of injury, {{platelets}} in the blood begin to stick to the injured site. This activates the platelets, causing a few things to happen. They change into an amorphous shape, more suitable for clotting, and they release chemical signals to promote clotting. This results in the activation of fibrin, which forms a mesh and acts as [...] "glue" [...] to bind platelets to each other. This makes a clot that serves to plug the break in the blood vessel, slowing/preventing further bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|Here {{wound healing}} is {{depicted}} and {{described in a}} discrete timeline of physical attributes (phases) comprising the post trauma repair process. In undamaged skin, the epidermis (surface layer) and dermis (deeper layer) form a protective barrier against the external environment. When the barrier is broken, a regulated sequence of biochemical events is set into motion to repair the damage. This process is divided into predictable phases: blood clotting (<b>hemostasis),</b> inflammation, tissue growth (proliferation), and tissue remodeling (maturation). Blood clotting may {{be considered to be}} part of the inflammation stage instead of a separate stage.|$|E
2500|$|Activated {{platelets}} {{will release}} {{the contents of}} stored granules into the blood plasma. The granules include ADP, serotonin, platelet-activating factor (PAF), vWF, platelet factor 4, and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which, in turn, activate additional platelets. The granules' contents activate a Gq-linked protein receptor cascade, resulting in increased calcium concentration in the platelets' cytosol. The calcium activates protein kinase C, which, in turn, activates phospholipase A2 (PLA2). PLA2 then modifies the integrin membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, increasing its affinity to bind fibrinogen. The activated platelets change shape from spherical to stellate, and the fibrinogen cross-links with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa aid in aggregation of adjacent platelets [...] (completing primary <b>hemostasis).</b>|$|E
