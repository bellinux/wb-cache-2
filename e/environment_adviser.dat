5000|$|In October 2007, six Greenpeace {{protesters were}} arrested for {{breaking}} into the Kingsnorth power station, climbing the 200 metre smokestack, painting the name Gordon on the chimney, and causing an estimated £30,000 damage. At their subsequent trial they admitted trying to shut the station down, but argued that they were legally justified because {{they were trying to}} prevent climate change from causing greater damage to property elsewhere around the world. Evidence was heard from David Cameron's <b>environment</b> <b>adviser</b> Zac Goldsmith, climate scientist James E. Hansen and an Inuit leader from Greenland, all saying that climate change was already seriously affecting life around the world. The six activists were acquitted. It was the first case where preventing property damage caused by climate change has been used as part of a [...] "lawful excuse" [...] defense in court. Both The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian described the acquittal as embarrassment to the Brown Ministry. In December 2008 The New York Times listed the acquittal in its annual list of the most influential ideas of the year.|$|E

40|$|In {{the absence}} of legal {{enforcement}} procedures for the participants of open electronic marketplaces, trust and reputation systems are central for resisting against threats from malicious agents. Such systems provide mechanisms for identifying the participants who disseminate unfair ratings. Reputation systems [4] are a particularly effective approach for buyers to evaluate sellers. In such systems, if a certain buyer does not have adequate personal experience with some candidate sellers, it will disseminate queries to other buyers (also called advisers) to inquire information about the sellers. Based on the reporting of seller {{information provided by the}} advisers, the buyer can then model the reputation of the sellers. However, in open <b>environments,</b> <b>advisers</b> may untruthfully report information about seller reputation because of their internal dispositions being deceitful or malicious. Also, it is possible that some of the honest participants are victimized {{as a consequence of the}} poor judgement of these systems. This paper consists of two main parts: In the first section, we propose a Prob-Cog model [2, 3], the two-layer filtering algorithm, that probabilistically and cognitivel...|$|R
