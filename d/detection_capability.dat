5|$|The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) ordered 14 {{aircraft}} in 2003 {{to use in}} both the airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) and transport roles. The AW101 was modified by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and the Japan Defense Agency designated the model MCH-101. Special features include the automated folding of the rotor and tail. For the mine-hunting role, the MCH-101 has been outfitted with Northrop Grumman's AQS-24A airborne mine-hunting system and AN/AES-1 Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) for a complete surface-to-bottom mine <b>detection</b> <b>capability,</b> as well as Mk-104 acoustic mine sweeping gear.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} largely at {{the urging}} of the Admiralty, who saw it as a solution to detecting the conning towers of partially submerged U-Boats. After a visit by Tizard to GEC's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939, and a follow-up visit by Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead of broadcasting the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a flashlight, pointed in the direction of observation. This would greatly increase the amount of energy falling on a target, and improve <b>detection</b> <b>capability.</b>|$|E

Subsequent inventions such as the High Frequency Radio Detection Finder (Huff-Duff) were later added, along with various radar systems (such as the Type 271), which proved particularly effective in low-visibility conditions in the North Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|Although {{photoelectric}} alarms {{are highly}} effective at detecting smoldering fires and do provide adequate protection from flaming fires, fire safety experts and the National Fire Protection Agency recommend installing {{what are called}} combination alarms, which are alarms that either detect both heat and smoke, or use both the ionization and photoelectric processes.

25|$|The vast {{northern}} {{borders of}} the Soviet Union were wide open in many places during the early Cold War years with little defensive radar coverage, with limited <b>detection</b> <b>capability.</b> RB-50 aircraft of the 55th SRW flew many sorties along the periphery, and where necessary into the interior. Initially, there was little opposition from the Soviet forces as radar coverage was limited and, if the overflying aircraft were detected, the World War II era Soviet fighters could not intercept the RB-50s at their high altitude.|$|E
25|$|A {{photomultiplier}} is a phototube whose sensitivity {{is greatly}} increased {{through the use}} of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of secondary emission, whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a dynode causing more electrons to be released from that dynode. Those electrons are accelerated toward another dynode at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon <b>detection</b> <b>capability</b> of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation {{as an alternative to the}} Geiger–Müller tube (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.|$|E

2500|$|The system {{features}} two tethered aerostats, roughly [...] in length, that {{float to}} {{an altitude of}} [...] for up to 30 days at a time. [...] Each aerostat utilizes a different radar system—one has a VHF-band surveillance radar and the other an X-band fire-control radar. [...] JLENS {{is designed to provide}} 24/7, 360-degree coverage extending [...] [...] The surveillance radar scans in all directions to pick up targets, then the targeting radar looks only in a certain segment to guide weapons to it. [...] Its <b>detection</b> <b>capability</b> seeks to equal 4–5 fixed-wing aircraft, and is designed to operate at 15–20 {{percent of the cost of}} fixed-wing aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a daytime}} fighter aircraft, the {{performance}} of the Potez 631 C3 was relatively disappointing, partially due to a low maximum speed and inadequate rate of climb compared with contemporary fighter aircraft. When applied to the nightfighter role, their lack of <b>detection</b> <b>capability</b> against enemy aircraft rendered their presence mainly ineffective. Later models had a heavy armament (12 machine guns for the Potez 63.11). Unfortunately the Potez 63 family, like many French aircraft of the time, simply did not have sufficiently powerful engines to endow them with an adequate performance and they proved vulnerable to Messerschmitt Bf 109s, like the contemporary Fairey Battle and Bristol Blenheim bombers. Their similarity to the Messerschmitt Bf 110, both being equipped with twin engines, twin fins and a long greenhouse canopy, is believed to have resulted in several aircraft being lost to [...] "friendly fire".|$|E
2500|$|The electro-physical basis whereby an EDD {{actually}} works is complex. [...] The original theory {{suggested that the}} paper sandwiched between the grounded platen and the mylar charging film acted {{as a type of}} capacitor with the change in capacitance being due to differing compression of the paper. [...] This led to models like the 'Thickness Variation Theory' and the 'Surface Variation Theory'. [...] However, it turns out that a detectable 'indentation' is not due to the physical pressure applied to the writing instrument as one might expect. Rather, Seward in 1998 and 1999 proposed an alternative theory explaining the <b>detection</b> <b>capability</b> of an EDD as being due to a surface charge effect created by paper-to-paper friction specifically in the area where a writing instrument is pressed down into the top-most sheet of paper. [...] Seward's model was based upon [...] "charge transport through the Mylar-paper-platen structure" [...] and is appropriately called the 'charge transport model'.|$|E

2500|$|A Hong Kong–based media {{report has}} claimed that THAAD could be {{deployed}} in Taiwan to intercept People's Republic of China missiles. However, Taiwan's Foreign Minister, David Lee, {{has said he}} is unaware of any talks with the US about possible deployment. Local military experts have {{said that it was}} neither necessary, nor affordable for Taiwan to deploy THAAD because China is threatening Taiwan with short-range missiles, whereas THAAD is designed to shoot down medium and long-range missiles. The Minister of National Defense, Feng Shih-kuan, said in March 2017 that he was firmly opposed the deployment of a THAAD system in Taiwan although comments made by Feng's deputy minister Cheng De-mei during a Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee Q session that was held in April 2017 in which he said that Taiwan did not need a THAAD system in the short term because its US-made phased-array radar system at Hsinchu County’s Leshan base was on par with the THAAD system in terms of <b>detection</b> <b>capability</b> was described as [...] "in slight contrast with Minister of National Defense Feng Shih-kuan’s last month."

2500|$|The Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT), the {{outermost}} {{component of the}} inner detector, {{is a combination of}} a straw tracker and a transition radiation detector. The detecting elements are drift tubes (straws), each four millimetres in diameter and up to 144 centimetres long. [...] The uncertainty of track position measurements (position resolution) is about 200micrometres. This is not as precise as those for the other two detectors, but it was necessary to reduce the cost of covering a larger volume and to have transition radiation <b>detection</b> <b>capability.</b> [...] Each straw is filled with gas that becomes ionized when a charged particle passes through. [...] The straws are held at about −1,500V, driving the negative ions to a fine wire down the centre of each straw, producing a current pulse (signal) in the wire. [...] The wires with signals create a pattern of 'hit' straws that allow the path of the particle to be determined. [...] Between the straws, materials with widely varying indices of refraction cause ultra-relativistic charged particles to produce transition radiation and leave much stronger signals in some straws. [...] Xenon and argon gas is used {{to increase the number of}} straws with strong signals. [...] Since the amount of transition radiation is greatest for highly relativistic particles (those with a speed very near the speed of light), and because particles of a particular energy have a higher speed the lighter they are, particle paths with many very strong signals can be identified as belonging to the lightest charged particles: electrons and their antiparticles, positrons. The TRT has about 298,000 straws in total.|$|E
