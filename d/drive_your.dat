500|$|The team's goal then was, in {{the words}} of Todd Howard, to [...] "create the quintessential RPG of the next generation", with a focus on a [...] "combination of {{freeform}} gameplay and cutting-edge graphics." [...] Producing for next generation machines, rather than a cheap upgrade, gave Bethesda an additional four years of development. Howard describes this as an aspect of Bethesda's greater goal of [...] "Reinvention", where the team's goal is to make [...] "a new game that stands on its own, that has its own identity". Howard spoke of the need to avoid repetition, to avoid merely adding [...] "some new features and content, and keep doing that", describing that path as [...] "a good way to <b>drive</b> <b>your</b> games into the ground." [...] Bethesda, Howard stated, would focus instead on recapturing what made its past titles exciting [...] "in the first place".|$|E

2500|$|Boone {{cultivated}} a safe, wholesome, advertiser-friendly {{image that}} won him a long-term product endorsement contract from General Motors {{during the late}} 1950s, lasting through the 1960s. He succeeded Dinah Shore singing the praises of the GM product: [...] "See the USA in your Chevrolet... <b>drive</b> <b>your</b> Chevrolet through the USA, America's the greatest land of all!" [...] GM had also sponsored The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom. In the 1989 documentary Roger & Me, Boone stated that he first was given a Chevrolet Corvette from the GM product line, but after his wife and he started having children, at one child a year, GM supplied him with a station wagon, as well.|$|E
2500|$|Despite heavy {{lobbying}} {{in favor}} {{of one of the}} existing projects, it soon became apparent that private industry could not turn out a car for only 990 RM. [...] Thus, Hitler chose to sponsor an all-new, state-owned factory using Ferdinand Porsche's design (with some of Hitler's design constraints, including an air-cooled engine so nothing could freeze). The intention was that ordinary Germans would buy the car by means of a savings scheme (""â€“ [...] "Five marks a week you must put aside, if you want to <b>drive</b> <b>your</b> own car"), which around 336,000 people eventually paid into. However, the entire project was financially unsound, and only the Nazi party made it possible to provide funding.|$|E
