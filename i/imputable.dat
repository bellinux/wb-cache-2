5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, <b>imputable</b> more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E

L'analyse porte sur les {{variations}} <b>imputables</b> aux conditions naturelles et sur une évaluation des performances du modèle une fois appliqué au ruisseau Catamaran au Nouveau-Brunswick (Canada). Ce modèle stochastique est développé selon l'approche de Box et Jenkins (1976) basée sur les séries temporelles des températures de l'eau et de l'air. Le modèle a été calibré avec des données de 1990. L'évaluation de performance comprend une analyse des séries résiduelles et le calcul des erreurs quadratiques moyennes. Les résultats montrent que l'erreur quadratique mensuelle varie de 0, 42 °C en juillet 1990 (année de calibration) jusqu'à 2, 96 °C en septembre 1992. Finalement, une discussion est menée pour souligner les avantages et les inconvénients relatifs à cette approche. Water {{temperature is}} a very important parameter not only in water quality studies but also in biological studies. For instance, salmonids can be adversely affected by natural high stream water temperatures or by those resulting from anthropogenic sources such as deforestation. To predict stream water temperatures, two different approaches have been used; the deterministic and stochastic approaches. The deterministic approach consists of a physical model based on the energy budget (solar radiation, convection, etc.) and the physical characteristics of the stream (water depth, stream cover, etc.). The stochastic modelling approach consists of studying the structure (autocorrelation) of the stream water temperature time series and its dependence on air temperatures (cross-correlation). The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop and test the performanoe of a stream water temperature model using a stochastic approach to predict water temperatures in rivers under natural conditions. The performance of such an approach was tested using data from Catamaran Brook, a small stream in New Brunswick (Canada). It differs from previous studies in that most others were on larger river systems. This stochastic model incorporates the Box and Jenkins method (1976) which relates the time series data to both water and air temperature residuals. To calculate the residuals of both air and water temperatures, a seasonal component was first estimated using Fourier series analysis. This seasonal component better represents the long-term trend in air and water temperatures for the studied period or season (i. e. increasing water temperatures at first, then reaching a maximum during the early part of August and decreasing again later in the season). The Fourier series with one harmonic was chosen for the analysis as it has been shown in previous studies that the first harmonic represents most of the variation within the stream water temperature variable. The model was calibrated using the Box and Jenkins method and Catamaran Brook data from 1990. This analysis consist of determining a transfer function relating present water temperature residuals to past water and air temperature residuals including present air temperature residuals and a random component. The random component (also called « noise series ») of the model is a normally distributed variable with a standard deviation calculated using the calibration period. After the calibration period, subsequent years or post-calibration years were analyzed to predicted stream water temperatures with the model using air temperature data only. A study of residuals between predicted and measured stream water temperatures showed very good results during the calibration year (1990) with a calculated root-mean square error of 0. 75 °C. The predicted temperatures during post calibration years (i. e. 1991 and 1992) were good and the root-mean-square errors were similar to previous studies (e. g. Marceau et al. 1986) with values of 1. 45 °C and 2. 10 °C respectively. The measured stream water temperatures during the post-calibration years were only used to estimate the relative performance of the model as opposed to a forecasting model which utilizes actual measured temperatures. At Catamaran Brook is has been observed that natural variation in air temperatures can have an influence on the performanoe of the model. When air temperatures were recorded higher or lower than the long term values (normal temperatures) calculated by the Fourier series analysis, the predicted water temperatures was not as good. For instance it was observed that during September of 1992, during which time the air temperature was higher that normal, the performance of the model was not as good with a root me an squared error of 2. 96 °C. However, during July 1992, below normal air temperatures were also recorded and a very good prediction of stream water temperatures in Catamaran Brook was achieved with a root me an square error of 0. 98 °C. In general, satisfactory prediction of stream water temperatures was achieved using the Box and Jenkins stochastic modelling approach...|$|R

Von der Segmentationstheorie wird im Allgemeinen der Gegensatz zwischen den internen Märkten und den externen Märkten im Gedächtnis behalten, der offers als der Gegensatz zwischen Stabilität und Un stetigkeit betrachtet wird. Jedoch scheint dieser Gegensatz tatsâchlich mehr auf dem Grad der internen Mobilitat der Arbeitskräfte als auf der Stärke der externen Fluktuation zu beruhen. Der Mangel an statistischen Daten zur Messung der internen Mobilitat der Arbeitskräfte fuhrt dazu, eine neue Methode anzubieten, die auf dem Vergleich zwischen der externen Fluktuation der Arbeitskräfte und der Entwicklung der Beschäftigtenstruktur basiert. Durch diese Methode kann der Beitrag der internen Aufstiegsmobilität an dieser Entwicklung ermessen werden, indem die Veränderungen der Beschäftigtenstrukturen, die den externen Zugängen und Abgangen in ieder Beschäftigtengruppe nicht anzu- rechnen sind, betrachtet werden. Offensichtlich werden die strukturellen Ànderungen aller Wirtschaftszweige im Industriebereich zwischen 1984 und 1986 zum grôssten Teil durch die interne Mobilitat erklart. Ausserdem ergibt sich daraus genauso deutlich, dass die jeweiligen Einflusse der internen Mobilitat und der externen Fluktuation der Arbeitskräfte am häufigsten gegensätzlich sind. Darù- ber hinaus kann festgestellt werden, dass die Wirtschaftszweige, die die stärksten strukturellen Verânderungen kennen, nicht diejenigen sind, die die höchsten Schwankungen der Beschäftigtenzahl und/ oder Fluktuationsquoten der Arbeitskrâfte haben. Die dabei herausgestellten Charakterisierungen der Wirtschaftszweige können affiniert werden, indem zusätzliche Kriterien eingefuhrt werden : die Differen- zierungen nach Berufskategorien und die spezifischen Ablaurformen des externen Marktes, wenn unter anderem das Alter der Zu- und Abgänger und der Grund ihrer Fluktuation in Betracht kommen. Gérard Podevin, The {{contribution}} of internal mobility to {{the transformation of}} industrial job structures. In the theory of segmentation, the opposition between internal and external markets is generally considered important, and it is usually defined as an opposition between stability and instability. However, rather than the intensity of external turnover of the workforce, {{it appears that the}} degree of internal mobility gives effective ground to this opposition. The absence of statistical data directly concerning this phenomenon of internal mobility makes it necessary to propose a methodology of flow/original stock, based on the sector by sector comparison of external movements of the workforce and the development of job structures. This methodology enables an indirect appreciation to be made, according to socio-professional categories, of the {{contribution of}} the internal promotion market to this development, via the changes in job structure that cannot be attributed to external exit and entry movements in each job category. It is evident that between 1984 and 1986, in industry, internal mobility can mainly explain the structural changes taking place in all sectors. It also appears just as clearly that the respective influences of internal and external mobility are exerted in opposite directions. Also, the sectors experiencing the greatest structural changes {{do not appear to be}} those where variations in numbers and /or staff turnover are the highest. The sectorial characteristics emerging in these cases can be refined, taking into account, on the one hand, differences introduced by the various different socio- professional categories, and, on the other, the specificity of certain methods of operation of the external market, involving in particular the age of those entering or leaving establishments and the detailed reasons for their movements. De la théorie de la segmentation, on retient généralement l'opposition marché interne/ marché externe, définie le plus souvent par l'opposition stabilité/instabilité. Cependant, plus que l'intensité de la rotation externe de la main-d'œuvre, il semble que le degré de mobilité interne fonde de manière effective cette opposition. L'absence de données statistiques se rapportant directement à ce phénomène de mobilité interne conduit alors à proposer une méthodologie flux/stock originale, basée sur le rapprochement par secteur des mouvements externes de main-d'œuvre et de l'évolution des structures d'emplois. Cette méthodologie permet d'apprécier indirectement, par catégorie socioprofessionnelle, la contribution du marché interne promotionnel à cette évolution à travers les déformations des structures d'emplois qui ne sont pas <b>imputables</b> aux mouvements externes d'entrée et de sortie de chaque catégorie d'emploi. II est manifeste qu'entre 1984 et 1986, dans l'industrie, la mobilité interne explique majoritairement les transformations structurelles de tous les secteurs. De plus, il ressort, tout aussi clairement, que les influences respectives de la mobilité interne et de la mobilité externe sont le plus souvent de sens contraire. II apparaît, par ailleurs, que les secteurs qui connaissent les transformations structurelles les plus fortes ne sont pas ceux où les variations d'effectifs et/ou les taux de rotation de la main-d'œuvre sont les plus élevés. Les caractérisations sectorielles qui se dégagent alors peuvent être affinées en tenant compte, d'une part, des différenciations qu'introduisent les diverses catégories socioprofessionnelles et, d'autre part, de la spécificité de certaines modalités du fonctionnement au marché externe faisant intervenir notamment l'âge des individus entrant ou sortant des établissements et le motif détaillé de leurs mouvements.

Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.

The question would thus have been, for him, with a still sharper eventual ache, of whether he positively had, as an effect of the miracle, been petrified, before fifty pair of eyes, to the posture of a prepossessing shepherd--and would perhaps have left him under the shadow of some such <b>imputable</b> fatuity if his consciousness hadn't, at a given moment, cleared up to still stranger things.|$|E
60|$|I had {{not been}} seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable {{robustness}} entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom {{he was a very}} great favorite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom-- the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February's snow. No one having previously heard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, <b>imputable</b> to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.|$|E
60|$|But {{who were}} Nicolai and Engel, {{and what did}} they against the famous enchanter? The former was born in 1733, at Berlin, where he carried on his father's {{business}} of book-selling, pursued literature with marked success, and attained to old age, full of literary honours. By means of three critical journals (the Literatur-Briefe, the Bibliothek der Schönen Wissenschaftern, and the Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek,) which he conducted with the powerful cooperation of Lessing, and of his intimate friend Mendelssohn, and to which he contributed largely himself, he became very considerable in the German world of letters, and so continued for the space of twenty years. Jördens, in his Lexicon, speaks highly of the effect of Nicolai's writings in promoting freedom of thought, enlightened views in theology and philosophy, and a sound taste in fine literature--describes him as a brave battler with intolerance, hypocrisy, and confused conceptions in religion; with empty subtleties, obscurities, and terminologies, that can but issue in vain fantasies, in his controversial writings on the 'so-named critical philosophy.' He engaged with the Kritik der reinen Vernunft, on its appearance in 1781, in the Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek; first explained his objections to it in the 11th vol. of his Reisebeschreibung, (Description of a Journey through Germany and Switzerland in the year 1781,) and afterwards, in his romance entitled The Life and Opinions of Sempronius Gundibert, a German Philosopher, sought to set forth the childish crotchets and abuses <b>imputable</b> to many disciples of this philosophy in their native absurdity. The ratsbone alluded to by Klopstock, was doubtless contained in the above-named romance, which the old poet probably esteemed more than Nicolai's more serious polemics.|$|E

These kinds of advocates do infinite mischief to OUR GOOD CAUSE, by giving grounds to the unjust reproaches of TORIES and JACOBITES, who charge us with being enemies to the Church. If I bear an hearty unfeigned loyalty to his Majesty King George, and the House of Hanover, not shaken in the least by the hardships we lie under, which never can be <b>imputable</b> to so gracious a prince: If I sincerely abjure the Pretender, and all Popish successors; if I bear a due veneration to the glorious memory of the late King William, who preserved these kingdoms from Popery and slavery, with the expense of his blood, and hazard of his life: And lastly, if I am for a proper indulgence to all dissenters; I think nothing more can be reasonably demanded {{of me as a}} WHIG, and that my political catechism is full and complete. But whoever, under the shelter of that party denomination, and of many great professions of loyalty, would destroy, or undermine, or injure the Church established; I utterly disown him, and think he ought to choose another name of distinction for himself, and his adherents. I came into the cause upon other principles, which, by the grace of God, I mean to preserve as long as I live. Shall we justify the accusations of our adversaries? Hoc Ithacus velit--The Tories and Jacobites will behold us with a malicious pleasure, determined upon the ruin of our friends: For is not the present set of bishops almost entirely of that number, as well as a great majority of the principal clergy?

6000|$|... "The Sermons of Swift," [...] says Scott, [...] "have {{none of that}} thunder which appals, or that resistless {{and winning}} {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, <b>imputable</b> more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vices of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E

Between them and that time, however, what mightn't, for him, poor devil, on his new basis, have happened? She wasn't at any rate within any calculable period going to care so much for anything as for the so quaintly droll terms in which her rearrangement with her husband--thanks to that gentleman's inimitable fatuity--would have to be made. This was what it was to own, exactly, her special grace--the brightest gaiety in the finest sensibility; such a display of which combination, Mark felt as he went (if he could but have done it still more justice) she must have regaled him with! That exquisite last flush of her fadedness could only remain with him; yet while he presently stopped at a street-corner in a district redeemed from desolation but by the passage just then of a choked trolley-car that howled, as he paused for it, beneath the weight of its human accretions, he seemed to know the inward [...] "sinking" [...] that had been determined in a hungry man by some extravagant sight of the preparation of somebody else's dinner. Florence Ash was dining, so to speak, off the feast of appreciation, appreciation of what she had to [...] "tell" [...] him, that he had left her seated at; and she was welcome, assuredly--welcome, welcome, welcome, he musingly, he wistfully, and {{yet at the same time}} a trifle mechanically, repeated, stayed as he was a moment longer by the suffering shriek of another public vehicle and a sudden odd automatic return of his mind to the pretty girl, the flower of Mrs. Folliott's crowd, who had spoken to him of Newton Winch. It was extraordinarily as if, on the instant, she reminded him, from across the town, that she had offered him dinner: it was really quite strangely, while he stood there, as if she had told him where he could go and get it. With which, none the less, it was apparently where he wouldn't find her--and what was there, after all, of nutritive in the image of Newton Winch? He made up his mind in a moment that it owed that property, which the pretty girl had somehow made <b>imputable,</b> to the fact of its simply being just then the one image of anything known to him that the terrible place had to offer. Nothing, he a minute later reflected, could have been so [...] "rum" [...] as that, sick and sore, of a bleak New York eventide, he should have had nowhere to turn if not to the said Fiftieth Street.|$|E
6000|$|Owing probably, {{to these}} prejudices, and the {{influence}} of the peculators, he was treated, on his return to England, in a manner which had nearly driven him from the service. During the three years that the BOREAS had remained upon a station which is usually so fatal, not a single officer or man of her whole complement had died. This almost unexampled instance of good health, though mostly, no doubt, <b>imputable</b> to a healthy season, must in some measure, also, be ascribed to the wise conduct of the captain. He never suffered the ships to remain more than three or four weeks at a time at any of the islands; and when the hurricane months confined him to English Harbour, he encouraged all kinds of useful amusements--music, dancing, and cudgelling among the men; theatricals among the officers; anything which could employ their attention, and keep their spirits cheerful. The BOREAS arrived in England in June. Nelson, who had many times been supposed to be consumptive when in the West Indies, and perhaps was saved from consumption by that climate, was still in a precarious state of health; and the raw wet weather of one of our ungenial summers brought on cold, and sore throat, and fever; yet his vessel was kept at the Nore from the end of June till the end of November, serving as a slop and receiving ship. This unworthy treatment, which more probably proceeded from inattention than from neglect, excited in Nelson the strongest indignation. During the whole five months he seldom or never quitted the ship, but carried on the duty with strict and sullen attention. On the morning when orders were received to prepare the BOREAS for being paid off, he expressed his joy to the senior officer in the Medway, saying, [...] "It will release me for ever from an ungrateful service; for it is my firm and unalterable determination never again to set my foot on board a king's ship. Immediately after my arrival in town I shall wait on the First Lord of the Admiralty, and resign my commission." [...] The officer to whom he thus communicated his intentions behaved in the wisest and most friendly manner; for finding it in vain to dissuade him in his present state of feeling, he secretly interfered with the First Lord to save him from a step so injurious to himself, little foreseeing how deeply the welfare and honour of England were at that moment at stake. This interference produced a letter from Lord Howe the day before the ship was paid off, intimating a wish to see Captain Nelson as soon as he arrived in town; when, being pleased with his conversation, and perfectly convinced, by what was then explained to him, of the propriety of his conduct, he desired that he might present him to the king on the first levee-day; and the gracious manner in which Nelson was then received effectually removed his resentment.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was after}} this {{that the most}} {{extraordinary}} incident of all, of course, had occurred--his pointing to the two photographs with the remark that those were persons he knew, and that, more wonderful still, he had made acquaintance with them, years before, precisely over the same article. The lady, on that occasion, had taken up the fancy of presenting it to the gentleman, and the gentleman, guessing and dodging ever so cleverly, had declared that he wouldn't for the world receive an object under such suspicion. He himself, the little man had confessed, wouldn't have minded--about THEM; {{but he had never}} forgotten either their talk or their faces, the impression altogether made by them, and, if she really wished to know, now, what had perhaps most moved him, it was the thought that she should ignorantly have gone in for a thing not good enough for other buyers. He had been immensely struck--that was another point--with this accident of their turning out, after so long, friends of hers too: they had disappeared, and this was the only light he had ever had upon them. He had flushed up, quite red, with his recognition, with all his responsibility--had declared that the connexion must have had, mysteriously, {{something to do with the}} impulse he had obeyed. And Maggie had made, to her husband, while he again stood before her, no secret of the shock, for herself, so suddenly and violently received. She had done her best, even while taking it full in the face, not to give herself away; but she wouldn't answer--no, she wouldn't--for what she might, in her agitation, have made her informant think. He might think what he would--there had been three or four minutes during which, while she asked him question upon question, she had doubtless too little cared. And he had spoken, for his remembrance, as fully as she could have wished; he had spoken, oh, delightedly, for the [...] "terms" [...] on which his other visitors had appeared to be with each other, and in fact for that conviction of the nature and degree of their intimacy under which, in spite of precautions, they hadn't been able to help leaving him. He had observed and judged and not forgotten; he had been sure they were great people, but no, ah no, distinctly, hadn't [...] "liked" [...] them as he liked the Signora Principessa. Certainly--she had created no vagueness about that--he had been in possession of her name and address, for sending her both her cup and her account. But the others he had only, always, wondered about--he had been sure they would never come back. And as to the time of their visit, he could place it, positively, to a day--by reason of a transaction of importance, recorded in his books, that had occurred but a few hours later. He had left her, in short, definitely rejoicing that he had been able to make up to her for not having been quite [...] "square" [...] over their little business by rendering her, so unexpectedly, the service of this information. His joy, moreover, was--as much as Amerigo would!--a matter of the personal interest with which her kindness, gentleness, grace, her charming presence and easy humanity and familiarity, had inspired him. All of which, while, in thought, Maggie went over it again and again --oh, over any <b>imputable</b> rashness of her own immediate passion and pain, as well as over the rest of the straight little story she had, after all, to tell--might very conceivably make a long sum for the Prince to puzzle out.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} the Council met upon the adjournment. Then Mr. Hastings proposed, as a compromise, a {{division}} of the object in question. One half was to be surrendered to the authority of the Court of Directors, the other was reserved for his dignity. But the choice he made of his own share in this partition is very worthy of notice. He had taken his sole ground of objection against Mr. Bristow on the supposed ill effect that such an appointment would have on the minds of the Indian powers. He said, [...] "that these powers could have no dependence on his fulfilling his engagements, or maintaining the faith of treaties which he might offer for their acceptance, if they saw him treated with such contempt." [...] Mr. Bristow's appearing in a political character was the whole of his complaint; yet, when he comes to a voluntary distribution of the duties of the office, he gives Mr. Bristow those very political negotiations of which but the day before he had in such strong terms declared him personally incapable, whose appointment he considered to be fatal to those negotiations, and which he then spoke of as a measure in itself such as the bitterest adversary to Great Britain would have proposed. But having thus yielded his whole ground of ostensible objection, he reserved to his own appointment the entire management of the pecuniary trust. Accordingly he named Mr. Bristow for the former, and Mr. Middleton for the latter. On his own principles he ought to have done the very reverse. On every justifiable principle he ought to have done so; for a servant who for a long time resists the orders of his masters, and when he reluctantly gives way obeys them by halves, ought to be remarkably careful to make his actions correspond with his words, and to put himself out of all suspicion with regard to the purity of his motives. It was possible that the political reasons, which were solely assigned against Mr. Bristow's appointment, might have been the real motives of Mr. Hastings's opposition. But these he totally abandons, and holds fast to the pecuniary department. Now, as it is notorious that most of the abuses of India grow out of money-dealing, it was peculiarly unfit for a servant, delicate with regard to his reputation, to require a personal and confidential agent in a situation merely official, in which secrecy and personal connections could be of no possible use, and could only serve to excite distrust. Matters of account cannot be made too public; and it is not the most confidential agent, but the most responsible, who is the fittest for the management of pecuniary trusts. That man was the fittest at once to do the duty, and to remove all suspicions from the Governor-General's character, whom, by not being of his appointment, he could not be supposed to favor for private purposes, who must naturally stand in awe of his inspection, and whose misconduct could not possibly be <b>imputable</b> to him. Such an agency in a pecuniary trust was the very last on which Mr. Hastings ought to have risked his disobedience to the orders of the Direction,--or, what is even worse for his motives, a direct contradiction to all the principles upon which he had attempted to justify that bold measure.|$|E
6000|$|Nick forbore from {{delicacy}} to intimate to Biddy that {{he thought}} it a pity she couldn't care for Mr. Grindon; {{but he had a}} private sense that if she had been capable of such a feat it would have lightened a little the weight he himself had to carry. He bore her a slight grudge, which lasted till Julia Dallow came back; when the circumstance of the girl's being summoned immediately down to Harsh created a diversion that was perhaps after all only fanciful. Biddy, as we know, entertained a theory, which Nick had found occasion to combat, that Mrs. Dallow had not treated him perfectly well; therefore in going to Harsh the very first time that relative held out a hand to her so jealous a little sister must have recognised a special inducement. The inducement might have been that the relative had comfort for her, that she was acting by her cousin's direct advice, that they were still in close communion {{on the question of the}} offers Biddy was not to accept, that in short Peter's sister had taken upon herself to see that their young friend should remain free for the day of the fugitive's inevitable return. Once or twice indeed Nick wondered if Julia had herself been visited, in a larger sense, by the thought of retracing her steps--if she wished to draw out her young friend's opinion as to how she might do that gracefully. During the few days she was in town Nick had seen her twice in Great Stanhope Street, but neither time alone. She had said to him on one of these occasions in her odd, explosive way: [...] "I should have thought you'd have gone away somewhere--it must be such a bore." [...] Of course she firmly believed he was staying for Miriam, which he really was not; and probably she had written this false impression off to Peter, who, still more probably, would prefer to regard it as just. Nick was staying for Miriam only in the sense that he should very glad of the money he might receive for the portrait he was engaged in painting. That money would be a great convenience to him in spite of the obstructive ground Miriam had taken in pretending--she had blown half a gale about it--that he had had no right to dispose of such a production without her consent. His answer to this was simply that the purchaser was so little of a stranger that it didn't go, so to speak, out of the family, out of hers. It didn't matter, Miriam's retort that if Mr. Sherringham had formerly been no stranger he was utterly one now, so that nothing would ever less delight him than to see her hated image on his wall. He would back out of the bargain and Nick be left with the picture on his hands. Nick jeered at this shallow theory and when she came to sit the question served as well as another to sprinkle their familiar silences with chaff. He already knew something, as we have seen, of the conditions in which his distracted kinsman had left England; and this connected itself, in casual meditation, with some of the calculations <b>imputable</b> to Julia and to Biddy. There had naturally been a sequel to the queer behaviour perceptible in Peter, at the theatre, on the eve of his departure--a sequel lighted by a word of Miriam's in the course of her first sitting to Nick after her great night. [...] "Fancy"--so this observation ran--"fancy the dear man finding time in the press of all his last duties to ask me to marry him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I must in {{some degree}} have felt it a charm {{there that we}} were not, under his rule, inordinately {{prepared}} for [...] "business," [...] but were on the contrary {{to remember that the}} taste of Cornelius Nepos in the air, even rather stale though it may have been, had lacked the black bitterness marking our next ordeal and that I conceive to have proceeded from some rank predominance of the theory and practice of book-keeping. It had consorted with this that we found ourselves, by I know not what inconsequence, a pair of the [...] "assets" [...] of a firm; Messrs. Forest and Quackenboss, who carried on business at the northwest corner of Fourteenth Street and Sixth Avenue, having for the winter of 1854-5 taken our education in hand. As their establishment had the style, so I was conscious {{at the time of its}} having the general stamp and sense, of a shop--a shop of long standing, of numerous clients, of lively bustle and traffic. The structure itself was to my recent recognition still there and more than ever a shop, with improvements and extensions, but dealing in other wares than those anciently and as I suppose then quite freshly purveyed; so far at least as freshness was <b>imputable</b> to the senior member of the firm, who had come down to our generation from a legendary past and with a striking resemblance of head and general air to Benjamin Franklin. Mr. Forest, under whose more particular attention I languished, had lasted on from a plainer age and, having formed, by the legend, in their youth, the taste of two or three of our New York uncles--though for what it could have been goodness only knew--was still of a trempe to whack in the fine old way at their nephews and sons. I see him aloft, benevolent and hard, mildly massive, in a black dress coat and trousers and a white neckcloth that should have figured, if it didn't, a frill, and on the highest rostrum of our experience, whence he comes back to me as the dryest of all our founts of knowledge, though quite again as a link with far-off manners and forms and as the most [...] "historic" [...] figure we had ever had to do with. W. J., as I distinguish, had in truth scarcely to do with him--W. J. lost again on upper floors, in higher classes, in real pursuits, and connecting me, in an indirect and almost deprecated manner, with a strange, curly, glossy, an anointed and bearded, Mr. Quackenboss, the junior partner, who conducted the classical department and never whacked--only sent down his subjects, with every confidence, to his friend. I make out with clearness that Mr. Forest was awful and arid, and yet that somehow, by the same stroke, we didn't, under his sway, go in terror, only went exceedingly in want; even if in want indeed of I scarce (for myself) know what, since it might well have been enough for me, in so resounding an air, to escape with nothing worse than a failure of thrill. If I didn't feel that interest I must clearly not have inspired it, and I marvel afresh, under these memories, at the few points at which I appear to have touched constituted reality. That, however, is a different connection altogether, and I read back into the one I have been noting much of the chill, or at least the indifference, of a foreseen and foredoomed detachment: it was during that winter that I began to live by anticipation in another world and to feel our uneasy connection with New York loosen beyond recovery. I remember for how many months, when the rupture took place, we had been to my particular consciousness virtually in motion; though I regain at the same time the impression of more experience on the spot than had marked our small previous history: this, however, a branch of the matter that I must for the moment brush aside. For it would have been meanwhile odd enough to hold us in arrest a moment--that quality of our situation that could suffer such elements as those I have glanced at to take so considerably the place of education as more usually and conventionally understood, and by that understanding more earnestly mapped out; a deficiency, in the whole thing, that I fail at all consistently to deplore, however--struck as I am with the rare fashion after which, in any small victim of life, the inward perversity may work.|$|E
6000|$|December 9th. I had {{to break}} off the other day, my dear Edith, through simple {{extremity}} of woe; and the woe has continued unbroken ever since--I have been in bed and in too great suffering, too unrelieved and too continual, for me to attempt any decent form of expression. I have just got up, {{for one of the}} first times, even now, and I sit in command of this poor little situation, ostensibly, instead of simply being bossed by it, though I don't at all know what it will bring. To attempt in this state to rise to any worthy reference to The Reef seems to me a vain thing; yet there remains with me so strongly the impression of its quality and of the unspeakably fouillée nature of the situation between the two principals (more gone into and with more undeviating truth than anything you have done) that I can't but babble of it a little to you even with these weak lips. It all shows, partly, what strength of subject is, and how it carries and inspires, inasmuch as I think your subject in its essence [is] very fine and takes in no end of beautiful things to do. Each of these two figures is admirable for truth and justesse; the woman an exquisite thing, and with her characteristic finest, scarce differentiated notes (that is some of them) sounded with a wonder of delicacy. I'm not sure her oscillations are not beyond our notation; yet they are so held in your hand, so felt and known and shown, and everything seems so to come of itself. I suffer or worry a little from {{the fact that in the}} Prologue, as it were, we are admitted so much into the consciousness of the man, and that after the introduction of Anna (Anna so perfectly named) we see him almost only as she sees him--which gives our attention a different sort of work to do; yet this is really, I think, but a triumph of your method, for he remains of an absolute consistent verity, showing himself in that way better perhaps than in any other, and without a false note <b>imputable,</b> not a shadow of one, to his manner of so projecting himself. The beauty of it is that it is, for all it is worth, a Drama, and almost, as it seems to me, of the psychologic Racinian unity, intensity and gracility. Anna is really of Racine and one presently begins to feel her throughout as an Eriphyle or a Bérénice: which, by the way, helps to account a little for something qui me chiffonne throughout: which is why the whole thing, unrelated and unreferred save in the most superficial way to its milieu and background, and to any determining or qualifying entourage, takes place comme cela, and in a specified, localised way, in France--these non-French people [...] "electing," [...] as it were, to have their story out there. This particularly makes all sorts of unanswered questions come up about Owen; and the notorious wickedness of Paris isn't at all required to bring about the conditions of the Prologue. Oh, if you knew how plentifully we could supply them in London and, I should suppose, in New York or in Boston. But the point was, as I see it, that you couldn't really give us the sense of a Boston Eriphyle or Boston Givré, and that an exquisite instinct, [...] "back of" [...] your Racinian inspiration and settling the whole thing for you, whether consciously or not, absolutely prescribed a vague and elegant French colonnade or gallery, with a French river dimly gleaming through, as the harmonious fond you required. In the key of this, with all your reality, you have yet kept the whole thing: and, to deepen the harmony and accentuate the literary pitch, have never surpassed yourself for certain exquisite moments, certain images, analogies, metaphors, certain silver correspondences in your façon de dire; examples of which I could pluck out and numerically almost confound you with, were I not stammering this in so handicapped a way. There used to be little notes in you that were like fine benevolent finger-marks of the good George Eliot--the echo of much reading of that excellent woman, here and there, that is, sounding through. But now you are like a lost and recovered [...] "ancient" [...] whom she might have got a reading of (especially were he a Greek) and of whom in her texture some weaker reflection were to show. For, dearest Edith, you are stronger and firmer and finer than all of them put together; you go further and you say mieux, and your only drawback is not having the homeliness and the inevitability and the happy limitation and the affluent poverty, of a Country of your Own (comme moi, par exemple!) It makes you, this does, as you exquisitely say of somebody or something at some moment, elegiac (what penetration, what delicacy in your use there of the term!)--makes you so, that is, for the Racinian-sérieux--but leaves you more in the desert (for everything else) that surrounds Apex City. But you will say that you're content with your lot; that the desert surrounding Apex City is quite enough of a dense crush for you, and that with the colonnade and the gallery and the dim river you will always otherwise pull through. To which I can only assent--after such an example of pulling through as The Reef. Clearly you have only to pull, and everything will come.|$|E
6000|$|I {{appear to}} myself none the less {{to have had}} dash for {{approaches}} to a confidence more largely seated; since I recall how, having commenced critic under Charles Norton's weighty protection, I was to find myself, on all but the very morrow, invited to the high glory, as I felt it, of aiding to launch, though on the obscurer side of the enterprise, a weekly journal which, putting forth its first leaves {{in the summer of}} '65 and under the highest auspices, was soon to enjoy a fortune and achieve an authority and a dignity of which neither newspaper nor critical review among us had hitherto so much as hinted the possibility. The New York Nation had from the first, to the enlivening of several persons consciously and ruefully astray in our desert, made no secret of a literary leaning; and indeed its few foremost months shine most for me in the light of their bestowal of one of the longest and happiest friendships of my life, a relation with Edwin Lawrence Godkin, the Nation incarnate as he was to become, which bore fruit of affection for years after it had ceased to involve the comparatively poorer exercise. Godkin's paper, Godkin's occasional presence and interesting history and vivid ability and, above all, admirably aggressive and ironic editorial humour, of a quality and authority new in the air of a journalism that had meant {{for the most part the}} heavy hand alone, these things, with the sudden sweet discovery that I might for my own part acceptedly stammer a style, are so many shades and shifting tints in the positive historic iridescence that flings itself for my memory, as I have noted, over the [...] "period" [...] of Ashburton Place. Wherever I dip, again, I pull out a plum from under the tooth of time--this at least so to my own rapt sense that had I more space I might pull both freely and at a venture. The strongest savour of the feast--with the fumes of a feast it comes back--was, I need scarce once more insist, the very taste of the War as ending and ended; through which blessing, more and more, the quantity of military life or at least the images of military experience seemed all about us, quite paradoxically, to grow greater. This I take to have been a result, first of the impending, and then of the effective, break-up of the vast veteran Army, swamping much of the scene as with the flow of a monster tide and bringing literally home to us, in bronzed, matured faces and even more in bronzed, matured characters, above all in the absolutely acquired and stored resource of overwhelming reference, reference usually of most substance the less it was immediately explicit, the more in fact it was faded and jaded to indifference, what was meant by having patiently served. The very smell of having so served was somehow, at least to my super-sensitive nostril, in the larger and cooler air, where it might have been an emanation, the most masculine, the most communicative as to associated far-off things (according to the nature, ever, of elements vaguely exhaled), from the operation of the general huge gesture of relief--from worn toggery put off, from old army-cloth and other fittings at a discount, from swordbelts and buckles, from a myriad saturated articles now not even lying about but brushed away with an effect upon the passing breeze and all relegated to the dim state of some mere theoretic commemorative panoply that was never in the event to be objectively disposed. The generalisation grew richly or, as it were, quite adorably familiar, that life was ever so handsomely reinforced, and manners, not to say manner at large, refreshed, and personal aspects and types accented, and categories multiplied (no category, for the dreaming painter of things, could our scene afford not to grab at on the chance), just by the fact of the discharge upon society of such an amount of out-of-the-way experience, as it might roughly be termed--such a quantity and variety of possession and assimilation of unprecedented history. It had been unprecedented at least among ourselves, we had had it in our own highly original conditions--or [...] "they," [...] to be more exact, had had it admirably in theirs; and I think I was never to know a case in which his having been directly touched by it, or, in a word, having consistently [...] "soldiered," [...] learnt all about it and exhausted it, wasn't to count all the while on behalf of the happy man for one's own individual impression or attention; call it again, as everything came back to that, one's own need to interpret. The discharge upon [...] "society" [...] is moreover what I especially mean; it being the sense of how society in our image of the word was taking it all in that I was most concerned with; plenty of other images figured of course for other entertainers of such. The world immediately roundabout us at any rate bristled with more of the young, or the younger, cases I speak of, cases of [...] "things seen" [...] and felt, and a delectable difference in the man thereby made <b>imputable,</b> than I could begin here to name even had I kept the record. I think I fairly cultivated the perceiving of it all, so that nothing of it, under some face or other, shouldn't brush my sense and add to my impression; yet my point is more particularly that the body social itself was for the time so permeated, in the light I glance at, that it became to its own consciousness more interesting. As so many existent parts of it, however unstoried yet, to their minor credit, various thrilled persons could inhale the interest to their fullest capacity and feel that they too had been pushed forward--and were even to find themselves by so much the more pushable yet.|$|E
