50|$|Phenylbutazone is a {{crystalline}} substance. It {{is obtained}} by condensation of diethyl n-butylmalonate with <b>hydrazobenzene</b> {{in the presence}} of base. In effect, this represents the formation of the heterocyclic system by simple lactamization.|$|E
50|$|The Diels-Reese Reaction is a {{reaction}} between <b>hydrazobenzene</b> and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (or related esters) first reported in 1934 by Otto Diels and Johannes Reese. Later work by others extended the reaction scope to include substituted hydrazobenzenes. The exact mechanism is not known. By changing the acidic or basic {{nature of the}} solvent, the reaction gives different products. With acetic acid as solvent (acidic), the reaction gives an diphenylpyrazolone. With xylene as solvent (neutral), the reaction gives an indole. With pyridine as solvent (basic), the reaction gives a carbomethoxyquinoline which can be degraded to a dihydroquinoline.|$|E
50|$|He made {{considerable}} {{contributions to}} organic chemistry. His research on aniline helped lay {{the basis of}} the aniline-dye industry. His earliest research on coal tar laid the groundwork for his student Charles Mansfield's practical methods for extracting benzene and toluene and converting them into nitro compounds and amines. Hofmann prepared three ethylamines and tetraethylammonium compounds and established their structural relationship to ammonia. His discoveries include formaldehyde, <b>hydrazobenzene,</b> the isonitriles, and allyl alcohol. His name is associated with the Hofmann voltameter and with a number of processes which he investigated, including the Hofmann rearrangement, the Hofmann-Martius rearrangement, Hofmann elimination, and the Hofmann-Löffler reaction.|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} and selective photochemical method for the oxidation of primary aromatic amines to the corresponding azoaromatic compounds with HgO as the photo-oxidant is reported. Aniline and substituted anilines were transformed to the corresponding azobenzenes by treatment with HgO in CH 3 CN {{at room temperature}} in high yields. Under similar conditions, diamines such as o-, m- and or p-phenylenediamines gave the corresponding diaminoazo compounds. It was proposed that the photoactivated HgO effects the cleavage {{of one of the}} N–H bond of the amine to generate the aminyl radical which dimerizes to the <b>hydrazobenzene</b> via nitrogen-nitrogen coupling. The <b>hydrazobenzene</b> was then oxidized to azo product...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} in order to complete the nitrogen- nitrogen bond energy series by calculating this energy in <b>hydrazobenzene</b> from its heat of combustion. In view of the wide discrepancies in the known values for this quantity the heat of combustion was determined in an adiabatic calorimeter after standardization with benzoic acid. To establish the validity of this result, {{as well as of}} those reported earlier from this laboratory, the heat of combustion of the secondary standard, hippuric acid, was also measured and found to agree with the accepted value. In addition to the calculation of the bond energy in <b>hydrazobenzene</b> this data also permitted calculation of the nitrogen- nitrogen double bond energy in azobenzene.

40|$|THE {{fact that}} certain {{aromatic}} amines were ascribed as causative agents for the bladder cancer amongst dyestuff workers {{has now been}} established. Bladder cancer was also experimentally induced in animals by administration of 2 -naphythylamine, 4 -aminophenol <b>hydrazobenzene,</b> aminoazotoluene and its dimethyl derivative and xenylamine (Hueper, 1938; Nelson and Woodard, 1953; Walpole, Williams and Roberts, 1954). The carcinoginic effect of these aromatic amines on the urinary bladder is mainly due to the excretion of certain metabolites of these amines in the urine. Some ortho-aminophenols which are normal products of endogenous metabolism of tryptophan and which naturally occur in small amounts in human urine are now known to induce bladder cance...|$|E

40|$|Part I A {{number of}} {{unsuccessful}} experiments {{were carried out}} {{in an attempt to}} show that the benzidine rearrangement proceeds through intermediate cation radicals. The rearrangement of p-hydrazo- toluene (HzT), which has been reported to give rise to p-toluidine, p-azotoluene, and 2 -amino- 4, 5 '-dimethyldiphenylamine (an o-semidine) in a 2 : 1 : 2 weight ratio, was extensively investigated. Attempts to initiate polymerization by intermediates formed during the rearrangement of HzT (and <b>hydrazobenzene)</b> failed. The product solution that was obtained after all of the HzT had reacted was found to oxidize N,N,N',N' tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine to Wurster's Blue.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxidation of aniline {{at low concentration}} {{was carried out in}} phosphate buffer solutions of pH 5. Both electrochemical and spectroscopic results indicate that during the initial stages of aniline oxidation, a dimerisation process takes place. The dimer has been identified as p-aminodiphenylamine (ADPA). No evidence supporting the formation of other dimerisation products, such as benzidine or <b>hydrazobenzene</b> has been found. The hydrolysis of ADPA seems to be a very slow process at pH 5 and, consequently, the formation of hydroquinone/p-benzoquinone has not been observed. ADPA is poorly soluble in aqueous medium and a part of these species precipitates on the electrode surface when formed. This precipitated dimer could act as an active centre for the further growth of the polymeric chains. Ministerio de Educación y Cultura (PB 97 - 0130...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} with {{the object of}} extending our knowledge concerning the action of certain of the derivatives of hydrazine in destroying red corpuscles. A number of hemolytic substances, such as phenyihydrazine, toluylendiamine, and saponin, {{have been used by}} former investigators in producing experimental anemia. In view of the practical difficulties in-volved in experimentation on human anemic individuals, especially when large amounts of blood are required, it appears desirable to have, for purposes of experimentation, as great a variety of anemic conditions as possible. According to Heinz (1), monobenzoylphenylhydrazine, ethyl-enephenylhydrazine, and ethylenephenyihydrazine-succinic acid are blood poisons. Joanin (2) has reported that this is true, likewise, of the methyl derivatives of phenylhydrazine. The work on these compounds has been reviewed by Fr#{ 228 }nkel (3). In the present investigation, the following compounds have been studied: hydrazine, phenylhydrazine, methylphenylhydra-zine, diphenyihydrazine, <b>hydrazobenzene,</b> acetylphenylhydra-zine, p-bromphenylhydrazine, p-hydrazinobenzoic acid, symmet-rical diisopropythydrazine, 2 - 2 ’ azobispropane, azobenzene, azoxybenzene, diazoaminobenzene, aminoazobenzene and di-phenylcarbazide.

40|$|A {{novel and}} simple {{methodology}} for characterization of electrode processes by square-wave voltammetry (SWV), {{considered as a}} complex repetitive double-step chronoamperometric experiment, is proposed. Specifically, the sampling of the current {{at the very end}} of each potential pulse, as common in conventional SWV, is replaced with a multisampling protocol during each potential pulse, resulting in generation of a series of corresponding multisampled SW voltammograms constructed out of a single measurement. The evolution of such voltammograms reflects the chronoamperometric properties of the current in the course of each potential pulse, thus being specific to electrode mechanism and electrode kinetics. The proposed methodology could serve as a basis for modification of common SWV mode in commercially available instrumentation for the purpose of an advanced characterization of electrode processes. The methodology is theoretically illustrated by the analysis of three kinetically controlled common electrode mechanisms, such as the electrode reaction of a solution resident and surface confined redox couples, as well as the regenerative catalytic electrode mechanism (EC’), while the experimental verification is done with the electrode reaction of Eu 3 +/Eu 2 + and azobenzene/ <b>hydrazobenzene</b> redox couples...|$|E
40|$|The earlier {{stage of}} the {{polymerization}} reaction of polyaniline has been studied employing in situ spectroelectro-chemical techniques. The r sults indicate that the nitrene cation {{appears to be a}} key intermediate species, which leads to all three possible dimers including a head-to-tail dimer (N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine), a tail-to-tail dimer (benzidine), and a head-to-head dimer (<b>hydrazobenzene).</b> The oxidized forms of these dimers were all shown to be capable of growing polyaniline in the presence of aniline, even though aniline was not oxidized. The cyclic voltammetric peaks observed ur-ing the PA synthesis in the middle potential regions were shown to arise from the redox reactions of these dimers, oligo-mers, and degradation products of polyaniline including quinoneimines and p-benzoquinone. Polyaniline (PA) has received a great deal of interest as one of the conductive polymers due to its straightforward methods of preparation and the stability of its conductive form in air (1 - 18). PA can be prepared chemically (2, 4) or electrochemically (1, 3, 7 - 18) in aqueous or nonaqueous media. Only those prepared in acidic aqueous media have a conductive form. Its applications as energy storage media (2 - 4) and as electrochromic devices (10, 11) have been discussed. Despite much work on PA preparation methods and its various properties, its growth mechanisms in the earlier phase of the polymerization reaction still remains unclear. Recently, Stilwell and Park have reported the autocataly-tic nature of the polymerization reaction and its related ki-netic data (16). From the extensive studies, a conclusion is reached that the PA growth reaction competes with degra-dation reaction paths (16, 19). The rate of autocatalytic re-action has also been determined employing normal pulse voltammetric techniques (18). In the early studies by Mohilner et al. (1) and Bacon and Adams (20), it was shown that the formation of a radical cation upon oxidation of aniline is the rate-limiting step. The radical cation thus formed leads to dimerization prod-ucts such as benzidine and p-aminodiphenylamin...|$|E
40|$|Pressure plays a {{critical}} role in regulating the structures and properties of materials. Since Percy Bridgeman was recognized by the 1946 Nobel Prize for his contribution to high-pressure physics, high-pressure research as an interdisciplinary area has attracted extensive attentions. Nowadays, the high-pressure research involves broad frontier areas, such as chemistry, physics, biology, material and earth science. For instance, brand new classes of inorganic materials of unusual stoichiometries and crystal structures, with wide range of optical, mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties, have been produced at high pressure. Pressure-induced structural transformations between crystalline and amorphous materials, as well as among insulators, conductors and even superconductors, have been extensive documented. This Ph. D. work focused on investigating pressure-induced structural transformations in materials and understanding the involved chemistry, which was assembled into two parts. In part I, two molecular systems, chlorocyclohexane (CCH) and azobenzene (AB), were investigated to examine the pressure effect on chemical conformations, stability of ring structures and reactivities using Raman spectroscopy. For CCH, pressure-induced conformational change as well as rich phase transformations were observed upon compression. Both AB and <b>hydrazobenzene</b> (HAB) underwent a phase transition at a similar pressure. However, origins of these phase transformations were drastically different. High-pressure structures of both molecules were examined based on spectroscopic data. Their distinctive high-pressure behaviors were analyzed and interpreted with the aid of ab initio molecular orbital calculations. Part II focuses on pressure-induced structural transformations of one dimensional (1 D) nanomaterials using vibrational spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Individual studies were first carried out on BN nanotubes and GaN nanowires aiming at investigating their high-pressure behaviors. Then, systematic studies were conducted on TiO 2 and ZnO nanowires focusing on the size- and morphology- effect on their high-pressure behaviors. These 1 D nanomaterials behaved dramatically different from bulk counterparts and nanoparticles, in terms of phase transition pressure, phase transition sequence, and compressibility. In addition, morphology of each material before and after compression was examined by scanning electron microscope. Our studies provide more insight into the understanding of unique high-pressure behaviors of nanomaterials and show profound implications for producing controlled structures with new applications achieved by combined pressure-morphology tuning...|$|E
40|$|Recently the 1, 3, 5 -triazine {{ring system}} has shown promise as a simple, stable, and {{inexpensive}} precursor for {{the synthesis of}} novel energetic materials. Synthetic work has resulted in several energetic compounds which have desirable properties. Although the synthetic chemistry surrounding triazines has been explored for nearly a century, development of highly complex multi-ring heterocyclic and nitrogen linked triazine moieties has only just begun. ^ In a search for novel energetic materials azo-linked bis triazines were pursued. Herein the thermal decomposition of 14 simple triazines and 16 hydrazo or azo-linked bis triazines were studied using mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, and differential scanning calorimetry. Decomposition was complete at temperatures far above the decomposition onset. Lower temperatures provided insight into {{the stability of the}} functional groups pendant to the triazine rings. Decomposition gases were identified by chromatography; they indicated little degradation of the triazine rings. The s-triazine ring system appears very stable, resisting decomposition up to 550 °C while its substituents undergo isolated chemistry. The azo or hydrazo linkage {{does not appear to be}} a trigger for the decomposition and nitrogen release is easily correlated between amino, hydrazino, and azido substituents. ^ Hydrogenation of azo bonds with hydrazine, mono-substituted hydrazine, and <b>hydrazobenzene</b> was studied with selected diazene compounds under oxygen-free conditions. The reactions proceed rapidly and in high yield in several solvents. The stoichiometry of the reactions suggests that all N-H hydrogens are efficiently delivered regardless of reaction time. While the reduction process is accompanied by the evolution of nitrogen gas in the case of N 2 H 4, the intermediacy of diimide could not be confirmed by standard trapping experiments. Evidenced by the difference in reactivity from azoarenes, electron-poor diazenes appear to offer a yet undescribed mechanistic pathway to proton abstraction which may be developed as a synthetic tool. ^ Acid catalyzed nitration has been examined using a variety of novel nitration agents: guanidine nitrate, nitroguanidine, and ethylene glycol dinitrate. Reactions with activated or deactivated aromatics proceed rapidly and in high yield; however, regioselectivity was similar for all nitrating agents examined. The synthetic advantages of liquid EGDN include high solubility in organic solvents, strong nitration activity, and ease of preparation. ...|$|E
