5|$|TouchWave, Inc. (now WebCom), was {{a privately}} held Palo Alto, California IP-telephony network switch {{provider}} founded in 1997. TouchWave developed a product line called WebSwitch {{that was designed}} to replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies. WebSwitch was part of a phone system that incorporates communication features provided by the Internet. The rapid success of TouchWave was memorialized with awards and an acquisition by Ericsson Communications for $46M two years after TouchWave was founded. Ericsson continued the TouchWave product line under the name WebCom, but its efforts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> as less than successful.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann's results <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> as {{a special}} case of linear programming, where von Neumann's model uses only nonnegative matrices. The study of von Neumann's model of an {{expanding}} economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics. This paper {{has been called the}} greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors, who recognized its introduction of fixed-point theorems, linear inequalities, complementary slackness, and saddlepoint duality. In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann's growth model, Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists, but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself.|$|E
5|$|Eardwulf (fl. 790– c. 830) {{was king}} of Northumbria from 796 to 806, {{when he was}} deposed and went into exile. He {{may have had a}} second reign from 808 until perhaps 811 or 830. Northumbria {{in the last years of}} the eighth century was the scene of dynastic strife between several noble families: in 790, the then-king Æthelred I {{attempted}} to have Eardwulf assassinated. Eardwulf's survival may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> as a sign of divine favour. A group of nobles conspired to assassinate Æthelred in April 796 and he was succeeded by Osbald: Osbald's reign lasted only twenty-seven days before he was deposed and Eardwulf became king on 14 May 796.|$|E

5|$|Fearing the {{approaching}} Jin army, Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south. The emperor deserting the capital would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> {{as an act}} of capitulation, so court officials convinced him to abdicate. There were few objections. Rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction was more important than preserving the rituals of imperial inheritance. In January 1126, {{a few days before the}} New Year, Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of Retired Emperor. The Jurchen forces reached the Yellow River on January 27, 1126, two days after the New Year. Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day, escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor Qinzong (r. 1126–1127) in charge of the capital.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the founders}} were {{educated in the}} {{classical}} tradition, and used classical models for landmarks and buildings in Washington, D.C., to avoid the feudal and religious connotations of European architecture such as castles and cathedrals. In forming their theory of the mixed constitution, the founders looked to Athenian democracy and Roman republicanism for models, but regarded the Roman emperor as a figure of tyranny. They nonetheless adopted Roman Imperial forms such as the dome, as represented by the US Capitol and numerous state capitol buildings, to express classical ideals through architecture. Thomas Jefferson saw the Empire as a negative political lesson, but was a chief proponent of its architectural models. Jefferson's design for the Virginia State Capitol, for instance, is modelled directly from the Maison Carrée, a Gallo-Roman temple built under Augustus. The renovations of the National Mall {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> as expressing a more overt imperialist kinship with Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{functions}} of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head have long inspired debate. Traditionally, these <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> as defensive weapons against predators. More recent theories, noting the presence of {{blood vessels in the}} skull bones of ceratopsids, find it more probable that these features were primarily used in identification, courtship and dominance displays, much like the antlers and horns of modern reindeer, mountain goats, or rhinoceros beetles. The theory would find additional support if Torosaurus was found to be the mature form of Triceratops, as this would mean the frill also developed holes (fenestrae) as individuals reached maturity, rendering the structure more useful for display than defense.|$|E

25|$|As a naval power, Britain {{had a long}} {{record of}} insisting that neutral nations honor its {{blockades}} of hostile countries.

He {{also pointed out that}} NATO should reconsider its decision to deny Georgia the fast track for NATO membership.

25|$|Prime brokers are broker-dealers {{which offer}} custody and other {{services}} to hedge funds. Prime brokerage has generally been considered as more risky than traditional custody, primarily because hedge funds <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>viewed</b> as more risky than institutional investors. Moreover, in the US a hedge fund may execute trades through any number of broker-dealers. But in the settlement process, those trades become the trades of the prime broker, as though the hedge fund had executed the trades only through that broker. The risk of the hedge fund's inability to settle those trades becomes that of the prime broker.|$|E
