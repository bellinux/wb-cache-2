2500|$|The Swiss Agency for Energy Efficiency (SAFE) uses {{a concept}} that {{promises}} to be of great use in the diagnosis and design of road lighting, [...] "consommation électrique spécifique (CES)", which can be translated into English as [...] "specific electric power consumption (SEC)". Thus, based on observed lighting levels {{in a wide range}} of Swiss towns, SAFE has defined target values for electric power consumption per metre for roads of various categories. Thus, SAFE currently recommends an SEC of 2 to 3 watts per meter for roads of less than 10 metre width (4 to 6 watts per metre for wider roads). Such a measure provides an easily applicable environmental protection constraint on conventional [...] "norms", which usually are based on the recommendations of lighting manufacturing interests, who may not take into account <b>environmental</b> <b>criteria.</b> In view of ongoing progress in lighting technology, target SEC values will need to be periodically revised downwards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} a traffic network equilibrium {{model in which}} the users or travelers on the network {{are assumed to be}} multicriteria decision-makers with an explicit <b>environmental</b> <b>criterion.</b> The members of a class of traveler perceive their generalized cost on a route as a weighting of travel time, travel cost, and the emissions generated. The model allows the weights to be not only class-dependent but also link-dependent. The multiclass, multicriteria network equilibrium conditions are shown to satisfy a finite-dimensional vari-ational inequality problem. Qualitative properties of the solution are obtained. A special case of the model is then used to obtain sharper results and to illustrate the relationship between the weights and the attainment of a desired environmental quality standard. An algorithm is proposed for the computation of the equilibrium pattern, along with conver-gence results, and then applied to solve a numerical example. The multiclass, multicriteria network equilibrium model is the first to incorporate an <b>environmental</b> <b>criterion.</b> 1 1...|$|R
