Hydrogen rich fueled flame stability is sensitive to operating conditions, including environment pressure, temperature, and jet velocity.

40|$|One {{of major}} {{concerns}} in gas turbine industry {{is to reduce}} emissions.   Tow kind of approaches could be identified in the industry to reduce emissions, namely Primary Emission Reduction approach and Secondary Emission Reduction approach. The primary approach concerns <b>emission</b> <b>prevention</b> in combustion, while secondary approach is all about emission cleanup before releasing to the atmosphere. Combustion flame temperature highly influences on emissions specially NOx formation.   NOx emission is lower when the combustor operates close to lean flammability limit. Incorporating catalyst to combustor is one of methods to extend flammability limit.   Heat and Power Division at KTH-Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden has developed a test facility to test performances of catalyst in combustion. The combustion test facility available at Heat & Power Davison at KTH, consists of high pressure air compressor and air flow control system, air preheating unit and control system, fuel flow control system, combustor unit, and exhaust gas analyzer system. But lack of proper user interface to control and monitor {{the operation of the}} test facility through a computer work station was a major concern from experimenters. The purpose of the thesis work is to design and construction of supervisory control and data acquisition system for the full scale catalytic combustion test facility.   Labview 2012 is used as the main platform for implementing data acquisition and control system for the test facility. Thermocouples, pressure transducer signals, air flow meter signal are connected to Keithley 2701 data acquisition system and then connected to the computer. Fuel flow controllers are directly connected to the computer via serial port. Air flow control actuator signal is given through ADAM digital to analogue converter. Developed GUI is more convenient for users in terms of easy control of air flow, fuel flow and gas sampling probe systems, and monitoring of temperature, pressure measurements and exhaust gas species systems.

50|$|Desflurane is a {{greenhouse}} gas. The twenty-year global-warming potential, GWP(20), for desflurane is 3714, meaning that one tonne of desflurane emitted {{is equivalent to}} 3714 tonnes of {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere, much higher than sevoflurane or isoflurane. In addition to global warming potentials, drug potency and fresh gas flow rates must be considered for meaningful comparisons between anesthetic gases. When a steady state hourly amount of anesthetic necessary for 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) at 2 liters per minute (LPM) for Sevoflurane, and 1 LPM for Desflurane and Isoflurane is weighted by the GWP, the clinically relevant quantities of each anesthetic can then be compared. On a per-MAC-hour basis, the total life cycle GHG impact of desflurane is more than 20 times higher than Isoflurane and Sevoflurane (1 minimal alveolar concentration-hour). One paper finds anesthesia gases used globally contribute the equivalent of 1 million cars to global warming. This estimate is commonly cited as a reason to neglect pollution prevention by anesthesiologists, however this is problematic. This estimate is extrapolated from only one U.S. institution’s anesthetic practices, and this institution uses virtually no Desflurane. Researchers neglected to include nitrous oxide in their calculations, and reported an erroneous average of 17 kg CO2e per anesthetic. However, institutions that utilize some Desflurane and account for nitrous oxide have reported an average of 175-220 kg CO2e per anesthetic.

40|$|The {{carbon dioxide}} <b>emission</b> <b>prevention</b> {{advantage}} of generating power with high hydrogen content fuels using gas turbines motivates an improved {{understanding of the}} ignition behavior of hydrogen in premixed and partially premixed environments. Hydrogen rich fueled flame stability is sensitive to operating conditions, including environment pressure, temperature, and jet velocity. Furthermore, when premixed or partially premixed operation is desired for nitric oxide emissions reduction, a diluent, such as nitrogen, is often added in allowing fuel/air mixing prior to combustion. Thus, the concentration of the diluent added is an additional independent variable on which flame stability dependence understanding is needed. The focus {{of this research is}} on characterizing the dependence of hydrogen jet flame stability on environment temperature, jet velocity, diluent concentration, and pressure by determining the dependence of the liftoff height of lifted flames on these 4 independent parameters. Nitrogen is used as the diluent due to its availability and effectiveness in promoting liftoff. Experiments are first conducted at atmospheric pressure in scoping subsequent research where the additional parameter of pressure is added. The stability and liftoff characteristics of a nitrogen diluted hydrogen jet flame at atmospheric pressure in a vitiated co-flow are investigated experimentally and numerically with particular attention focused on regimes where multiple stabilization mechanisms are active. Information gleaned from this research is instrumental for informing modeling approaches in flame transition situations when both autoignition and flame propagation influence combustion characteristics. Stability regime diagrams which outline the conditions under which the flame is attached, lifted, blown-out, and unsteady are experimentally developed and explored. The stability of the flame is investigated with a 1 D Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes parabolic numerical model which shows that under certain conditions, local turbulent flame speeds exceed the local velocity for the production of stable lifted hydrogen flames. These modeling results suggest that the dominant flame stabilization mechanism is flame propagation, and likely tribrachial flame propagation, consistent with the conclusions of prior studies for jet flames issuing into ambient environments such as the research of Muñiz and Mungal (1997). The lifted regime is further characterized at atmospheric pressure in determining liftoff height dependence on co-flow temperature, jet velocity, and nitrogen dilution. A strong sensitivity of liftoff height to co-flow temperature, jet velocity, and nitrogen dilution is observed. The numerical model results trend well with the experimentally developed stability regime diagrams. Liftoff heights predicted by Kalghatgi's correlation are unable to capture the effects of nitrogen dilution on liftoff height for the heated co-flow cases. A uniquely formulated Damköhler number was therefore developed which acceptably captures the effects of jet velocity, nitrogen dilution and environment temperature on liftoff height. Satisfactory agreement between the correlation results which relies on propagation parameters in its formulation further indicates that stabilization is indeed dominated by propagation. The unsteady regime is also investigated experimentally at atmospheric pressure. The unsteady regime is characterized by rapid ignition events of an initially unburned jet of fuel, and these events are always followed by subsequent blowout events. The frequency by which these ignition events occur are measured and insights are drawn regarding the impact of nitrogen dilution, jet velocity, and co-flow equivalence ratio on ignition frequency. Nitrogen addition to the fuel increases autoignition delay times which reduces ignition frequency, though it also reduces the speed of flame propagation which increases the frequency of blowoff. Consequently, when the level of nitrogen dilution added to the fuel is moderate, increases in dilution increase ignition frequency, and when high levels of nitrogen are added, further increases reduce ignition frequency because each ignition event is preceded by a blowoff event. Jet velocity increases lead to broader ranges of nitrogen dilution where unsteady behavior is observed. Finally, increases in co-flow equivalence ratio result in unsteady behavior for greater levels of nitrogen dilutionExperiments are also conducted at elevated pressure with co-flow temperature, jet velocity, and nitrogen dilution still parameterized. Strong sensitivity of liftoff height on co-flow temperature and pressure is observed both when jet velocity and jet Reynolds number are held constant as pressure is varied. With confinement, which is required in achieving elevated pressure, liftoff height sensitivity on jet velocity is diminished. The Damköhler number is again utilized in assessing its utility in incorporating the pressure effect, and satisfactory correlation results are demonstrated. Elevated pressure results and atmospheric pressure results (without confinement) indicate that the Damköhler number can be used in scoping experimental lifted flame research at elevated pressures and temperatures and in informing numerical modeling approaches for research as well as in industry...|$|E

In this paper, {{the environmental impact of}} combustion and of direct land spreading of poultry manure are compared, considering three aspects of cleaner production: sustainable energy production and GHG <b>emissions,</b> pollution <b>prevention</b> and recycling of materials. In a life cycle perspective, it is shown that the production of electricity from poultry manure reduces the emissions of GHGs, NH 3, nitrates, SO 2 and NOx to the environment. The reduction of the emissions and resulting decreased environmental impact is partly due to the diversion of poultry manure from land spreading and partly due to the replacement of electricity production by the combustion of fossil fuels. The combustion ash is rich in phosphorus and potassium, but low in nitrogen, {{so that it can be}} recycled as an inorganic soil conditioner. The ash is dry, odorless, and free of pathogens, which are beneficial properties compared to fresh poultry manure.

Long term experience in these fields exists, especially in Australia, Germany, China, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. Based on local conditions including geology, market conditions and mining regulations, different approaches have been developed in these countries. Changes in these parameters have however exposed the limitations of traditional solutions. While the Australian approach {{is based on the}} premise that gas content will be reduced below specific threshold values ahead of mining, opportunities of pre-drainage are limited in low permeability coal such as that encountered e. g. in Germany and China. In the case of multi seam mining, a highly effective increase in permeability can however be achieved through pressure relief by unconventional mining sequences. Although practiced at several mines in Europe and Asia, realising this in open market conditions requires a high quality of planning in regard to mine layout, mine development and gas drainage as well as the appropriate geotechnical assessments.

Mining at high gas contents by applying local exploration and pressure relief drilling has been practiced in a successful and safe way in several European mines.

40|$|Soil biofiltration, {{also known}} as soil bed reactor (SBR), {{technology}} was originally developed in Germany {{to take advantage of}} the diversity in microbial mechanisms to control gases producing malodor in industrial processes. The approach has since gained wider international acceptance and continues to see improvements to maximize microbial and process efficiency and extend the range of problematical gases for which the technology can be an effective control. We review the basic mechanisms which underlay microbial soil processes involved in air purification, advantages and limitations of the technology and the current research status of the approach. Soil biofiltration has lower capital and operating/energetic costs than conventional technologies and is well adapted to handle contaminants in moderate concentrations. The systems can be engineered to optimize efficiency though manipulation of temperature, pH, moisture content, soil organic matter and airflow rates. Soil air biofiltration technology was modified for application in the Biosphere 2 project, which demonstrated in preparatory research with a number of closed system testbeds that soil could also support crop plants while also serving as soil filters with airpumps to push air through the soil. This Biosphere 2 research demonstrated in several closed system testbeds that a number of important trace gases could be kept under control and led to the engineering of the entire agricultural soil of Biosphere 2 to serve as a soil filtration unit for the facility. Soil biofiltration, coupled with food crop production, as a component of bioregenerative space life support systems has the advantages of lower energy use and avoidance of the consumables required for other air purification approaches. Expanding use of soil biofiltration can aid a number of environmental applications, from the mitigation of indoor air pollution, as a method of reducing global warming impact of methane (biogas), improvement of industrial air <b>emissions</b> and <b>prevention</b> of accidental release of toxic gases...|$|R

The suitability of the models was checked taking into consideration their compatibility with the legislation (i. e. fire protection, earth quake <b>prevention,</b> <b>emission</b> thresholds), and the relevant standards of participating countries. The strategic aim of this Task was the definition of criteria, strategies and actions (procedures, technical tools, economic analysis) for receiving information about the actual degradation state of the buildings and the possibility to develop renovation plans, taking into account the appli-cability and availability of existing systems. The main objective of the Action is the development and dissemination of knowledge and tools to assess and promote the refurbishment of existing suburban building stocks” (Memorandum of Understanding COST ACTION TU 0701). The main aim of this work is to compare systems and learn from each other the potentials of each methodology...|$|R
40|$|In many countries, {{the poor}} are still {{excluded}} 16 from economic development. “Is it possible fight- 17 ing poverty through business?” The idea behind 18 inclusive business is that developing business and 19 fighting poverty can {{go hand in hand}} and can be 20 synthesized in “doing business with the poor to 21 combat poverty”: “Whenever I see a problem, 22 I immediately go and create a company” 23 (Muhammad Yunus, Founder, Grameen Bank). 24 There are a number of terms that characterize 25 the concept of inclusive business (Table 1). The 26 inclusive business models also frequently appear 27 in connection with the following two concepts:Social enterprise/social business, which refers 28 to companies that pursue social objectives as part 29 of their business model, among them fighting 30 poverty. 31 Corporate Social Responsibility, which refers 32 to the responsibility of companies to make 33 a contribution to society and prevent damage. 34 Many companies strive to integrate CSR activi- 35 ties into their core business. Inclusive business 36 pursued by companies also falls into this cate- 37 gory. In fact, these types of initiatives also often 38 originate in the CSR department in larger 39 companies. 40 These models try to answer the question: 41 Inclusive business is all about including the 42 poor and disadvantaged, especially in developing 43 countries, in the business process, either as 44 producer or consumer, bringing added value for 45 companies and people living in poverty alike and 46 contributing to poverty reduction through engag- 47 ing them in different ways in any stage of the 48 business value chain: as employees, suppliers, 49 distributors, consumers, and/or innovator – i. e., 50 directly employing low-income people, targeting 51 development of suppliers and service providers 52 from low-income communities, or providing 53 affordable goods and services targeted at low- 54 income communities – thus making a positive 55 contribution to the development of companies, 56 the local population, and the environment. 57 This strategy can be successful because people 58 living in the slums and villages of developing 59 countries have difficulty accessing the market. 60 By giving them access, new opportunities often 62 emerge for both sides. 63 In the last years, there has been growing 64 evidence that many companies are making a 65 serious effort to align their core business func- 66 tions with the needs of the societies in which 67 they are operating. Even though business 68 solutions often require complex collaboration 69 with nontraditional partners, as well as a signifi- 70 cant rethink of conventional business models, 71 there are a growing number of companies that 72 have profitably navigated these challenges, and 73 the development benefits appear to have been 74 significant. 75 Inclusive business models can include the 76 developing or adapting existing supply and dis- 77 tribution chains in order to increase the participa- 78 tion of disadvantaged producers, informal 79 traders, and employees; developing or adapting 80 existing product and services needed by the poor 81 and or enable greater access to these product and 82 services to the poor; and creating low carbon, 83 climate-resilient businesses that help business 84 and communities adapt to a changing environ- 85 ment. Relevant domains include renewable ener- 86 gies and energy efficiency, water treatment, and 87 <b>emissions</b> <b>prevention</b> but also medical and phar- 88 maceutical technology or food chemistry. 89 Inclusive businesses can therefore be con- 90 ceived as sustainable business solutions that 91 increase access to goods and services and 92 create new source of income for low-income 93 communities. There are four main areas where 94 the principles of inclusive business can be incor- 95 porated: supply chain, employment; products/ 96 services; distribution channels. Business models 97 that open up these kinds of possibilities also cre- 98 ate income and business opportunities for third 99 parties (employees, business partners, and micro- 100 entrepreneurs), giving rise to other positive social 101 and economic effects. 102 The basic idea is to use the know-how and 103 capital base accumulated {{at the top of the}} eco- 104 nomic pyramid to develop its base (BoP 105 approach, Base of the Pyramid). Private-sector 106 institutions and especially governments play an 107 important role in inclusive business ventures. 108 They are responsible for protecting the interestsof both consumers and producers. They can also 109 improve the overall conditions for business at the 110 micro and macro level...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{assessment}} and methods software tools existing in EU member states, {{represented in the}} COST action TU 0701 (2008 - 2012) “Improving the quality of suburban building stock”. The work carried out during the Action focused on different policies and operational models concerning the housing stock which during the past decades led the evolution of several important concepts concerning legislation, people’s lifestyles, technical knowledge and innovation, city assets and growing demands for comfort, sustainability, energy efficiency and accessibility. How {{to improve the quality}} of the cities and to get more value from regenerating suburban building stock was the crucial issue of the Action, targeted both the European economic/social needs and also scientific/technological advancement, via the implementation of a new, integrated approach to the improvement and upgrading of suburban building stock. The paper highlights different approaches and strategies taken by different Countries towards the methodologies to assess a building refurbishment, particularly in the suburban building stock, namely private and public social housing. The strategic aim of the work was the definition of criteria, strategies and actions (procedures, technical tools, economic analysis) for receiving information about the actual degradation state of suburban building stock and the possibility to develop renovation plans, taking into account the applicability and availability of existing systems. The suitability of the models was checked taking into consideration their compatibility with the legislation (i. e. fire protection, earth quake <b>prevention,</b> <b>emission</b> thresholds and energy efficiency), the cost structure and the relevant standards of different countries...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the rationale for training in voice emission and voice prophylaxis among teachers and to assess the effects of voice disorders rehabilitation in the selected group of teachers participating in the program “Protect your voice. ” Material and Methods: An anonymous survey was conducted among 463 teachers participating in the training part of the program. The effectivness of rehabilitation of teachers with occupational voice disorders was evaluated among 51 subjects (average age: 43 years) taking part in diagnostic and rehabilitation part of the program. Phonation voice exercises with speech therapist and physiotherapy (iontophoresis, inhalations and elektrostimulation) were administered. Evaluation of rehabilitation was based on phoniatric examination, including videostroboscopy and statistical calculations. Results: The survey showed that among teachers there is high demand (98 %) for training in proper voice <b>emission,</b> hygiene and <b>prevention</b> of voice. The effectiveness of rehabilitation has been confirmed by the observed improvements in phonatory activities of larynx, proper breathing during phonation (p = 0. 0000), the voice quality (p = 0. 0022), prolonged phonation time (an average of 1. 39 s), increased number of people who correctly activated resonators (p = 0. 0000) and increased number of people with phonation without excesive muscle tension of the neck. Conclusions: The results indicate that among all the professionally active teachers, there is a need for regular training of proper voice emission and vocal hygiene and then conduct individually phonation and breathing exercises, supported by the physiotherapy. This should be an effective method of voice disorders prevention in teachers. Med Pr 2017; 68 (5) : 593 – 60...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{analyses}} are the core functionality of geoinformation systems. Therefore, calculating regionalized potentials, ecological and economic balances using geoinformation technologies {{is an obvious}} application {{that has not yet}} been realised. With this project, the functioning is demonstrated in an exemplary manner by the example of the technology path of biogas feed. The selected technology path is suitable for technical and methodical demonstrations from the geoinformation perspective, as all classes of geographical objects and data formats must be used and can be practically applied for the GIS application. Extensive information on the agricultural cultivation, punctiform information on livestock breeding and plant locations are combined with each other via linear structures of substrate transport. Vector and grid data has been used for modelling. To facilitate balancing, the necessary factual data and algorithms have been integrated into GIS using scripts and database combinations. The default GIS application facilitates the system-specific determination of actually available biomass potentials for biogas feed. At the same time, biomethane costs associated with the varying high potentials are determined and the ecological balancing of the impact categories of greenhouse gas, acidification and eutrophication potential is carried out. The results show that the assumptions for surface availability are {{the most important factor in}} determining the extent and spatial distribution of the biomethane potential. The quantitative recording of regional surface availability to produce biogas substrates takes place in several steps by using selected secondary literature data available across Germany. The focus of this thesis was on providing sustainable and economically accessible biomass for biomethane production. With the BMU pilot study, the RAUMIS agriculture sector model and other environment-friendly assumptions, the appropriate framework conditions were selected to be able to illustrate the objectives according to the requirements. In contrast to other biomass-related potential studies, which can obtain spatial statements only via administrative structures, the GIS analyses makes it possible to identify the contributions to the reduction of greenhouse gas <b>emissions</b> and resulting <b>prevention</b> costs of a certain plant, including the substrate of areas under culti-vation and livestock breeding sites used in the catchment area. This functionality can be used simultaneously for various spaces so that a variety of systems and these entire regions can be analysed at once. The applied method can be extended to other forms of bioenergy or to products which are not from the bioenergy sector, especially if the raw materials used show a spatial reference and this varies on a small scale. The fundamental work for other applications has been laid with this dissertation...|$|R
