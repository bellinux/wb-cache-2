40|$|The {{effects of}} copper, organic mercury and {{a mixture of}} the two on {{glycerol}} lysis of erythrocytes were examined. Copper ion and organic mercury (EMP; <b>ethylmercury</b> <b>phosphate,</b> and PCMB; sodium p-chloromercuricbenzoate) inhibited glycerol lysis of erythrocytes. The inhibitory effects was dependent on the incubation period. An equimolor solution of copper ion and EMP showed between copper ion and EMP. Similar results were obtained with copper and PCMB...|$|E
