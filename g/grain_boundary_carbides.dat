Testing was done in air at 500 OF at a total strain range of 0. 75 %. The mechanisms of crack initiation and crack propagation in baseline specimens were determined and {{used as the basis}} of comparison for the rejuvenated specimens. Crack initiation in the baseline specimens was due to decohering of blocky <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides.</b> Pre-crack initiation damage consisted of extrusions and intrusions formed at persistent slip bands and partially decohered <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides.</b> A pre-rejuvenation damage level of 800 cycles (60 % of crack initiation) was selected.

Alloys KM 4, CH 98, IN- 100 and 456 {{are based on a}} Ni- 18 Co- 12 Cr composition while alloys Rene' 88 DT and SR 3 have lower Al and Co and higher Cr contents. The lambda size distributions were determined from quantitative image analysis of the TEM images. The volume fraction of lambda and carbides and the composition of the phases were determined by a combination of phase extraction and TEM. The results showed many similarities in lambda size distributions, grain boundary serrations, and grain boundary carbide frequencies between alloys KM 4, CH 98, 456, Rene' 88 DT and SR 3 when heat treated to give an approximate grain size of ASTM 6. The density of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides</b> in KM 4 was shown to substantially increase as the grain size increased. IN- 100 and 456 subjected to a serration cooling heat treatment had much more complex lambda size distributions with very large intergranular and intragranular secondary lambda as well as finer than average cooling and aging lambda. The <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides</b> in IN- 100 were similar to the other alloys, but 456 given the serration cooling heat treatment had a more variable density of <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides.</b> Examination of the phases extracted from the matrix showed that there were significant differences in the phase chemistries and elemental partitioning ratios between the various alloys...|$|E

Before stress rupture tests, all materials were water-quenched after holding at 1050 °C for 1 h. The microstructure showed a typical lath martensite. Heating rate was 1200 °C/h to a testing temperature and stress rupture test was performed without any soaking. At a fixed temperature, time to failure increased as the applied stress decreased. Irrespective of the bulk contents of P, the fracture mode was intergranular except for a condition corresponding to a longer time to failure. From AES analyses, the crater interface where <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides</b> had existed showed a segregation concentration of P much higher than that at the carbide-free grain boundaries, resulting from the much higher interface energy. The phosphorus segregation at the carbide interfaces of the alloy containing the higher bulk content of phosphorus is mainly replaced by the segregation of nitrogen, tin and tellurium in the alloy containing a lower bulk content of phosphorus. These results suggest that the intergranular cracking follows the sequence from the crater interface to the carbide-free grain boundaries...|$|E

This condition showed excellent room temperature strength and ductility. The introduction of an additional solution treatment at 1120 °C resulted in grain growth, interconnected <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides</b> and coarse (100 nm) intragranular γ′. The coarser γ′ led to {{a significant reduction in}} the strength level, and the interconnected carbides resulted in quasi-brittle fracture with a 50 % reduction in ductility. Reducing the temperature of the stabilization step to 996 °C during ageing of the mill annealed material produced a bi-modal γ′ distribution, and grain boundaries decorated by discrete carbides accompanied by γ′. This condition showed very similar strength and ductility levels as the standard ageing of mill-annealed material. This is promising since both grain boundary γ′ and a bi-modal intragranular γ′ distribution can be used to tailor the mechanical properties to suit specific applications.

40|$|Intergranular stress {{corrosion}} cracking (IGSCC) of two commercial alloy 600 conditions (600 LT, 600 HT) and controlled- purity Ni- 18 Cr- 9 Fe alloys (CDMA, CDTT) were investigated using constant extension rate tensile (CERT) tests in primary water (0. 01 M LiOH+ 0. 01 M H{sub 3 }BO{sub 3 }) with 1 bar hydrogen overpressure at 360 {degrees}C and 320 {degrees}C. Heat treatments produced two types of microstructures in both commercial and controlled-purity alloys: one dominated by <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides</b> (600 HT and CDTT) and one dominated by intragranular carbides (600 LT and CDMA). CERT tests were conducted over a range of strain rates and at two temperatures with interruptions at specific strains to determine the crack depth distributions. Results show that in all samples, IGSCC was the dominant failure mode. For both the commercial alloy and the controlled-purity alloys, the microstructure with <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides</b> showed delayed crack initiation and shallower crack depths than did the intragranular carbide microstructure under all experimental conditions. This data indicates that a grain boundary carbide microstructure is more resistant to IGSCC than an intragranular carbide microstructure. Observations support both the film rupture/slip dissolution mechanism and enhanced localized plasticity. The advantage of these results over previous studies is that the different carbide distributions were obtained in the same commercial alloy using different heat treatments, {{and in the other}} case, in nearly identical controlled-purity alloys. Therefore, observations of the effects of carbide distribution on IGSCC can more confidently be attributed to the carbide distribution alone rather than other potentially significant differences in microstructure or composition...|$|E

The relationship between carbide volume fraction {{and the loss}} of ductility was systematically investigated. The embrittlement was found to be severe for volume fractions greater than about 0. 03 if the carbides were formed principally on <b>grain</b> and twin <b>boundaries.</b> Cracks were propagated unhindered in the continuous, <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbide</b> films formed in alloys containing Cr or Mo and caused intergranular fracture with rupture elongations of similar magnitude to that of the <b>carbide</b> phase itself. <b>Grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbide</b> precipitates which were not continuous led to less severe ductility loss. Intracrystalline carbide precipitates as found in the W or Nb containing alloys reduced the ductility only slightly compared with <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> carbidesin alloys of similar carbon content because the linkage of pores was prevented by the presence of ductile matrix between the pores. The fracture of individual intragranular carbides as well as of connected carbide plates was interpreted using the parallel loaded, two phase structure model.

40|$|A {{continuum}} damage relation (CDR) {{is proposed}} {{to describe the}} failure process of hydrogen attack, i. e. grain boundary cavitation of steels under conditions of high temperature and high hydrogen pressure. The cavitation {{is caused by the}} chemical reaction of hydrogen with <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides</b> forming cavities filled with high pressure methane. The micromechanisms described are the grain boundary cavitation and the dislocation creep of the grains. The CDR is based on two extreme cavitation rate distribution modes. In the first mode, the cavitation rate along the facets is uniform, resulting in a hydrostatic dilatation while the creep deformations remain relatively small. In the second mode, cavitation proceeds predominantly on grain boundary facets transverse to the principal macroscopic stress. This part of the CDR builds on constituitive relation for intergranular creep rupture where the facet cavitation is constrained by creep of the surrounding grains. The mode corresponding to the highest cavitation rate is the active mode. The two-dimensional version of the CDR is verified against detailed finite element analyses of hydrogen attack in planar polycrystalline aggregates. Finally, the generalization to a three-dimensional CDR is discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Power plant {{components}} {{are expected to}} withstand service at high temperature and pressure for thirty years or more. One of the main failure mechanisms under these conditions is creep. The steel compositions and heat treatments for this application are chosen to confer microstructural stability and creep resistance. Nevertheless, gradual microstructural changes, which eventually degrade the creep properties, occur during the long service life. Conservative design lives are used in power plant, and it is often found that components can be used safely beyond the original design life. However, to bene t from this requires reliable monitoring methods. One such technique involves relating the microstructural state to measurable magnetic properties. Magnetic domain walls interact energetically with microstructural features such as <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries,</b> <b>carbides</b> and dislocations, and are `pinned' in place at these sites until a su ciently large eld is applied to free them. When this occurs, the sudden change in magnetisation as the walls move can be detected as a voltage signal (Barkhausen noise). Previous work has suggested that <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> and <b>carbide</b> particles in power plant steels act as pinning sites with characteristic strengths and strength distributions. In this study, the concept of pinning site strength distributions was used to develop {{a model for the}} variation of the Barkhausen noise signal with applied eld. This gave a good t to published data. The modelling parameters characterising pinning site strengths showed good correlations with grain and carbide particle sizes. New Barkhausen noise data were obtained from tempered power plant steel samples for further model testing. The Orientation Imaging Microscopy (OIM) technique was used to investigate the grain orientations and <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> properties in the steel and their possible role in Barkhausen noise behaviour. The model again tted the data well, and a clear relationship could be seen between the pinning strength parameter and the severity of tempering (as expressed by the Larson-Miller tempering parameter) to which the steel was subjected. The experimental results suggest that the Barkhausen noise characteristics of the steels investigated depend strongly on the strain at <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries.</b> As tempering progresses and the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> dislocation density falls, the pinning strength of the <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> also decreases. A clear di erence in Barkhausen noise response could be seen between a 21 4 Cr 1 Mo traditional power-plant steel and an 11 Cr 1 Mo steel designed for superior heat resistance. A study of an oxide dispersion strengthened ferrous alloy, in which the microstructure undergoes dramatic coarsening on recrystallisation, was used to investigate further the e ects of <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> and particles on Barkhausen noise.

Thermodynamic calculations were performed to add confidence in phase identification as well as understanding {{of the evolution of}} the microstructure with temperature. Ti(C,N) banding was found in all materials. Bands with few large Ti(C,N) precipitates had negligible effect on the microstructure, whereas bands consisting of numerous small precipitates were associated with locally finer grains and coarser M 23 C 6 <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides.</b> The Ti(C,N) remained unaffected in the HAZ while the M 23 C 6 carbides were fully dissolved close to the fusion line. Cold deformed solution annealed Alloy 690 is believed to be a better representation of this region than cold deformed TT Alloy 690. QC 20140930 </p...|$|E
40|$|Thermomechanical Fatigue (TMF) {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} Mar-M 200, B- 1900, and PWA- 1480 (single crystals) over temperature ranges representative of gas turbine airfoil environments. The results were examined from both a phenomenological basis and a micromechanical basis. Depending on constituents present in the superalloy system, certain micromechanisms dominated the crack initiation process and significantly influenced the TMF lives as well as sensitivity of the material to the type TMF cycle imposed. For instance, high temperature cracking around <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides</b> in Mar-M 200 resulted in short in-phase TMF lives compared to either out-of-phase or isothermal lives. In single crystal PWA- 1480, the type of coating applied was seen to be the controlling factor in determining sensitivity {{to the type of}} TMF cycle imposed. Micromechanisms of deformation were observed over the temperature range of interest to the TMF cycles, and provided some insight as to the differences between TMF damage mechanisms and isothermal damage mechanisms. Finally, the applicability of various life prediction models to TMF results was reviewed. Current life prediction models based on isothermal data must be modified before being generally applied to TMF...|$|E
40|$|The Hot Section Technology (HOST) program, creep {{fatigue life}} {{prediction}} for engine hot section materials (isotropic), is reviewed. The program {{is aimed at}} improving the high temperature crack initiation life prediction technology for gas turbine hot section components. Significant results include: (1) cast B 1900 and wrought IN 718 selected as the base and alternative materials respectively; (2) fatigue test specimens indicated that measurable surface cracks appear early in the specimen lives, i. e., 15 % of total life at 871 C and 50 % of life at 538 c; (3) observed crack initiation sites are all surface initiated and are associated with either <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>carbides</b> or local porosity, transgrannular cracking is observed at the initiation site for all conditions tested; and (4) an initial evaluation of two life prediction models, representative of macroscopic (Coffin-Mason) and more microscopic (damage rate) approaches, was conducted using limited data generated at 871 C and 538 C. It is found that the microscopic approach provides a more accurate regression of the data used to determine crack initiation model constants, but overpredicts the effect of strain rate on crack initiation life for the conditions tested...|$|E

The kinetics of these cellular precipitation reactions {{are of interest}} since the resulting microstructures give undesirable properties. Detailed kinetic studies of these reactions were undertaken in U-Nb alloys isothermally transformed over a wide span of time and temperature. The volume fractions, growth rates, interlamellar spacings, and phase compositions of the discontinuous precipitation {{as well as the}} succeeding discontinuous coarsening reactions were measured. These results will be compared with theories of cellular growth. The added effects of non-steady-state growth, diverging lamellae, and the effect of nucleation site (<b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> vs. <b>carbide</b> inclusions) will be highlighted. N...|$|R
40|$|The {{wettability}} {{of tungsten}} carbide by liquid binders with various carbon contents and infiltration of WC-WC <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> in cemented <b>carbide</b> by such binders were examined. The wettability of tungsten carbide by the liquid Co-based binder is complete at low carbon contents and becomes incomplete when increasing the carbon content. The wettability of WC by the Co-based binder alloy saturated with carbon is relatively poor with a wetting angle of about 15 °. The well-known phenomenon of Co migration from carbide regions with high carbon contents into regions with low carbon contents is presumably caused mainly by {{the variance in}} capillary forces related to the different wettability rates of WC by liquid binders with various carbon contents. The Co-based binders with various carbon contents are found to have different behaviors with respect to infiltrating WC-WC <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> in cemented <b>carbides</b> during sintering. WC-WC interfaces in a cemented carbide sample with a high carbon content do not comprise nm-thick Co interlayers. In contrast to that, {{the majority of the}} WC-WC interfaces in a cemented carbide sample with a low carbon content comprise continuous Co interlayers of the order of at least several nanometers in thickness...|$|R
