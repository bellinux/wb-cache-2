5000|$|HIMR is hybrid vehicle. Induction {{motor and}} {{batteries}} equipped in car. When vehicle start, motor assist engine, and braking, motor operating as <b>electric</b> <b>retarder,</b> and accumlate energy to battery.|$|E
50|$|Another braking {{feature of}} semi-trucks is engine braking, {{which could be}} either a {{compression}} brake (usually shortened to Jake brake) or exhaust brake or combination of both. However, the use of compression brake alone produces a loud and distinctive noise, and to control noise pollution, some local municipalities have prohibited or restricted the use of engine brake systems inside their jurisdictions, particularly in residential areas. The advantage to using engine braking instead of conventional brakes is that a truck can descend a long grade without overheating its wheel brakes. Some vehicles can also be equipped with hydraulic or <b>electric</b> <b>retarders</b> which have an advantage of near silent operation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>retarders</b> use {{electromagnetic}} induction {{to provide a}} retardation force. An electric retardation unit can be placed on an axle, transmission, or driveline and consists of a rotor attached to the axle, transmission, or driveline—and a stator securely attached to the vehicle chassis. There are no contact surfaces between the rotor and stator, and no working fluid. When retardation is required, the electrical windings in the stator receive power from the vehicle battery, producing a magnetic field through which the rotor moves. This induces eddy currents in the rotor, which produces an opposing magnetic field to the stator. The opposing magnetic fields slows the rotor, and hence the axle, transmission or driveshaft {{to which it is}} attached. The rotor incorporates internal vanes (like a ventilated brake disk) to provide its own air cooling, so no load is placed on the vehicle's engine cooling system. The operation of the system is extremely quiet.|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} of Wind Powered Thermal Energy Systems (WTES) to provide dispatchable energy from an intermittent, renewable resource makes them highly attractive to replace fossil fired {{electricity and heat}} generators {{in all areas of}} an energy system. The presented study for the workshop emphasizes two topics. On the one hand it aims to give a complete overview of theoretical concepts that can be referred to as WTES for supply of both heat and electricity. Therefore, it considers possible advantages and drawbacks from an overall system’s point of view. On the other hand a techno-economic analysis based on the estimation of levelized costs of heat supply for room heating is carried out. The novelty of this study is the comparison of five specific WTES concepts, which either make use of <b>electric</b> boilers, hydro-dynamic <b>retarders</b> or heat pumps. Furthermore, in order to consider economies of scale three different system sizes are analysed ranging from the application of a small single wind turbine to WTES consisting of a wind park with rated power of several megawatts. The aim of this investigation is to identify regions where certain WTES are commercially interesting compared to traditional heating technologies. First results only taking into account the costs of wind energy converter and heat generation unit indicate the necessity of energy transport within WTES {{to be included in the}} techno-economic analysis...|$|R
