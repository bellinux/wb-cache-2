5|$|Many critics {{compared}} Nuka-World to {{a previous}} expansion pack for Fallout 4 named Far Harbor. Dan Stapleton (IGN) {{said that when}} compared to Far Harbor, the role-playing elements are far less developed, though he also said Nuka-World has a nice setting filled with surprises and battles. Nicholas Tan (Game Revolution) also believed {{it was one of}} the better expansion packs, albeit not <b>having</b> <b>such</b> an in-depth a story-line as Far Harbor. Paul Tassi (Forbes) preferred Far Harbor due to this expansion being light on story.|$|E
5|$|Many {{ethnic groups}} {{have never been}} {{represented}} on the Court. There {{has never been a}} Justice with any Asian, Native American, or Pacific Islander heritage, and no person <b>having</b> <b>such</b> a heritage was publicly considered for an appointment until the 21st century. Legal scholar Viet D. Dinh, of Vietnamese descent, was named as a potential George W. Bush nominee. During the presidency of Barack Obama, potential nominees have included Harold Hongju Koh, of Korean descent, and former Idaho attorney general Larry Echo Hawk, a member of the Pawnee tribe.|$|E

5|$|Many riders {{were named}} as contenders, {{including}} Ivan Basso, Levi Leipheimer, Armstrong, Damiano Cunego, Carlos Sastre, Gilberto Simoni, Danilo Di Luca, Marzio Bruseghin, and Denis Menchov. Before his collarbone injury, Armstrong {{was considered an}} overall favorite, {{and it was also}} noted that three time trials, including the insertion of an unusually long time trial mid-race, might favor him. Pre-race analysis noted that Armstrong, when on his best form, would be a rider very likely to gain from <b>having</b> <b>such</b> a long race against the clock included in the Giro.|$|E
5|$|Numerous mixed lead(II,IV) oxides are known. When PbO2 {{is heated}} in air, it becomes Pb12O19 at 293°C, Pb12O17 at 351°C, Pb3O4 at 374°C, and finally PbO at 605°C.

5|$|President James Monroe and Congress invited Lafayette {{to visit}} the United States in 1824, in part to {{celebrate}} the nation's upcoming 50thanniversary. Monroe intended to have Lafayette travel on an American warship, but the general felt <b>having</b> <b>such</b> a vessel as transport was undemocratic, and booked passage on a merchantman. LouisXVIII did not approve of the trip, and his officers had troops disperse the crowd that gathered at Le Havre to see Lafayette off.|$|E

5|$|In {{the remains}} of a small cabin in the bow of the ship and in a few other {{locations}} around the wreck was found the earliest dated set of navigation instruments in Europe found so far: compasses, divider calipers, a stick used for charting, protractors, sounding leads, tide calculators and a logreel, an instrument for calculating speed. Several of these objects are not only unique in <b>having</b> <b>such</b> an early, definite dating, but also because they pre-date written records of their use; protractors would have reasonably been used to measure bearings and courses on maps, but sea charts are not known to have been used by English navigators {{during the first half of}} the 16th century, compasses were not depicted on English ships until the 1560s, and the first mention of a logreel is from 1574.|$|E
5|$|On DS9, Sisko informs Nog that he {{will not}} give him a {{recommendation}} as he has concerns that it is a scheme. Nog confesses that he wants to do it so that he doesn't turn out like his father Rom (Max Grodénchik), whom he describes as an engineering genius but his culture won't let him pursue it. Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi <b>having</b> <b>such</b> upstanding ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy. Odo is suspicious of Kira's responses and points a phaser at her, demanding to know who she is. Kira and the crystal suddenly morph into the female Founder (Salome Jens), who reveals that she stole the Maquis ship and she was hoping to convince Odo to return to the Dominion. She reveals the location of the real Kira and transports away. Odo finds Kira and tells her of the Founder, but not of his feelings for her.|$|E
5|$|Winehouse's {{battles with}} {{substance}} abuse were {{the subject of much}} media attention. In 2005, she went through a period of drinking, heavy drug use, and weight loss. People who saw her during the end of that year and early 2006 reported a rebound that coincided with the writing of Back to Black. Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction. In August 2007, Winehouse cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health. She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol. In various interviews, she admitted to <b>having</b> <b>such</b> problems with self-harm, depression, and eating disorders.|$|E

5|$|Development on Crash: Mind over Mutant began {{immediately}} {{after the completion of}} Crash of the Titans. The idea of preserving a titan for later use came from the play testing sessions of Crash of the Titans, in which the testers were found to be reluctant to leave the titans behind after an epic battle was won. Fans of the series were also a source of inspiration for Crash: Mind over Mutant, <b>having</b> <b>such</b> wishes as a free-roaming environment, Coco Bandicoot being a playable character and the return of the character Doctor Nitrus Brio. Full camera control was considered for the game, but was rejected for graphical reasons and to avoid having to insert a split-screen view in the cooperation mode. Online gameplay was also considered as a feature in the finished game, but was omitted due to the brief development schedule. Coco Bandicoot as a playable character was omitted from the PlayStation 2 version of the game due to her distinct animations taking up much of the console's memory. The Wii version of Crash: Mind over Mutant was created first, with the graphics scaled up for the Xbox 360, and scaled down for the PlayStation 2. A PlayStation 3 version of the game was rumored, but was promptly debunked by Radical Entertainment as a mistake on many press sites' behalf.|$|E
