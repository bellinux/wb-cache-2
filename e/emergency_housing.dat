It was also used for a while for <b>emergency</b> <b>housing</b> for demobilised servicemen and their families. In 1959, the parade ground {{was used as a}} coal store during a miners' strike. Thurrock Urban District Council (now Thurrock Council) purchased the fort in 1962 and still own it. The council turned the area around the fort into a riverside park but the building itself decayed badly through neglect and vandalism.|$|E
5|$|A {{catastrophic flood}} in March 1913, {{known as the}} Great Dayton Flood, led to the {{creation}} of the Miami Conservancy District, a series of dams and hydraulic jumps installed around Dayton, in 1914. Like other cities across the country, Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II. Several locations around the city hosted the Dayton Project, a branch of the larger Manhattan Project, to develop polonium triggers used in early atomic bombs. The war efforts led to a manufacturing boom throughout the city, including high demand for housing and other services. At one point, <b>emergency</b> <b>housing</b> was put into place due to a housing shortage in the region, much of which is still in use today.|$|E

In Veracruz, only 9helicopters were utilized to distribute food and water to isolated areas. About 948tons of medicine was also distributed. Helicopters assisted in transporting people to shelters. In Veracruz alone, 34people were rescued by boat and 1,131 by aircraft. In Puebla and Veracruz, 9,551troops were stationed to assist in relief work, utilizing 48helicopters, 4Hercules planes, and 10boats. Between Veracruz and Hidalgo, the Department of Social Development distributed about 18,500mattresses and other relief items. Workers quickly made repairs to highways, and by October19, all of the 28damaged federal highways were provisionally reopened; some of the reopened highways had to undergo additional construction work. The military worked to reopen other roads. In Veracruz, the Director of the Federal Electricity Commission noted that repairs to electrical systems were difficult {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the floods. Planes flew generators into Gutiérrez Zamora, Veracruz, mainly for hospitals, and by October20, 90% of the affected areas had their power restored. President Zedillo announced on October11 that the government would begin building new houses, part of the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Housing</b> Program initiative. In Puebla, the initial stages of the program would involve rebuilding 1,200houses and moving 500houses to safer lands. The Mexican government estimated that the housing program would help 37,000families. Mexico's agricultural ministry provided assistance for farmers to replant lost crops. Through the Temporary Employment Program, the federal government temporarily hired about 1million people who lost their homes or farms. Students gradually returned to school after repairs were made, and by October28, over 800,000students who were affected were able to return to school, including all of Oaxaca and Hidalgo. The area in Teziutlán, Puebla affected by the mudslide was never rebuilt, due to being labeled a high-risk area.|$|E

2500|$|In 1953, the Shek Kip Mei fire left 53,000 homeless.

2500|$|During World War II, many {{government}} facilities {{were used for}} military purposes, and the island airport became a military training base. In 1940, the Norwegian Government in-exile made arrangements to use the island airport as a training facility for the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNAF), using airplanes ordered from the United States prior to war breaking out. The facility was named [...] "Little Norway". Barracks were built nearby on the mainland {{at the foot of}} Bathurst Street. In 1943, the Norwegians moved to an existing camp at Muskoka, Ontario for their training. The barracks became <b>emergency</b> <b>housing</b> after the war, and were eventually demolished in 1957. The nearby 'Little Norway Park' is named in remembrance of the Norwegian community around the airport. The airport was turned over to the Royal Canadian Air Force {{for the duration of the}} war. It was the headquarters for No. 1 Training Command, training pilots on Harvard trainers. It was also used by 124 Ferry Squadron as a waypoint for transporting planes around the country.|$|E
2500|$|On November 30, 1941, {{just eight}} {{days prior to}} the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor {{and the start of}} direct United States {{involvement}} in the Second World War, tenants of the last mutual ownership project (Winfield Park, New Jersey) began to move into their new homes. The outbreak of war ignited the smoldering debate over permanent vs. temporary housing for the defense workers. Early shortages of materials, equipment and manpower for construction, along with the early retreat of the allied forces on all fronts, added support to the argument that <b>emergency</b> <b>housing</b> should be only of temporary nature, and not built in support of long-term postwar goals. The construction of temporary housing quickly became the program's emphasis. But the mutual housing program was based on long-term financial planning for the construction of permanent housing, and could not function with this new temporary construction emphasis. [...] Support for centralizing the defense housing effort was also increasing, and resulted in the February 24, 1942 establishment of the National Housing Agency by Executive Order of the President. Those individuals sympathetic to centralization were not very supportive of experimental housing programs. Even prior to the formal outbreak of war, the entire defense housing program, under pressure from Congressional conservatives and industry officials, began to make a significant switch to private sector initiatives to get the defense housing job done. Supporters of this new direction strongly believed that private industry was far more efficient, and [...] "..could utilize a few lots here and a favorably located site there, wholly unsuitable for large-scale Government projects." [...] Congressional support of the private construction industry came in the legislative form of Title IV of the Lanham Act, passed in the Spring of 1941. This legislation provided 100% financing for speculative builders of housing for workers in defense areas. Obviously Title IV was meant to serve the same housing market as the mutual housing program. Evidence also suggests that the staff of the NHA was far more conservative than had been the staff of the FWA. This swing to the right was completed when 700 members of the consolidated staff were laid off; many of those leaving were among the most progressive, and many programs, including the mutual housing program, were officially ended. This newly consolidated agency moved quickly to develop programs that were especially supportive of private initiative programs for solving the defense housing need, and generally supportive of Title IV. [...] Colonel Lawrence Westbrook noted in 1945 testimony that the NHA had destroyed the mutual housing program even at a time when requests for expansion of the program were pouring in from across the nation. Although news of the mutual housing concept had spread quickly through the labor union network, and many committees had been organized by workers to aid the implementation of the plan locally, all committees had to be told that the program was experimental in nature and no more staff could be made available to work with them.|$|E
