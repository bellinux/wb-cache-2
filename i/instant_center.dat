50|$|A {{component}} of the tire's force vector points from the contact patch of the tire through <b>instant</b> <b>center.</b> The larger this component is, the less suspension motion will occur. Theoretically, if the resultant of the vertical load on the tire and the lateral force generated by it points directly into the <b>instant</b> <b>center,</b> the suspension links will not move. In this case, all weight transfer at that end of the vehicle will be geometric in nature. This is key information used in finding the force-based roll center as well.|$|E
40|$|In a planar mechanism, the {{position}} of the <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> reveals important pieces of information about its static and kinematic behaviors. Such pieces of information are useful for designing the mechanism. Unfortunately, when the mechanism architecture becomes complex, common methods to locate the <b>instant</b> <b>centers,</b> which are based on the direct application of the Aronold–Kennedy theorem, fail. Indeterminate linkages are single-degree-of-freedom (single-dof) planar linkages where the secondary <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> cannot be found by direct application of the Aronold–Kennedy theorem. This paper presents an analytical method to locate all the <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> of any single-dof planar mechanism, which, in particular, succeeds in determining the <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> of indeterminate linkages. In order to illustrate the proposed method, it will be applied to locate the secondary <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> of the double butterfly linkage and of the single flier eight-bar linkage...|$|R
40|$|The <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> of {{velocity}} (ICs) of most planar mechanisms can {{be determined}} as {{the intersection of the}} lines of centers, also known as Aronhold–Kennedy lines, along which the ICs of three distinct links in relative motion are located. It is shown how these intersections can be kept track of in matrix form, very suitable to algorithmic implementation on a computer. Solving for the coordinates of the actual <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> can be also cast in matrix form. Moreover, the singularity and force transmissivity of the mechanism are reflected in the condition numbers of these matrices and the degree of dispersion of the secondary <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> i. e., the <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> that cannot be found by inspection...|$|R
50|$|In {{this respect}} the <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> are more {{important}} to the handling of the vehicle than the kinematic roll center alone, in that the ratio of geometric to elastic weight transfer is determined by the forces at the tires and their directions in relation to the position of their respective <b>instant</b> <b>centers.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{a spatial}} {{displacement}} specializes to a planar displacement, the screw axis becomes the displacement pole, and the instantaneous screw axis becomes the velocity pole, or instantaneous center of rotation, also called an <b>instant</b> <b>center.</b> The term centro {{is also used}} for a velocity pole, and the locus of these points for a planar movement is called a centrode.|$|E
5000|$|The {{location}} of the geometric roll center is solely dictated by the suspension geometry, {{and can be found}} using principles of the <b>instant</b> <b>center</b> of rotation. The SAE's definition of the force based roll center is, [...] "The point in the transverse vertical plane through any pair of wheel centers at which lateral forces may be applied to the sprung mass without producing suspension roll".|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the wheel and tire's motion is {{constrained}} by the suspension links on the vehicle, the motion of the wheel package in the front view will scribe an imaginary arc in space with an [...] "instantaneous center" [...] of rotation at any given point along its path. The <b>instant</b> <b>center</b> for any wheel package can be found by following imaginary lines drawn through the suspension links to their intersection point.|$|E

There {{are great}} differences in outward appearance, geometric shape, luffing performance between lemniscate type crane and ordinary double-link type crane. Lemniscate type crane has some advantages, i. e. lower centre of weight, practical and reasonable structure, strongly anti-wind and easy operation. Based on inverse design and theory of mechanism, <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> of velocity, luffing locus and moment of lemniscate type crane is studied and solved.

40|$|As the <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> in planar mechanisms, the {{instantaneous}} poles can be {{used for}} instantaneous kinematic analysis of spherical mechanisms. In this paper, a novel geometrical method is presented for isotropy analysis of spherical mechanisms via the concept of instantaneous poles. First, a different form of the Jacobian matrix is formulated for multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-DOF) spherical mechanisms, based on the instantaneous poles. Then, using the obtained Jacobian matrix, isotropy analysis of spherical mechanisms is carried out, and general conditions to have isotropic configurations are determined. The proposed method is fast and applicable for all types of spherical mechanisms. At last, two illustrative examples are presented to show the efficiency of the method...|$|R

Eight patients were studied {{on the basis}} of a sus-pected tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. Clinical evaluation consisted of a history and examination with special attention to the anterior drawer test, Lach-mann’s test, and the pivot shift test. Control knees chosen had a negative history of injury and a normal examination. Serial roentgenograms were obtained on all knees through a range of motion from 0 to 90 &deg; of flexion, at increments of 7 to 10 &deg;. Internal rotation and valgus stress were applied to duplicate the pivot shift maneu...|$|R
50|$|Roll {{center height}} {{is a product}} of {{suspension}} <b>instant</b> <b>center</b> heights and is a useful metric in analyzing weight transfer effects, body roll and front to rear roll stiffness distribution. Conventionally, roll stiffness distribution is tuned adjusting antiroll bars rather than roll center height (as both tend to have a similar effect on the sprung mass), but the height of the roll center is significant when considering the amount of jacking forces experienced.|$|E
50|$|Current {{methods of}} {{analyzing}} individual wheel instant centers have yielded more intuitive {{results of the}} effects of non-rolling weight transfer effects. This type of analysis is better known as the lateral-anti method. This is where one takes the individual <b>instant</b> <b>center</b> locations of each corner of the car and then calculates the resultant vertical reaction vector due to lateral force. This value then is taken into account in the calculation of a jacking force and lateral weight transfer. This method works particularly well in circumstances where there are asymmetries in left to right suspension geometry.|$|E
50|$|Consider a {{right angle}} moving rigidly so that one leg remains on the point P and the other leg is tangent to the curve. Then the vertex of this angle is X and traces out the pedal curve. As the angle moves, its {{direction}} of motion at P is parallel to PX and its direction of motion at R {{is parallel to the}} tangent T = RX. Therefore, the <b>instant</b> <b>center</b> of rotation is the intersection of the line perpendicular to PX at P and perpendicular to RX at R, and this point is Y. If follows that the tangent to the pedal at X is perpendicular to XY.|$|E

40|$|Many even complex {{machines}} employ single degree-of-freedom (single-dof) planar mechanisms. The instantaneous kinematics of planar mechanisms can {{be fully}} understood by analyzing where the <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> (ICs) {{of the relative}} motions among mechanism's links are located. ICs' positions depend only on the mechanism configuration in singledof planar mechanisms {{and a number of}} algorithms that compute their location have been proposed in the literature. Once ICs positions are known, they can be exploited, for instance, to determine the velocity coefficients (VCs) of the mechanism and the virtual work of the external forces applied to mechanism's links. Here, these and other ICs' properties are used to build a novel dynamic model and an algorithm that solves the dynamic problems of single-dof planar mechanisms. Then, the proposed model and algorithm are applied to a case study...|$|R
40|$|Instantaneous pole axes (IPAs) play, in sphericalmechanism kinematics, {{the same}} role as <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> in planar-mechanism kinematics. IPA-based {{techniques}} have not been proposed yet for the singularity analysis of spherical mechanisms, even though instant-center-based algorithms have been already presented for planar mechanisms’ singularity analysis. This paper addresses the singularity analysis of single-dof spherical mechanisms by exploiting the properties of pole axes. A general method for implementing this analysis is presented. The presented method relies {{on the possibility of}} giving geometric conditions for any type of singularity, and it is the spherical counterpart of an instantcenter- based algorithm previously proposed by the author for single-dof planar mechanisms. It can be used to generate systems of equations useful either for finding the singularities of a given mechanism or to synthesize mechanisms that have to match specific requirements about the singularities...|$|R
5000|$|Dental {{panoramic}} radiography equipment {{consists of a}} horizontal rotating arm which holds an X-ray source and a moving film mechanism (carrying a film) arranged at opposed extremities. The patient's skull sits between the X-ray generator and the film. The X-ray source is collimated toward the film, to give a beam shaped as a vertical blade having a width of 4-7mm [...] when arriving on the film, after crossing the patient's skull. Also the height of that beam covers the mandibles and the maxilla regions.

50|$|To {{determine}} {{the percentage of}} front suspension braking anti-dive for outboard brakes, {{it is first necessary}} to {{determine the}} tangent of the angle between a line drawn, in side view, through the front tire patch and the front suspension <b>instant</b> <b>center,</b> and the horizontal. In addition, the percentage of braking effort at the front wheels must be known. Then, multiply the tangent by the front wheel braking effort percentage and divide by the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. A value of 50% would mean that half of the weight transfer to the front wheels, during braking, is being transmitted through the front suspension linkage and half is being transmitted through the front suspension springs.|$|E
40|$|A six {{degree of}} freedom model was {{utilized}} to continuously measure the motions of loaded cadaveric human knees with unconstrained motion at the tibiofemoral joint through a range of motion from zero to 110 degrees of flexion. Several conditions were studied. Loading conditions were varied to simulate the natural body forces (i. e. the normal condition) and quadriceps-deficient condition. The range of motion in which the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the primary restraint to anterior tibial translation was determined. The effect of ACL insufficiency on the kinematics of the human knee was investigated by comparing the kinematics of the knee specimens in the intact state with the kinematics obtained after the ACL was surgically severed. To simplify the complex kinematics of a six {{degree of freedom}} model, {{the motion of the}} <b>instant</b> <b>center</b> of the tibiofemoral joint for each specimen was estimated using the femoral transepicondylar pin reference point. The estimated motion of the <b>instant</b> <b>center</b> of the knees in the intact state and ACL deficient state was compared to empirical observations. The importance of the motion of the <b>instant</b> <b>center</b> was then determined in pathologic knee motion. Finally, the effect of total knee replacement on kinematics was investigated. NANAU. S.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{software}} package for computational simulation of single particle motion {{in the presence of}} static external electric and magnetic fields. This seemingly simple problem is in fact very complicated one. Namely, while analytic formulations of this problem are unambiguous, {{it is very difficult to}} predict even qualitatively a charged particle trajectory for an arbitrary combination of field parameters, except in simplified cases. Instead, one might perform a single particle motion simulation. Our software package represents a unique tool for this problem. A special new feature of our approach is constructing the <b>instant</b> Larmor <b>Center</b> Trajectory. For the case of slowly changing fields, the Larmor center trajectory reduces to the less general guiding center trajectory approximation. The possibilities for further investigating these two approaches by using our software might be of great interest for both educational and engineering purposes, especially in the areas of gaseous electronics and laboratory, fusion and space plasmas...|$|R

40|$|AtsTjc’r: The long fibers of the {{superficial}} medial collateral ligament {{are the primary}} stabilizers of the medial side of the knee against valgus and rotatory stress. The long fibers as a functional unit have a complex pattern in which the anteriormost fibers tighten as the knee flexes from the position of extension; simultaneously, the fibers just posterior to them slacken. The long fibers arise from a critical point on the medial femoral condyle relative to the <b>instant</b> <b>centers</b> of rotation such that the an-tenor border is kept under tension from full extension to 90 degrees of flexion. This may be of fundamental importance for surgical reconstruction of torn medial liga-ments. The ligaments responsible for medial stability of the knee have been studied at length by numerous authors 13. 6, 8. 9. 12, 15. 17, 18 Palmer, Steindler, Brantigan and Voshell 2. 3, and others have discussed the importance of {{the superficial}} medial ligament as a check against external rotation of the tibia and medial opening of the joint. These investigators, how-ever, did not elaborate on the possible supporting role of the deep portion of the medial ligament. In current thinking the medial ligament usually is considered as having three func-tional units. The first of these is the superficial medial ligament, the anterior border of which in this study will be referred to as the long fibers. The second portion {{is referred to as the}} deep medial ligament (meniscofemoral and meniscotibial ligaments, or the so-called middle capsular ligament of Slocum and Larson). The third portion consists of the posterior oblique fibers which blend into the posterior capsule of the joint. In recent years, Kennedy and Fowler and Slocum and Larson have directed attention to the deep portion of the ligament. They consider it fundamental in preventing excessive external rotation of the tibia. It was the purpose of this study to test the hypothesis that the deep portion of the medial ligament acts as the prime stabilizer against external rotatory and valgus stresses. In addition, the long fibers of the superficial ligament were studied and their function clarified...|$|R

50|$|The {{collimation}} of {{the machine}} means that, while rotating, the X-rays project only a limited portion of the anatomy onto the film at any given instant but, as the rotation progresses around the skull, a composite picture of the maxillo-facial block is created. While the arm rotates, the film moves in a such way that the projected partial skull image (limited by the beam section) scrolls over it and exposes it entirely. Not all of the overlapping individual images projected on the film have the same magnification because the beam is divergent and the images have differing focus points. Also not all the element images move with the same velocity on the target film as {{some of them are}} more distant from and others closer to the <b>instant</b> rotation <b>center.</b> The velocity of the film is controlled in such fashion to fit exactly the velocity of projection of the anatomical elements of the dental arch side which is closest to the film. Therefore, they are recorded sharply while the elements in different places are recorded blurred as they scroll at different velocity.|$|R

Maximum isometric ex-tensor torques were measured at 90 and 30 degrees of knee flexion while the distance from the knee joint to the resisting force was varied.

In spite of that, during that short period the gymnasts obtained, thanks to the vertical reactionimpulse they elicited from the bar, as large an increase as 0. 15 min the peak height of theCMduring flight. Thishighlights the important role of the actions performed in the instants immediately preceding release. If release hadoccurred 62 ms esarlier, in the instant of maximum Vy, the gymnasts' angular momentum would have beenhigher, allowing a faster rotation velocity.
