5|$|U.S. President Herbert Hoover {{signed the}} Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act into law on June 17, 1930. The tariff's {{aim was to}} protect {{agriculture}} in the United States, but congressional representatives ultimately raised tariffs {{on a host of}} manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as 53% on over a thousand various goods. Twenty-five trading partners responded in kind by introducing new tariffs {{on a wide range of}} U.S. goods. Hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the Republican Party's 1928 platform, which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market pressures on the nation's struggling agribusinesses and reduce the domestic unemployment rate. The culmination of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression heightened fears, further pressuring Hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of Henry Ford and over 1,000 economists who protested by calling for a veto of the act. Exports from the United States plummeted 60% from 1930 to 1933. Worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt. The international ramifications of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, comprising protectionist and discriminatory trade policies and bouts of <b>economic</b> <b>nationalism,</b> are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression.|$|E

There are many possible traits that could contribute to a group’s success, such as technological development, social and political organization, <b>economic</b> development, <b>nationalism,</b> etc. According to Joseph Soltis, it would take 500-1000 years for group selection to happen this way.|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} dictatorship lasted for almost twenty-one years; despite initial pledges to the contrary, military governments in 1967 enacted a new, restrictive Constitution, and stifled {{freedom of speech}} and political opposition with support from the U.S. government.

25|$|Traditionally, it {{had been}} the Liberal Party that held a continentalist {{position}} and the Conservatives who opposed free trade with the United States in favour of economic links with Britain.

It was with this background that Mulroney fought and won the 1988 election {{on the issue of the}} Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement.|$|E
25|$|According to {{international}} relations scholar Michael Foley, paleoconservatives press for restrictions on immigration, a rollback of multicultural programmes, the decentralization {{of the federal}} policy, the restoration of controls upon free trade, a greater emphasis upon <b>economic</b> <b>nationalism</b> and non-interventionism {{in the conduct of}} American foreign policy, and a generally revanchist outlook upon a social order in need of recovering old lines of distinction and in particular the assignment of roles in accordance with traditional categories of gender, ethnicity, and race. Practitioners of this philosophy identify themselves as the legitimate heirs to the American conservative tradition.|$|E
25|$|From the 1830s to 1860, Congress {{repeatedly}} rejected Whig {{calls for}} higher tariffs, and its policies of <b>economic</b> <b>nationalism,</b> which included increased state control, regulation and macroeconomic development of infrastructure.

Proposals to fund massive western railroad projects, or to give free land to homesteaders, were defeated by Southerners afraid these policies would strengthen the North.

50|$|The Civil War has {{generated}} {{an unusually large}} historiography. In terms of controversy, historians have long debated {{the causes of the}} war, and the relative importance given to nationalism and sectionalism, slavery, and <b>economic</b> issues. <b>Nationalism</b> dominated historiography from the late 19th century and the 1920s, especially as reflected in the work of James Ford Rhodes. In the 1920s, the Beardian school Identified an inevitable conflict between the plantation-based South and the industrial Northeast. When the agrarian Midwest sided with the Northeast, war resulted. In the 1930s, numerous arguments were made that the war was not inevitable, that was caused by a failure of the political system to reach a compromise.|$|R

25|$|From the 1920s Ireland {{had high}} trade {{barriers}} {{such as high}} tariffs, particularly during the Economic War with Britain in the 1930s, and a policy of import substitution. During the 1950s, 400,000 people emigrated from Ireland. It became increasingly clear that <b>economic</b> <b>nationalism</b> was unsustainable. While other European countries enjoyed fast growth, Ireland suffered economic stagnation. The policy changes were drawn together in Economic Development, an official paper published in 1958 that advocated free trade, foreign investment, and growth rather than fiscal restraint as the prime objective of economic management.|$|E
25|$|The MacAdam Shield-Shovel {{currently}} {{stands in}} Canadian First World War historiography as an invention which was poorly conceived given that its intended purpose was never fully realized. One historian {{is of the}} opinion that the MacAdam Shield Shovel must be recognized for what he feels it represents: a serious attempt to improve the well-being of Canadian troops. Others feel the device is simply indicative of Sir Sam Hughes' greed and arrogance who often put his own well-being ahead that of his troops. It is also an illustration of the <b>economic</b> <b>nationalism</b> whereby locally developed technologies were ardently believed by their proponents inherently superior because they were products of the country.|$|E
25|$|After the 1873 depression, {{agricultural}} and industrial groups lobbied for protective tariffs. The 1879 tariffs protected these interests, stimulated economic revival through state intervention and refurbished {{political support for}} the conservative politicians Bismarck and John A. Macdonald (the Canadian prime minister). Chancellor Bismarck gradually veered away from classical liberal economic policies in the 1870s, embracing many conservative and progressive policies, including high tariffs, nationalization of railroads, and compulsory social insurance. This political and <b>economic</b> <b>nationalism</b> also reduced {{the fortunes of the}} German and Canadian classical liberal parties. France, like Britain, also entered into a prolonged stagnation that extended to 1897. The French also attempted to deal with their economic problems through the implementation of tariffs. New French laws in 1880 and in 1892 imposed stiff tariffs on many {{agricultural and}} industrial imports, an attempt at protectionism. The U.S., still in the period after the Civil War, continued to be very protectionist.|$|E

25|$|In Poland itself, {{however, the}} Polish Socialist Party is {{considered}} 'pro-independence, patriotic left-wing' (in {{contrast with the}} internationalist left-wing) rather than left-wing nationalist. The term nationalism is used nearly exclusively for the right-wing national democracy of Roman Dmowski, and other officially far-right movements such as National Radical Camp and National Revival of Poland. Nowadays, notable parties and organizations that come the closest {{to the idea of}} a 'left-wing nationalism' are Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, under the leadership of Andrzej Lepper, and Zmiana led by Mateusz Piskorski. Both advocate patriotism (at times even nationalism), social conservatism, euroscepticism, anti-imperialism (strong criticism of a NATO and US foreign policies), and <b>economic</b> <b>nationalism.</b> The Self-Defence won 53 seats out of 460 in 2001 elections, and 56 in 2005.

Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver.

By focusing on the changes in China’s elite discourse during the reform period and particularly during the last decade, this paper aims to elaborate on the relative importance of various sources of legitimacy as they shift over time, as well as on their inherent dilemmas and limitations. There is evidence of an agile, responsive, and creative party effort to relegitimate the postrevolutionary regime through <b>economic</b> performance, <b>nationalism,</b> ideology, culture, governance, and democracy. At the same time, the paper identifies a clear shift in emphasis from an earlier economic-nationalistic approach to a more ideological-institutional approach. regime legitimacy, China, Chinese Communist Party, performance, nationalism, ideology, culturalism, governance, democracy...|$|R
40|$|Assessing the {{transformation}} of Russian nationalist discourse in the 21 st century Russian nationalism, previously dominated by ‘imperial’ tendencies – pride in a large, strong and multi-ethnic state able to project its influence abroad – is increasingly focused on ethnic issues. This new ethno-nationalism has come in various guises, like racism and xenophobia, but also in a new intellectual movement of ‘national democracy’ deliberately seeking to emulate conservative West European nationalism. Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent violent conflict in Eastern Ukraine utterly transformed the nationalist discourse in Russia. This book provides an up-to-date survey of Russian nationalism as a political, social and intellectual phenomenon by leading Western and Russian {{experts in the field}} of nationalism studies.

2500|$|Starting before Confederation in 1867 {{the debate}} between free trade and {{protectionism}} was a defining issue in Canadian politics.

This issue dominated Canadian politics during the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the Tories taking a populist, anti-free trade stance. Conservative leader Sir John A.

This rule targeted ethnic Chinese, who dominated both the rural and urban retail economy despite the fact that at this time few of them had Indonesian citizenship.

2500|$|In November 1991, Chrétien {{organised}} a party {{conference in}} Aylmer, Quebec where the Liberals formally disallowed {{most of the}} <b>economic</b> <b>nationalism</b> and protectionism of the Pearson-Trudeau years, and instead embraced globalization as the cure for the recession of the early 1990s. Reflecting the changed emphasis, at the Aylmer conference, the Liberals declared {{their support for the}} 1987 free trade agreement with the United States, which the party had famously promised to tear up if they won the 1988 election, and instead Mulroney was now denounced for not going far enough in opening up the economy by signing more free trade agreements with other nations. Reflecting the changed emphasis, Chrétien in a pointed symbolic move, had the outspoken pro-free trade Liberal Roy MacLaren sitting next to him on his right while the equally outspoken anti-free trade Liberal Lloyd Axworthy sat at some distance from Chrétien on his left. Delivering the keynote speech at the Aylmer conference, Chrétien came out firmly in support of globalization, stating that: [...] "Protectionism is not right wing or left wing. It is simply passé. Globalization is not right wing or left wing. It is simply a fact of life". Chrétien's biographer Lawrence Martin wrote that the Aylmer conference marked Chrétien's first real achievement as Liberal leader, as {{it was the first time}} that he put forward a positive vision for Canada, instead of automatically opposing everything that Mulroney was doing without offering a constructive alternative. In an interview with Martin, Chrétien called himself a centrist by inclination, and stated that Aylmer conference was the beginning of his efforts to bring the Grits to the political center.|$|E
