5|$|The priory's lands around Guisborough were {{a source}} of wealth for the Chaloners. Around 1595, Sir Thomas Chaloner's son, also called Thomas, {{established}} England's first alum works at Belman Bank south of the town. Alum was an important product {{with a variety of}} industrial uses. It was especially important to the cloth industry as a mordant (a substance used to fix dyes on cloth). The supply of alum was controlled by a cartel controlled by the Papal States and Spain which were in conflict with England and exercised a virtual monopoly on the provision of alum to Christian Europe, as the import of cheaper Turkish alum was banned by Pope Paul II in the mid-15th century. Chaloner visited the Pope's alum works at Tolfa near Rome and noticed the soil and vegetation around them resembled those of his estate at Guisborough. On his return he established alum works at Belman Bank with the aid of workmen smuggled from Rome, earning him a papal excommunication. <b>John</b> <b>Walker</b> Ord casts doubt on the story, noting an account published a few decades afterwards stated that the workmen came from France and does not mention Chaloner's travels in Italy.|$|E
