5|$|Full-speed (FS) rate of 12Mbit/s is {{the basic}} USB <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> defined by USB1.0. All USB hubs can operate at this speed.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} USB1.0 specification, {{which was}} introduced in January 1996, defined data transfer rates of 1.5Mbit/s Low Speed and 12Mbit/s Full Speed. Microsoft Windows 95, OSR 2.1 provided OEM support for the devices. The first widely used version of USB was 1.1, which was released in September 1998. The 12Mbit/s <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> was intended for higher-speed devices such as disk drives, and the lower 1.5Mbit/s rate for low <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> devices such as joysticks. Apple Inc.'s iMac was the first mainstream product with USB and the iMac's success popularized USB itself. Following Apple's design decision to remove all legacy ports from the iMac, many PC manufacturers began building legacy-free PCs, {{which led to the}} broader PC market using USB as a standard.|$|E
5|$|The {{theoretical}} maximum <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> in USB2.0 is 480Mbit/s (60MB/s) per controller and {{is shared}} amongst all attached devices. Some chipset manufacturers overcome this bottleneck by providing multiple USB2.0 controllers within the southbridge.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Current EDGE peak <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> of 300 kbps cannot {{cope with}} the <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> of 7. 2 Mbps {{provided}} by WCDMA/HSPA networks. Still, the enormous GSM/EDGE subscriber base motivates mobile operators to continue investing in network upgrades to provide higher <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> at minimum cost. EDGE Evolution, also standardized by 3 GPP, consists of a subset of features which allow to quadruple the downlink <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> compared to legacy EDGE performance. Introduction of new modulation schemes, e. g. 32 QAM and higher symbol <b>rate</b> will boost <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> up to 118. 4 kbps per timeslot.

40|$|The {{spectrum}} efficiency in a cellular radio system {{is affected by}} the <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> used in the system. High <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> may result in low {{spectrum efficiency}} if the frequency reuse is low. The spectrum efficiency may be enhanced by using adaptive modulation with carefully chosen <b>data</b> <b>rates.</b> We present an analytical method, based on a lower bound on the BER, for finding the best <b>data</b> <b>rates.</b> The method results in the best code rates to be used with QPSK, 8 -PSK, and 16 -QAM in an adaptive fashion.

5|$|At first, USB was {{considered}} a complement to IEEE 1394 (FireWire) technology, which {{was designed as a}} high-bandwidth serial bus that efficiently interconnects peripherals such as disk drives, audio interfaces, and video equipment. In the initial design, USB operated at a far lower <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> and used less sophisticated hardware. It was suitable for small peripherals such as keyboards and pointing devices.|$|E
5|$|When a USB {{device is}} first {{connected}} to a USB host, the USB device enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB device. The <b>data</b> <b>rate</b> of the USB device is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the device {{is supported by the}} host, the device drivers needed for communicating with the device are loaded and the device is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|E

30|$|Wideband code {{division}} multiple access (WCDMA) cellular networks use a CDMA scheme known as OVSF-CDMA [4] to support variable <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> by employing orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes. In an OVSF-CDMA-based system, each mobile station is assigned a single OVSF code. Variable <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> are supported by changing the spreading factor (SF). An alternative CDMA scheme known as multicode CDMA (MC-CDMA) [5] assigns multiple codes of the same spreading factor to a mobile station in order to achieve variable <b>data</b> <b>rates.</b> MC-CDMA requires multiple transceivers to support variable <b>data</b> <b>rates.</b> OVSF-CDMA reduces the hardware complexity of the mobile station because it requires only a single transceiver to support variable <b>data</b> <b>rates.</b> However, OVSF-CDMA suffers from the code blocking problem, as explained next.|$|R

This report assesses Australian consumers’ {{experience in}} using internet services, including download and upload <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> across major cities and regional areas, network availability and latency.

Deployment of HSDPA enables operators to offer broadband <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> to their customers.

Already two-branch receive diversity-based type- 3 receivers are entering the market to improve the delivery of <b>data</b> <b>rates.</b> The <b>data</b> <b>rates</b> delivered by type- 3 receivers can be further improved by adding inter-cell interference cancellation capability.
