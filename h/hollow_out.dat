5|$|Onions are {{commonly}} chopped {{and used as}} an ingredient in various hearty warm dishes, and may {{also be used as}} a main ingredient in their own right, for example in French onion soup or onion chutney. They are versatile and can be baked, boiled, braised, grilled, fried, roasted, sautéed, or eaten raw in salads. Their layered nature makes them easy to <b>hollow</b> <b>out</b> once cooked, facilitating stuffing them, as in sogan-dolma. Onions are a staple in Indian cuisine, used as a thickening agent for curries and gravies. Onions pickled in vinegar are eaten as a snack. These are traditionally a side serving in pubs and fish and chip shops throughout the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Pickled onions form part of a British pub ploughman's lunch, usually served with cheese and ale. In North America, sliced onions are battered, deep-fried, and served as onion rings.|$|E
25|$|The 8th liberated Halberstadt-Zwieberge, a subcamp of the Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp, between 12 and 17 April 1945 {{during its}} drive through central Germany. The {{area around the}} city of Halberstadt housed a number of Buchenwald subcamps that had been established in 1944 to provide labor for the German war effort, including Halberstadt-Zwieberge I and Halberstadt-Zwieberge II. More than 5,000 inmates were incarcerated in these two subcamps, where {{they were forced to}} <b>hollow</b> <b>out</b> massive tunnels and build underground factories for Junkers Aircraft of Aircraft Motors Construction Company, which produced military aircraft.|$|E
25|$|During puberty, androgen, LH and {{follicle}} stimulating hormone (FSH) production {{increase and}} the sex cords <b>hollow</b> <b>out,</b> forming the seminiferous tubules, and the germ cells start to differentiate into sperm. Throughout adulthood, androgens and FSH cooperatively act on Sertoli cells in the testes to support sperm production. Exogenous androgen supplements {{can be used as}} a male contraceptive. Elevated androgen levels caused by use of androgen supplements can inhibit production of LH and block production of endogenous androgens by Leydig cells. Without the locally high levels of androgens in testes due to androgen production by Leydig cells, the seminiferous tubules can degenerate, resulting in infertility. For this reason, many transdermal androgen patches are applied to the scrotum.|$|E

25|$|The Web of Caves, {{which is}} in black and white, sees Walliams and Putner as aliens (somewhat similar in {{appearance}} to Movellans) trying to persuade the Doctor (Gatiss) to defeat their schemes. The Walliams alien appears alone at first and outlines his scheme to <b>hollow</b> <b>out</b> {{the core of the}} Earth {{and replace it with a}} motor; the Doctor dismisses this plan, in a rather bored fashion, as having been done, and the alien suggests he will come back the next day with a new plan. The next day he returns, accompanied by the Putner alien, and proposes to drain the world's oceans into its core thus boiling them away; again the Doctor points out that it has been done, but decides he has to stop them. The two aliens and the Doctor agree on a time for their battle and the Doctor leaves in the TARDIS, only to have it rematerialise in the same spot, leaving the Doctor visibly annoyed. He disappears back into the TARDIS, only to have the Walliams alien obliviously comment on how nice the Doctor is.|$|E

At this panel Dirk began to work, till presently it slid aside, revealing a <b>hollow,</b> <b>out</b> of which he took a book bound in boards covered with leather. Then, having closed the panel, the two young men returned to the sitting-room, and placed the volume upon the oak table beneath the chandelier.|$|E

6000|$|... § VI. But to proceed. It will doubtless {{appear to}} the reader, that, even {{allowing}} {{for some of}} these permissible variations in the curve or slope of X, neither the form at b, nor any approximation to that form, would be sufficiently undercut to keep the rain from running back upon it. This is true; but we have to consider that the cornice, as the close of the wall's life, is of all its features that which is best fitted for honor and ornament. It has been esteemed so by almost all builders, and has been lavishly decorated in modes hereafter to be considered. But it is evident that, as it is high above the eye, the fittest place to receive the decoration is the slope of X, which is inclined towards the spectator; and if we cut away or <b>hollow</b> <b>out</b> this slope more than we have done at b, all decoration will be hid in the shadow. If, therefore, the climate be fine, and rain of long continuance not to be dreaded, we shall not hollow the stone X further, adopting the curve at b merely as the most protective in our power. But if the climate be one in which rain is frequent and dangerous, as in alternations with frost, we may be compelled to consider the cornice in a character distinctly protective, and to <b>hollow</b> <b>out</b> X farther, so as to enable it thoroughly to accomplish its purpose. A cornice thus treated loses its character as the crown or honor of the wall, takes the office of its protector, and is called a DRIPSTONE. The dripstone is naturally the attribute of Northern buildings, and therefore especially of Gothic architecture; the true cornice is the attribute of Southern buildings, and therefore of Greek and Italian architecture; and it is one of their peculiar beauties, and eminent features of superiority.|$|E
