Such technical properties allow determining the precise tilt response to Earth tides. The tidal tilt models obtained show an important influence from ocean tides. Thus, the estimated amplitude for the main harmonic constituents is of some 4 - 5 times larger than values measured at continental stations.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{characterize}} the deformation of a natural cave induced by temperature varia-tions and by the underground water flow. We consider the tilt recorded by two <b>horizontal</b> <b>pendulums</b> installed in the largest cave of the Italian Karst, the Grotta Gigante. The environmental factors we consider are temperature, rainfall and level and flow rate of the river Reka that feeds the underground Karstic waters. The tilt and temperature have a regular annual cycle, with period of 365 days, which is caused primarily by the thermo-elastic deformation. Semiannual periods are present but more than 10 times smaller. For rainfall and river level the semi-annual and annual oscillation have comparable am-plitudes. The effect induced by the underground water flow consists in a tilting towards SW, that has a linear relation between maximum tilting and the integrated amount of water entering the Karst during the flood, with tilting coefficient a = 10. 7 10 - 6 nrad/m 3.

Tidal measurements at Erie, Colorado, have larger, possibly nonrandom variability that {{may be caused by}} a coupling between the tides and long-period tilts. The coherence between nearby instruments is 20. 5 for frequencies ranging from 0. 5 to 2 cycles per day, but drops to a much smaller value outside of this range. The secular tilt rate is quite variable and ranges from 0. 1 to 1 prad/yr. Measurements at Erie, Colorado, and in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, exhibit an annual or biannual periodicity with an amplitude of about 1 prad, which is consistent with a l/f 2 extrapolation of the diurnal noise power to longer periods.

50|$|He {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1887 and persuaded the Society to fund 20 {{earthquake}} observatories around the world, equipped with his <b>horizontal</b> <b>pendulum</b> seismographs. His network initially included seven in England, three in Russia, two in Canada (one in Toronto {{and one in}} Victoria British Columbia), three {{on the east coast}} of the United States, and one in Antarctica, eventually growing to total 40 worldwide. These stations sent their 'station registers' to Milne, where the data formed the basis of Milne's researches.

50|$|The tiltmeters are <b>horizontal</b> <b>pendulums</b> {{installed}} by the Geodesist Antonio Marussi in 1959. The instruments {{are sensitive to}} deviations of the vertical, to rotations and shearing of the cave. Some movements are aperiodic, others regular, as the Earth Tides caused by the lunar and solar gravitational field. The pendulums measure a distance of 95 m between {{the upper and lower}} mountings, which contributes {{to the fact that the}} instruments detect tectonic movements with high precision and are relatively immune to some of the noise which affects smaller instruments. The pendulum beam is suspended horizontally by two steel wires, an upper one fixed to the roof of the cave, the lower one fixed to the floor. The pendulum beam rotates in the horizontal plane around a virtual near-to-vertical axis that passes through the upper and lower mounting points. The Earth crust (the outer brittle layer of our planet, on average 35 km thick in continental areas) moves up and down by ten centimeters during the time of 12 and 24 hours due to the attraction of Moon and Sun, and is accompanied by a local tilting of some parts in a billion of radians.The movements of the pendulums has contributed to identify the free oscillations of the Earth, and to show that the secular term tilting of the cave is towards North-West. The marine tides of the Adriatic have a loading effect in the cave, as have also the underground carstic floods of the river Timavo that disappears at the Skocjanske Cave in Slovenia. The Grotta Gigante tiltmeters are the only existing instruments to have recorded four out of five greatest earthquakes in the recent 50 years, which are the earthquakes of Chile 1960 (the greatest earthquake ever instrumentally recorded) and Chile 2010 (the fifth in the scale of recorded worldwide mega-events) the tsunami-generating event of the Sumatra-Andaman islands of 2004 (third greatest event) and the event of Japan 2011 (fourth greatest event), allowing an absolute-amplitude comparison between these events.|$|R

40|$|The Grotta Gigante {{is located}} on the Trieste Carst close to the Adriatic Sea in Italy. It is the {{greatest}} cave in {{the world in terms of}} single volume cave and has a diameter of 100 m. In 1959 the Marussi <b>horizontal</b> <b>pendulums</b> were installed for the first time. They are very stable tiltmeters due to the type of installation which uses the entire height of the cave (Marussi, 1959, Braitenberg et al., 2005). Though having been modernized and some maintenance having been applied, the instruments are perfectly controlled in their instrumental response during the 50 years of functioning. We have an absolute control on the correctness of the amplitudes by the tidal signal, which is observed very well on the instrument. At our knowledge it is the only station that uses the same instruments in the same location and has observed three of the five greatest events ever measured: Cile 1960 (M= 9. 5), 2010 (M= 8. 8), and Sumatra 2004 (M= 9. 3) (Bolt and Marussi, 1962; Bozzi Zadro and Marussi, 1967; Braitenberg and Zadro, 2007). We analyze the gravest modes of the free oscillations as 0 S 2, 0 T 2, 1 S 2 and determine frequencies and amplitudes of the modes for the events of Cile and Sumatra. Two minor events are added, as Cile 2007 and Sumatra 2005. For the spectral analysis we use the method described in Braitenberg and Zadro (2007), We find a few spectral amplitudes that are common to the different spectra and are intermediate to the theoretical free oscillation frequencies. We determine the Q values for the low degree free oscillation frequencies. At last we seek a direct comparison of the oscillation amplitudes for the different events. The observation of the 1960 event was made on photographic paper, the recent events are made with a digital system, which has some consequences on the resolution of the first part of the record.
