Can Darwinian random mutations and selection generate biological complexity and holism? In this paper we argue that the "wonderful but not enough" tools of linear reductionism cannot lead to chaos and hence to complexity and holism, but with ChaNoXity this seems indeed plausible, even likely. Based on the Pump-Engine realism of mutually interacting supply and demand [...] - demand institutes supply that fuels demand [...] - we demonstrate that the "supply" of symmetry breaking Darwinian genetic variation, in direct conflict with the symmetry inducing "demand" of natural selection, defines the antagonistic arrows of the real and negative worlds. Working in this competitively collaborating nonlinear mode, these opposites generate the homeostasy of holistic life. Protein folding, mitosis, meiosis, hydrophobicity and other ingredients have their respective expressions in this paradigm; nucleotide substitution, gene duplication-divergence, HGT, stress-induced mutations, antibiotic resistance, Lamarckism would appear to fit in naturally in this complexity paradigm defined through emergence of novelty and self-organization. With obvious departures from current reductionism, this can have far reaching implications in the <b>Darwinian</b> and nano <b>medicine</b> of genetic diseases and disorders.

40|$|A growing {{interest}} toward the evolutionary or <b>Darwinian</b> approaches in <b>medicine</b> stimulates today's {{debates about the}} future of medical knowledge and practice. A rising number of symposia, essays, and books are questioning if medicine still makes sense without evolution, arguing that an understanding of how natural selection shaped human vulnerability to disease could provide new insights into medical research and practice, and contribute to a more pertinent idea of health and disease than the ones emerging from the understanding of physiology and biochemistry. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide an historical and epistemological perspective for an evolution based medicine (ebm). Starting from a schematic analysis of the most controversial issues debated within the literature dealing with the so called "crisis of medicine", I will guess that medical theory and philosophy of medicine find it difficult to manage the crisis because they are suffering from a historical fallacy. A schematic reconstruction of the historical advancements of medical epistemology, both at the level of theoretical thinking and of methodological strategies will then be put forward, to demonstrate the epistemological pluralism of medicine. Instead of considering medical pluralism as a demonstration that medical knowledge is socially constructed, the essay argues that it is a consequence of the fact that the living beings who become sick and those that try to understand how and why it happens are temporary endpoints of the ongoing process of biological evolution by natural selection. The main assumptions and theories which inspire "evolution based medicine" will finally be listed and analyzed in terms of their the epistemological implications, showing why and how an evolutionary and Darwinian perspective about medical knowledge and practice can improve and complete the epistemological understanding and foundation of medicine...|$|R
50|$|Evolutionary {{medicine}} or <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine</b> is {{the application of}} modern evolutionary theory to understanding health and disease.

The evolutionary approach has driven important advances in our understanding of cancer, autoimmune disease, and anatomy.

50|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{evolved from}} Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) {{otherwise}} known as common S. aureus. Many people are natural carriers of S. aureus, without being affected in any way. MSSA was treatable with the antibiotic methicillin until it acquired the gene for antibiotic resistance. Though genetic mapping of various strains of MRSA, scientists have found that MSSA acquired the mecA gene in the 1960s, which accounts for its pathogenicity, before this it had a predominantly commensal relationship with humans. It is theorized that when this S. aureus strain that had acquired the mecA gene was introduced into hospitals, it {{came into contact with}} other hospital bacteria that had already been exposed to high levels of antibiotics. When exposed to such high levels of antibiotics, the hospital bacteria suddenly found themselves in an environment that had a high level of selection for antibiotic resistance, and thus resistance to multiple antibiotics formed within these hospital populations. When S. aureus came into contact with these populations, the multiple genes that code for antibiotic resistance to different drugs were then acquired by MRSA, making it nearly impossible to control. It is thought that MSSA acquired the resistance gene through the horizontal gene transfer, a method in which genetic information can be passed within a generation, and spread rapidly through its own population as was illustrated in multiple studies. Horizontal gene transfer speeds the process of genetic transfer since {{there is no need to}} wait an entire generation time for gene to be passed on. Since most antibiotics do not work on MRSA, physicians have to turn to alternative methods based in <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine.</b> However prevention is the most preferred method of avoiding antibiotic resistance. By reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in human and animal populations, antibiotics resistance can be slowed.|$|E

Ten years on, at what is still the dawn of a new millennium, it is timely to review the current state of <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine</b> and to assess some of its still latent potentialities.

Distinct lines of academic interest and inquiry are, however, emerging within <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine</b> and it has found inclusion in a number of undergraduate curricula. Sufficient interest exists to suggest that it will survive as a discipline. But as a discipline, <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine</b> needs more than a single protagonist – it needs serious critical attention. It is important, therefore, to ask in what form the discipline is to persist and into what new areas it might go. Fundamental to such questions is the relationship between <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine</b> (as a scientific discipline) and Western clinical medicine (as a profession). It is suggested that, rather than try to gain direct acceptance by the medical profession, <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine</b> might seek to establish itself more firmly within the academic disciplines of evolutionary and human biology. It is suggested that it give special attention to identifying and making its own distinctive voice heard as a biological science of health and disease distinct from medicine – a voice that clinical medicine, drawing as ever from allied sciences, cannot then afford to ignore.

40|$|Concepts of 'health' and 'disease' are of {{fundamental}} importance to ethical considerations regarding medical provision. Yet the terms have no clearly agreed definitions. In fact, {{the difficulty of}} defining health has led to most attention being given to defining disease instead. Here, two schools of thought have arisen: the 'naturalist' which argues that disease is an objective entity in itself and the 'normativist' which gives emphasis to the subjective nature of disease experience differing between cultures and through history. Respectively, these two schools characterize quantitative (or functional) and qualitative (or evaluative) views of disease. Although both schools offer important insights, they are essentially at odds. This poster outlines an approach that seeks to find a basis for a meeting (if not a unification) of these schools by adopting ideas and approaches from evolutionary psychology and <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine.</b> From the perspective of reproductive fitness, {{the question of whether}} health and disease can be said to exist as biological entities is addressed and the idea that all that matters is reproductivity is considered. It is suggested that attitudes regarding certain biological entities, such as physical or physiological states, serve adaptive functions. The suggestion is then made that, although open to social and cultural influence, attitudes towards and qualitative definitions of health and disease also have biological bases. Thus, it may be argued that evaluative definitions of disease have functional (evolutionary) bases, thereby linking the naturalist and normativist schools of thought. Important in this linkage, however, is acceptance of ideas from evolutionary psychology. The only discipline that currently unites the study of health and disease with that of evolutionary biology (including evolutionary psychology) is <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine.</b> It is within this discipline that new theoretical and evidence-based understanding of 'health' and 'disease' is likely to prove fruitful – in particular, in giving 'health' appropriately weighted attention...|$|E
40|$|There {{is much to}} {{be gained}} from {{examining}} human diseases within the expanding framework of <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine.</b> This is particularly true of those conditions that change in frequency as populations develop from the human "environment of evolutionary adaptedness" to the living conditions of the rich industrialized countries. This development entails major changes in lifestyle, leading to reductions in contact with environmental microorganisms and helminths that have evolved a physiologic role as drivers of immunoregulatory circuits. It is suggested that a deficit in immunoregulation in rich countries is contributing not only to increases in the incidence of allergic disorders but also to increases in other chronic inflammatory conditions that are exacerbated by a failure to terminate inappropriate inflammatory reponses. These include autoimmunity, neuroinflammatory disorders, atherosclerosis, depression associated with raised inflammatory cytokines, and some cancers. </p...|$|E

40|$|A central {{tenet of}} {{evolutionary}} or <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine</b> {{is that many}} chronic diseases and degenerative conditions evident in modern Western populations have arisen because of a mismatch between ‘Stone Age’ genes and recently-adopted lifestyles [1 – 5].

Some suggest that this mismatch can be extended even further back in time, to the widespread adoption of agriculture [5]. It is believed that chronic and degenerative conditions persist at such high levels in many populations because the rate at which selection operates is not sufficient to respond to the current pace of cultural and environmental change [1, 5].

40|$|Abstract Background Medical and pre-professional health {{students}} {{ask questions}} about human health that can be answered in two ways, by giving proximate and evolutionary explanations. Proximate explanations, most common in textbooks and classes, describe the immediate scientifically known biological mechanisms of anatomical characteristics or physiological processes. These explanations are necessary but insufficient. They can be complemented with evolutionary explanations that describe the evolutionary processes and principles that have resulted in human biology we study today. The main goal of the science of <b>Darwinian</b> <b>Medicine</b> is to investigate human disease, disorders, and medical complications from an evolutionary perspective. Discussion This paper contrasts the differences between {{these two types of}} explanations by describing principles of natural selection that underlie medical questions. Thus, why is human birth complicated? Why does sickle cell anemia exist? Why do we show symptoms like fever, diarrhea, and coughing when we have infection? Why do we suffer from ubiquitous age-related diseases like arteriosclerosis, Alzheimer's and others? Why are chronic diseases like type II diabetes and obesity so prevalent in modern society? Why hasn't natural selection eliminated the genes that cause common genetic diseases like hemochromatosis, cystic fibrosis, Tay sachs, PKU and others? Summary In giving students evolutionary explanations professors should underscore principles of natural selection, since these can be generalized for the analysis of many medical questions. From a research perspective, natural selection seems central to leading hypotheses of obesity and type II diabetes and might very well explain the occurrence of certain common genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis, Tay sachs, Fragile X syndrome, G 6 PD and others because of their compensating advantages. Furthermore, armed with evolutionary explanations, health care professionals can bring practical benefits to patients by treating their symptoms of infection more specifically and judiciously. They might also help curtail the evolutionary arms race between pathogens and antibiotic defenses. </p...|$|E
40|$|The 2009 {{celebrations}} of Darwin’s birth and {{the publication of}} The Origin of Species were grand not only because his discoveries changed biology, {{but also because they}} are continuing to benefit society. Nowhere is this more evident than in medicine and public health. You might think that Darwin’s discoveries would have been fully applied long ago, but a deep fracture in the intellectual landscape has prevented medicine from making full use of evolutionary biology. This is changing fast. Scientists are now recognising that diseases need evolutionary explanations as well as explanations based only on the body’s mechanisms. The field that tries to understand why natural selection has left the body vulnerable to diseases is called <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine.</b> Also called evolutionary medicine, it applies every aspect of evolutionary biology to every problem in medicine and public health. It has grown quickly since 1991 (Williams and Nesse, 1991). Major edited volumes have illustrated the opportunity in areas from infectious disease epidemiology to genetics, anatomy and physiology. The most significant ones are already in second editions (Stearns and Koella, 2007; Trevathan et al., 2007). They are being widely read and studied except, it seems, by physicians. Most doctors never take a course in evolutionary biology before medical school, and evolution {{is not part of the}} usual medical curriculum. This is a significant detriment to human health. It is as if we left out embryology from the medical curriculum. Like embryology, many of the contributions of evolutionary biology are not the kind of thing that one applies in the clinic every single day. Instead, evolution provides an essential foundation for understanding why the body is the way it is, and why it fails in ways that cause disease. Physicians and researchers who understand thes...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{apparent}} consensus in philosophy of medicine that conceptualanalysis {{has led to}} a stalemate regarding the definitions of health anddisease. Rather than accepting this view and abandoning attempts to definethese concepts, I consider whether a more biologically nuanced approach isneeded. More precisely, I scrutinize the idea that understanding biologicalnorms in terms of variation and variability helps to clarify the concepts ofhealth and disease. In this dissertation, I explore how the work of GeorgesCanguilhem seeks to follow this path. In the first chapter, I differentiateCanguilhems biological genealogy of medical concepts from conceptual analysisto specify how his approach differs from many others in analytic philosophyof medicine. The second chapter then goes further into Canguilhems critique ofthe idea that disease is merely a deviation from normality and shows how hisviews differ from a standard naturalist approach as found in Christopher Boorse. After establishing that, for Canguilhem, biological norms should be understoodrelative to individual organisms in their environments, the third and fourthchapters address some criticisms leveled at his eco-organismic approach, suchas whether his account misunderstands biological individuality, whether theconcepts of health and disease need only apply to individual organisms, andwhether he places too much emphasis on individual organisms for understandinghow (evolutionary) biology can clarify health and disease. Together, these twochapters serve as a heuristic for clarifying many concepts within Canguilhemsphilosophy and allow me to show how these criticisms miss the mark. AsCanguilhem argues for the environmental relativity of biological and medicalnorms, the fifth chapter considers whether some environments are more importantthan others by looking at the ideas of <b>Darwinian</b> <b>medicine.</b> I show that whileevolutionary accounts of health and disease help to clarify the various causesof disease, they struggle to provide clear definitions of health and disease. As health and disease are likely best understood relative to presentenvironments and current physiological norms, it seems that Canguilhems eco-organismicrelativity remains quite relevant. In chapter six, I tie together the precedingarguments with a more detailed analysis of Canguilhems organismic andenvironmental relativity and show how his views on health and disease can beupdated by looking at some concepts from ecological developmental biology:phenotypic flexibility and biological robustness. While this provides aninteresting way to naturalize the concepts of health and disease, I also showthat Canguilhems view is limited when it comes to finding a way tooperationalize or measure these concepts. The final chapter explores somepotentially problematic conclusions that result from relativizing health anddisease when it comes to human social environments. I analyze the idea ofsocial pathologies and consider how social norms contribute to the experienceof disease.
