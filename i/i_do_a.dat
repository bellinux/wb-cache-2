Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

In an interview published ahead of his 2013 “One More for the Road” tour, McTell said, “It could be the last time <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> big tour... {{this is the beginning of}} slowing things down”.|$|E

[...] "I draw a lot of diagrams when I work. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot of thinking about etchings by Escher, for instance. That frees me, finding a mathematical model or a scientific model. I'll draw pictures and diagrams that illustrate the movement or the rhythm that I'm after." [...] Caltech physicist and Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne compared Nolan's [...] "deep" [...] intuition to scientists such as Albert Einstein, noting that the director intuitively grasped things non-scientists rarely understand. Upon his own decision-making {{of whether or not}} to start work on a project, the filmmaker has proclaimed a belief in the sincerity of his passion for something within the particular project in question as a basis for his selective thought.|$|E

500|$|Disney's {{public persona}} was very {{different}} from his actual personality. Playwright Robert E. Sherwood described him as [...] "almost painfully shy... diffident" [...] and self-deprecating. According to his biographer Richard Schickel, Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public identity. Kimball argues that Disney [...] "played the role of a bashful tycoon who was embarrassed in public" [...] and knew that he was doing so. Disney acknowledged the façade, and told a friend that [...] "I'm not Walt Disney. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot of things Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke. I smoke. Walt Disney does not drink. I drink." [...] Critic Otis Ferguson, in The New Republic, called the private Disney: [...] "common and everyday, not inaccessible, not in a foreign language, not suppressed or sponsored or anything. Just Disney." [...] Many of those with whom Disney worked commented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his exceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said [...] "That'll work", it was an indication of high praise. Instead of direct approval, Disney gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or recommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would be passed on.|$|E

500|$|Linda S. Ghent, Professor in the Department of Economics at Eastern Illinois University, {{discusses}} {{some economic}} {{issues in this}} episode. Just before Jerry's dare about the egg roll, Elaine says, [...] "You know, it's not fair people are seated first come first served. It {{should be based on}} who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody's plate." [...] Ghent discusses the history and reasoning behind rationing mechanisms and economic efficiency, which are the bases behind how tables are seated at restaurants, rationales which are perhaps invisible to hungry or impatient customers. Elaine's attempt at bribery is an example of opportunity cost: the trio are willing to pay more than usual to get a table, if it means Elaine can eat sooner and Jerry makes it to the movie on time. Ghent also gives Jerry's willingness to lie to his uncle as another example of opportunity cost: [...] "Did <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> bad thing by lying to my uncle and saying I couldn't go to dinner? Plan Nine from Outer Space – one night only, the big screen! My hands are tied!" ...|$|E
500|$|Jay Cocks of TIME {{magazine}} {{offered a}} mixed review, stating [...] "or all its sass, {{there is something}} a little too careful about this album: the rhythms are too studied and studiobound, the sexiness slightly forced. It's as if Jackson, aware that this was her premier effort under a new, $40 million record deal, felt weighed down by the burden of proving herself. When, however, she kicks loose on What'll <b>I</b> <b>Do,</b> <b>a</b> nifty, '60s-style soul stirrer, it's clear that Jackson's got nothing to prove to anyone, including herself." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times compares Jackson to her brother Michael and Madonna, stating [...] "Jackson's real strength, abetted by Jam and Lewis, is the way she tops dance-club rhythms with pop melodies. Less up-to-the-second than Madonna but still effective, the Jackson team has obviously {{been listening to the}} competition. Madonna's 'Justify My Love' echoes in 'That's the Way Love Goes,' and 'If' resembles Michael Jackson's 'Why You Wanna Trip on Me,' starting with screaming guitar and a chanted verse, rising to a sweet melody." [...] He also comments that despite its shortcomings, [...] "he album's not about being real; it's about seamlessness and ingenuity, about giving the public something it can use. For a superstar, Jackson is downright selfless, but she gets the job done." ...|$|E
500|$|Spears {{explained}} that since {{she did not}} tour to promote Blackout, she was excited about having to include songs from that album into the setlist. The finished setlist would include three songs from Circus, six songs from Blackout and five songs from In the Zone (2003); {{other parts of the}} setlist consist of a medley of [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "Touch of My Hand", both from In the Zone; and a remix of [...] "...Baby One More Time", the only song performed off the album of the same name (1998). [...] "Everytime" [...] was the only song not included in the released setlist but was performed regularly on the show. Magician Ed Alonzo joined Spears in one of the acts, and she played as his assistant. Alonzo stated, [...] "We're going to be doing the classics of magic but a little high-tech. We'll be doing a little dissection, transposition, a vanish, an appearance— and if <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> trick, she doesn't just hold the props, she's actually getting inside the big boxes or I am slicing her up. ... Some of it's pretty scary, but she gets right in there with no reservations." [...] The costumes were designed by Dean and Dan Caten from DSquared2. They recreated classic circus outfits, like clowns, jugglers and trapeze artists in a more provocative way. They commented that, ...|$|E

2500|$|Breaking Bad {{was created}} by Vince Gilligan, who spent several years writing the Fox series The X-Files.

[...] "When I realized this, the logical next step was to think, how can <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> show in which the fundamental drive is toward change?" [...] He added that his goal with Walter White was to turn him from Mr. Chips into Scarface.|$|E

Wales first encountered the philosophy through reading Rand's novel The Fountainhead during his undergraduate period and, in 1992, founded an electronic mailing list devoted to [...] "Moderated Discussion of Objectivist Philosophy". Though he has stated that the philosophy [...] "colours everything I do and think", he has said, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> better job—than {{a lot of people}} who self-identify as Objectivists—of not pushing my point of view on other people." ...|$|E

[...] When asked if he could see himself doing the job for another 21 years, he replied: [...] "Absolutely. It's the greatest show on Earth.
