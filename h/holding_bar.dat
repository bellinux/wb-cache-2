50|$|Athletes in {{this class}} used secure frames for {{throwing}} events. The frame can be only one of two shapes: A rectangle or square. The sides {{must be at least}} 30 cm long. The seat needs to be lower at the back or level, and it cannot be taller than 75 cm. This height includes any cushioning or padding. Throwers can have footplates on their frames, but the footplate can only be used for stability. It cannot be used to push off from. Rests can be used on the frame but they need to be present only for safety reasons and to aide in athlete stability. They need to be manufactured from rigid materials that do not move. These materials may include steel or aluminum. The backrest can have cushioning but it cannot be thicker than 5 cm. It cannot have any movable parts. The frame can also have a <b>holding</b> <b>bar.</b> The <b>holding</b> <b>bar</b> needs to be round or square, and needs to be a single straight piece. Athletes are not required to use a <b>holding</b> <b>bar</b> during their throw, and they can hold on to any part of the frame during their throw. Throwing frames should be inspected prior to the event. This should be done either in the call room or in the competition area. In general, people {{in this class}} should be allocated around 2 minutes to set up their chair.|$|E
50|$|Athletes need {{to throw}} from a seated position. They cannot throw from an {{inclined}} or other position. Doing so {{could increase the}} contribution of their legs and benefit their performance. Their legs must be {{in contact with the}} seat during the throw. If an athlete throws from a non-seated position, this is counted as a foul. People in this class can put tape on their non-throwing hand to assist in gripping the <b>holding</b> <b>bar.</b> All straps used to hold the athlete to the frame must be non-elastic. While in the process of throwing, an athlete cannot touch a tie-down for the frame. Because of visibility issues for officials, athletes cannot wear lose clothing and they can ask athletes to tuck in clothing if they feel there is any issue with visibility. In throwing events at the Paralympic Games and World Championships, athletes get three trial throws. After that, the top 8 throwers get an additional three throws. For other events, organizers generally have the option to use that formula to give all throwers six consecutive throws. The total number of warm-up throws is at the discretion of the meet director.|$|E

40|$|Rationale: Huntington disease (HD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. HD is usually diagnosed {{by the appearance}} of motor deficits, resulting in skilled hand use disruption, gait abnormality, muscle wasting and choreatic movements. The BACHD transgenic rat model for HD represents a well-established transgenic rodent model of HD, offering the prospect of an in-depth characterization of the motor phenotype. Objective: The present study aims to characterize different aspects of motor function in BACHD rats, combining classical paradigms with novel high-throughput behavioral phenotyping. Methods: Wild-type (WT) and transgenic animals were tested longitudinally from 2 to 12 months of age. To measure fine motor control, rats were challenged with the pasta handling test and the pellet reaching test. To evaluate gross motor function, animals were assessed by using the <b>holding</b> <b>bar</b> and the grip strength tests. Spontaneous locomotor activity and circadian rhythmicity were assessed in an automated home-cage environment, namely the PhenoTyper. We then integrated existing classical methodologies to test motor function with automated home-cage assessment of motor performance. Results: BACHD rats showed strong impairment in muscle endurance at 2 months of age. Altered circadian rhythmicity and locomotor activity were observed in transgenic animals. On the other hand, reaching behavior, forepaw dexterity and muscle strength were unaffected. Conclusions: The BACHD rat model exhibits certain features of HD patients, like muscle weakness and changes in circadian behavior. We have observed modest but clear-cut deficits in distinct motor phenotypes, thus confirming the validity of this transgenic rat model for treatment and drug discovery purposes...|$|E

Although the martial arts in the 20 th century provide striking examples of processes of sportization and para-sportization, the rise of No <b>Holds</b> <b>Barred</b> events in the 1990 s represented an opposing trend, a process of de-sportization. The analysis of No <b>Holds</b> <b>Barred</b> contests demonstrates that both sportization and de-sportization trends depend primarily on the interests of the organizers, and in particular on {{the degree to which they}} rely on the perspectives of practitioners, spectators, or viewers. The decisive factor for the predominance of the latter perspective was the formation of a new and poorly regulated market for visual material, which emerged with pay-per-view television. This allowed media entrepreneurs to commercialize nonsanctioned events, which depend primarily on the demands and fantasies of viewers who are less interested in the specifics of particular sports or games than in the antinomian excitement produced by the transgression of the rules and conventions of ordinary life. The case of No <b>Holds</b> <b>Barred</b> fighting thus suggests that new markets for visual material are likely to become an important factor in the development of spectator sports and sport-like forms of entertainment. It also suggests that regulatory regimes are an essential feature for the actual outcome of the changes that these new markets may bring about. Public pressure eventually led to the disappearance of No <b>Holds</b> <b>Barred</b> events from the major US cable television networks and from the full contact fighting scene in most Western European countries. In response, various initiatives worked towards a re-sportization of the matches, a process that has led to the transformation of No <b>Holds</b> <b>Barred</b> tournaments into Mixed Martial Arts matches...|$|R

50|$|A No <b>Holds</b> <b>Barred</b> match, {{also known}} as a no {{disqualification}} match, or sometimes as an Anything Goes match, Boot Camp match or Raven's Rules match, is a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference. The key differences between a No <b>Holds</b> <b>Barred</b> match and a standard hardcore match are that falls must be made in the ring and there is less emphasis on the use of weapons. A match that does not observe disqualifications, where pinfalls must take place in the ring, can also be known as an unsanctioned match, or street fight.|$|R
