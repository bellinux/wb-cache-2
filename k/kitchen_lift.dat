"The {{clubs that}} started the present vogue for dance clubs were the Cabaret Club in Heddon Street [...] [...] [...] [...] The Cabaret Club was the first club where members were {{expected}} to appear in evening clothes[...] [...] [...] The Cabaret Club began a system of vouchers which friends of members could use to obtain admission to the club[...] [...] [...] {{the question of the}} legality of these vouchers led to a famous visitation of the police.

5000|$|Some student groups, {{including}} SDSU group [...] "Students for Sensible Drug Policy," [...] {{protested the}} arrests, especially SDSU's decision {{to involve the}} DEA, a federal agency, in the operation. In addition, they called for a more sympathetic policy toward drug use on the campus.One day later, on May 7, SDSU officials stated that only 33 were students, and that the inflated number issued originally included students arrested months earlier, in some cases for simple possession.On May 15, SDSU Vice President for Student Affairs James <b>Kitchen</b> <b>lifted</b> the interim suspension from the Phi Kappa Theta, Sigma Alpha Mu, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternities. The suspension was lifted after an administrative review found that those arrested in connection to the controlled substances investigation were either inactive members of the fraternity and/or were not presently residents of chapter houses.|$|R
60|$|I {{ran into}} the kitchen and huddled our four silver spoons into my pocket; then took the unlucky book with the bank-notes {{and put it in the}} bosom of my dress. I was {{determined}} to defend the property confided to my care with my life. Just as I had secured the pocketbook I heard the door splintering, and rushed into the passage again with my heavy <b>kitchen</b> poker <b>lifted</b> in both hands.|$|R

50|$|In 2003 the {{building}} underwent a major refurbishment. The work {{was carried out}} by the architects Richard Griffiths & Hawkins Brown who removed all non-original fittings and restored the original stonework. The ceiling was stripped to reveal the original paint colours which have since been retained. The main Council Chamber was fitted with audio-visual equipment, air conditioning, a scene-setting lighting scheme, induction loops and more flexible furniture to allow different seating plans. Also upgraded and remodelled were the meeting rooms, members lounge, washrooms, <b>kitchen</b> and offices. <b>Lifts</b> were also installed in the main foyer.|$|R
5000|$|That {{same month}} a flat was broken into in Kitwe. An {{impression}} of the ball of a foot {{was found on the}} <b>kitchen</b> windowsill and <b>lifted.</b> Foot impressions were taken from 60 Africans employed locally and the burglar thus identified. He was put on an identification parade and recognised by a miner who had accosted him carrying a bundle {{on the morning of the}} crime and from whom he had run away. Northern Rhodesia Police Standing Orders required all identification parades to be photographed, some thirty years before the Code of Practice for the Identification of Persons Suspected of Offences, made under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 required a similar procedure in England and Wales.|$|R
