25|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled against}} Mr. Sentell and {{established}} the precedent in U.S. jurisprudence that {{the regulation of}} dogs was within the police power of the state, and that the dogs were not as valuable as horses, cattle, sheep, or other domesticated animals:It is true that under the Fourteenth Amendment, no state can deprive a person of his life, liberty, or property without due process of law, but in determining what is due process of law, we are bound to consider {{the nature of the}} property, the necessity for its sacrifice, {{and the extent to which}} it has heretofore been regarded as within the police power. So far as property is inoffensive or harmless, it can only be condemned or destroyed by legal proceedings, with <b>due</b> <b>notice</b> to the owner; but, so far as it is dangerous to the safety or health of the community, due process of law may authorize its summary destruction....|$|E
500|$|There was {{an attempt}} made to claim the flitch on 12 June 1772 by John and Susan Gilder. [...] The couple had given <b>due</b> <b>notice</b> of their claim and were {{accompanied}} by a large crowd of onlookers. [...] However, {{the lord of the}} manor had ordered that the ceremony should not take place and the gates of the priory were nailed shut to prevent it. [...] By 1809 the tradition was definitely abolished. [...] A further attempt to claim the flitch was made in 1832 by Josiah Vine, a retired cheesemaker, who travelled with his wife from Reading to make his claim. [...] He too was refused a trial by a very unsympathetic Steward of Little Dunmow. [...] John Bull on 8 October 1837 reported that it had been revived by the Saffron Walden and Dunmow Agricultural Society. [...] Apparently however, this flitch was merely distributed at the annual society dinner. [...] In 1851 a couple from Felstead were also refused a trial at the Priory, but obtained a flitch from the people of nearby Great Dunmow who felt that they deserved it.|$|E

40|$|The New Deal Supreme Court revised a {{well-known}} set of constitutional doctrines. Legal scholarship has principally {{focused on the}} changes that occurred in three areas — federalism, delegation, and economic liberty. This Article identifies a new and important fourth element of New Deal constitutionalism: {{a change in the}} constitutional doctrine of <b>due</b> process <b>notice,</b> the doctrine that specifies the minimum standards for constitutionally adequate notice of the law. The law of <b>due</b> process <b>notice</b> — which includes the doctrines of vagueness, retroactivity, and the rule of lenity — evolved dramatically {{over the course of the}} New Deal to permit lesser clarity and to tolerate more retroactivity. The upshot has been the near-total elimination of successful notice-based challenges other than in the limited context of First Amendment vagueness attacks. Unlike the more famous doctrinal changes of this period, changes to <b>due</b> process <b>notice</b> doctrine were not obviously necessary to accommodate the New Deal legislative agenda, either as a matter of jurisprudence or as a matter of politics. <b>Due</b> process <b>notice</b> doctrine nonetheless underwent a radical transformation in this era, as the Court came to regard its broader shift toward deferring to legislative and executive policy decisions as requiring the relaxation of <b>due</b> process <b>notice</b> doctrine. The link forged between deference and notice had significant functional effects on the most important audience for the Court’s notice jurisprudence — Congress. By loosening the strictures of <b>due</b> process <b>notice</b> doctrine, the Court lowered sharply the enactment costs of federal legislation and thereby facilitated its proliferation. This is a distinct, and hitherto unacknowledged, mechanism by which the Court in this period enhanced national power and encouraged the flourishing of the emerging administrative state. Like much of the New Deal “settlement,” the New Deal reformulation of <b>due</b> process <b>notice</b> doctrine is today the subject of ferment in the courts. Recognizing the New Deal roots of <b>due</b> process <b>notice</b> doctrine is critical for understanding these ongoing judicial debates — and for beginning the conceptual work of mapping the future shape of this vital cluster of doctrines...|$|R

2500|$|The {{roots of}} the strike began in a pattern of labor actions, {{negotiations}} and temporary agreements all through 1885. [...] The Knights of Labor and Gould's Union Pacific had reached an agreement that included the principle that [...] "no man should be discharged without <b>due</b> <b>notice</b> and investigation." [...] This was purportedly violated when a Knight named Charles A. Hall in Marshall, Texas was fired for attending a union meeting on company time.

2500|$|The Court {{concluded}} {{by emphasizing}} {{the need for the}} parties to receive fair notice and an opportunity to be heard before a court acts on its own initiative. [...] Courts must also ensure that the petitioner is not significantly prejudiced by the delayed focus on the limitation issue, and [...] "determine whether the interests of justice would be better served" [...] by addressing the merits or by dismissing the petition as time barred. [...] The Court also stated that a district court would not have the discretion to disregard the choice of a defendant to intelligently waive the limitations defense. [...] In this case, however, the Court believed the Magistrate Judge gave Day <b>due</b> <b>notice</b> and a fair opportunity to show why the limitation period should not yield dismissal of the petition, and there was nothing to suggest that the State [...] "strategically" [...] withheld the defense or chose to relinquish it. [...] The record instead indicated that the miscalculation was [...] "merely an inadvertent error." ...|$|E
