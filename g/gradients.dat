30|$|Fracture <b>gradient</b> {{is defined}} by the Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary as the {{pressure}} <b>gradient</b> required to induce fractures in the rock at a given depth. Based on this definition, the fracture <b>gradient</b> is the maximum mud weight that a well can hold without mud losses and without uncontrolled tensile failures (fracture growth). However, there is no consensus for a method to calculate the fracture <b>gradient</b> in the oil and gas industry. Some pore pressure specialists use the minimum stress <b>gradient</b> as the fracture <b>gradient,</b> but others may use the maximum leak-off pressure <b>gradient</b> (fracture breakdown pressure <b>gradient)</b> or the fracture initiation pressure <b>gradient</b> as the fracture <b>gradient.</b> In this paper, the maximum leak-off pressure <b>gradient</b> (the peak value in the LOT test) is used as the fracture <b>gradient.</b> That is, the effects of the minimum stress, tensile strength, and the wellbore stress concentrations will be considered for fracture <b>gradient</b> prediction.|$|R

5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the <b>gradients</b> of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag.

The locomotives available at the time were not thought to be capable of climbing the steep inclines, and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution.
