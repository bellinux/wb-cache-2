25|$|Approximately 70% of Superfund cleanup {{activities}} {{historically have}} been paid for by parties responsible (PRPs) for the cleanup of contamination. The exceptions occur when the responsible party either cannot be found or is unable {{to pay for the}} cleanup. Until the mid-1990s, most of the funding came from a tax on the petroleum and chemical industries, reflecting the polluter pays principle, but since 2001, most of the funding for cleanups of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> <b>sites</b> has come from taxpayers. Despite the name, the program has suffered from under-funding, and Superfund cleanups have decreased to a mere 8 in 2014, out of over 1,200. As a result, the EPA typically negotiates consent orders with PRPs to study sites and develop cleanup alternatives, subject to EPA oversight and approval of all such activities.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamic effect}} of a <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> <b>site</b> is {{analyzed}} by investigating the causal relationship between housing appreciation rates and house location {{in relation to a}} <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> <b>site</b> using resale data from individual sales transactions in Dallas County, Texas. The results indicate that in the period in which the <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> <b>site</b> was identified and cleanup occurred, residential property owners in close proximity to the <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> <b>site</b> experienced lower housing appreciation rates. In the first post-cleanup period, they gained some of the lost ground with a higher appreciation rate. In a subsequent post-cleanup period, their appreciation fell in line with property owners whose properties are located farther away from the <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> <b>site.</b> This suggests that a long-run equilibrium has been reached since appreciation rates were not significantly different across the Dallas housing market in the second post-cleanup period. Although the results indicate that adjustment takes time, an equilibrium is eventually reached for the houses in this repeat sales data set. An important implication of our analysis is that since the post-cleanup recovery was not immediate, property owners should be compensated for their loss of liquidity...|$|R

2500|$|In {{response}} to the environmental disasters at Love Canal and Times Beach, Missouri, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), {{commonly known as the}} Superfund legislation. CERCLA gave EPA primary responsibility for identifying, investigating, and cleaning up <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> <b>sites.</b> CERCLA also authorized the establishment of ATSDR to assess the presence and nature of health hazards to communities living near Superfund sites, to help prevent or reduce harmful exposures, and to expand the knowledge base about the health effects that result from exposure to hazardous substances. ATSDR was created as an agency under the Department of Health and Human Services on April 19, 1983, and James O. Mason served as the agency's first administrator. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) gave ATSDR additional authority related to hazardous waste storage facilities. ATSDR was charged with conducting public health assessments at these sites when requested by EPA, states, or individuals, as well as assisting EPA to determine which substances should be regulated and the levels at which chemicals may pose a threat to human health. ATSDR was formally organized as an agency on June 11, 1985. [...] The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) broadened ATSDR's responsibilities in the areas of public health assessments, establishment and maintenance of toxicological databases, information dissemination, and medical education. In 2003, the position of assistant administrator was replaced with a director who is shared with NCEH.|$|E

2500|$|Landfill {{sites have}} been shown to have adverse effects on fetal development. [...] Extensive {{research}} has been shown that landfills have several negative effects on babies born to mothers living near landfill sites: low birth weight, birth defects, spontaneous abortion, and fetal and infant mortality. [...] Studies done around the Love Canal site near Niagara Falls and the Lipari Landfill in New Jersey have shown a higher proportion of low birth babies than communities farther away from landfills. [...] A study done in California showed a positive correlation between time and quantity of dumping and low birth weights and neonatal deaths. [...] A study in the United Kingdom showed a correspondence between pregnant women living near landfill sites and an increased risk of congenital disorders, such as neural tube defects, hypospadias, epispadia, and abdominal wall defects, such as gastroschisis and exomphalos. [...] A study conducted on a Welsh community also showed an increase incidence of gastroschisis. [...] Another study was done on twenty-one European <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> <b>sites</b> and showed that those living within three kilometers had an increased risk of giving birth to infants with birth defects and that as distance from the land increased, the risk decreased. [...] These birth defects included neural tube defects, malformations of the cardiac septa, anomalies of arteries and veins, and chromosomal anomalies. Looking at communities that live near landfill sites brings up environmental justice. [...] A vast majority of sites are located near poor, mostly black, communities.
