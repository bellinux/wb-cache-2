40|$|Soybean meal (SBM) is {{the primary}} source of plant protein {{commonly}} used in poultry nutrition since its amino acid balance is appropriate for diets (Marsman et al., 1997). However, the use of raw SBM by mono-gastric animals is not totally efficient due to the pre-sence of anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) (Ebrahimi-Mahmoudabad & Taghinejad-Roudbaneh, 2011). These ANFs interfere with metabolic processes and re-duce nutrient availability (Coulibaly et al., 2011). In fact, feeding raw unprocessed SBM usually reduces growth rate and feed efficiency, causes pancreatic gland enlargement and decreases digestibility and availabi-lity of amino acids in broiler chickens (Gilani et al., 2005). Hamilton & Sandstedt (2000) also reported that body weight (BW), body weight gain (BWG) and feed intake (FI) were higher and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was lower on broiler chickens when raw unprocessed SBM was replaced by heat processed SBM. To inactivate or remove ANFs in poultry diets, va-rious <b>heat</b> <b>procedures</b> (extrusion, cooking, toasting and roasting) have been reported to be efficient in reducing trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) and phytic acid (PA) in soybeans (Ari et al., 2012).

Nano-scaled fish bone (NFB) effectively increased gel breaking force and penetration distance (up to 1 g/ 100 g) while micro-scaled fish bone (MFB) did not. Endogenous transglutaminase (TGase) activity of surimi paste increased obviously as the concentration of NFB increased, indicating calcium ions readily released from NFB and assisting gel formation through TGase-induced covalent bonds. With MFB, TGase activity increased slightly, but not significantly. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results revealed NFB was capable of being imbedded in the gel matrices without disrupting the myofibrillar gel network. Surimi with MFB formed a discontinuous and porous network with pores near the size of MFB. Lightness (L*) and whiteness (L*- 3 b*) of NFB gels were higher than those of MFB...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the effect of soybean meal (SBM) <b>heat</b> <b>procedures</b> on growth performance of broiler chickens. A trial was carried out using 200 male Ross 308 strain chickens during 3 feeding periods (starter, grower and finisher, 42 days). The experiment was based on a completely randomized design with 5 treatments giving 4 replications of 10 broilers per treatment. Treatments consisted on: T 1 (control, un-processed SBM), T 2 (autoclaved SBM: 121 ºC, 20 min), T 3 (autoclaved SBM: 121 ºC, 30 min), T 4 (roasted SBM: 120 ºC, 20 min) and T 5 (microwaved SBM: 46 ºC, 540 watt, 7 min). Growth performance of animals was examined by determining body weight (BW), body weight grain (BWG), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion rate (FCR). Higher BW (p< 0. 05) and BWG (p< 0. 05) and lower FCR (p< 0. 05) were found in broiler chickens fed heat processed SBM diets compared to those fed a raw SBM diet, probably due to higher nutrient availability. However, no differences were found among <b>heat</b> SBM <b>procedures</b> (autoclaving, roasting and microwaving) on growth performance of animals for the starter, grower and finisher periods.
