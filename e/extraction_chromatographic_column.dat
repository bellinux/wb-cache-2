40|$|Until the 1960 s, liquids were {{generally}} regarded as either dense gases or dis-ordered solids, and theoretical attempts at understanding their structures and properties were largely based on those concepts. Bernal, himself a crystallog-rapher, was unhappy with either approach, preferring to regard simple liquids as ‘homogeneous, coherent and essentially irregular assemblages of molecules containing no crystalline regions’. He set about realizing this conceptual model through a detailed examination of the structures and properties of ran-dom packings of spheres. In order to test {{the relevance of the}} model to real liquids, ways had to be found to realize and characterize random packings. This was at a time when computing was slow and in its infancy, so he and his collaborators set about building models in the laboratory, and examining aspects of their structures in order to characterize them in ways which would enable comparison with the properties of real liquids. Some of the imaginative – often time consuming and frustrating – routes followed are described, as well the comparisons made with the properties of simple liquids. With the increase of the power of computers in the 1960 s, computational approaches became increasingly exploited in random packing studies. This enabled the use of packing concepts, and the tools developed to characterize them, in understanding systems as diverse as metallic glasses, crystal–liquid interfaces, protein structures, enzyme–substrate interactions and the distribution of galax-ies, as well as their exploitation in, for example, oil <b>extraction,</b> understanding <b>chromatographic</b> separation <b>columns,</b> and packed beds in industrial processes...|$|R

500|$|Once the nobelium-255 is produced, {{it can be}} {{separated}} out {{in a similar way}} as used to purify the neighboring actinide mendelevium. The recoil momentum of the produced nobelium-255 atoms is used to bring them physically far away from the target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum: this is usually combined by trapping the nobelium atoms in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and carrying them along with a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the nobelium atoms can be transported over tens of meters. The thin layer of nobelium collected on the foil can then be removed with dilute acid without completely dissolving the foil. The nobelium can then be isolated by exploiting its tendency to form the divalent state, unlike the other trivalent actinides: under typically used elution conditions (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP) as stationary organic phase and 0.05Mhydrochloric acid as mobile aqueous phase, or using 3Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant from cation-exchange resin columns), nobelium will pass through the column and elute while the other trivalent actinides remain on the column.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{frequency response}} of a <b>chromatographic</b> <b>column</b> for the adsorption of two dissolved components is analyzed using {{the concept of}} higher order frequency response functions (FRFs) {{which is based on}} the Volterra series and generalized Fourier transform. By applying this concept a nonlinear model of a system is replaced by an infinite series of the FRFs of the first, second, etc. order. The FRFs up to the third order are derived theoretically starting from the equilibrium-dispersive model, which is used for description of a <b>chromatographic</b> <b>column,</b> and applying the harmonic probing method. The functions that relate outlet concentration changes of each component to the corresponding inlet concentration changes are derived. At the inlet of a <b>chromatographic</b> <b>column,</b> it is considered: (a) the concentration change of one of the components keeping the concentration of the other component constant and (b) the concentration change of both components keeping their ratio constant. The FRFs are calculated numerically for different steady-state concentrations and relative mixture compositions. It has been found that, despite certain differences in initial conditions, the FRFs exhibit similar behavior. For higher frequencies, the amplitudes of the FRFs tend to zero and phases to −∞. In the low frequency range, which is of interest for investigation of equilibrium parameters, these functions have similar behavior, but tend to different asymptotic values. Correlations between coefficients of competitive adsorption isotherms, i. e. partial isotherm derivatives, and the derived FRFs are established.
