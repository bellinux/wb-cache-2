2500|$|Reviewers' {{response}} to the album was mostly positive, holding a score of 75 (out of 100) on music review aggregation website Metacritic. Andy Kellman from Allmusic said [...] "Stronger with Each Tear {{is a very good}} Blige album, if not quite a classic. One of her briefest sets, it is tremendously (almost studiously) balanced between all the ground she has covered so well before. That's no criticism, though, since most of the songs are easily memorable and display so much range. Those who detest [...] "The One" [...] on principle, for its use of Auto-Tune, need only to forward to the album's final song, a quiet and sparse throwback (to 40-plus years ago) production from Raphael Saadiq in which Blige professes new love to chilling effect." [...] Mikael Wood from Spin magazine also liked the album saying [...] "Mary J. Blige <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decade effecting a slow transformation from R's queen of pain to the closest thing the genre counts to Oprah Winfrey. Judging by the titles on Blige's latest, that transformation is almost complete: 'Good Love,' 'I Feel Good,' 'I Love U (Yes I Du).' It's hard to believe this is the same woman who once felt the need to announce she was done with drama. Yet despite the conviction that those track names suggest—and despite solid writing and production contributions from A-listers [...] it feels less vital than 2005's terrific The Breakthrough or 2007's Growing Pains [...] The result is minor Mary—strong by many standards, a bit tepid by hers." [...] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau offered the description, [...] "plainspoken, low-drama, midtempo love vows, with attempted glamour relegated to the cover shoot", while naming [...] "Tonight" [...] and [...] "I Am" [...] as the record's highlights.|$|E
