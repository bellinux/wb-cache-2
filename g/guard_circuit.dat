40|$|An active {{guarding}} {{technique is}} demonstrated for substrate immunity improvement on LC-tank oscillators. Active {{components in the}} oscillator, which are sensitive to substrate noise {{and contribute to the}} output most, are guarded from the substrate perturbation by applying the active <b>guarding</b> <b>circuit</b> to decouple and also compensate the noise current. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, noise signals of both single and multiple tones of various frequencies are injected to the substrate close to the guarded transistors and measure the sideband spurs by switching the active <b>guarding</b> <b>circuit</b> on/off respectively. Experimental results showed more than 11 dB noise suppression performances can be achieved in a wide frequency range from DC to 10 GHz.

50|$|Winter {{guard is}} similar to outdoor color guard (marched with a drum corps or marching band), except the {{performances}} are indoors on gymnasium floors through the winter season. The traditional marching band music heard during fall season is replaced with a recording of various musical genres. A common theme in many shows is loss or something that converys great emotion. The gymnasium floor typically is covered by an individually designed tarp (called a floor mat or floor by members) that generally reflects the show being performed on it. Occasionally the floor only acts as a backdrop so that the audience is drawn towards what the members are doing. The members may perform barefoot, but wearing jazz shoes or modern dance shoes is also common. There are several winter <b>guard</b> <b>circuits</b> for participating in competitions during indoor season, including TIA (Tournament Indoor Association), MAIN (Mid-Atlantic Indoor Network), AIA (Atlantic Indoor Association), WGI (Winter Guard International), and many more.|$|R

This paper analyzes the different coupling mechanisms between a 4 GHz prepower amplifier (PPA) and a 5 – 7 GHz LC-VCO designed in 0. 13 µm technology. Different experiments are carried out to reveal the dominant coupling mechanisms. Insight into these mechanisms leads to the proposal of proper countermeasures.
