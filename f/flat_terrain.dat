5|$|M-67 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US41 near Trenary {{east of the}} West Branch of the Whitefish River. From that intersection the highway runs east crossing Scott Creek before running into downtown Trenary along relatively <b>flat</b> <b>terrain.</b> East of town, the highway turns north running parallel to the AuTrain River Basin. The trunkline crosses Dexter Creek between Paulsen and Trout Lake roads. About halfway along the north–south segment of the highway, M-67 passes through the community of Limestone and crosses Johnson Creek. After running for , M-67 ends at a four-way intersection with M-94 and Tunteri Road.|$|E
5|$|SR 139 runs {{northwest}} and north over mostly <b>flat</b> <b>terrain</b> {{through the center}} of the national forest and the communities of Ambrose and Perez before turning northwest. The route continues through Copic, Newell, Stronghold, Homestead, and Tuber before cutting across the intermittent Tule Lake as the Lava Beds Highway through the city of Tulelake. During this segment, SR 139 passes directly through the former Tule Lake Segregation Unit, used to house Japanese-Americans during WWII. After passing through the former internment camp, SR 139 continues to the Oregon state line at Hatfield. At an intersection right on the state line, SR 161 begins to the west, and Oregon Route 39 continues northwest towards Klamath Falls.|$|E
5|$|Winnipeg {{has four}} major rivers: the Red, Assiniboine, La Salle and Seine. The city {{was subject to}} severe {{flooding}} in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826. Another large flood occurred in 1950, which caused {{millions of dollars in}} damage and mass evacuations. This flood prompted Duff Roblin's provincial government to build the Red River Floodway to protect the city; the project began in 1962 and was completed in 1968. In the 1997 flood, flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered very limited damage compared to the flood's impact on cities without such structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota. The generally <b>flat</b> <b>terrain</b> and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in many mosquitoes during wetter years.|$|E
30|$|The DSM errors {{follow a}} Gaussian {{function}} with mean and variance varying with the slope gradient. The mean errors {{are found to}} vary from 0  m on <b>flat</b> <b>terrains</b> to − 0.9  m on slopes of 80 ° (Fig.  2). The uncertainties vary from 1.3  m on <b>flat</b> <b>terrains</b> up to 9  m on slope gradients of 80 ° (Fig.  2). This shows a DSM uncertainty approximatively equal to 1 pixel size on <b>flat</b> <b>terrains,</b> which {{is also consistent with}} previous estimations using the Pléiades satellites (Berthier et al. 2014; Lacroix et al. 2015), the ASTER GDEM (Toutin 2002) and the SPOT 5 satellite (Toutin 2002; Berthier et al. 2014; Tsutsui et al. 2007).|$|R

40|$|Catchment {{area and}} {{watershed}} delineation {{is a common}} task in hydrology. The determination of the catchment is still as a challenge considered being crucial key issues particular in <b>flat</b> <b>terrains.</b> Three concepts could be briefly identified through: the manual delineation of a catchment based on a topographic map with contour lines which is a difficult task for <b>flat</b> <b>terrains,</b> by combination of field survey or evaluation of satellite images. The present research is focus on evaluating the possibility to delineate catchments from flat and arid areas by means of DTM avoiding hard techniques like river burning or other manual hydrological DTM corrections. Three GIS packages were used (Arc Hydrotools, TNTmips and RiverTools) within two DEM: the 90 m and 30 m SRTM {{in addition to the}} ASTER 30 m, the application sample presented by western Iraq desert—Ubaiydh wadi. A brief review is given how the delineation algorithms have been developed since the 1980 ’s. Where result shows that automated watershed analysis of <b>flat</b> <b>terrains</b> is cannot be done without manual evaluation and correction either by using several seeding points or river burning technique...|$|R
5|$|The area {{south of}} Lake Ladoga is a heavily forested area with many {{wetlands}} (especially peat deposits) {{closer to the}} lake. In addition the forest shielded both sides from visual observation. Both of these factors greatly hindered the mobility of artillery and vehicles in the area, providing a considerable advantage to the defending forces. One of the key locations were the Sinyavino heights which were some 150 metres higher than the surrounding <b>flat</b> <b>terrain,</b> which {{were some of the}} few dry and clear areas, and in addition provided good observation. Since the front line had changed very little since the blockade was established, the German forces had built a dense defensive network of strong points, interconnected by trenches and protected by extensive obstacles and interlocking artillery and mortar fire. The Neva River and marshes were partially frozen in winter which allowed infantry to cross it, but not heavy vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} {{was not an}} easy place to defend without artillery, as the plains made surprise attacks difficult. Except for the convent itself, the terrain did not offer any natural barriers that the patriots could exploit. Nevertheless, the <b>flat</b> <b>terrain</b> was ideal for cavalry manoeuvres, and the distance between the church and the west gully gave enough room for a cavalry charge. The royalists, on the other hand, could support their troops with their ships from the river. Without a supporting navy, or local batteries, San Martín had no means to attack the ships. Although the small path allowed them passage to the ships, it could force the royalist forces to bottleneck during a retreat while the long range guns of the ships protected them. San Martín studied the battlefield and readied the plan for the operation during the night, when the grenadiers were hidden inside the convent.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, barring {{intermittent}} passes and valleys (the major one being the corridor through Zhangjiakou and the Juyong Pass), the North China Plain remained shielded from the Mongolian steppe by the Yin Mountains. However, if this defence were breached, China's <b>flat</b> <b>terrain</b> offered no protection {{to the cities}} on the plain, including the imperial capitals of Beijing, Kaifeng, and Luoyang. Heading west along the Yin Mountains, the range ends where the Yellow River circles northwards upstream in the area known as the Ordos Looptechnically part of the steppe, but capable of irrigated agriculture. Although the Yellow River formed a theoretical natural boundary with the north, such a border so far into the steppe was difficult to maintain. The lands south of the Yellow River—the Hetao, the Ordos Desert, and the Loess Plateau—provided no natural barriers on the approach to the Wei River valley, the oft-called cradle of Chinese civilization where the ancient capital Xi'an lay. As such, control of the Ordos remained extremely important for the rulers of China: not only for potential influence over the steppe, {{but also for the}} security of China proper. The region's strategic importance combined with its untenability led many dynasties to place their first walls here.|$|E

30|$|With {{a single}} camera and without {{localization}} algorithm, {{it would be}} very difficult to have any geometrical information of the terrain.

5|$|In Bačka and Baranja, the Volksdeutsche and Hungarian {{authorities}} killed {{significant numbers}} of Serbs. After small-scale armed resistance broke out in Hungarian-occupied Bačka and Baranja {{in the second half}} of 1941, the Hungarian military reacted with heavy repressive measures. In September 1941 alone the Hungarian occupation forces summarily executed 313 people. Measures included the establishment of temporary concentration camps at Ada, Bačka Topola, Begeč, Odžaci, Bečej and Subotica, as well as at Novi Sad, Pechuj and Baja. According to Professor Paul Mojzes, some 2,000 Jews and a large number of Serbs were detained in these camps for periods from two weeks to two months, with Jews that had not been interned being employed as forced labourers. Several thousand people remained in camps until the end of the war. Some of the Jews that had migrated to Bačka and Baranja during the inter-war period were expelled to the NDH or the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were killed. The communist-led Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito was never strong in Bačka and Baranja because the <b>flat</b> <b>terrain</b> of the region did not lend itself to guerilla warfare, and because South Slavs, from which the Partisans drew their recruits, only made up one-third of the regional population. Some Partisan units raised in the occupied territories were sent to the NDH to reinforce Partisan formations operating there. Despite their initial resistance, the Chetnik movement was largely inactive during the occupation, maintaining some covert activity only. The Partisans and their regional committee had largely been destroyed by the end of 1941.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{southern}} Massachusetts, from its border with New York toward Worcester {{and to the}} ocean, experienced flooding. Most streams in western Massachusetts overflowed their banks, and in southeastern Massachusetts, which is largely <b>flat</b> <b>terrain,</b> streams flooded large areas along their channels; these streams moved slowly, while other areas in New England sustained damage due to the fast-moving nature of the floods. Record flooding was reported along 24stream gauges in the state, including ones that surpassed the peak set by the 1938 New England hurricane. Both the Charles and Neponset rivers were among those that flooded. About 40% {{of the city of}} Worcester was flooded during Diane, and in Russell, the state police forced many residents to evacuate. In Weymouth, the floods were considered at least a 1 in 50 year event. The Little River in Buffumville, Massachusetts had a peak discharge of 8,340ft³/s (236m³/s), which was 6.2times greater than the previous peak and 28.5times the average annual flooding. Flooded rivers breached run-of-the-river dams and covered nearby roadways, although dams with reservoirs resulted in less flooding. Nearly all dams along the French River were severely damaged or destroyed. One failed dam in West Auburn washed out a portion of U.S. Route 20, and the same route was washed out near Charlton. An overflown brook also damaged the Massachusetts Turnpike. A train on the Boston and Albany Railroad line plunged into a washed out portion along the Westfield River. Along the same river, floods destroyed roads and tobacco farms. In the state, 97houses were destroyed. Damage in Massachusetts was second worst of the affected states, totaling $110million; the damage was largely due to flooded basements. There were 12deaths in the state.|$|E

25|$|One {{theory is}} that the whole area was uplifted by crustal {{movements}} in the Miocene, and since then, erosion by wind and rain has reduced its thickness.

40|$|Time of {{concentration}} parameter is defined very loosely {{in literature and}} it is calculated rather subjectively in practice (Akan 1986). The situation becomes adverse as the terrain slope approaches zero; because the slope generally appears in the denominator of any formula for time {{of concentration}}, this time goes to infinity as the slope goes to zero. The variables affecting this time parameter on <b>flat</b> <b>terrains</b> have been studied through plot scale field experiments. It {{has been found that}} the antecedent moisture and rainfall rate control this parameter. Some of the existing time of concentration methods have been compared, and it is found that all the empirical models compared under predict this time parameter. This under prediction can be attributed first to the differing concepts of time of concentration previous researchers have modeled, secondly to the absence of any accounting for the initial moisture content in their respective equations and thirdly to the watersheds where these models have been calibrated. At lower time of concentrations, Izzard-based model predictions show some results close to the observed values. A methodology to determine the plot scale surface undulations has been developed to estimate the depression storage. Regression equations have been derived based upon the experiments to determine the overland flow times on a flat plot of 30 feet length with uniform rainfall intensity. The application of these equations on other lengths cannot be ascertained. Equations for the hydrograph slope on <b>flat</b> <b>terrains</b> have been determined for bare clay and grass plots...|$|R
30|$|Elevation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} parameters in flood analysis (Fig.  5 a), and occurrence of PFF in highly elevated areas is nearly impossible [34]. Water flows from highly elevated areas toward lower regions. Consequently, probability of any type of flood event is naturally high in low altitude or <b>flat</b> <b>terrains.</b> Rather than digital terrain model (DTM), digital surface model (DSM) must be considered in calculating altitude parameter because of the urban pattern of this study area, wherein high-rise buildings and other facilities act as flood obstacles. However, other topographical factors related to flood occurrence were derived from DTM. Thus, a highly precise DTM presents a significant basic datum [35].|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we extend {{state of}} the art Model Predictive Control (MPC) {{approaches}} to generate safe bipedal walking on slippery surfaces.

Simulation results show that increasing the walking velocity increases the possibility of slippage, while reducing the slippage possibility conflicts with reducing the tip-over possibility of the contact and vice versa.
