50|$|Short <b>dialing</b> {{codes are}} <b>assigned</b> for special {{services}} or network features.|$|R
50|$|The {{associated}} dial plan {{requires that}} all numbers, even for local calls, must be <b>dialed</b> with the <b>assigned</b> NDC, {{in contrast to}} previous plans. When dialing from within the country, a prefix 0 must be dialed.|$|R
50|$|Interoperability: Telephone {{calls to}} {{satellite}} terminals are often accomplished by <b>dialing</b> numbers <b>assigned</b> to the Global Mobile Satellite System, although most Globalstar users and some Iridium users are assigned country-based numbers. Thus, calls {{can be made}} to satellite phones from normal land-line and cellular terminals. However, pricing for terrestrial-satellite is often higher than pricing for satellite-terrestrial and satellite-satellite calls. Satellite-based Internet access is also fully interoperable with traditional land-based and mobile Internet and can access the same services, although cost is usually much higher and satellite link latency can affect some interactive services. Also, due to security concerns, the satellite segment and end-user can be (and in the case of BGAN often are) behind a NAT.|$|R
50|$|The {{first was}} an update {{to a small}} number of {{geographic}} dialling codes in response to the rapid late-1990s growth of telecommunications and impending exhaustion of local numbers in several cities. The change greatly expanded the pool of available numbers within those places while retaining 'local dialling' (the ability to dial local numbers directly, without needing to dial an area code first). The change affected the <b>dialling</b> codes <b>assigned</b> to Cardiff, Coventry, London, Northern Ireland, Portsmouth and Southampton, culminating in a large switch on 22 April 2000. All of these places moved to eight-digit local numbers ensuring sufficient local capacity for many decades (London saw a five-fold increase in capacity, for example). No other geographic area codes were affected.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} exchanges in areas {{adjacent}} to the London 01 area, local <b>dialling</b> codes were <b>assigned.</b> For example, Romford 5 digit numbers (which began with 2, 4, or 6) could be reached from 01 numbers by dialling 70 (instead of 0708), Romford 6 digit numbers (which began with 75 and were served by Romford South exchange) could be reached by dialling 3 instead of 0708 and Hornchurch numbers (5 digit) could be reached by dialling 49 instead of 04024.|$|R
5000|$|International <b>dialing</b> {{codes are}} <b>assigned</b> by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to its member states and their dependencies. However, as Taiwan {{was not an}} ITU member state, {{it had to be}} {{allocated}} the code +886 unofficially, with the ITU listing the code as 'reserved' until 2006. However, in that year, it formally allocated the code to [...] "Taiwan, China". Until the late 1970s, Taiwan used the code 866, but the 86 code was reassigned to the People's Republic of China in conformity with the ITU's official membership, forcing Taiwan to utilize another code for countries that wished to maintain direct dial connections.|$|R
40|$|Irwin Cohen (1947 -), a {{bibliophile}} {{and book}} collector, is {{manager of the}} Time Warner, Inc., Bookstore in New York City. When was in high school, Mr. Cohen first encountered and read Djuna Barnes's Nightwood, which led him to collect works by and about her. He eventually met Miss Barnes, when his wife, Francesca Belanger, then senior designer at <b>Dial</b> Press was <b>assigned</b> to Miss Barnes's last book, Creatures in an Alphabet. The Cohen collection consists of artwork, clippings, manuscripts, proofs, photographs, and publications by and about Djuna Barnes and her era. Materials related to the publication of Creatures in an Alphabet form {{a large part of}} the collection. The books that came with the collection were transferred to the Marylandia and Rare Books Department and the reference collection of the Archives and Manuscripts Department...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{road traffic}} {{simulators}} sometimes require the turn probabilities at the intersections {{of the network}} they are simulating. This report describes a method for updating the given probabilities following the occurrence of a traffic incident. Taking Dial's proportional assignment as the model of driver route choice behavior, we use a variant of <b>Dial's</b> algorithm to <b>assign</b> traffic to the turns of the network. We first estimate the origin and destination of traffic prior to the incident by computing an OD matrix (approximately) consistent with the assignment and the turn probabilities in normal traffic conditions. We then work backwards from the assignment in the changed conditions and the above OD matrix to determine {{a new set of}} turn probabilities appropriate in the new conditions. We validate this method on the urban networks constituting the test suite of the TRITRAM simulator. This Research was supported by the Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Computational Syst [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} informed, deliberative {{views of the}} older general public toward a policy of {{allowing}} surrogate consent for Alzheimer disease (AD) research. Methods: A total of 503 persons aged 50 recruited by random digit <b>dialing</b> were randomly <b>assigned</b> to 1 of 3 groups: deliberation, education, or control. The deliberation group attended an all-day education/peer deliberation session; the education group received written informa-tion only. Participants were surveyed at baseline, after deliberation session (or equivalent time), and 1 month after the session, regarding their attitudes toward a policy of allowing surrogate consent for research studies of varying risks and potential benefits (a lumbar punc-ture study, a drug randomized controlled trial, a vaccine randomized controlled trial, and an early phase gene transfer trial). Results: At baseline, a policy of surrogate consent for AD {{research was supported by}} 55 %– 91 %, depending on the scenario. The education group had a transient increase in support for one re-search scenario after receiving the information materials. In the deliberation group, support for surrogate consent was higher after deliberation for all scenarios (67 % to 97 %), with much of the increase sustained 1 month after the deliberation session. No changes occurred in the control group. The study’s limitations include self-selection of participants due to the demanding nature of attendance at the deliberation sessions. Conclusions: This sample of the older general public generally supported a policy of surrogate consent for AD research at baseline. Their support increased with democratic deliberation involving informed, in-depth exploration of the relevant scientific and ethical issues...|$|R
40|$|Challenges to random digit dialing {{have been}} documented, but the {{reliability}} of random digit dialing outcomes from telephone number calling, household identification, and enumeration has never been addressed, despite its potential to bias population representativeness by affecting completeness of coverage. The authors explored interobserver reliability of calls to numbers generated by random digit dialing for a 1990 – 1996 population-based case-control study in San Francisco, California, area women, using data from a quality control effort in which 122 of 4, 890 random digit <b>dialing</b> numbers were <b>assigned</b> to a second interviewer for recontacting within 4 months. The 34 numbers discrepant {{between the first and}} second calls did not differ from the 88 unchanged outcomes, and reliability was good (kappa = 0. 65, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 55, 0. 75). Eligibility (an adult woman in the household) was confirmed for nine of 11 eligible households. However, six of 29 households originally ineligible because of gender were eligible on recontact, and eligible residences rose from 24 % to 39 % between the two calls, although the two groups of eligible women did not differ in age or race. This underenumeration of women by random digit dialing confirms prior observations, although interviewer differences or changes in respondents or household composition {{between the first and second}} calls may have contributed. Recontact of gender-ineligible households may improve completeness of random digit dialing coverage for female populations.

40|$|Background: There is {{a longstanding}} {{concern about the}} {{accuracy}} of surrogate consent in representing the health care and research preferences of those who lose their ability to decide for themselves. We sought informed, deliberative views of the older general public (≥ 50 years old) regarding their willingness to participate in dementia research and to grant leeway to future surrogates to choose an option contrary to their stated wishes. Methodology/Principal Findings: 503 persons aged 50 + recruited by random digit <b>dialing</b> were randomly <b>assigned</b> {{to one of three}} groups: deliberation, education, or control. The deliberation group attended an all-day education/peer deliberation session; the education group received written information only. Participants were surveyed at baseline, after the deliberation session (or equivalent time), and one month after the session, regarding their willingness to participate in dementia research and to give leeway to surrogates, regarding studies of varying risk-benefit profiles (a lumbar puncture study, a drug randomized controlled trial, a vaccine randomized controlled trial, and an early phase gene transfer trial). At baseline, 48 % (gene transfer scenario) to 92 % (drug RCT) were willing to participate in future dementia research. A majority of respondents (57 – 71 % depending on scenario) were willing to give leeway to future surrogate decision-makers. Democratic deliberation increased willingness to participate in all scenarios, to grant leeway in 3 of 4 scenarios (lumbar puncture, vaccine, and gene transfer), and to enroll loved ones in research in all scenarios. On average, respondents were more willing to volunteer themselves for research than to enroll their loved ones. Conclusions/Significance: Most people were willing to grant leeway to their surrogates, and this willingness was either sustained or increased after democratic deliberation, suggesting that the attitude toward leeway is a reliable opinion. Eliciting a person’s current preferences about future research participation should also involve eliciting his or her leeway preferences...|$|R
