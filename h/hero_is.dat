5|$|The game {{begins when}} the player assumes {{the role of}} a {{stranger}} who arrives at Tantegel Castle. A castle guard tells him that a dragon has captured the princess and is holding her captive in a distant cave. Determined to rescue the princess and defeat the Dragonlord, he discovers an ancient tablet hidden inside a desert cave; carved on the tablet is a message from Erdrick that outlines what the hero needs to do to follow in Erdrick's footsteps and defeat the Dragonlord. The hero eventually rescues Princess Gwaelin, but realizes that in order to restore light to Alefgard, he must defeat the Dragonlord at Charlock Castle. After the hero collects a series of relics, he creates a bridge to reach Charlock and fights his way through the castle before finally confronting the Dragonlord. At this point the <b>hero</b> <b>is</b> given a dialogue choice – to side with the Dragonlord or to challenge him. If players choose the former, the game ends, the <b>hero</b> <b>is</b> put to sleep, and the game freezes; however, in the GBC remake, the hero instead wakes up from a bad dream. If players choose to fight, a final battle between the hero and the Dragonlord commences.|$|E

5|$|Ahalya's {{seduction}} by Indra and its repercussions {{form the}} central narrative {{of her story}} in all scriptural sources for her life. Although the Brahmanas (9th to 6th centuries BCE) are the earliest scriptures to hint at her relationship with Indra, the 5th- to 4th-century BCE Hindu epic Ramayana– whose <b>hero</b> <b>is</b> Rama– {{is the first to}} explicitly mention her extra-marital affair in detail. Medieval story-tellers often focus on Ahalya's deliverance by Rama, which is seen as proof of the saving grace of God. Her story has been retold numerous times in the scriptures and lives on in modern-age poetry and short stories, as well as in dance and drama. While ancient narratives are Rama-centric, contemporary ones focus on Ahalya, telling the story from her perspective. Other traditions deal with her children.|$|E
5|$|DJ <b>Hero</b> <b>is</b> a {{music video}} game, {{developed}} by FreeStyleGames {{and published by}} Activision as a rhythm game spin-off of the Guitar Hero franchise. It was released on October 27, 2009 in North America and on October 29, 2009 in Europe. The game is based on turntablism, the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously recorded songs using record players and sound effect generators, and features 94 remixes of two different songs from a selection of over 100 different songs across numerous genres.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero was {{generally}} well received by game journalists, praising the {{departure from the}} Guitar Hero series-style of gameplay, {{the use of the}} turntable controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform as strongly as expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, DJ <b>Hero</b> <b>is</b> stated by NPD Group to be the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America.|$|E

50|$|Johnny <b>Hero</b> <b>was</b> a clothed, 13 inch tall figure {{produced}} by Rosko Industries for Sears as a boy's doll (the term action figure had only begun being used with G.I. Joe).

5|$|Donkey Kong is {{considered}} to be the earliest video game with a storyline that visually unfolds on screen. The eponymous Donkey Kong character is the game's de facto villain. The <b>hero</b> <b>is</b> a carpenter originally unnamed in the Japanese arcade release, later named Jumpman and then Mario. The ape kidnaps Mario's girlfriend, originally known as Lady, but later renamed Pauline. The player must take the role of Mario and rescue her. This is the first occurrence of the damsel in distress scenario that would provide the template for countless video games to come.|$|E
5|$|Hero. A {{version of}} the team deathmatch where a <b>hero</b> <b>is</b> {{randomly}} selected on both sides for one minute, or until the hero dies. The hero gets a health boost, damage boost, and every weapon in the game (which the hero can keep if he survives the one minute). The key difference between Hero and TDM is that in TDM all enemy kills are counted to the team total whereas in Hero, only when killing the Hero or when the Hero kills an enemy are they counted towards the total.|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} {{column for the}} Detroit Free Press, Marta Salij said that Cal's {{identity}} crisis resembles Odysseus's fate. Whereas the mythical <b>hero</b> <b>is</b> troubled by Poseidon and succored by Athena, the intersex protagonist is affected by his chromosomes in a similar manner. John Sykes, professor of English and religion education, noted another Greek-hero reference. In {{a manner similar to}} Oedipus's fulfillment of Pythia's prophecy to slay his father and marry his mother, Callie validates the prediction her grandmother made before her birth by adopting a male identity. Eugenides also used the allusions to Greek mythology and modern pop music to show the passing of familial traits and idiosyncrasies {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E

5|$|In most Dragon Quest games, players must visit {{a church}} (known as a House of Healing in the NES translations) {{and talk to}} a priest or nun to save the games' progress; in Dragon Warrior, players {{had to talk to}} a king to save their progress, though the first two Dragon Quest titles for Famicom use a {{password}} save system. If the party dies in battle the group loses half of its gold and warps to the nearest save location where the <b>hero</b> <b>is</b> revived; players must then pay a priest or nun to revive their party members.|$|E
5|$|A Hero's Song is musically {{structured}} like a four-movement symphony, {{beginning with}} an allegro con fuoco, transitioning {{to a slow}} poco adagio lacrimosa, then including a scherzo and concluding with a coda. The piece {{is based on a}} short, energetic theme in B minor played in the violas, cellos, and basses {{at the start of the}} piece. This theme is featured in various forms throughout the first section. Following this, a slow section is marked by quiet music which symbolizes the hero's grief. It includes a funeral march, a musical form Dvořák also used in his Requiem, Stabat Mater, and Piano Quintet No. 2. The hero recovers from his grief as the mood of the music gradually brightens and goes into B major, leading into the dance-like scherzo. Finally, the triumph of the <b>hero</b> <b>is</b> represented by the victorious coda. The piece has a run time of approximately 22 minutes.|$|E
5|$|A Newsboy <b>Hero</b> <b>is</b> an American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. A standard melodrama, it has the alcoholic John Bailey return home in a drunken state.

John searches for them, but believes they are dead after reading a newspaper story and decides to commit suicide. He is saved {{by a member of the}} Salvation Army and then is reunited with his family. The only known credit in the production is that of Marie Eline as the couple's child, Marie. The film was released on February 24, 1911, and it received mixed reviews by critics over its melodramatic plot, but the actors strong skills was the strongest redeeming factor in the negative reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|After {{getting off}} the bed, the <b>Hero</b> <b>is</b> then given a task to get a crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E
5|$|DJ <b>Hero</b> <b>is</b> {{a rhythm}} video {{game and a}} {{spin-off}} of the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by FreeStyleGames and published by Activision worldwide in October 2009 for the PlayStation 2 and 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 consoles. The game is based on turntablism, requiring {{the use of a}} special game controller that includes a turntable surface with three buttons, a crossfader bar, and an effects dial, in addition to other controller buttons used to manipulate in-game menus. In a manner similar to Guitar Hero, players use the turntable controller to mimic the actions of a disc jockey (DJ), such as scratching and crossfading between two different songs, as graphical representations of these actions scroll down on screen towards the player in time with the music. Unlike previous Guitar Hero games, there is no performance meter, and instead players are simply challenged to obtain the best score possible in order to earn stars (from zero to five for each mix) to unlock new songs, venues, and characters. The player can attempt these songs at one of four difficulties (Easy to Expert), with higher difficulties providing more actions for the player to perform within the song.|$|E
5|$|During battles, {{a weapon}} limit gauge is shown, filling up over time; by waiting to attack until the gauge is filled up, the player {{can use a}} more {{powerful}} attack specific to the currently equipped weapon. The gauge resets to zero whenever the player attacks or gets hit by an attack. The player is able to use various different types of weapons, such as swords, axes and flails, each having a different attack pattern: sword attacks, for example, are mid-ranged swings and stabs, while flail attacks are long-ranged and reach out {{in a straight line}} from the hero. Most weapons {{can also be used to}} affect the environment: the player can cut down trees with axes, for instance. There are also variants of each weapon type with bonus strengths, such as flame variations, which are effective against ice monsters. At various points in the game, the <b>hero</b> <b>is</b> accompanied by non-player characters who help the player defeat enemies. These companions have different abilities that the player can use, such as Fuji's healing spell and Watt's shop.|$|E
50|$|Blood of <b>Heroes</b> <b>is</b> {{a superhero}} {{role-playing}} game published by Pulsar Games. It was {{a successor to}} DC Heroes and used that game's Mayfair Exponential Game System, or MEGS. Blood of <b>Heroes</b> <b>is</b> set in its own fictional world, rather than the DC universe.|$|R
50|$|In the show's world, popular superheroes have {{comic books}} devoted to them, {{but the actual}} actions of all <b>heroes</b> <b>are</b> also {{reviewed}} by critics, exactly like comic books. <b>Heroes</b> <b>are</b> thus subject to criticism not only for incompetence, but also for being insufficiently entertaining.|$|R
5000|$|No <b>Heroes</b> <b>was</b> given 8.1/10 by Brandon Stosuy of Pitchfork Media {{as he said}} [...] "Conceptually {{reminiscent}} of the way Orthrelm's OV rocked socks within a tight framework, No <b>Heroes</b> <b>is</b> one of the year's most musically cohesive ways to keep pulses beating rapidly." ...|$|R
