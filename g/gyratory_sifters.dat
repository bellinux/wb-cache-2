50|$|Most {{modern day}} gyratory {{screening}} machines employ {{the use of}} screen cleaners, which act to prevent any clogging of the <b>gyratory</b> <b>sifters.</b> The motion and mechanism of a gyratory screener enables more energy to be imparted onto the cleaners, thus actively preventing the occurrence of build-up on the <b>gyratory</b> <b>sifters.</b> In the long run, the prevention of build-up in the sifters would enable the gyratory screener to have a longer lifespan.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{study of}} <b>gyratory</b> <b>sifters,</b> {{which are used}} to remove {{aggregate}} or alien substances, is presented. The effects of operating conditions, such as the bed depth of powder, the sieve revolving speed, and {{the size and shape}} of the sieve, on sifting capacity or sifting rate are investigated. The motion of the powder bed on a screening surface is also observed. Experimental results show that the sifting rate is very sensitive to the bed depth. There is an optimum bed depth at which the sifting rate is maximized. The sifting rate of a circular sieve is higher that of a rectangular sieve. The sifting capacity increases with the revolving speed...|$|E
50|$|The <b>gyratory</b> <b>sifter</b> has {{a complex}} flow pattern, as well a complex drive mechanism, {{which is more}} complex than most other sifters. This could pose problems, as the {{complexity}} of the operating mechanism makes the unit harder to operate.|$|R
50|$|The <b>gyratory</b> <b>sifter</b> {{operates}} at a gentle pace, {{and has a}} non-robust motion during operation. The gentle motion involved will not break up any lumps or agglomerates found in the feed. Thus, the lumps in the feed would be discarded in the top frame discharge, along with other large particles.|$|R
50|$|A gyratory {{screener}} {{can be used}} in many situations, {{regardless of}} whether the solid-solid mixture to be separated consists of a binary mixture, or a multi-fraction mixture. This is owing {{to the fact that the}} flexibility of usage of the <b>gyratory</b> <b>sifter</b> screens eliminates the need for excess screen materials, cleaners or other forms of additional apparatus.|$|R
50|$|The lack of {{vertical}} {{motion in the}} mechanism of a <b>gyratory</b> <b>sifter,</b> coupled with its relatively gentle motion enables a higher accuracy in the separation of materials in the solid-solid mixture. The longer stroke involved in gyratory machines allows the finer particles {{to settle down and}} spread out. This, coupled with the horizontal motion used maximises the opportunity for the finer particles to pass, thus enhancing the quality and efficiency of separation.|$|R
40|$|Motion of {{a powder}} bed is {{analyzed}} by assuming a simplified model {{to study the}} sifting mechanism of a <b>gyratory</b> <b>sifter.</b> Analysis shows that the relative motion of {{the bottom of the}} power bed with respect to the sieve diminishes as the bed depth increases. The sifting rate, or the particle flow through a sieve, is treated in a manner analogous to that for the fluid flow through an orifice. The proposed model shows general agreement with the experiment though the experimental results are more dependent on revolving speed than the analytical ones...|$|R
