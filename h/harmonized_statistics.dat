40|$|The CEPII Country Profiles {{put forward}} an {{original}} tool {{to analyze the}} insertion of eighty countries in international trade using databases developed by the CEPII. Thus, CHELEM which provides long period trade data since the 1960 s in goods and services, GDP and population; MAcMap which estimates the average country’s protection by partners and products; BACI which offers <b>harmonized</b> <b>statistics</b> on values and quantities at a very detailed level of products; and World Trade Flows Characterization (WTFC) which defines type and price range of trade flows, are used to present a consistent set of indicators. Tables and figures are grouped under seven thematic sections: broad patterns; tariff protection; products and partners; comparative advantages; one-way and two-way trade; unit value ranges; and terms of trade. This document specifies the indicators, databases and classifications used i...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{combines}} different {{strands of}} the productivity literature {{to investigate the}} effect of idiosyncratic (firm-level) policy distortions on aggregate outcomes. On the one hand, {{a growing body of}} empirical research has been relating cross-country differences in key economic outcomes, such as productivity or output per capita, to differences in policies and institutions that shape the business environment. On the other hand, a branch of empirical research has attempted to shed light on the determinants of productivity at the firm level and the evolution of the distribution of productivity across firms within each industry. In this paper, we exploit a rich source of data with <b>harmonized</b> <b>statistics</b> on firm level variation within industries for a number of countries. Our key empirical finding is that there is substantial variation in the within-industry covariance between size and productivity across countries, but this covariance varies significantly across countries and is affected by the presence of idiosyncratic distortions. We develop a model in which heterogeneous firms face adjustment frictions (overhead labor and quasi-fixed capital) and idiosyncratic distortions. We show that the model can be readily calibrated to match the observed cross-country patterns of the within-industry covariance between productivity and size and thus help to explain the observed differences in aggregate performance. ...|$|E
40|$|How can we <b>harmonize</b> <b>statistics</b> on the CCI of the Spanish {{regions to}} European standards? Spanish Statistics Institute (INE) offers limited {{data on the}} Annual Services Survey (ASS). It was {{necessary}} to have statistics on the specific ASS for this research project. Solution: Signing of a supply agreement INE data-UAB + defining a Statistical model for Value Assignment with UAB Service of Applied Statistics. Two difficulties with supplied data: NACE coding: Data available only included NACE codes with two digits. Distortions in some subcategories (Architecture and Advertising) occurred. Example: the NACE 71 includes Architecture together with Technical Engineering Services, Technical Testing and Analysis. We should have four-digit NCEA data, class 7111, which only includes architecture. Disaggregation by region: In subcategories for Performing Arts and Libraries, archives and museums, the data supplied by the INE-UAB agreement were not disaggregated by region. Results: Data from 2008 – 2014; Four indicators: employment, number of companies, business turnover, gross added value; Maps + graphics per region & Spain; Individual reports for each region (data + relevant policy issues) ...|$|R

40|$|Eurostat and the European National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) need {{to provide}} {{detailed}} high-quality data on all relevant aspects (economic, social, demographic, environmental) of modern societies. Moreover, the quality declaration of the European Statistical System (ESS) states that continuously improving a programme of <b>harmonized</b> European <b>statistics</b> {{is one of the}} major objectives of the ESS. Given the differences among the existing national statistical systems, the development of new approaches aiming at standardizing the statistical production processes for improving the quality of statistics and for a successful harmonization is essential. In particular, one of the two main purposes of the “European Statistics Code of Practice”, adopted by the Statistical Programme Committee on 24 February 2005, is: “To promote the application of best international statistical principles, methods and practices by all producers of European Statistics in order to enhance their quality”. In this framework, the European Community (represented by the Commission of the European Com-munities) is supporting the development of a set of handbooks on current best methods in order to facilitate the implementation of principle 8 of the Code of Practice- “Appropriate statistical proce-dures, implemented from data collection to data validation, must underpin quality statistics”.

40|$|Livestock {{remains the}} world¿s largest user {{of land and}} is {{strongly}} related to grassland and feed-crop production. Assessments of environmental impacts of livestock farming require detailed knowledge {{of the presence of}} livestock, farming practices, and environmental conditions. The present Europe-wide livestock distribution information is generally restricted to a spatial resolution of NUTS 2 (province level). This paper presents a modelling approach to determine the spatial distribution of livestock at the landscape level. Location factors for livestock occurrence were explored and applied to consistent and <b>harmonized</b> EU-wide regional <b>statistics</b> to produce a detailed spatial distribution of livestock numbers. Both an expert-based and an empirical approach were applied in order to disaggregate the data to grid level. The resulting livestock maps were validated. Results differ between the two downscaling approaches but also between livestock types and countries. While both the expert-based and empirical approach are equally suited to modelling herbivores, in general, the spatial distribution of monogastrics can be better modelled by applying the empirical approac...|$|R
40|$|On the {{measurement}} of environmental taxes The purpose of environmental taxes is to correct the market when it fails to take environmental damages into account, i. e. to internalize the Pigouvian element. In addition, fiscal taxes are levied on both polluting and clean goods, which may follow the Ramsey principle. In practical policy, environmental and fiscal taxes are conceptually intertwined. This mixture complicates the calculation of the extent and {{the evaluation of the}} effects of environmental taxes. Eurostat, OECD and IEA include all taxes related to energy, transport and pollution, and most resource taxes in their international measurement of environmentally related taxes. Consequently, numerous fiscal taxes are added together with the environmental taxes. This article discusses the distinctions between the Pigouvian and the fiscal taxes in light of tax theory. The revenues following the Eurostat et al. statistical basis deviate significantly from the revenues from the environmental taxes defined on the basis of theory. Steps should be taken to <b>harmonize</b> the international <b>statistics</b> of environmental taxes with economic tax theory...|$|R

40|$|Irrigation {{agriculture}} is {{of a major}} socio-economic importance for the Central Asian countries Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Remote agricultural areas, the lack of <b>harmonized</b> agricultural <b>statistics,</b> the intensification of agriculture combined with water scarcity as well as unsustainable water use management make the integrated and combined use of Remote Sensing and Web GIS a very valuable technique for crop monitoring and to support the mitigation of those problems. Thus, within {{the frame of the}} Central Asian Water project (CAWa), a web-based mapping platform, the Water Use Efficiency Monitor in Central Asia (WUEMoCA), is being currently developed. It is comprised of a coherent and automated interdisciplinary processing chain starting from the automated download of Terra MODIS data and the computation of NDVI time series. A subsequent land use classification and crop yield estimation via machine learning algorithms for image processing provides a retrospective crop inventory for all years between 2000 and 2016 so far. Parallely, the near-real time early estimation of the current agricultural vegetation condition provides information about phenological anomalies and drought-affected regions. The systematic storage of these large amounts of processed multitemporal MODIS data requires the deployment of a spatial database with supportive raster analysis functionalities such as PostgreSQL/PostGIS in which all results are spatially aggregated on administrative levels such as water use associations, state districts and state provinces. Morover, the connectivity between a GeoServer and PostGIS is natively integrated, allowing for the automatic creation of Web Map Services (WMS) directly from the database. Interactive maps are visualized in a client application based on the mapping framework OpenLayers which is tailored for the specific needs of Central Asian water management. This makes a web-based presentation of all results possible. At last, the use of a PostGIS database also provides the possibility to establish a land use indicator system for all administrative levels with secondary information such as land use coefficient, crop diversity, land use intensity and irrigated crop acreage.

40|$|During {{the past}} quarter century, the {{globalisation}} of the economy has caused international trade to become remarkably dynamic. Over the same period international trade also experienced fundamental changes : intra-industry trade in manufacturing products has dramatically increased and new markets and competing countries have emerged. Belgium has long been integrated into this global framework, and its economic development and prosperity have been largely based on close trading links with other countries. Its degree of openness is among the highest of the euro area countries, due in particular to intense trade with these countries. Since 1980, Belgium has been relatively successful in maintaining its position in international trade. The trade balance has initially improved and has subsequently remained positive at around 3 p. c. of GDP. Global market shares have remained relatively stable in value terms. However, using <b>harmonized</b> foreign trade <b>statistics,</b> a more detailed analysis of Belgium’s export volume over the period 1995 - 2002 reveals that Belgium has lost 5. 8 p. c. of its market share, while the three neighbouring countries have on average increased their share by 3. 8 p. c. This negative result can be attributed in part to an unfavourable export product specialisation, in particular the large share of basic chemicals, metal products and textiles in total trade and the under-representation of machinery and data-processing hardware, electronic and telecommunication equipment.

40|$|Ethiopia’s {{agricultural}} sector is highly diverse {{and subject to}} change due to different factors such as climate and population growth. Consequently, competition for available land, water, energy, and other inputs increases, posing pressure on the rural population’s livelihoods and food security. It is therefore imperative to analyze farmer’s production choices under these changing circumstances. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop a methodology to establish country-wide farm typologies allowing for both a spatial and temporal analysis of the evolution of the {{agricultural sector}}, and in particular smallholders' food security and income in Ethiopia. First, household survey data is employed to categorize smallholder farming systems according to their agro-ecological zone, farm size, main activities and degree of intensification. Second, farming systems are extrapolated using a multinomial logit-regression. Resulting combinations of farming-system occurrence and their production activities are <b>harmonized</b> with national <b>statistics</b> and subsequently equipped with the potential to intensify. Compared with other typologies that commonly only focus on the distribution of farming systems, this study fills the typology with data, allowing for the analysis of income and food security over space and time. It is concluded that livestock-oriented systems are less profitable than crop-oriented systems and more prone to food-insecurity. Increased input intensification is one way to reduce pressure on cropland expansion caused by the expected increase in population, but has to go together with other methods to fully alleviate pressure on land and thereby poverty and food insecurity...|$|R
