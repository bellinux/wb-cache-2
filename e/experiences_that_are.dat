25|$|A similar defense {{comes from}} Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived {{the theory of}} epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not {{play a role in}} {{physical}} states. Jackson argues that {{there are two kinds of}} dualism. The first is substance dualism that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is property dualism that says that body and soul are different properties of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not yet).

He indicated that a future release might including other writers and not necessarily Duffy.

25|$|This sentimental, anti-intellectual form of pietism {{is seen in}} {{the thought}} and {{teaching}} of Zinzendorf, founder of the Moravians; but more intellectually rigorous forms of pietism are seen in the teachings of John Wesley, which were themselves influenced by Zinzendorf, and in the teachings of American preachers Jonathan Edwards, who restored to pietism Gerson's focus on obedience and borrowed from early church teachers Origen and Gregory of Nyssa the notion that humans yearn for God, and John Woolman, who combined a mystical view of the world with a deep concern for social issues; like Wesley, Woolman was influenced by Jakob Böhme, William Law and The Imitation of Christ. The combination of pietistic devotion and mystical <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> found in Woolman and Wesley are also found in their Dutch contemporary Tersteegen, who brings back the notion of the nous ("mind") as the site of God's interaction with our souls; through the work of the Spirit, our mind is able to intuitively recognize the immediate presence of God in our midst.|$|E

500|$|Modern {{medical and}} {{psychological}} investigations into consciousness {{are based on}} psychological experiments (including, for example, the investigation of priming effects using subliminal stimuli), and on case studies of alterations in consciousness produced by trauma, illness, or drugs. [...] Broadly viewed, scientific approaches are based on two core concepts. [...] The first identifies the content of consciousness with the <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> reported by human subjects; the second makes use {{of the concept of}} consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals who deal with patients whose behavior is impaired. [...] In either case, the ultimate goals are to develop techniques for assessing consciousness objectively in humans as well as other animals, and to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms that underlie it.|$|E
500|$|In the 1962 Marsh Chapel Experiment, {{which was}} run by Pahnke at the Harvard Divinity School under the {{supervision}} of Timothy Leary, almost all of the graduate degree divinity student volunteers who received psilocybin reported profound religious experiences. One of the participants was religious scholar Huston Smith, author of several textbooks on comparative religion; he later described his experience as [...] "the most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced." [...] In a 25-year followup to the experiment, all of the subjects given psilocybin described their experience as having elements of [...] "a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of the high points of their spiritual life". Psychedelic researcher Rick Doblin considered the study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of the double-blind procedure, and several imprecise questions in the mystical experience questionnaire. Nevertheless, he said that the study cast [...] "a considerable doubt on the assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed by drugs are in any way inferior to non-drug mystical experiences in both their immediate content and long-term effects". This sentiment was echoed by psychiatrist William A. Richards, who in a 2007 review stated [...] " [...] mushroom use may constitute one technology for evoking revelatory <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> similar, if not identical, to those that occur through so-called spontaneous alterations of brain chemistry." ...|$|E
500|$|Language and {{literacy}} have far reaching effects as they facilitate self-expression and social interaction {{in a variety}} of settings. Furthermore, literacy fosters independence by providing access to educational and vocational opportunities. Children whose disabilities require AAC often experience developmental delays in language skills such as vocabulary knowledge, length of sentences, syntax, and impaired pragmatic skills. These delays may be {{due in part to the}} fact that expressive language is limited by more than the children's own language knowledge. Unlike speaking children, children who use AAC do not always have access to their AAC system, and don't select the content available on the device. These external characteristics may impact language learning opportunities. Most children in this category do not achieve literacy skills beyond that of a typically developing 7–8 year old. [...] Cognitive, language and learning delays contribute to difficulty with literacy development, but environmental factors also play a role. The most literate AAC users often report having access to abundant reading and writing material at home as well as in school during childhood. Studies have shown that many children who use AAC have literacy <b>experiences</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> reduced quality, quantity, and opportunity at home and at school as compared to children without disabilities. Research suggests that with explicit reading instruction, AAC users can develop good literacy skills.|$|E

5000|$|Player {{performance}} (e.g., {{highest position}} on the scoreboard, highest amount of earned points) does not {{increase the amount of}} rank <b>experience</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> earned because rank experience is earned on a time basis (time spent playing the game).
