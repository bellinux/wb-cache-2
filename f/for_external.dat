5|$|If cancer growth blocks a short {{section of}} bronchus, {{brachytherapy}} (localized radiotherapy) {{may be given}} directly inside the airway to open the passage.

5|$|In January 1952, Pollard succeeded Colonel John Wilton as Director of Military Operations and Plans at Army Headquarters, {{and became}} Chairman of the Joint Planning Committee. That August {{he was one}} of the Australian delegates joining the Minister <b>for</b> <b>External</b> Affairs, Richard Casey, for the inaugural meeting of the ANZUS Council in Honolulu; the US and New Zealand {{delegations}} were led, respectively, by Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Minister <b>for</b> <b>External</b> Affairs Clifton Webb.

30|$|For {{the sake}} of query efficiency, it is {{necessary}} to build indexes <b>for</b> the <b>external</b> factors. Similar to building indexes for bus journey data (Sect.  3.2), <b>for</b> each <b>external</b> factor, we build corresponding indexes based on the domain partition. <b>For</b> an <b>external</b> factor whose data type is continuous (e.g., average daily temperature), the index is built like building the index on “Delay”. Specifically, for each bus journey record, we construct a bit-vector indicating the interval that the value of average daily temperature locates in. <b>For</b> an <b>external</b> factor whose data type is enumerable (e.g., daily weather activity), the index is built like building the index on “day of the week”. Specifically, we use a set of bit-vectors to indicate the values of daily weather for all bus journey records.|$|R

5|$|The UN is financed from {{assessed}} {{and voluntary}} contributions from member states. The General Assembly approves the regular budget and determines the assessment for each member. This is broadly {{based on the}} relative capacity of each country to pay, as measured by its gross national income (GNI), with adjustments <b>for</b> <b>external</b> debt and low per capita income. The two-year budget for 2012–13 was $5.512 billion in total.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} seven {{companies}} began the development of USB in 1994: Compaq, DEC, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, and Nortel. The goal was to make it fundamentally easier to connect external devices to PCs by replacing the multitude of connectors {{at the back of}} PCs, addressing the usability issues of existing interfaces, and simplifying software configuration of all devices connected to USB, as well as permitting greater data rates <b>for</b> <b>external</b> devices. A team including Ajay Bhatt worked on the standard at Intel; the first integrated circuits supporting USB were produced by Intel in 1995.|$|E

Networking {{was supported}} with two built-in Gigabit Ethernet ports. 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi support (AirPort Extreme) required an optional module in the Mid 2006, Early 2008 and Early 2009 models, {{whereas in the}} 2010 model and later Wi-Fi was standard. Bluetooth also required an optional module in the Mid 2006 model, but was standard in the Early 2008 and newer models. Displays were supported by one or (optionally) more PCIe graphics cards. More recent cards featured two Mini DisplayPort connectors and one dual-link Digital Visual Interface (DVI) port, with various configurations of on-card graphics memory available.|$|E

Instead, Tharoor became chairman of Dubai-based Afras Ventures, which established the Afras Academy for Business Communication (AABC) in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India, the city in which he would go on to win two parliamentary elections. He also spoke around the world about India and Kerala, where he spent increasing amounts of time before moving for good to India in October 2008.|$|E

5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common <b>for</b> <b>external</b> hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E
