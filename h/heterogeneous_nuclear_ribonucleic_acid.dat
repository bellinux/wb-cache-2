40|$|The rate of {{synthesis}} in Chinese hamster {{cells of}} 5 ' cap structures, m 7 GpppNmp, in large (greater than 700 bases) <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (RNA) molecules is {{two to three}} times faster than the synthesis of 3 '-terminal polyadenylic acid segments. As judged by presence of caps, newly synthesized polysomal messenger RNA, exclusive of messenger RNA the size of histone messenger RNA, is more than 90 % in the polyadenylated category. It appears, therefore, that between half and two-thirds of the long capped heterogeneous nuclear RNA molecules do not contribute a capped polysomal derivative to the cytoplasm. There are capped, nonpolysomal, non-polyadenylated molecules with a rapid turnover rate that fractionate with the cytoplasm. These metabolically unstable molecules either could represent leakage into the cytoplasm during fractionation or could truly spend a brief time in the cytoplasm before decay...|$|E
40|$|<b>Heterogeneous</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (hnRNA) {{molecules}} in eucaryotic cell nuclei associate with a well-defined group of abundant, highly conserved proteins to form heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP). The exact {{manner in which}} these 30 S complexes assemble on nuclear transcripts, however, has not been well documented. To determine whether any site selectivity {{in the formation of}} hnRNP can be detected (e. g., preferential recognition of intervening sequences or of premessage regions), we investigated the distribution of 30 S hnRNP on a particular nuclear RNA, the polyoma virus late transcript. Hybridization studies showed not only that the majority of polyoma late nuclear RNA sequences can be isolated in the form of 30 S complexes, but that the RNP were located equally on intervening sequences and premessage portions of the transcript. The latter conclusion was confirmed by ribonuclease T 1 oligonucleotide fingerprint analysis of polyoma virus-specific RNA recovered from native 30 S complexes. However, fingerprint analysis of the small segments of viral RNA in the 30 S fraction that survived extensive ribonuclease treatment revealed that oligonucleotides corresponding to intervening sequences were preferentially lost. We discuss these findings in relation to the structure of 30 S hnRNP and their function in RNA biogenesis...|$|E

Here we show that, like HEXIM 1, a highly homologous protein named HEXIM 2 also possesses the ability to inactivate P-TEFb to suppress transcription through a 7 SK-mediated interaction with P-TEFb. Furthermore, HEXIM 1 and HEXIM 2 can form stable homo- and hetero-oligomers (most likely dimers), which may nucleate {{the formation of the}} 7 SK small <b>nuclear</b> <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> particle.

In HEXIM 1 -knocked down cells, HEXIM 2 can functionally and quantitatively compensate for the loss of HEXIM 1 to maintain a constant level of the 7 SK/ HEXIM-bound P-TEFb.

40|$|The yeast {{cell nucleus}} has {{previously}} {{been shown to be}} divided into two regions by a variety of microscopic approaches.

These studies were performed with the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy, most of the abundant snRNAs were localized to the portion of the nucleus which has heretofore been referred to as the nucleolus.

During interphase the snRNA label, which is almost exclusively nuclear, is distributed fairly uniformly through the nucleus with a slightly higher amount of label over chromatin than over nonchromatin areas. During prophase the sn-RNAs, which continue to be largely nuclear, become highly concentrated in the condensing chromosomes. At metaphase, almost all of the snRNAs are cytoplasmic and essentially none are associated with the maximally condensed chromatin.

The box H/ACA scaRNAs carry the com-mon CAB box motif (consensus, ugAG) that is re-quired for both WDR 79 binding and CB-specific accu-mulation. Thus far, no cis-acting CB-localization ele-ment has been reported for vertebrate box C/D scaR-NAs. In this study, systematic mutational analysis of the human U 90 and another newly identified box C/D scaRNA, mgU 2 - 47, demonstrated that the CB-specific accumulation of vertebrate intron-encoded box C/D scaRNAs relies on GU- or UG-dominated dinucleotide repeat sequences which are predicted to form the terminal stem-loop of the RNA apical hair-pin. While the loop nucleotides are unimportant, the adjacent terminal helix that is composed mostly of consecutive G. U and U.

40|$|THE {{early stages}} of feeding the {{carcinogens}} thioacetamide and p-dimethylaminoazobenzene (DAB) to rats are characterised by marked morphological changes in the liver cell nucleus. These changes are accompanied {{by an increase in}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (RNA) (Rees, Rowland and Vareoe, 1965 a). In vrio studies using 32 p had indicated that this was the result of an increased nuclear RNA synthesis (Rees, et al., 1965 a). We considered that this increase in RNA synthesis {{played an important role in}} the sequence of events occurring within these nuclei. It was the purpose of the present study to examine in more detail nuclear RNA synthesis and to investigate whether such an alteration in RNA synthesis was accompanied by a change in the pattern of cytoplasmic enzymes. We have therefore measured the in vitro incorporation of tritiated uridine into the nucleus and nucleolus of " tissue chop " preparations and the in vitro RNA polymerase activity of nucleoli prepared from the livers of control and carcinogen fed rats. Quantitative measurements of tryptophan pyrrolase activity and qualitative studies of the isoenzyme pattern of lactate dehydrogenase have been made on liver homogenates from both control and treated rats. METHODS Animals and diets Male Wistar albino rats of 150 - 200 g. were used throughout the investigation.

40|$|HEp- 2 {{cells were}} pulse-labeled at {{different}} times after infection with herpes simplex virus, and <b>nuclear</b> <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (RNA) and cytoplasmic RNA were examined. The data showed the following: (i) Analysis by acrylamide gel electrophoresis of cytoplasmic RNA of cells infected at high multiplicities [80 to 200 plaque-forming units (PFU) /cell] revealed that ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis falls to less than 10 % of control (uninfected cell) values by 5 hr after infection. The synthesis of 4 S RNA also declined but not as rapidly, and at its lowest level it was still 20 % of control values. At lower multiplicities (20 PFU), the rate of inhibition was slower than at high multiplicities. However, at all multiplicities the rates of inhibition of 18 S and 28 S rRNA remained identical and {{higher than that of}} 4 S RNA. (ii) Analysis of nuclear RNA of cells infected at high multiplicities by sucrose density gradient centrifugation showed that the synthesis and methylation of 45 S rRNA precursor continued at a reduced but significant rate (ca. 30 % of control values) at times after infection when no radioactive uridine was incorporated or could be chased into 28 S and 18 S rRNA. This indicates that the inhibition of rRNA synthesis after herpesvirus infection is a result of two processes: a decrease in the rate of synthesis of 45 S RNA and a decrease in the rate of processing of that 45 S RNA that is synthesized. (iii) Hybridization of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA of infected cells with herpesvirus DNA revealed that a significant proportion of the total viral RNA in the nucleus has a sedimentation coefficient of 50 S or greater. The sedimentation coefficient of virus-specific RNA associated with cytoplasmic polyribosomes is smaller with a maximum at 16 S to 20 S, but there is some rapidly sedimenting RNA (> 28 S) here too. (iv) Finally, there was leakage of low-molecular weight (4 S) RNA from infected cells, the leakage being approximately three-fold that of uninfected cells by approximately 5 hr after infection...|$|R

The existance of N-[(9 -beta-D-ribofuranosyl- 2 -methylthiopurin- 6 -yl) carbamoyl]threonine in two species of lysine transfer <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acids</b> was also confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Four of these thionucleosides [...] N 6 -(delta 2 -isopenenyl) - 2 -methylthioadenosine, 2 -methylthioadenosine, 5 -carboxymethylaminomethyl- 2 -thiouridine, and the unknown designated X 1 [...] occurred only in specific areas in the elution profile of an RPC- 5 column and probably affect the chromatographic properties of the transfer <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acids</b> containing them. In contrast with Escherichia coli, where 4 -thiouridine is the most frequent type of sulfur-containing modification, approximately one-third of the sulfur groups in B. subtilis transfer <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> are present as thiomethyl groups on the 2 position of an adenosine or modified adenosine residue...|$|R
