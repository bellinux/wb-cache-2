5|$|As a builder, Hugh {{built the}} New Bridge, now Elvet Bridge, <b>in</b> <b>Durham,</b> the second stone {{bridge in the}} town. Hugh also oversaw work on Durham Cathedral, decorating the inside with marble, {{installing}} stained glass windows, putting in a shrine for the bones of Bede, and building the Galilee Chapel on {{the west end of}} the cathedral. Originally, Puiset had planned to put in a Lady Chapel {{on the east side of}} the cathedral, but the ground was unsuitable, and instead work began on the Galilee Chapel on the west side of the cathedral. The Galilee Chapel is unusual in that it has five aisles, and quatrefoil, or four lobed, piers. A model for the chapel may have been the work being done on York Minster in rebuilding the choir. The current Norman doorway and the gallery that is above the doorway <b>in</b> <b>Durham</b> Castle were also the work of Hugh, which was part of a hall built in the bailey of the castle. Along with the king of Scots, he built the first bridge over the River Tweed at Berwick. He also rebuilt Norham Castle, replacing the previous buildings built by Ranulf Flambard, an earlier bishop, with a stone castle.|$|E
