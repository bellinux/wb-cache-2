40|$|ABSTRACT: Replacing {{conventional}} tillage (CT) with no-tillage (NT) management alters the pe-doenvironment {{and the rate}} of topsoil processes, with possible effects on dissolution processes associated with <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> and therefore soil mineralogy. This study aimed to determine the effect of NT on the content and distribution of types of <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> in a Rhodic Paleudult in southern Brazil. Soil samples were collected at eight depths within the 0. 00 - 0. 80 m layer under CT and NT in a long-term experiment (21 years). Mineralogical identification was conducted by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the Fe content related to specific types of <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> determined by selective dissolution and diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy. Kaolinite, quartz, goethite, hematite, and maghemite were identified in the clay fraction. In the NT-managed soil, there was a decrease in the content of crystalline <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> and an increase in the content of poorly crystalline <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> with increasing proximity to the soil surface. These results suggest that <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> are rearranged in this soil by reductive dissolution of the crystalline types and neoformation of meta-stable ferrihydrite in topsoil layers, which should be assessed further in laboratory studies...|$|R

40|$|Microbial {{reduction}} of arsenic-bearing <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> in the deltas of South and Southeast Asia produces widespread arsenic-contaminated groundwater. Organic carbon is abundant {{both at the}} surface and within aquifers, but the source of organic carbon used by microbes in the reduction and release of arsenic has been debated, as has the wetland type and sedimentary depth where release occurs. Here we present data from fresh-sediment incubations, in situ model sediment incubations and a controlled field experiment with manipulated wetland hydrology and organic carbon inputs. We find that in the minimally disturbed Mekong Delta, arsenic release is limited to near-surface sediments of permanently saturated wetlands where both organic carbon and arsenic-bearing solids are sufficiently reactive for microbial oxidation of organic carbon and {{reduction of}} arsenic-bearing <b>iron</b> <b>oxides.</b> In contrast, within the deeper aquifer or seasonally saturated sediments, reductive dissolution of <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> is observed only when either more reactive exogenous forms of <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> or organic carbon are added, revealing a potential thermodynamic restriction to microbial metabolism.
