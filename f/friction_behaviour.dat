Understanding the lubrication properties of the first chemisorbed layer of additives on work pieces yields important information for the optimization of lubrication in various solutions, in particular with regard to the type of additive and amount needed. To characterize the influence of oil polarity, two reference base oils (hexadecane - non polar and diethylenglycol - polar) were blended with different concentrations of ZDDP-C 4, and the solutions were tested. A monolayer of base oil/additive solution is deposited on an ASI 52100 steel plate and is scanned on AFM contact mode under several rubbing time and applied load conditions. An AFM technique is developed to estimate microscopic values of friction coefficients showing how the oil polarity contributes to the differences in <b>friction</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the solution due to the addition of ZDDP.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{relates the}} {{confined}} structure of several ionic liquids (ILs) and mixtures of ILs with various n -alkanols and the polymer poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) to their nanoscale <b>friction</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The influence of various parameters including IL molecular structure, applied electric potential, bulk liquid viscosity and interfacial liquid viscosity on nanoscale friction were studied. Friction force microscopy (FFM) {{was used to}} investigate the <b>friction</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{of a series of}} protic ionic liquids (PILs) confined between a silica colloidal probe and a mica surface. The effect of solvophobic interactions on friction was investigated by varying cation alkyl chain length (propylammonium cation vs. ethylammonium cation). The effect of the hydrogen bonding capacity of both the cation (ethanolammonium cation vs. ethylammonium cation) and anion (nitrate vs. formate) was also studied. The effect of steric hindrance was probed using an IL (dimethylethylammonium formate) with weak interfacial structure. The friction coefficient changed at a critical normal load equal to the final push-through force in normal force-distance profiles in each IL. At this critical normal load all but a single layer of ions was removed from between the surfaces. Soft contact atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging showed a change in the morphology of the propylammonium nitrate (PAN) -mica system from a structure with an undulating appearance to one with a worm-like appearance as the imaging load crossed the critical normal load. This indicated a structural rearrangement, consistent with the number of confined ion layers changing as load increased. Addition of n -alkanols to PAN resulted in a decrease in friction. The reduction was dependent on the concentration of n-alkanol, but independent of n -alkanol alkyl chain length. The friction reduction was not correlated with the bulk viscosity of the system, and thin-film drainage experiments showed that localised viscosity reductions did not occur in the system. The decrease in the friction force was attributed to weakening of intermolecular interactions between ions adsorbed to the mica surface and those in near surface layers. Friction was reduced when PEO was adsorbed to silica surfaces and immersed in pure PAN and in the aprotic ionic liquid (AIL) 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate. A range of PEO molecular weights were investigated. Theoretical fits to AFM force-distance profiles showed that PEO adsorbed onto silica from both ILs in a mushroom conformation. FFM experiments showed that friction was lower when PEO was present compared to either pure IL, and that friction decreased as polymer molecular weight increased. Friction was reduced due to the high osmotic pressures generated as polymer layers were compressed; this provided an effective barrier to direct surface-surface contact. The ability of an IL to lubricate an electrically charged contact was investigated by applying a surface potential to a gold surface lubricated by the IL 1 -butyl- 1 -methylpyrrolidinium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate. Friction varied as a function of both the sign and magnitude of the bias. The composition of the adsorbed layer of ions varied as surface polarity changed from positive to negative or vice versa. The adsorbed layer composition influenced ion packing arrangements and both had a significant effect on friction; the relatively long alkyl chains of the cations lowered friction more effectively than the bulky anions...|$|R

However, it {{is still}} not well-understood how the microscale asperity interactions determine the macroscale <b>friction</b> <b>behaviour</b> under different loading conditions. The current study aims to numerically investigate and reveal the <b>friction</b> <b>behaviour</b> and mechanism of sliding and rolling-sliding contacts, in particular, to quantitatively study the microscale asperity interactions and their contributions to overall <b>friction</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The following contributions have been made in this thesis. Firstly, an analytical model for the contact of rough surfaces was derived based on the essentials and the physical understanding of the contact phenomena, as presented in Chapter 4. The contact process of Gaussian random surfaces and fractal surfaces were studied and presented in terms of the real contact area, elastic load, plastic load, and plastic ratio. Secondly, an innovative friction prediction model was derived in Chapter 5, where the macroscale sliding friction was predicted from the combined result of the molecular and mechanical components of each individual asperity. Numerical results provide insight into the effect of surface roughness on the mechanical and molecular components of friction, that is, the mechanical component dominates the friction coefficient when the surface is rough, whilst the friction coefficient is mainly determined by the molecular component when the surface is relatively smooth. Furthermore, an optimal roughness value for minimising the friction coefficient is predicted. Thirdly, a numerical model for the friction prediction of rolling-sliding contact in mixed Elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) was developed in Chapter 6, where the friction of mixed EHL was predicted by the combined result of lubricants fluid, boundary film and solid-to-solid frictions. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the friction is dominated by the solid-to-solid ploughing and adhesion friction in boundary lubrication regime, 2) in the mixed EHL regime, the overall friction coefficient shows a significant decreasing trend with the increase in velocity due to the decrease in solid-to-solid friction, and 3) the boundary film friction does not show a significant influence on the overall friction in both boundary and mixed lubrication regimes...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{analyses}} {{friction coefficient}} evolution of dry lubricant coatings subjected to unidirectional sliding. Dry lubricant coatings {{have been investigated}} for maintaining low friction under sliding conditions, and {{have been used for}} this purpose in mechanical components. Experimental characterisation of coating durability can be achieved by measuring the friction coefficient {{as a function of the}} number of turns, or, alternatively, the sliding distance. In this paper, literature on abrasive wear tests of various low friction coatings was reviewed, and friction coefficient evolutions of these coatings were analysed with appropriate mathematical forms. The friction coefficient evolutions can be classified into three distinct types: exponential, linear, and logarithmic. In an exponential evolution type, friction coefficient growth rate with respect to sliding distance is expressed as a power-law function of the friction coefficient itself. It was identified that two parameters determine the friction coefficient evolution: the damage rate constant and the damage exponent. The damage exponent was found to be close to unity, suggesting an exponential relation between damage and sliding distance. In a linear evolution type, friction coefficient growth rate is constant, expressed with the damage rate constant. In a logarithmic evolution type, friction coefficient growth rate is expressed as a power-law function of sliding distance. Two parameters, the damage rate constant and the damage exponent, were also identified. The damage exponent was found to be close to minus unity.

It is reasonable to expect that in steel/DLC contacts, at least the steel counter body will behave according to conventional lubrication mechanisms and will interact with lubricants and additives in the contact. However, in DLC/DLC contacts, such mechanisms are still unclear. For example, the "inertness" of DLC coatings raises several questions about whether {{they are able to}} provide real boundary "lubrication" or whether they are just a "passive" member in these contacts. On the other hand, biodegradable oils, in particular vegetable base oils, possess a good lubricating ability, often much better than mineral or conventional synthetic oils {{as a result of the}} large amount of un-saturated and polar components thatcan promote the lubricity of DLC coatings.
