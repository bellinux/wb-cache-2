40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{differences}} in margins of export and <b>domestic</b> <b>markets</b> for Spanish manufacturing firms in the period 1990 - 1997. We estimate jointly a multiproduct cost function, a variable factor share equation and two price-marginal cost margin equations. The results obtained indicate that the marginal cost of production sold in export markets is slightly greater than in <b>domestic</b> <b>markets.</b> At the same time, the price-marginal cost margins in export markets are smaller than in <b>domestic</b> <b>markets.</b> We also find strong evidence that margins are procyclical in the <b>domestic</b> <b>markets,</b> but this evidence is less clear in the foreign markets...|$|R

5|$|Braathens SAFE's <b>domestic</b> <b>market</b> was {{deregulated}} on 1 April 1994. Since then, any airline {{within the}} European Economic Area {{is free to}} operate any domestic or international route. Braathens rejected a proposal from the main competitor Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) for a merger; instead the helicopter division was sold and the company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. New routes were opened from Oslo Airport, Fornebu to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, but the routes from Bergen to these cities were terminated. International routes to Rome, Nice and Jersey were introduced. In 1996, Braathens SAFE bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede, and started flying on the Oslo–Stockholm route. The following year, Transwede, with its five domestic routes, was merged into Braathens SAFE. The same year, KLM bought 30% of Braathens SAFE and the airlines started a partnership.|$|E
5|$|From {{his first}} term in Congress, McKinley was a strong {{advocate}} of protective tariffs. The primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue, but to allow American manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the <b>domestic</b> <b>market</b> over foreign competitors. McKinley biographer Margaret Leech noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of protection, and that this may have helped form his political views. McKinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs, and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue. Garfield's election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the House Ways and Means Committee; McKinley was selected to fill it, placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms.|$|E
