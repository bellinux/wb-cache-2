40|$|AbstractA triple-junction {{photodetector}} {{for color}} detection is explored in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 900 nm. According to the mechanism that light with longer wavelength can penetrate silicon deeper than light with shorter wavelength the detector can detect different colors of incident light simultaneously and rather independently. We adopt three vertically stacked photodiodes in the detector, which accurately determine {{the color of}} the incident light. In addition, the photodetector can be used as wavelengths division demultiplexer for three different wavelengths in optical <b>data</b> <b>receivers</b> without needing beam splitters or optical filters. The detector is fabricated in a standard 90 nm CMOS technology without any process modifications. Based on the measured results, we conclude that this kind of photodetector can meet the requirements of color detection and of <b>data</b> <b>receivers</b> up to 150 Mbit/s...|$|R
