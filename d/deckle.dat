5|$|Each {{section of}} the process was overseen {{by one of the}} prisoners, and the day-to-day {{operations}} were run by Oscar Stein, a former office manager and bookkeeper. Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened to imitate the <b>deckle</b> finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed printing presses.|$|E
25|$|Trimming {{separates}} {{the leaves of}} the bound book. A sheet folded in quarto will have folds at the spine and also across the top, so the top folds must be trimmed away before the leaves can be turned. A quire folded in octavo or greater may also require that the other two sides be trimmed. <b>Deckle</b> edge, or Uncut books are untrimmed or incompletely trimmed, and may be of special interest to book collectors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wooden frame}} {{is called a}} [...] "deckle". The <b>deckle</b> leaves {{the edges of the}} paper {{slightly}} irregular and wavy, called [...] "deckle edges", one of the indications that the paper was made by hand. Deckle-edged paper is occasionally mechanically imitated today to create the impression of old-fashioned luxury. [...] The impressions in paper caused by the wires in the screen that run sideways are called [...] "laid lines" [...] and the impressions made, usually from top to bottom, by the wires holding the sideways wires together are called [...] "chain lines". Watermarks are created by weaving a design into the wires in the mould. [...] Handmade paper generally folds and tears more evenly along the laid lines.|$|E

50|$|Before the 19th century, the <b>deckle</b> edge was unavoidable, {{a natural}} {{artifact}} of the papermaking {{process in which}} sheets of paper were made individually on a <b>deckle.</b> The <b>deckle</b> could not make a perfect seal against the screen at the edges and the paper slurry would seep under, creating a rough edge to the paper. The <b>deckle</b> edge could be trimmed off, but this extra step would add {{to the cost of}} the book. Beginning in the early 1800s with the invention of the Fourdrinier machine, paper was produced in long rolls and the <b>deckle</b> edge became mostly obsolete; although there was some <b>deckle</b> on the ends of the rolls, it was cut off, and the individual sheets cut out from the roll would have no <b>deckle</b> in any case.|$|E
50|$|Van Vechten {{became an}} expert {{in all aspects of}} book-making. She was an {{innovator}} on the technical side of printing, inventing a way to feed <b>deckled</b> paper through the press that would allow for perfectly registered printing {{on both sides of the}} page. This was something that most experts had thought impossible, and her achievement was remarked on in publications around the country.|$|R
5000|$|Hesse’s {{interest}} in latex {{as a medium}} for sculptural forms {{had to do with}} immediacy. Keats states, [...] "immediacy {{may be one of the}} prime reasons Hesse was attracted to latex". Hesse’s first two works using latex, Schema and Sequel (1967-68) use latex in a way never imagined by the manufacturer. [...] "Industrial latex was meant for casting. Hesse handled it like house paint, brushing layer upon layer to build up a surface that was smooth yet irregular, ragged at the edges like <b>deckled</b> paper." ...|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the pages}} were smooth-cut {{on the top and}} bottom edges, and <b>deckled</b> on the outer edge. Some books {{contained}} the note: [...] "This book is standard length, complete and unabridged. Manufactured under wartime conditions in conformity with all government regulations controlling the use of paper and other materials." [...] This explains the yellowed or tanning paper condition, more noticeable in some books than others. Some books were illustrated. Many of the books did not include a publish date. Dust jackets were not included.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{appearance}} of smooth edges in the 19th century, the <b>deckle</b> edge slowly emerged as a status symbol. Many 19th-century presses advertised {{two versions of the}} same book: one with edges trimmed smooth and a higher-priced <b>deckle</b> version, which suggested the book was made with higher-quality paper, or with more refined methods. This tradition carried forward into the 20th and 21st centuries. [...] modern <b>deckle</b> is produced by a purpose-built machine to give {{the appearance}} of a true <b>deckle</b> edge by cutting a smooth edge into patterns. Many modern readers are unfamiliar with the <b>deckle</b> edge and may see it as a defect; for example, Amazon.com has left notes to buyers that the <b>deckle</b> is not a flaw in the product. A <b>deckle</b> edge is unrelated to the practice of unopened pages, in which a reader must cut open pages with knife.|$|E

In Japan the range gradually received upgraded motors which could pass the 1978 emissions standards; these models carry 811 series chassis numbers, with Japanese market vehicles were installed with a NAPS badge on the rear <b>deckled</b> that identified emission control technology having been installed. This process began in October 1977 and continued until August 1978. This meant replacing the earlier L-series engines with the new crossflow Z engines, based on the L.|$|R
50|$|The only folio set {{produced}} in Klimt's lifetime, Das Werk Gustav Klimts, was published initially by H. O. Miethke (of Gallerie Miethke, Klimt's exclusive gallery in Vienna) from 1908 to 1914 in an edition of 300, supervised personally by the artist. The first thirty-five editions (I-XXXV) each included an original drawing by Klimt, {{and the next}} thirty-five editions (XXXVI-LXX) each with a facsimile signature on the title page. Fifty images depicting Klimt's most important paintings (1893-1913) were reproduced using collotype lithography and mounted on a heavy, cream-colored wove paper with <b>deckled</b> edges. Thirty-one of the images (ten of which are multicolored) are printed on Chine-collé. The remaining nineteen are high quality halftones prints. Each piece was marked with a unique signet—designed by Klimt—which was impressed into the wove paper in gold metallic ink. The prints were issued in groups of ten to subscribers, in unbound black paper folders embossed with Klimt's name. Because of the delicate nature of collotype lithography, {{as well as the}} necessity for multicolored prints (a feat difficult to reproduce with collotypes), and Klimt's own desire for perfection, the series that was published in mid-1908 was not completed until 1914.|$|R
5000|$|In manual papermaking, a <b>deckle</b> is a {{removable}} wooden frame or [...] "fence" [...] placed into a mould {{to keep the}} paper slurry within bounds and to control {{the size of the}} sheet produced. After the mold is dipped into a vat of paper slurry, excess water is drained off and the <b>deckle</b> is removed and the mold shaken or [...] "couched" [...] to set the fibers of the paper. Some of the paper slurry passes under the <b>deckle</b> and forms an irregular, thin edge.|$|E

5000|$|The Goyard art book {{published}} by Devambez is the reference publication upon Parisian trunk makers. It was dubbed [...] "a luxury bible" [...] by Suzy Menkes {{in the article}} called [...] "A tender Tome of Art and Heart" [...] that she wrote in the New York Times on 15 June 2010. The book had a print run of 233 copies, {{a reference to the}} address of the Goyard historic store that has been located at 233, rue Saint Honoré since 1834. It will never be republished and is visible by appointment only.The Goyard art book pays tribute to the golden days of luxury travelling, from horse carriage to ocean liners. It retraces the history of Goyard and is showcased in a special made-to-order trunk that is altogether a jewel case and a book’s binding (sewing). Each individual purchaser is invited to make their named copy into a unique piece by picking the colour for the trunk canvas, which can also be initialled or adorned with stripes in the shades of their choice. Copies are numbered from 1 to 233, and that number is specified both on the trunk and in the book. The Goyard art book is printed on watermarked <b>deckled</b> vellum paper that was custom-made by Arches, France’s most renowned papermakers. Lead letterpress techniques have been used for the texts. The Goyard art book is featured in the collections of the National Library of France, the Bibliothèque des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and the Kunstbibliothek in Berlin.|$|R
2500|$|ERS or profile {{lanterns}} {{have many}} useful features. One {{of the most}} useful are the metal shutters at the focal plane of the lens to shape the beam of light. The original shape of the beam is round, but {{with the use of}} the shutters one can limit the beam to avoid obstacles or parts of the set that should not be illuminated in a specific look. Another feature is a gate, also in the focal plane, for sliding in gobos (also known as templates or <b>deckles).</b> These have patterns cut into them, much like a stencil. These patterns are projected onto the stage. An iris can be also be inserted in this position to make the beam smaller in diameter, reducing the light cast without the sharp edges of the shutters. ERS instruments from ETC, Altman, Selecon, and a variety of others have interchangeable lens tubes (or barrels) which can both create a very sharp or very soft beam as well as alter the beam spread. The barrel sizes can range from a narrow, long distance 5- or 10-degree spot to a broad and short-distance 50- or even 90-degree. The first 90-degree profile lantern was developed by Selecon Performance Lighting as part of their [...] "Pacific" [...] range of products. Since its introduction many other manufacturers have introduced their own 90-degree barrels. ERS instruments allow many different lens tubes to be used with the same body. This makes them more versatile, since a venue can purchase varying degrees of barrels without buying as many instruments. Many manufacturers also produce zoom lenses which offer the ability to change the beam angle. Some zoom ranges have a poorer optical quality making them difficult to use in sharp focus.|$|R

50|$|In film processing, deckles are die inserts {{that set}} the coating width of a slot die coater or the {{extrusion}} width of an extrusion die. They work by constraining the flow as the material exits the die.

50|$|Paper is {{manufactured}} by forming pulp fibers into a mat {{on an open}} mesh screen (a <b>deckle),</b> and then drying and pressing this mat into paper.
