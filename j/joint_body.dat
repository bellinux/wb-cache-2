25|$|Brigg {{lies within}} the unitary {{authority}} of North Lincolnshire, {{the majority of}} the town being within the Brigg and Wolds electoral ward, and represented by three councillors. The town also has a civil parish governed by Brigg Town Council. The council has nineteen members, serving four year terms; the last elections took place in May 2011. However, part of the town's urban area lies in Scawby Brook, which is split between the civil parishes of Scawby and Broughton. The area is likewise split between Ridge ward and Broughton & Appleby wards within North Lincolnshire Council. There is no <b>joint</b> <b>body</b> that covers Brigg and Scawby Brook.|$|E

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} convolutional {{neural networks}} (3 D CNNs) {{have been established}} as a powerful tool to simultaneously learn features from both spatial and temporal dimensions, which is suitable {{to be applied to}} video-based action recognition. In this work, we propose not to directly use the activations of fully-connected layers of a 3 D CNN as the video feature, but to use selective convolutional layer activations to form a discriminative descriptor for video. It pools the feature on the convolutional layers under the guidance of <b>body</b> <b>joint</b> positions. Two schemes of mapping <b>body</b> <b>joints</b> into convolutional feature maps for pooling are discussed. The <b>body</b> <b>joint</b> positions can be obtained from any off-the-shelf skeleton estimation algorithm. The helpfulness of the <b>body</b> <b>joint</b> guided feature pooling with inaccurate skeleton estimation is systematically evaluated. To make it end-to-end and do not rely on any sophisticated <b>body</b> <b>joint</b> detection algorithm, we further propose a two-stream bilinear model which can learn the guidance from the <b>body</b> <b>joints</b> and capture the spatio-temporal features simultaneously. In this model, the <b>body</b> <b>joint</b> guided feature pooling is conveniently formulated as a bilinear product operation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of <b>body</b> <b>joint</b> guided pooling which achieves promising performance...|$|R
