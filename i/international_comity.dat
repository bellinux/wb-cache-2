500|$|Tan Yock Lin has {{opined that}} the Court of Appeal was {{incorrect}} in dismissing over-inclusiveness {{on the ground}} that section 37(1) applies to all Singapore citizens as a class. Such reasoning amounts to the argument that class fairness is a tautology, where so long as there is equality within the same class, it is considered fair. If this were the case, no classification would ever be over- or under-inclusive. Instead, Tan argues that the doctrine of reasonable classification is premised on the propriety of distinctions based on classes, and whether it is proper to treat those within the class differently from those outside. Tan also criticized the justification of under-inclusiveness purely on the basis of <b>international</b> <b>comity.</b> Whilst he accepts that the considerations of <b>international</b> <b>comity</b> [...] "explain why the nationality criterion is sound", he questions the under-inclusion of the permanent resident, an unexplained omission.|$|E

Finally, he argued that if this was the interpretation to be adopted, then Taw Cheng Kong [...] "suggests that what the Singapore courts recognize as a customary rule of international law that has been received into the common-law could determine or condition the proper interpretation to be given to a statutory provision, or could at least be relied upon to determine the true intent of Parliament".|$|E

Great impact on arising the idea of sustainable development came from so called Brundtland Rapport in 1987. In the document it was stated that one of the conditions of sustaining development in the World requires such development which would satisfy needs of present gen-erations without depriving future generations abilities and satisfactions of their needs. In reference to the idea of sustainable development two-fold purposes were undertaken: (1) instantiation of distributive justice criteria, and (2) explaining validity of future generation justice...|$|R

40|$|For over 150 years, the {{principle}} of comity has {{played a crucial role}} in American legal jurisprudence in the arena of <b>international</b> law. <b>Comity</b> is the “practice among political entities (as nations, states, or courts of different jurisdictions), involving... mutual recognition of legislative, executive, and judicial acts. ” At the highest level of generality, <b>comity</b> encourages <b>international</b> judicial courtesy and respect for foreign legal values. With regard to interstate relations, it has shaped the uniquely American doctrine of act of state as well as the international understanding of foreign sovereign immunity. Against the backdrop of Cold War diplomacy in the 1960 s, comity also fostered the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR), a treaty that seeks to regulate relations between individual nations and foreign consular officials. The VCCR governs diplomatic protocol such as the establishment and conduct of consular relations and the privileges and immunities of consular officers and offices from the laws of the “receiving State” (the country where the foreign consular office has been established). Its adoption was arguably “the single most important event in the entire history of the consular institution. ...|$|R
40|$|Antitrust {{is a brief}} for the uselessness of {{international}} law. Notwithstanding the apparent utility {{of international}} cooperation in accommodating global economic activity and reconciling the flourishing of national antitrust regimes, there is little by way of binding agreement or customary international law. Indeed, any 2 ̆ 2 reasonableness 2 ̆ 2 constraint on unilateral antitrust jurisdiction has largely been repudiated, {{in part because of}} the problematic role it describes for federal courts, and even beforehand was being held out as proof of the incoherence and irrelevance of custom. This article argues that existing doctrine, and its attempted repudiation, are both entirely misconceived. After examining the limits of existing international arrangements, I set out a new, general methodology for identifying what I term 2 ̆ 2 local international law 2 ̆ 2 - a process for evaluating potential custom that begins with the norm 2 ̆ 7 s potential application to particular members and subjects-matter within the international community, and its articulation, adaptation, and enforcement in domestic circumstances. Special custom, applicable through the interpretation of federal statutes in a fashion sensitive to local actors, permits us to overcome many of the universalist flaws that afflicted the reasonableness approach. Applying this theory to antitrust, I advocate recognizing antitrust comity, a principle requiring consideration of certain nations 2 ̆ 7 legitimate interests, in particular the prospects for coordinated regulation of international antitrust matters among OECD members. This principle, and the underlying method, permit a fresh look at the diverse means of enforcing U. S. antitrust law. While antitrust comity binds the federal agencies, it does not directly constrain private enforcement; most controversially, it reflects constitutionally-premised limitations on the ability of state government enforcers to conduct the necessary intergovernmental relations, limits best mediated through a federal-state protocol that brings <b>international</b> antitrust <b>comity</b> home...|$|R
60|$|All England, just then, {{was in one}} {{of those}} {{singular}} fits of panic excitement (not fear, though as sensitive and tremulous as that emotion), which, in consequence of the homogeneous character of the people, their intense patriotism, and their dependence for their ideas in public affairs on other sources than their own examination and individual thought, are more sudden, pervasive, and unreasoning than any similar mood of our own public. In truth, I have never seen the American public in a state at all similar, and believe that we are incapable of it. Our excitements are not impulsive, like theirs, but, right or wrong, are moral and intellectual. For example, the grand rising of the North, at the commencement of this war, bore the aspect of impulse and passion only because it was so universal, and necessarily done in a moment, just as the quiet and simultaneous getting-up of a thousand people out of their chairs would cause a tumult that might be mistaken for a storm. We were cool then, and have been cool ever since, and shall remain cool to the end, which we shall take coolly, whatever it may be. There is nothing which the English find it so difficult to understand in us as this characteristic. They imagine us, in our collective capacity, a kind of wild beast, whose normal condition is savage fury, and are always looking for the moment when we shall break through the slender barriers of <b>international</b> law and <b>comity,</b> and compel the reasonable part of the world, with themselves at the head, to combine for the purpose of putting us into a stronger cage. At times this apprehension becomes so powerful (and when one man feels it, a million do), that it resembles the passage of the wind over a broad field of grain, where you see the whole crop bending and swaying beneath one impulse, and each separate stalk tossing with the selfsame disturbance as its myriad companions. At such periods all Englishmen talk with a terrible identity of sentiment and expression. You have the whole country in each man; and not one of them all, if you put him strictly to the question, can give a reasonable ground for his alarm. There are but two nations in the world--our own country and France--that can put England into this singular state. It is the united sensitiveness of a people extremely well-to-do, careful of their country's honor, most anxious for the preservation of the cumbrous and moss-grown prosperity which they have been so long in consolidating, and incompetent (owing to the national half-sightedness, and their habit of trusting to a few leading minds for their public opinion) to judge when that prosperity is really threatened.|$|R

Mr. Gladstone (Feb. 19), on the other hand, 'as one who has perhaps too often made it his business {{to call attention to the}} failings of his countrymen,' contended that if national honour was not henceforth to be a shadow and a name, it was the paramount, absolute, and imperative duty of Her Majesty's ministers to protest against the imputation upon us of favour for assassination, 'a plant which is congenial neither to our soil nor to the climate in which we live.'[370] One of the truest things said in the debate was Disraeli's incidental observation that 'the House should remember that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, when there is a quarrel between two states, it is generally occasioned by some blunder of a ministry.' Mr. Disraeli perhaps consoled himself by the pithy saying of Baron Brunnow, that if no one made any blunders, there would be no politics. The blood of the civis Romanus, however, was up, and Palmerston, defeated by a majority of nineteen, at once resigned.|$|E

5000|$|Modified universalism or {{modified}} universality {{is a legal}} concept (particularly an English legal concept) relating to the general principle that in relation to corporate insolvency national courts should strive to administer the estate of insolvent companies {{in the spirit of}} <b>international</b> <b>comity.</b> [...] The broad concept is that it is desirable for cross-border insolvencies to be managed by a single officeholder as a single estate rather than a series of piecemeal and unconnected proceedings in different countries, and that this should be recognised globally. In practice, whilst many countries will recognise foreign bankruptcy proceedings, in many instances the courts have set some limits on the recognition of insolvency proceedings, such that the courts apply this principle of modified universality whereby the courts retain a discretion to assess whether the overseas proceedings are consistent with their own principles of justice and public policy. But, subject to that safeguard, the courts will generally defer to the proceedings which are regarded as the [...] "main proceedings" [...] for the purposes of getting in and distributing assets of the insolvent company.

5000|$|The {{principle}} of lis alibi pendens (Latin for [...] "dispute elsewhere pending") applies both in municipal law, public international law, and {{private international law}} {{to address the problem}} of potentially contradictory judgments. If two courts were to hear the same dispute, it is possible they would reach inconsistent decisions. To avoid the problem, there are two rules. Res judicata provides that once a case has been determined, it produces a judgment either inter partes or in rem depending on the subject matter of the dispute, i.e. although there can be an appeal on the merits, neither party can recommence proceedings on the same set of facts in another court. If this rule were not in place, litigation might never come to an end. The second rule is that proceedings on the same facts cannot be commenced in a second court if the lis i.e. action, is already pendens, i.e. pending, in another court. Lis alibi pendens arises from <b>international</b> <b>comity</b> and it permits a court to refuse to exercise jurisdiction when there is parallel litigation pending in another jurisdiction. Shany (2003) considers the problem within the public international law field where, for example, the Southern Bluefin Tuna dispute could have been determined either by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), or by tribunals established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the Swordfish dispute, which was submitted simultaneously to both the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and a dispute settlement panel of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

The case description is as follows: [...] "Lance Paul Larsen, a resident of Hawaii, brought a claim against the Hawaiian Kingdom by its Council of Regency (“Hawaiian Kingdom”) {{on the grounds that the}} Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom is in continual violation of: (a) its 1849 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with the United States of America, as well as the principles of international law laid down in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969 and (b) the principles of <b>international</b> <b>comity,</b> for allowing the unlawful imposition of American municipal laws over the claimant’s person within the territorial jurisdiction of the Hawaiian Kingdom. In determining whether to accept or decline to exercise jurisdiction, the Tribunal considered the questions of whether there was a legal dispute between the parties to the proceeding, and whether the tribunal could make a decision regarding that dispute, if the very subject matter of the decision would be the rights or obligations of a State not party to the proceedings. [...] The Tribunal underlined the many points of agreement between the parties, particularly with respect to the propositions that Hawaii was never lawfully incorporated into the United States, and that it continued to exist as a matter of international law. The Tribunal noted that if there existed a dispute, it concerned whether the respondent has fulfilled what both parties maintain is its duty to protect the Claimant, not in the abstract but against the acts of the United States of America as the occupant of the Hawaiian islands. Moreover, the United States’ actions would not give rise to a duty of protection in international law unless they were themselves unlawful in international law. The Tribunal concluded that it could not determine whether the Respondent has failed to discharge its obligations towards the Claimant without ruling on the legality of the acts of the United States of America - something the Tribunal was precluded from doing as the United States was not party to the case." ...|$|E

He was recognized as [...] "Canada's leading legal scholar on extradition law" [...] by Larry Rousseau, {{executive vice president of the}} Public Service Alliance of Canada. His U.S.-published Extradition between Canada and the United States, cited by the Supreme Court of Canada, criticized Canada's level of cooperation with the United States in international criminal matters, arguing that Canada's policy of placing <b>international</b> <b>comity</b> over individual rights had dangerously expanded executive discretion and damaged human rights protections. The book received favourable reviews in the Law & Politics Book Review and the Revue québécoise de droit international. Another of his works on extradition law, Canadian Extradition Law Practice, which has gone through five editions, contains broader criticisms of Canada's network of extradition treaties, in particular of the erosion of the double criminality requirement. His Extradition: Individual Rights vs. International Obligations, published in Stuttgart, Germany, was released in 2010, and Halbury's Laws of Canada: Extradition and Mutual Legal Assistance the following year. His Wrongful Conviction in Canadian Law (2010) examines Canadian commissions of inquiry into miscarriage of justice. The book's foreword was written by David Milgaard, who was convicted of a murder he did not commit and spent 23 years in prison. Botting spent four years as a visiting scholar and post-doctoral fellow at University of Washington School of Law in Seattle and another year as research associate at the University of British Columbia - where he is a Paetzold Fellow - before returning to private practice in British Columbia in 2009. In April 2015 he was granted a Trent University Distinguished Alumnus lifetime achievement award for his legal scholarship and literary skills. The citation noted that Botting [...] "is recognized as one of the most prolific legal scholars in Canada, the 'go to' expert in Canada on extradition, and a writer of immense talent." [...] In 2016 and again in 2017 he was invited to join an exclusive Oxford think-tank deliberating on the future of extradition and the European arrest warrant in the wake of [...] "Brexit". He proposed [...] "a single, simple multilateral extradition treaty to replace the European arrest warrant and the thousands of variable, and mostly unworkable, bilateral treaties now in existence." [...] He called the proposed treaty the “Unified Multilateral Extradition Treaty” or UMET, and stated that half the countries of the world would already qualify to [...] "sign on" [...] by virtue of being signatories to current treaty arrangements.

For three decades, when faced with concerns of <b>international</b> <b>comity</b> in the discovery context, U. S. courts ruled overwhelmingly in favor of discovery through the Federal Rules, rendering <b>international</b> <b>comity</b> a dead concept. Recent case law, however, shows that this paradigm is coming to an end. In a trilogy of cases decided, respectively, by the United States Supreme Court (Daimler), the Second Circuit (Gucci), and the New York State Court of Appeals (Motorola), each court rejected attempts by plaintiffs to subject foreign entities to jurisdiction in the United States or otherwise impose on them overbroad duties, including those in conflict with foreign laws. Prominently relying on “international comity,” each decision limited the reach of U. S. courts and emphasized the need for harmony in the international legal system. These three cases are groundbreaking and should lead to changes in U. S. transnational discovery.

The article argues that the retrenchment of United States enforcement policy in foreign commerce antitrust cases, the diminution of comity in private antitrust cases, the failure of United States courts to apply comity during its heyday on a coherent and principled basis, the spread of extraterritoriality to foreign competition systems, the rise of more practical concerns in foreign commerce antitrust cases, and the emergence of new issues relating to competition law in transition economies and the potential role of the World Trade Organization in the competition field all contributed to the demise of comity as a controversial issue.

40|$|A {{number of}} judge-made doctrines attempt to promote <b>international</b> <b>comity</b> by {{reducing}} possible {{tensions between the}} United States and foreign sovereigns. For example, ambiguous statutes are usually interpreted to conform to international law, and statutes are usually not understood to apply outside of the nation’s territorial boundaries. The <b>international</b> <b>comity</b> doctrines are best understood {{as a product of}} a judicial judgment that in various settings, the costs of American deference to foreign interests are less than the benefits to American interests. Sometimes Congress balances these considerations and incorporates its judgment in a statute, but usually it does not. In such cases, executive interpretations should be permitted to trump the comity doctrines. This conclusion is supported both by considerations of institutional competence and by the distinctive position of the President in the domain of foreign affairs. It follows that if the executive wants to interpret ambiguous statutes so as to apply extraterritorially, or so as to conflict with international law, it should be permitted to do so. The analysis of the interpretive power of the executive follows by reference to the Chevron doctrine in administrative law, which similarly calls for deference to executive interpretation of statutory ambiguities. Sometimes the Chevron doctrine literally applies to executive interpretations; sometimes it operates as a valuable analogy...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of foreign law in U. S. federal courts is often spotty at best. Many decisions pay lip-service {{to the need}} for <b>international</b> <b>comity</b> and the fair {{application of}} foreign law, but this requires extensive research into a wholly unfamiliar body of law which courts and parties are rarely willing to do. This article examines the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision in Trans-Tec Asia v. M/V Harmony, a case which is indicative of this problem. Next, it argues that a more faithful application of foreign law is both increasingly possible and increasingly necessary. A petition for certiorari has been filed in Trans-Tec, underscoring this growing necessity...|$|E
40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{transnational}} litigation in the federal courts, {{it is time to}} retire the doctrine of forum non conveniens. The doctrine, which allows judges to decline jurisdiction in cases they believe would be better heard in foreign courts, is meant to promote <b>international</b> <b>comity</b> and protect defendant fairness. But it is not well-designed for the former purpose, and given recent developments at the Supreme Court, it is dangerously redundant when {{it comes to}} the latter. This Article seeks to demythologize forum non conveniens, to question its continuing relevance, and to encourage the courts and Congress to narrow its scope of application so that, when the time is right, it may be fully interred...|$|E
40|$|In Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., the U. S. Supreme Court {{limited the}} {{application}} of U. S. securities fraud law in transnational situations. The Supreme Court noted that its decision was influenced by <b>international</b> <b>comity</b> considerations. In this Article, we evaluate the availability of class actions in China in cases involving alleged securities fraud. Because {{we find that the}} availability of those actions is too limited to fully protect U. S. shareholders, we argue that U. S. investors should be permitted to bring securities fraud class actions against non-U. S. companies whose securities are traded on a U. S. exchange regardless of where those investors entered into the relevant securities transactions...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{argues for}} {{stabilizing}} and preserving arbitration 2 ̆ 7 s necessary and valuable vocation in dispute resolution. It outlines the basic {{stages in the}} evolution of the American law of arbitration and studies the underlying motivation of each of its historical phases. It attributes vital significance to the legislative and decisional law developments that led to an early rehabilitation of arbitration in American law, beginning with the enactment of the United States Arbitration Act (FAA) in 1925 and continuing with the ratification of the New York Arbitration Convention and the elaboration of a 2 ̆ 2 hospitable 2 ̆ 2 federal caselaw. Eventually, these developments gave rise to a law of arbitration with truly national dimensions that also embraced the ideals of <b>international</b> <b>comity...</b>|$|E
40|$|This Note {{examines}} recent {{interventions in}} corporate human rights lawsuits {{by the executive}} branch from both legal and political perspectives. It first identifies a nascent trend in human rights litigation in U. S. courts-namely, the propensity of the Bush administration to intervene on behalf of corporate defendants accused of violating {{human rights in the}} developing world-by examining the factual and procedural history of three contemporary lawsuits. It then explores the role of the political question, act of state, and <b>international</b> <b>comity</b> doctrines in these and similar suits, and advances a method for applying all three doctrines in a 2 ̆ 2 human rights-friendly 2 ̆ 2 manner. Finally, the Note examines the Bush administration 2 ̆ 7 s interventions from a human rights policy perspective and concludes that for political, in addition to legal reasons, the executive branch should desist from intervening on behalf of corporate defendants in human rights lawsuits...|$|E
