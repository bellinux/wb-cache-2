25|$|Melbourne Park {{was built}} in 1988 beside the Jolimont Yard as a new precinct to host the Australian Open. The {{previous}} venue, Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club, had become {{too small for the}} burgeoning tournament. Melbourne Park's construction was completed in 1988 at a cost of at least $94 million. The unveiling of the new precinct was met with incredibly positive reviews by players and spectators, with some labelling the facilities and amenities the best of the four Grand Slams. Expansion of the precinct next occurred in 1996, when a further $23 million was invested to create two <b>fully</b> <b>seated</b> and larger show courts and eight new ‘Ace’ courts, as well as a large grassy space, now known as ‘Garden Square’.|$|E

A ramrod was used to <b>fully</b> <b>seat</b> the round.|$|R

50|$|As {{long as the}} hot-swap {{connector}} {{is sufficiently}} rigid, {{one of the four}} corner pins will always be the first to engage. For a typical two-row connector arrangement this provides four first-to-make corner pins that are usually used for grounds. Other pins near the corners can be used for functions that would also benefit from this effect, for example sensing when the connector is <b>fully</b> <b>seated.</b> This diagram illustrates good practice where the grounds are in the corners and the power pins are near the center. Two sense pins are located in opposite corners so that <b>fully</b> <b>seated</b> detection is confirmed only when both of them are in contact with the slot. The remaining pins are used for all the other data signals.|$|E

50|$|A {{drawback}} of the Lusa {{is that it}} uses {{a proprietary}} magazine that is not widely available and is somewhat expensive. The magazines are all marked 30 rounds, {{but much of the}} company literature refers to them as having a 28-round capacity. This is probably because it is difficult to load a full 30 rounds and still insert the magazine against the closed bolt, since the Lusa has no provision to lock the bolt to the rear. The additional spring pressure makes it more difficult to <b>fully</b> <b>seat</b> the magazine. The 28-round recommendation is to ensure reliable magazine insertion. The magazines are of a double-stack double-feed type, feeding alternately from each side of the magazine.|$|R
