40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of intelligent <b>fastening</b> <b>tool</b> tracking systems for the automotive industry to identify the fastened bolts. In order to accomplish such a task, the position of the tool tip must be identified because the tool tip position coincides {{with the head of the}} fastened bolt while the tool fastens the bolt. The proposed systems utilize an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and another sensor to track the position and orientation of the tool tip. To minimize the position and orientation calculation error, an IMU needs to be calibrated as accurately as possible. This research presents a novel triaxial accelerometer calibration technique that offers a high accuracy. The simulation and experimental results of the accelerometer calibration are presented. To identify the fastening action, an expert system is developed based on the sensor measurements. When a fastening action is identified, the system identifies the fastened bolt by using an expert system based on the position and orientation of the tool tip and the position and orientation of the bolt. Since each fastening procedure needs different accuracies and requirements, three different systems are proposed. The first system utilizes a triaxial magnetometer and an IMU to identify the fastened bolt. This system calculates the position and orientation by using an IMU. An expert system is used to identify the initial position, stationary state, and the fastened bolt. When the tool fastens a bolt, the proposed expert system detects the fastening action by triaxial accelerometer and triaxial magnetometer measurements. When the fastening action is detected, the system corrects the velocity and position error using zero velocity update (ZUPT). By using the corrected tool tip position and orientation, the system can identify the fastened bolts. Then, with the fastened bolt position, the position of the IMU is corrected. When the tool is stationary, the system corrects linear velocity error and reduces the position error. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can identify fastened bolts if the angles of the bolts are different or the bolts are not closely placed. This low cost system does not require a line of sight, but has limited position accuracy. The second system utilizes an intelligent system that incorporates Kalman filters (KFs) and a fuzzy expert system to track the tip of a <b>fastening</b> <b>tool</b> and to identify the fastened bolt. This system employs one IMU and one encoder-based position sensor to determine the orientation and the centre of mass location of the tool. When the KF is used, the orientation error increases over time due to the integration step. Therefore, a fuzzy expert system is developed to correct the tilt angle error and orientation error. When the tool fastens a bolt, the system identifies the fastened bolt by applying the fuzzy expert system. When the fastened bolt is identified, the 3 D orientation error of the tool is corrected by using the location and the orientation of the fastened bolt and the position sensor outputs. This orientation correction method results in improved reliability in determining the tool tip location. The <b>fastening</b> <b>tool</b> tracking system was experimentally tested in a lab environment, and the results indicate that such a system can successfully identify the fastened bolts. This system not only has a low computational cost but also provides good position and orientation accuracy. The system can be used for most applications because it provides a high accuracy. The third system presents a novel position/orientation tracking methodology by hybridizing one position sensor and one factory calibrated IMU with the combination of a particle filter (PF) and a KF. In addition, an expert system is used to correct the angular velocity measurement errors. The experimental results indicate that the orientation errors of this method are significantly reduced compared to the orientation errors obtained from an EKF approach. The improved orientation estimation using the proposed method leads to a better position estimation accuracy. The experimental results of this system show that the orientation of the proposed method converges to the correct orientation even when the initial orientation is completely unknown. This new method was applied to the <b>fastening</b> <b>tool</b> tracking system. This system provides good orientation accuracy even when the gyroscopes (gyros hereafter) include a small error. In addition, since the orientation error of this system does not grow over time, the tool tip position drift is limited. This system can be applied to the applications where the bolts are closely placed. The position error comparison results of the second system and the third system are presented in this thesis. The comparison results indicate that the position accuracy of the third system is better than that of the second system because the orientation error does not increase over time. The advantages and limitations of all three systems are compared in this thesis. In addition, possible future work on <b>fastening</b> <b>tool</b> tracking system is described as well as applications that can be expanded by using the KF/PF combination method...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the dynamic {{mechanical}} behavior of elastomeric materials under impact loading is presented. An unique experimental apparatus was designed and fabricated to measure the dynamic load-deflection behavior of elastomeric impact absorbers (bumpers), particularly of the type used in pneumatic fastening tools, and the apparatus was designed to duplicate actual service conditions in such a tool. The apparatus {{was used to measure}} the dynamic load-deflection behavior of thin cylindrical specimens having a thickness comparable to specimens tested using the classic Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB), and a comparison between the two methods is given. Larger cylindrical specimens and an actual bumper design used in a small pneumatic <b>fastening</b> <b>tool</b> were also evaluated. The behavior of four typical elastomeric materials used in this application was examined and the forces, deflections and energy absorption characteristics of each are discussed. Data obtained using the SHPB were used to develop a dynamic material model for use in the ABAQUS/Explicit commercial finite element program to facilitate a {{study of the}} dynamic behavior elastomeric impact absorbers using finite element analysis. This material model was used to predict the dynamic load-deflection behavior of the cylindrical specimens and bumpers studied using the load-deflection apparatus, and a comparison with the experimental results was made to verify the computational results. The finite element analysis provided insight into the dynamic stress, strain and strain energy distributions resulting from impact, thus reducing the need to fabricate costly prototypes and perform extensive testing to characterize component behavior. The results of the work were also invaluable in the design of elastomeric impact absorbers, as they provided a means for eliminating much of the iterative redesign commonly used to develop elastomeric impact absorbers. ...|$|E

50|$|Injection {{molding machine}} molds can be {{fastened}} {{in either a}} horizontal or vertical position. The majority of machines are horizontally oriented, but vertical machines are used in some niche applications such as insert molding, allowing the machine {{to take advantage of}} gravity. Some vertical machines also don't require the mold to be fastened. There are many ways to <b>fasten</b> the <b>tools</b> to the platens, the most common being manual clamps (both halves are bolted to the platens); however hydraulic clamps (chocks are used to hold the tool in place) and magnetic clamps are also used. The magnetic and hydraulic clamps are used where fast tool changes are required.|$|R

40|$|We {{encountered}} {{several areas}} of methodologic uncertainty during {{development of a}} data collection method for use with vibrating hand tools in metal assembly. A local manufacturer sought our assistance designing a data collection method for evaluating and predicting risks of upper extremity disorders associated with use of vibrating hand tools. Current methods of vibration measurement are described in ISO 5349 [2]. However, the complexity of measuring vibration along with other exposures such as force and posture has limited the number of workplace-based studies of upper extremity disorders that have included direct measurements of vibration. Data from this preliminary study was used to look at two issues: a comparison of vibration values between production and non-production workers when performing the same task, and a comparison of worker ratings of vibration comfort to direct measurement of tool vibration. Methods Eight experienced production workers used each of six metal <b>fastening</b> <b>tools</b> to install fasteners. Vibration was collected by 3 tri-axial accelerometers, one attached to the tool handle following ISO 5349 recommended locations, one attached to the hand dorsum on the 3 rd knuckle and one to the thumb side of the wrist. Data sampling rate was 10, 000 samples/second. Hand grip and feed forces were obtained using a Novel pressure sensing mat on the palm. Each trial consisted of installing 10 fasteners per tool {{for each of the}} 6 tools. The test set-up placed the wrist in the position typically used by the operator during production. Each worker documented subjective comfort and effort ratings on a seven point scale following each series of fastener installations. One series of testing was completed by three non-production workers inexperienced in fastener installation to simulate use of alternative employees for data gathering. Vibration data for each trial were acquired, digitized, and stored using Lab View. The X, Y, & Z axes were used to calculate the vector sum response for each tri-axial accelerometer. The tool data were digitally filtered following ISO recommendations. Calculated data consisted of the mean RMS over the tool 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s on- time, the starting and breaking peak impulses, and the peak of the frequency response. Results Production workers (n= 8) were right hand dominant males {{with a mean age of}} 55 years and normal hand strength (mean right grip = 106 lbs). Non-production workers (n= 3) had similar characteristics. We found large and statistically meaningful differences in hand force during tool use between production and non-production workers (mean production workers = 9. 77 lbs, mean non-production workers = 43. 30 lbs, p = 0. 0001). Vibration values obtained from the hand also showed a statistically meaningful difference (mean in production workers = 0. 67 Gs, mean in non-production workers = 1. 48 Gs, p = 0. 0014, figure 1). Experienced worker ratings of comfort during tool use demonstrated a moderate correlation with measured vibration (r= 0. 63). Worker ratings trended with direct recordings from the tool handle as shown in figure 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the differences in muscle activation and handle forces between three direct current right angle power <b>tool</b> <b>fastening</b> strategies: turbo tight, two stage without soft stop and two stage with soft stop. Thirty-six participants (20 - 60 yrs) were assigned to one of two experimental groups: hard-joints or soft-joints. Participants conducted fastenings at four different postures for three different target torques and muscle sEMG was collected on 16 muscles of the upper body. Data from the muscle sEMG, and forces collected at the handle were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test to determine statistical significance (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Results found that the participants sEMG activation impulse was less for the turbo tight fastening strategy in comparison to the two-stage fastening strategy with and without soft stop. These findings were not impacted by joint type, posture or target torque...|$|R
