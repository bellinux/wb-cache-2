50|$|A {{variable}} <b>import</b> <b>levy</b> is a levy {{on imports}} that raises their price {{to a level}} at least {{as high as the}} domestic price. Such levies are adjusted frequently (hence variable) in response to changes in world market prices, and are imposed to defend administered prices set above world market prices. Under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, the variable levies of the EU have been converted into fixed tariffs or tariff-rate quotas.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether a}} small country facing foreign price {{instability}} benefits from active stabilization of the domestic price of the importable.

It is shown that, if the random tariff revenue ex post, domestic price stabilization increases income instability and nonintervention is optimal. If an ex ante rebating scheme is employed, {{a small country}} can benefit from domestic price stabilization and there exists a partial stabilization policy that dominates free trade. Partial stabilization of the domestic price with the ex ante rebate requires a variable <b>import</b> <b>levy</b> inversely related to the foreign price of the importable.

40|$|In the {{long-term}} the Japanese Government aims to maintain 80 per cent self-sufficiency in beef. Price support programs for feeder-calves are major domestic policy measures {{designed to encourage}} domestic beef production in Japan. These price support programs were greatly strengthened during 1977. This paper describes the latest arrangements in detail and reviews the past operation of these programs. The historical background to the feeder-calf price-support policies is also outlined. The link between feeder-calf prices and beef import policies in Japan was clearly demonstrated in 1974. Therefore, the new provisions for guaranteeing the prices of feeder-calves are important in assessing future Japanese beef impart policy. Furthermore, the recent financial strengthening of the feeder-calf price-support programs has been achieved with beef <b>import</b> <b>levy</b> funds collected by the LIPC. Feeder-calf price-support policies in Japan are, therefore, of vital interest to anyone concerned about Japanese beef import policy. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E

Relocation of EU energy-intensive firms to countries with a lax regime also leads to carbon leakage.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} tariffication-conversion of a variable <b>import</b> <b>levy,</b> widely used in the European Community, into an equivalent ad valorem tariff on trade and welfare. While tough negotiations lie ahead over the exact rates of tariff reduction, contracting countries in principle agreed to tariffication proposed by the United States. If producers are risk neutral, tariffication {{has no effect on}} production and trade, and gains from a GATT agreement in the Uruguay Round depend on the extent of tariff reductions. If domestic producers are risk averse, however, tariffication reduces domestic production of the importable and thus has a trade expansion effect, which causes a shift in the import demand curve. This trade expansion effect may dominate the increased trade effect resulting from a negotiated tariff reduction, which causes a movement along the import demand curve. Consumers benefit from tariffication but domestic producers lose because of an increased risk premium. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on {{arrangements}} made by the EEC to establish a common market in sheepmeats. A system of intervention buying or deficiency payments ensures that producers are guaranteed a minimum price. In addition, compensatory payments up to a Reference Price level give farmers additional income support during the transition period from 1980 to 1984. The whole arrangement is protected from imports from third countries with a system of tariffs, licences and Voluntary Restraint Agreements. EEC exports, subject to a clawback tax under the Variable Premium System, and to refunds under the Intervention System, are maintained at traditional levels to current markets.
