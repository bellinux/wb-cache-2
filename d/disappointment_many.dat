Then he strolled out to examine the great gathering round the settlement, which hitherto he had had no time to do, having been at work from daybreak until late at night. As he wandered among the motley throng of emigrants, he was struck with the hopefulness which everywhere prevailed, and could not but feel that many of them were doomed to <b>disappointment.</b> <b>Many</b> of them were storekeepers, men who had never done a day's work in their life; some were aged men, encumbered with wives and large families, and Frank wondered how these would ever survive the terrible journey across the plains, even if they escaped all molestation from the marauding Indians. He paused for a moment near four men who were seated round a fire cooking their meals.|$|E

50|$|There {{continues}} to be some short-day cannabis growers that insist that autoflowers are simply a fad and produce subpar medicine. The number one reason for these feelings are the understandable <b>disappointment</b> <b>many</b> had {{with the results of}} the first Lowryder. Also commonly argued is that when growing indoors, growers already have the ability to initiate flowering with photoperiod/short-day plants at will by changing the lighting. Hormones such as BAP and paclobutrazol {{can also be used to}} completely arrest vertical growth in photoperiod plants. There are however concerns about the carcinogenicity of some of these growth regulators. When growing outdoors, initiation of flowering in short-day plants is more difficult to control than with autoflowers. Another concern is the overall yield of autoflowering plants which with some dwarf strains can be a half ounce per plant.|$|E

However, despite all the resources that were being devoted to the organization, the NSDF failed to satisfy expectations and was largely considered to be a <b>disappointment.</b> <b>Many</b> politicians refused to work with a vexed associate of the organization named Houng. The National Salvation Front rejected the NSDF’s consolidation request for this very reason. Moreover, the NSDF did not have any success with integrating its constituent parts.

Thieu did not want to turn pacification into a political task and would offer no supplemental ideology or program to replace Communism in Vietnam.|$|E
40|$|Michael King let {{his mind}} wander {{as he waited}} for the meeting to begin. Although still young, he had earned a {{reputation}} as a competent planetary geologist through years of hard work at the U. S. Geological Survey. He attributed his success in part to an excellent education which stressed the validity of the scientific method. He fully understood the need to proceed cautiously whenever the announcement of a new discovery was contemplated. That was why he was both astonished and dismayed when NASA Senior Scientist David Collins called with the news that the “Life on Mars” investigation would be revealed at an upcoming press conference. As part of the investigative team, Michael felt that such an announcement was premature. He did not want to risk his reputation and career by rushing to make a public disclosure before the work was validated. He tried to imagine the public and professional reactions if the first report of life on another planet was ultimately proven false. The repercussions would be far worse than the simple <b>disappointment</b> <b>many</b> felt when the Viking Lander soil experiments produced negative indications of life 20 years ago. Michael stopped musing and {{turned his attention to the}} meeting. David was trying to explain the situation. “We are here because word has leaked that we have discovered evidence of life on Mars. If we let this get out of control, we could have a public relations nightmare. A news blackout will do more harm than good. So, we are going public tomorrow at 1 : 00 p. m. with a televised press conference. ” Michael wished he could find an argument against a well-orchestrated press release as the best method of rumor control. He could not, so he kept quiet...|$|E
40|$|Malcolm Turnbull could {{reshape the}} Liberal Party and, {{ultimately}}, Australia, writes JACK WATERFORD MALCOLM TURNBULL has {{all it takes}} to be a great, and ultimately successful, leader of the Liberal Party. He has ambition and drive. He has a tremendous ego - fancy him calling the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, vain - but also a considerable capacity to harness it and anything else that matters to him to an ultimate end. His mind is working and calculating all of the time; but he is more strategic than tactical and, if possessing a great retentive brain, more a grand vision man than a detail man. All his grand visions involve himself on centre stage. Focused, he is hard to distract. He reads, and has a considerable capacity to master a brief and fight without restraint for the objectives he has set. He has a considerable personal fortune which helps prevent his being distracted, any more, by the merely venal. If he lacks a compelling philosophy, he is liberal and decent in his instincts, and sound by either Labor or Liberal standards on public policy and social philosophy. He is young (53), and his ambitions go beyond mere occupation of the Lodge, which may help him be patient. He also has the resources, public and personal, to make his way there through well-tested strategies, which will inevitably include ruthless bastardry and opportunism but will probably earn him as much admiration as it will reflect on his character. No one expects leaders to be namby-pambies and, as Peter Costello has demonstrated, no one ever gets to be leader either by waiting for a delegation from one 2 ̆ 7 s colleagues or by execution of a well-thought-out party succession plan. Unlike John Howard, he does not live and breathe politics alone. His relative breadth, his other lives and his wider interests, may soften him and make less predictable, just as it makes him less dependent on the structures, forms and history of the Liberal Party. Yet that very three-dimensionality, and contempt for obstacles, can make his fire far hotter when it is all focused. Turnbull is, like Rudd, always focused even if, unlike Rudd, he is not distracted by the imperative of day-to-day survival. On paper, indeed, he has the potential to resemble a Menzies in both longevity and achievement. He does not come from patrician stock, as did Gorton (via a bar sinister), McMahon, Fraser and Peacock. He 2 ̆ 7 s no mere try-hard, as was Snedden; avuncular lieutenant not up to the big job, as was Holt; or moral and intellectual vacuum trying to please everyone, like Nelson. He 2 ̆ 7 s not what the Trots would call an entrist, as Hewson was, to a degree. Nor a patient, dogged and cunning ordinary guy with a tight and narrow bundle of ideological ideas. No Howard, he. Because Turnbull has qualities complementary to, rather than resembling, Howard 2 ̆ 7 s, he is an ideal long-term successor, in just the same way that many businesses operate well by having, alternately, martinets followed by easygoing managers, or visionaries after consolidators. He will also be more difficult for Labor to touch. He has a history, of course, but not much of a political history, and most of his history (except so far as it touches his personality) does not tie him down. He may prattle about free enterprise and personal choice, but he is no conviction politician, ideologue nor ancient class enemy. Nor is he predictable. And, being able to see further through a brick wall than most, he is less likely to be tied to losing positions, or sentimental about party shibboleths or the record. And he is agile, with some capacity to attack from the side, or the rear. He is not conservative about mere notions such as King, country, Church and convention. Nor does he pander to less worthy manifestations of these tendencies. These qualities could make Turnbull great, and reshape the Liberal Party, and ultimately Australia, for a long period in office in the 2010 s. That period, which could well embrace the transition to a republic he has championed, could see Australia a very different country, but not in ways that would make many Australians feel uneasy. But they are also the very qualities that could bring him down. His strengths contain great potential weaknesses. Now he must wrestle with his political opponents mostly in his own party, of course in an effort to shape them to his will. That will be more difficult because he has never cared much, before, how bruised, battered and resentful he has left those he trampled over. Yet he will depend on many of them for his survival. The Liberal Party usually (but not always, as Brendan Nelson will attest) allows its leaders great latitude, and depends upon its leader as much as its party structure for winning strategies. But that power depends, at the end of the day, on being in power. Turnbull’s less attractive qualities are well known, even to himself. He has no common touch, though he is rather more closely rooted to the way of thinking of the common man than, for example, a Gough Whitlam or a Bob Carr. Nor in politics, at least, has he ever learnt to relax or, for that matter to relax others. He is not a good listener, even if he is a good interrogator who hears and processes what he thinks important. His political apprenticeship has forced him to pretend to listen and to be patient, but his impatience is generally manifest. Many who have wanted urgently to tell him something have left him feeling frustrated, and angry because he was lecturing, not listening. He demands great loyalty, but has never been famous for giving it, except to clients. Even then, he has fought with many of his clients in the end. He has never wanted for admirers; but has never been famous for followers, nor assiduous about their interests. Not only can he demand and process great quantities of information, and follow-ups to it eighteen hours a day, but his intellect is so formidable, and his contempt so withering, that many good people find working with him, in any subservient capacity, too daunting. His staff, in short, will be very good, but in primary part because they are well paid rather than because they have been inspired to join him on his journey. In much the same way, those who attach themselves to him, or to his journey, in hopes of achieving some of their own agendas on the way, are pretty much doomed to <b>disappointment.</b> <b>Many</b> with his background in the law, and advocacy, have not succeeded, as some had hoped or expected in politics, because the part of persuading a judge, or a client, is by no means the same as persuading one’s colleagues or the wider public. Some great racehorses, moreover, are too brittle to be caught in the pack. Turnbull, however, showed from the first - for example, with his relentless undermining of Nelson - that he had the appetite and capacity for the elbowing, fouling and scrabbling for position, as well as some judgment about when to make the break. And, for that matter, when to back himself. His formidable business career began at the top. He’s never been much of a one for the team, and has earned no great reputation as a manager whether of people, or of resources. That’s been for minions working to his instructions. For one from his background who was fast promoted in politics, he acquired no particular reputation as an able administrator of his department, or champion of the policies he or it pursued in cabinet. An advocate in the class of his father-in-law, Tom Hughes, he has never dazzled in parliament and, to date, no one has ever entered the chamber just to hear him speak. Perhaps the greatest contradiction is that no one could ever articulate, beyond vague references to a republic, what he believes in and what he stands for. Apart from himself and his manifest destiny, that is. For Brendan Nelson, the same problem saw him described as a chameleon, a chancer and a bit of a fake. No one says this about Malcolm Turnbull, but they have as little idea about what is actually banging around in his head. • Jack Waterford is editor-at-large of the Canberra Times, where this article first appeared...|$|E
