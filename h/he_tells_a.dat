5|$|John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{is shown}} {{working in an}} office {{building}} for a box company. He has a cruel manager named Randy Nations (Billy Ray Gallion) who is constantly taunting and demeaning Locke. At one point Locke tells Randy off and feels great about it. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> woman named Helen on the phone about it, but it is revealed that she charges by the hour to talk with Locke, {{and that they have}} been conversing for eight months. Locke reveals to Helen that he is going on a walkabout and would like for Helen to go with him; she tells him that she can't meet customers in person and that his paid hour on the phone with her is up.|$|E
5|$|Patrice {{begins the}} show, {{explaining}} that he will use memories and objects relating to Rémi to perform. He says that Rémi loved ventriloquism, and performs his own routine with a monkey puppet called Falzouille, in which the puppet never speaks. He talks about how the puppet is not alive as it has Velcro pads, and imitates a cat and mouse with Velcro on their paws. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> story of when he removed the batteries from his colleague's calculator, then takes out Rémi's notebook, which contains the telephone numbers of prostitutes and vomit stains. Patrice performs a shadow puppetry routine in which an Armenian soldier rescues his daughter from 25 duduk players. It becomes clear that Patrice is not actually making the shadows, and he gets annoyed at three stagehands called David.|$|E

25|$|Myshkin {{makes the}} {{acquaintance}} of Lizaveta Prokovyevna {{and her three}} daughters—Alexandra, Adelaida and Aglaya, the last being the youngest and the most beautiful. They are all very curious about him and not shy about expressing their opinion, particularly Aglaya. He readily engages with them and speaks with remarkable candor {{on a wide variety}} of subjects – his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that he speaks of the time he was in love, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly subjected to cruel persecution and universal moral condemnation. The Prince ends by describing what he divines about each of their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastassya Filippovna.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the guests}} at the party are Totsky, General Yepanchin, Ganya, his friend Ptitsyn (Varya's husband), and Ferdyshchenko, who, with Nastassya Filippovna's approval, {{plays the role of}} cynical buffoon. With the {{acquiescence}} of Kolya, Prince Myshkin arrives, uninvited. To enliven the party, Ferdyshchenko suggests a game where everyone must recount the story of the worst thing they have ever done. Others are shocked at the proposal, but Nastassya Filippovna is enthusiastic. When it comes to Totsky's turn <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> long but completely innocuous anecdote from the distant past. Disgusted and angry, Nastassya Filippovna turns to Myshkin and demands his advice on whether or not to marry Ganya. Myshkin advises her not to, and Nastassya Filippovna, to the dismay of Totsky, General Yepanchin and Ganya, firmly announces that she is following this advice. At this point, Rogozhin and his followers arrive with the promised 100,000 rubles. Nastassya Filippovna is preparing to leave with him, exploiting the scandalous scene to humiliate Totsky, when Myshkin himself offers to marry her. He speaks gently and sincerely, and in response to incredulous queries about what they will live on, produces a document indicating that he will soon be receiving a large inheritance. Though surprised and deeply touched, Nastassya Filippovna, after throwing the 100,000 rubles in the fire and telling Ganya they are his if he wants to get them out, chooses to leave with Rogozhin. Myshkin follows them.|$|E
500|$|In a mid-credits scene, Stryker is {{detained}} {{for questioning}} by some MPs {{in connection with}} the death of his superior, General Munson, whom Stryker had murdered to protect his experiment. There were two alternate post-credits scenes that were shown at different screenings.

500|$|In {{addition}} to being the primary source for Alfred's life, Asser's work is also a source for other historical periods, where he adds material to his translation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. For example, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> story about Eadburh, the daughter of Offa. Eadburh married Beorhtric, king of the West Saxons. Asser describes her as behaving [...] "like a tyrant" [...] and ultimately accidentally poisoning Beorhtric {{in an attempt to}} murder someone else. He finishes by describing her death as a beggar in Pavia. This Eadburh {{is not the same as}} Alfred's mother-in-law, also named Eadburh, whom Asser mentions elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Charles later spoofed {{this double}} {{standard}} {{on the television}} comedy show Saturday Night Live in 1977. He hosted an episode and had the original band he toured with in the 1950s to join him. In one skit, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> producer {{that he wants to}} record the song, but the producer tells him that a white band named the [...] "Young Caucasians", composed of beaming white teenagers, are to record it first, which they do on the show, in a chaste, sanitized, and unexciting performance. When Charles and his band counter with their original version, Garrett Morris tells them, [...] "Sorry. That'll never make it." ...|$|E
500|$|Four elderly men {{meet for}} coffee late at night. The fourth to arrive is {{hostile to the}} waiter, who {{secretly}} urinates in the man's coffee. The man, Abum (Dick Bakalyan), realizes this, and the group share a laugh over it, during which they are revealed to actually be demons. One of them, Blurk (Bill Macy), complains {{that there are no}} strong personalities in this century. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> story of Perry, a man he met hitch-hiking, who he molded into a serial killer over encouraging conversations. Perry sought to emulate Johnny Mack Potter, the country's most prolific killer, and to break his record number of murders. As Perry drew level with Potter's figure, Blurk grew bored accompanying him on the [...] "mundane" [...] murders of prostitutes and vagrants. Blurk gave an anonymous tip to the police that leads to Perry's arrest; one of the men present at the arrest—offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen)—seems to see through Blurk's human disguise. In prison, Perry is murdered by his cellmate Johnny Mack Potter, reclaiming his record.|$|E

500|$|That night, at the Snakehole Lounge, Leslie is {{surprised}} and annoyed to find Ann partying {{on the dance}} floor instead of preparing for the job interview. Ann introduces Leslie to her latest boyfriend, local radio host [...] "The Douche" [...] (Nick Kroll). As Leslie and Ann become increasingly drunk from Snake Juice, Leslie insults Ann's current dating lifestyle. This prompts Ann to insult Leslie for moving too slow with Ben (Adam Scott), whom Leslie is attracted to. The fight escalates throughout the night, and Leslie ultimately claims she always has to keep Ann motivated or she would not go anywhere. Both declare it best that Ann not work with Leslie after all and they storm off. Meanwhile, the Snake Juice proves delicious and popular {{with the rest of the}} parks department employees, all of whom become extremely drunk, with the exception of Donna (Retta) who is the only one not drinking, claiming it's [...] "basically rat poison". Chris arrives to warn Tom that using government employees to promote his own personal ventures is a breach of ethics. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> disappointed Tom that he must sell his shares of the Snakehole Lounge if he wants to keep his job.|$|E
500|$|Soon after sobering up, Stewie {{stretches}} {{and takes}} out a Jenny Craig Anytime Bar from his shopping bag. [...] Brian loses his temper with Stewie for not revealing that he had been storing food the entire time, and Stewie punishes him by only offering one of the Bars he doesn't want to eat himself (though Brian is happy to have it). After Brian calms down, Stewie asks Brian why he has a gun, noting that Brian is a staunch gun control proponent and seems like the last person who would ever have a gun. Brian doesn't {{want to talk about it}} at first, but eventually admits to Stewie's shock and disbelief that he has the gun in case he ever feels he has to commit suicide. Brian confesses that he cannot find his purpose in life, and finds comfort in knowing he has the option of killing himself. He admits that the Scotch was to be a last drink. Stewie then admits that he would be lost without Brian, claiming he is the only person in the world that he really cares about; <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> skeptical Brian that his earlier ranting against Brian was only an attack because Brian verball attacked him, and he finally tells Brian he loves him. Brian tells Stewie he loves him back. In addition, Stewie reminds Brian that maybe making someone else happy is enough, because it is the best gift one person can give, for which Brian thanks him. Stewie falls asleep as Brian reads the beginning of David Copperfield to him. The following morning, the vault door opens, and Brian carries a sleeping Stewie and their belongings out of the room in silence. The episode plays the closing credits without music as well.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{follows the}} {{interrogation}} of Roger [...] "Verbal" [...] Kint, a small-time con {{man who is}} one of only two survivors of a massacre and fire on a ship docked at the Port of Los Angeles. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>an</b> interrogator a convoluted story about events that led him and his partners in crime to the boat, and about a mysterious mob boss known as Keyser Söze who commissioned their work. Using flashback and narration, Kint's story becomes increasingly complex.|$|R

2500|$|In 1960, Tormé {{appeared}} in the TV crime drama Dan Raven with Don Dubbins. He {{had a role in}} a cross-cultural western entitled Walk Like a Dragon, starring Jack Lord. He played [...] "The Deacon", a bible-quoting gunfighter who protects a female saloon-owner and teaches a young Chinese man the art of the fast draw. In one scene, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> soon-to-be victim: [...] "Say your prayers, brother Masters. You're a corpse" [...] and then delivers on the promise. Like Sammy Davis Jr. and Robert Fuller, [...] Tormé was a real-life fast-draw expert. He also sang the show's theme song.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{complaints}} about Trudeau's infomercials is that he makes only vague references to scientific studies, making them impossible to cross-check for accuracy. The same criticism exists for the anecdotal evidence he presents in the infomercials. [...] He does not identify people who he claims have been cured by his methods. For example, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> story in an infomercial about [...] "a friend from England" [...] who came to his house and complained of heartburn. He also references a study done on the antidepressant qualities of St. John's Wort compared to two prescription medications. [...] These studies, the informercials suggest, are identified in the book being advertised for sale, but none of his books provide any such substantiation. [...] In an interview, {{he explained that he}} cannot reveal his source material because of [...] "FTC suppression"; but readers can join his web site, where, for $9.99 a month or $499 for a lifetime, they can gain access to the special members-only section from which they can e-mail him for the information.|$|E
2500|$|Motivated by jealousy, Figaro tells Bartolo and Basilio {{to come to}} his aid when {{he gives}} the signal. Basilio {{comments}} on Figaro's foolishness and claims he was once as frivolous as Figaro was. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> tale of how he was given common sense by [...] "Donna Flemma" [...] ("Dame Prudence") and learned the importance of not crossing powerful people. (aria: In quegli anni – [...] "In those years"). They exit, leaving Figaro alone. Figaro muses bitterly on the inconstancy of women (recitative and aria: Tutto è disposto ... Aprite un po' quegli occhi – [...] "Everything is ready ... Open those eyes a little"). Susanna and the Countess arrive, each dressed in the other's clothes. Marcellina is with them, having informed Susanna of Figaro's suspicions and plans. After they discuss the plan, Marcellina and the Countess leave, and Susanna teases Figaro by singing a love song to her beloved within Figaro's hearing (aria: Deh vieni, non tardar – [...] "Oh come, don't delay").

5000|$|The paradox {{suggested}} by Veronique, [...] "My nose grows now", or in future tense: [...] "will be growing", leaves room for different interpretations. In the novel Pinocchio's nose {{continues to grow}} as he lies: [...] "As he spoke, his nose, long though it was, became at least two inches longer." [...] So logicians question if the sentence [...] "My nose will be growing" [...] was the only sentence that Pinocchio spoke, did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> lie before <b>he</b> said [...] "My nose will be growing", or was <b>he</b> going to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> lie—and {{how long would it}} take for his nose to start growing? ...|$|R

2500|$|Sombra, {{one of the}} {{beautiful}} but naïve Arcadians, is troubled by reports of a place beyond the sea where [...] "monsters" [...] live in cages of brick and stone and never tell the truth – a place called London. The Arcadians beg Father Time to bring them a Londoner. He reluctantly agrees and causes the amateur aviator James Smith, an ageing London restaurateur with passions for aeroplanes and philandering, to crash land in Arcadia, where no one tells lies or grows older, where money is unknown, and employment is unnecessary. The Arcadians and Smith exchange stories, and Smith introduces the Arcadians to some new concepts: ugliness, jealousy and lying. He attempts to seduce Sombra by telling a lie. Far from impressed, the Arcadians immerse him in the Well of Truth, from which he emerges transformed into a young man, wearing the scanty costume of Arcadia, with a luxuriant head of hair but minus his mutton-chop whiskers. They christen him [...] "Simplicitas", and he will remain young until <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> lie. His hosts dispatch him with missionary zeal, and two agelessly beautiful Arcadian nymphs, Sombra and her sister, Chrysea, to wicked London to [...] "set up the truth in England for ever more, and banish the lie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Back in the U.S., Mike {{maintains}} a low profile. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> cab driver to drive past {{the house where}} all his friends are waiting, as he is embarrassed by the fuss Linda and the others have made.

Angela is barely responsive. When asked by Mike about Steven's whereabouts, she writes a phone number on a scrap of paper, which leads Mike to the local VA hospital where Steven has been for several months. Mike goes hunting with Axel, John, and Stan one more time, and after tracking a deer across the woods, but fires into the air. He then sits on a rock escarpment and yells out, [...] "OK?", which echoes back at him. He also berates Stan for carrying around a small revolver and waving it around, not realizing it is loaded. Mike visits Steven, who has lost both of his legs and is partially paralyzed. Steven reveals that someone in Saigon has been mailing large amounts of money to him, and Mike is convinced that it is Nick. Mike brings a reluctant Steven home to Angela and then travels to Saigon just before its fall in 1975.|$|E
