5000|$|The RPI {{is still}} {{used by the}} {{government}} {{as a base for}} various purposes, such as the amounts payable on <b>index-linked</b> <b>securities</b> including index-linked gilts, and social housing rent increases. Many employers also use it as a starting point in wage negotiation. Since 2003, it is no longer used by the government for the inflation target for the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee nor, from April 2011, {{as the basis for the}} indexation of the pensions of former public sector employees. , the UK state pension is indexed by the highest of the increase in average earnings, CPI or 2.5% ("the triple lock").|$|E
40|$|Security {{baskets and}} <b>index-linked</b> <b>{{securities}}</b> are securities whose values are aggregates {{of the cash}} flows or values of other assets. Creation of these "composite" securities improves the welfare of uninformed investors by reducing their trading losses. The introduction of composite securities can also affect real investment decisions. When investors are exposed to nontradeable, heterogeneous risks, different trading equilibria are possible. Markets for multiple composite securities may exist or, when the degree of heterogeneity is high, markets for a single composite security and its component securities may coexist. No results depend {{on the existence of}} exogenous "noise" traders. Copyright 1993 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Index-linked</b> <b>securities</b> {{are offered}} by banks, {{financial}} institutions and building societies to investors looking for downside risk protection whilst still providing upside equity index participation. This article explores how reverse cliquet options can {{be integrated into the}} structure of a guaranteed principal bond. Pricing problems are discussed under the standard Black-Scholes model and under the constant-elasticity-of-variance model. Forward start options are the main element of this structure and new closed formulae are obtained for these options under the latter model. Risk management issues are also discussed. An example is described showing how this structure can be implemented and how the financial engineer may forecast the coupon payment that will be made to investors buying this product without exposing the issuing institution to risk of loss...|$|E
40|$|The {{world is}} first known {{inflation}}-indexed bonds were {{issued by the}} Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1780 during the Revolutionary War. These bonds were invented to deal with severe wartime inflation and with angry discontent among soldiers in the U. S. Army with the decline in purchasing power of their pay. Although the bonds were successful, the concept of indexed bonds was abandoned after the immediate extreme inflationary environment passed, and largely forgotten until the twentieth century. In 1780, the bonds were viewed as at best only an irregular expedient, {{since there was no}} formulated economic theory to justify indexation.

40|$|This Handbook {{discusses}} different possible {{approaches to}} the primary issuance of government debt, that is to say, {{the point at which}} the debt - normally in securitised, or tradable, form - is first sold by the government to the non-state sector. The main focus of the Handbook is on auctions of tradable debt, in part because this is the means predominantly used by developed, developing and transitional countries which issue debt to the non-state sector to finance the governmentâ€™s deficit. But it also covers other means of selling tradable debt, and some aspects of non-tradable debt. The Handbook considers some of the key factors affecting uncertainty and demand in the primary market. In general there will be a cost to uncertainty (where investors are unsure about a number of aspects of the debt issuance programme), and to exclusivity (where access to part or all of the primary market is restricted in some way). But uncertainty may be the counterpart to a measure of flexibility, and exclusivity the counterpart to manageability. Debt managers need to decide where, in view of the structure and state of development of their markets, to make the trade-offs. The Handbook also discusses a number of practical operational issues. An Appendix describes in detail some of the features of <b>index-linked</b> <b>securities.</b> An earlier Handbook (No. 5 The management of government debt, see Related Links) discussed the relative merits of fixed and floating interest securities, but covered indexed securities only briefly. This handbook is also available in Russian and Spanish. Government, Securities, Issuance...|$|E
