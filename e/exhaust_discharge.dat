40|$|This report covers tests {{made on the}} MK 25 torpedo to {{determine}} the effect of gas discharged through a horizontal exhaust pipe. This report is supplemental to the report, Section No. 6. 1 -sr 207 - 1275, which described teats with the gas discharged through a vertical fin. It was requested by Dr. E. H. Colpitts, Chief of Section 6. 1 NDRC, in a letter dated May 4, 1944. The objective of both this and the former report is {{to examine the effects of}} discharging the turbine exhaust gases through the fin structure instead of through the propeller shafts. Since the feasibility of this new method of <b>exhaust</b> <b>discharge</b> is greatly dependent on the effect of the gas flow on the afterbody fin structure and propeller zone, both studies have been restricted to the observation and analysis of this flow. Determination of the effects of the discharge passages and gas stream on the hydrodynamic stability, rudder control, and propeller efficiency have been deferred. Pending the development of an exhaust passage having discharge characteristics that are not visibly unsatisfactory. Several different lengths of exhaust pipe were tested; also, runs were made for various values of velocity and submergence and different amounts of gas discharged. Photographs were taken to show the exhaust cavities created under the different conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{interference}} of {{exhaust gas}} {{on the air}} intake for ventilation system often results in poor indoor air quality (IAQ) on board ships. Low IAQ will adversely affect the performance of human and electronic equipment on board ships and will decrease {{the performance of the}} ship's intended capability. Most studies on exhaust gas interference are for ships with the exhaust funnel located on top but current ship design also includes those with side exhaust. This paper presents the results of a study on the interaction between exhaust gas and the ship's superstructure by the determination of the pressure coefficient obtained through wind tunnel testing for ships with side exhaust. A model of an actual ship with side exhaust with a scale of 1 : 100 was tested in a low speed wind tunnel and pressure coefficients were obtained for various head wind speeds. The results are presented in graphical form and are depicted by the graphs of pressure coefficient versus yaw angle. Preliminary results show that the area around the superstructure near the intake of the ventilation system has low pressure compared to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>discharge.</b> This could lead to the interference of exhaust gas on the intake of the ventilation system and could affect the performance of indoor air quality and electronic equipment on board ships with side exhaust...|$|E
