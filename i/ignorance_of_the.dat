5|$|Commentators {{have offered}} many {{theories}} for {{the origins of}} vampire beliefs, trying to explain the superstition – and sometimes mass hysteria – caused by vampires. Everything ranging from premature burial to the early <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body's decomposition cycle after death has been cited as the cause for the belief in vampires.|$|E
5|$|New Formulation {{reviewer}} Michael Glavin cited Newman's <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{initiative of}} anarchists to decentralize power and of anarchist forms of organisation such as trade unions, federations and affinity groups {{as evidence that}} he failed to understand power and wrongly conflated it with domination.|$|E
5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. The court found the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pilots. The court required the pilots to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E

50|$|Chapter II has ninety verses {{dealing with}} Adhyasa, i.e. Superimposition, which is <b>the</b> {{superimposition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unreal {{on the real}} due to ignorance, its individual and collective aspects, <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> Turiya, <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> pure consciousness, <b>the</b> extensions <b>of</b> <b>Ignorance,</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Subtle Bodies, <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gross Bodies and <b>the</b> Limit <b>of</b> Superimposition.

5|$|By 1885, King {{became aware}} of the scheme and {{retained}} lawyer John Van Voorhis to sue Menage. Menage claimed <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first agreement between King, Remington and Innes and asserted that he had purchased the property outright from the two. After a lengthy trial in Minnesota District Court, Menage lost and was ordered to return the land to King along with all proceeds from the development of the land. Menage appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court in 1886, however the lower court's decision was upheld.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{the vampire}} is {{generally}} {{held to be}} a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating {{the figure of the}} vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.|$|E
5|$|The goal of Espejo's {{first three}} works was the {{intellectual}} improvement of Quito. El Nuevo Luciano de Quito ridiculed the outdated educational system {{maintained by the}} clergy. Espejo argued {{that the people of}} Quito were accustomed to adulation and that they admired any preacher who could quote the Bible in a pompous and insubstantial way. Marco Porcio Catón exposed the <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pseudointellectuals of Quito. La ciencia blancardina, in which Espejo claimed to be the author of the previous two works, condemned the results of the clergy's educational system: ignorance and affectation. All three works caused polemic.|$|E

5|$|In March 1787, he {{continued}} his attack against his enemies from Riobamba {{with a series of}} eight satirical letters which he called Cartas riobambenses. In response, his enemies denounced Espejo before the President of the Royal Audiencia, Juan José De Villalengua. On August 24, 1787, Villalengua requested that Espejo either to go to Lima or return to Quito to occupy a post in the government, and subsequently arrested him. Espejo was accused of writing El Retrato de Golilla, a satire against King Charles III and the Marquis de la Sonora, colonial minister of the Indies. He was taken to Quito, and from prison he sent three petitions to the Court in Madrid, which decreed, on Charles III's behalf, that the case was to be taken to the Viceroy of Bogotá. President Villalengua feigned <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter and sent Espejo to Bogotá to defend his own cause.|$|E
40|$|With {{present and}} future {{observations}} becoming of higher and higher quality, it is timely and necessary to investigate the most significant theoretical uncertainties in <b>the</b> predictions <b>of</b> inflation. We show that our <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe, including <b>the</b> physics <b>of</b> reheating after inflation, translates to considerable errors in observationally relevant parameters. Using the inflationary flow formalism, we estimate that for a spectral index n and tensor/scalar ratio r in the region favored by current observational constraints, the theoretical errors are of order Δ n ∼ 0. 02 and Δ r /r ∼ 1. These errors represent the dominant theoretical uncertainties in <b>the</b> predictions <b>of</b> inflation, and are generically <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> or larger than the projected uncertainties in future precision measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cosmic Microwave Background.

5|$|Messi's {{financial}} affairs {{came under}} investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were allegedly used to evade €4.1million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama, {{set up in}} 2012, was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1million in August 2013. He stood trial alongside his father on three counts of tax evasion in May 2016. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7million and €1.4million in fines.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{wrote that}} there had been a {{hardening}} of police attitudes, with officers believing that proportionality meant reciprocity. The deployment of officers in riot gear had become a routine response to lawful protest, largely the result of an <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law and a lack of leadership from the Home Office and police chiefs. Officers were being trained to use their riot shields as weapons. Police forces across the country differed in their training, the equipment they had access to, and their understanding of the law. The failure to understand the relevant legislation was in part due to its complexity, the report said, with 90 amendments to the Public Order Act passed since 1986.|$|E
5|$|Prescott {{enrolled}} at Harvard College {{as a second}} year student (sophomore) in August 1811, {{at the age of}} 15. He was not considered academically distinguished, despite showing promise in Latin and Greek. Prescott found mathematics particularly difficult, and resorted to memorizing mathematical demonstrations word-for-word, which he could do with relative ease, in order to hide his <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subject. Prescott's eyesight degenerated after being hit in the eye with a crust of bread during a food fight as a student, and it remained weak and unstable throughout the rest of his life. Prescott was admitted to the Phi Beta Kappa Society as a senior, which he considered a great personal honor, and graduated from Harvard in 1814. After a short period of rheumatic illness, he embarked on an extended tour of Europe.|$|E

5|$|As {{told in the}} Kurma Purana, Bhikshatana-Shiva {{wanted to}} reveal the <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sages, who were engrossed in Dharma (righteousness) and extreme austerities but had {{forgotten}} the Samkhya (Supreme Knowledge). The naked, handsome, ithyphallic (with an erect phallus, urdhvalinga) beggar Shiva entered the forest, begging for alms from the sages' wives. They were so enamoured of him that while granting alms, they allowed their clothes to fall off and followed him, dancing and singing, love-sick. Bhikshatana was accompanied by Mohini—Vishnu disguised as Bhikshatana's enchanting wife, who maddens the sages' sons in love. The sages, unable to recognise Shiva, abused and cursed him, even assaulting him. They cursed that his Linga (phallus) should fall off. Shiva allowed it to be so and the Linga became an infinite fiery pillar of light. Anusuya, the wife of sage Atri, enlightened the sages that the couple {{was none other than}} Shiva and Vishnu. The sages thereafter worshipped the Linga. Pleased, Shiva returned to the forest as a beggar in an ugly form with his wife Parvati. Eventually, he revealed his supreme form to the sages and exalted the Pashupata vow – by which a man restrains his passion, becomes celibate, and roams naked smeared with ash – declaring that such a lifestyle would lead to moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|Fourteen {{fighters were}} sent to strafe from low altitude, German ground targets ahead of the British infantry, roving behind German lines, attacking infantry, transport, gun-teams and machine-gun nests; the attacks {{continued}} all day, {{with two of the}} British aircraft being shot down. Organised attacks were made on the German airfields at Bisseghem and Marcke near Courtrai and the day bombing squadrons attacked airfields at Ramegnies Chin, Coucou, Bisseghem (again) and Rumbeke. Reconnaissance reports of German troops concentrating from Quesnoy to Warneton, led to aircraft setting out to attack them within minutes. German fighters made a considerable effort to intercept corps observation aircraft over the battlefield but were frustrated by patrols on the barrage line and offensive patrols beyond; only one British corps aircraft was shot down by German aircraft during the day. After dark, the night-bombing specialists of 100 Squadron bombed railway stations at Warneton, Menin and Courtrai. <b>Ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation at the northern end of the II Anzac Corps front was resolved by air reconnaissance at dawn on 8 June.|$|E
5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Andrei and Foma have a {{conversation}} about Foma’s faults, especially lying. Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden, after Andrei notices his cassock is tacky, and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. While Foma has talent as an artist, he is less concerned with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick. We cut to banks of a stream where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that the <b>ignorance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn’t understand how {{he can be a}} painter and maintain such views. This section contains a reenactment of Christ's Crucifixion on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God's will and loved him.|$|E
