However, numerous factors in addition to exposure magnitude influence biomarker {{concentrations in}} spot samples, including temporal variation in spot samples because of elimination kinetics. The influence of half-life of elimination relative to <b>exposure</b> <b>interval</b> is examined here using simple first-order pharmacokinetic simulations of urinary concentrations in spot samples collected at random times relative to exposure events. Repeated exposures were modeled for each individual in the simulation with exposure amounts drawn from lognormal distributions with varying geometric standard deviations.

Results of the modeling agreed well with data from a serial urine collection data set from the Centers for Disease Control.

Adults of the above species were exposed on wheat treated with spinetoram at 1 ppm (1 mg/kg of wheat) for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 40, and 72 h. After this interval, mortality was recorded (immediate mortality) and the surviving individuals were transferred in untreated wheat, where mortality was recorded again 7 d later (delayed mortality). Then, all adults were removed, and the number of progeny production in the untreated substrate was measured 65 d later. From the species tested, R. dominica was by far the most susceptible, given that immediate and delayed mortality for the 72 -h <b>exposure</b> <b>interval</b> reached 44 and 97 %, respectively. At the same time, progeny production was low, in most of the exposure intervals tested.

Finally, adult mortality for T. confusum was extremely low, regardless of the <b>exposure</b> <b>interval</b> and the type of the formulation.
