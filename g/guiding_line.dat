5000|$|Different rules {{govern the}} {{possible}} explanations for representations of the four classes and “every explanation given in accordance with this <b>guiding</b> <b>line</b> is merely relative. It principle of sufficient reason explains things in reference to one another, but it always leaves unexplained something that it presupposes,” and the two things that are absolutely inexplicable are the principle itself and the “thing in itself”, which Schopenhauer connects with the will to live. The principle, in another point of view, provides the general form of any given perspective, presupposing both subject and object. The thing in itself, consequently, remains forever unknowable from any standpoint, for any qualities attributed to it are merely perceived, i.e., constructed in the mind from sensations given in time and space. Furthermore, because the concepts we form from our perceptions cannot in any way refer with any validity to anything beyond these limits to experience, all proofs {{for the existence of}} God or anything beyond the possibility of experience fall away under the razor of Kant’s critique. Kant termed this critical or transcendental idealism. Important to note here is that “Transcendental” does not refer to knowing the unknowable, but rather it refers to the a priori intellectual conditions for experience. This intuition of the a priori understanding is a modern elucidation of the postmodern expression [...] "always already": time and space always and already determine the possibilities of experience. Additionally, Schopenhauer distinguishes from this something he calls a [...] "spurious a priori": cultural perspectives (ideologies) one is born into that determine one's relationship to experience, in addition to the forms of space and time. He considers these false because it is possible to investigate and uncover their grounds, leading to a reorientation that regards the phenomena of experience as source material of new knowledge, rather than one's always already prejudices about phenomena.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a camera-based position measurement system for automatic tracking {{control of a}} rubber Tired Gantry Crane (RTGC). An automatic tracking control of RTGC depends {{on the ability to}} measure its displacement and angle from a <b>guide</b> <b>line</b> that the RTGC has to follow. The measurement system proposed in this paper is composed of a camera and a PC that are mounted on the right upper between front and rear tires of the RTGC’s side. The measurement accuracy of the system is affected by disturbances such as cracks and stains of the <b>guide</b> <b>line,</b> shadows, and halation from the light fluctuation. To overcome the disturbances, both side edges of the <b>guide</b> <b>line</b> are detected as two straight lines from an input image taken by the camera, and parameters of the straight lines are determined by using Hough transform. The displacement and angle of the RTGC from the <b>guide</b> <b>line</b> can be obtained from these parameters with the robustness against the disturbances. From the experiments with the disturbances, we found the accurate displacement and the angle from the <b>guide</b> <b>line</b> that have the standard deviations of 0. 95 pixels and 0. 22 degrees, respectively...|$|R

By following this <b>guiding</b> <b>line</b> we arrive to consider, for a general noncommutative probability space (A, phi), a family of "(l,r) -cumulant functionals" which enlarges the family of free cumulant functionals of the space. In the motivating case of canonical operators on the full Fock space we find a simple formula for a relevant family of (l,r) -cumulants of a (2 d) -tuple (A_ 1, [...] ., A_d, B_ 1, [...] ., B_d), with A_ 1, [...] ., A_d canonical operators on the left and B_ 1, [...] ., B_d canonical operators on the right.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{experience}} of last five years, during which 24 guide liens about the most important aspects of Occupational Physician activity have been produced, the Italian Society of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene (SIMLII) delegated a specific working group for updating the methodology to be adopted for <b>guide</b> <b>lines</b> and other instruments for improving and standardizing the current activity in our professional field. SIMLII produced {{in the context of the}} specific Education and Accreditation Programme for occupational physicians prepared from 2002 25 <b>guide</b> <b>lines</b> or other informative instruments on the most important and controversial themes in which our discipline is involved. They were considered and treated to meet the need to improve and standardise activities and to modify the current approach of occupational physicians and aimed not only at improving the effectiveness of preventive actions but also at constantly adopting rigorous methodologies based where possible on evidence based or on consensus procedures. The Directive of SIMLII was firmly convinced about the opportunity-necessity to critically evaluate the experience carried out during the last years, at the light of the National Program for <b>Guide</b> <b>Lines</b> edited By Italian National Health Institute since 2002 and which concerns preparation, dissemination, updating, implementation of <b>guide</b> <b>lines</b> in Medicine.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} some {{problems}} of constructing and graphical displaying {{for a class}} of kinematic surfaces generated by mutual moving ruled surfaces touching one another along their common ruling in each position [1, 2]. Exactly, {{we are dealing with}} the surfaces generated by movement of a cone fixed ruling during combined movement of the cone with respect to a torse surface [2]. The movement is defined as a cone rotating with simultaneous movement of the cone vortex along the torse edge-of-regression so that both surfaces, the torse and the cone, touch one another along the common ruling [3 - 5]. The methods and program modules developed allow using a wide range of curves as a torse edge-of-regression and a cone <b>guiding</b> <b>line.</b> Since the program modules are implemented using some numerical methods the application of a new-type curve is reduced to define the curve within the program module.

40|$|Complying {{with the}} idea that {{institutions}} could be used “to manage conflict democratically in divided societies” (Belmont et al. 2002, p. 3), the Belgian state has reformed its institutions in the past 40 years to accommodate ethno-linguistic tensions between Dutchspeakers and French-speakers. While less frequently mentioned, electoral rules have also been adapted to this ‘ethnicization’ of Belgian politics. Interestingly, changes made to the electoral system for managing tensions between the two linguistic communities followed the core principles of consociationalism.
