50|$|An {{electrostatic}} <b>immersion</b> <b>objective</b> lens {{brings the}} sample {{close to that}} of the gun, slowing down the high energy electrons to a desired energy only just before interacting with the sample surface.|$|E
50|$|Water <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> {{are used}} {{not only at}} very large magnifications that require high resolving power, but also of {{moderate}} power as there are water <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> as low as 4X. Objectives with high power magnification have short focal lengths, facilitating the use of water. The water {{is applied to the}} specimen (conventional microscope), and the stage is raised, immersing the objective in water. Sometimes with water dipping objectives, the objective is directly immersed in the solution of water which contains the specimens to look at. Electrophoretic preparations used in the case of comet assay can benefit from the use of water objectives.|$|R
50|$|From {{the above}} it is {{understood}} that oil between the specimen and the objective lens improves the resolving power by a factor 1/n. Objectives specifically designed for this purpose are known as oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives.</b>|$|R
50|$|Oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> {{can have}} {{practical}} difficulties {{due to their}} shallow depth of field and extremely short working distance, which calls {{for the use of}} very thin (0.17 mm) cover slips, or, in an inverted microscope, thin glass-bottomed Petri dishes.|$|R

50|$|In light microscopy, a water <b>immersion</b> <b>objective</b> is a {{specially}} designed objective lens used to increase {{the resolution of the}} microscope. This is achieved by immersing both the lens and the specimen in water which has a higher refractive index than air, thereby increasing the numerical aperture of the objective lens.|$|E
50|$|Immersion oils are {{transparent}} oils {{that have}} specific optical and viscosity characteristics necessary {{for use in}} microscopy. Typical oils used have an index of refraction around 1.515. An oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objective</b> is an objective lens specially designed {{to be used in}} this way. Many condensers also give optimal resolution when the condenser lens is immersed in oil.|$|E

Typical oils used have an index of refraction around 1.515. An oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objective</b> is an objective lens specially designed {{to be used in}} this way.

50|$|To solve {{his problem}} Zeiss {{returned}} to his original plans to design his objectives based on a calculated theoretical basis.  He renewed his search for a collaborator and this time chose Ernst Abbe (1840-1905), a private docent, or associate professor, at the university.  The official collaboration between the 50 year old Zeiss and 26 year old Abbe began in July 1866 {{with the goal of}} the creation of a water <b>immersion</b> <b>objective</b> with resolution equal to those of Emil Hartnack’s.|$|E
50|$|The {{objectives}} for these new compound microscopes were still empirically design but nonetheless met with immediate approval from Leopold Dippel.  Dippel examined the optical {{quality of the}} most useful objectives, A, C, D and F and had considerable praise for Zeiss’ new objectives.  The D objective was compared very favorably with the similar power objectives of Belthle and Hartnack (successor to Oberhaeuser).  The F objective is even described as the equal of much more expensive objectives from established makers.  It is assessed as {{almost as good as}} Hartnack’s water immersion objectives.  That was, of course the problem.  When selling to researchers at the forefront of their fields, “almost as good” is a commercial disaster.  Zeiss knew quite well that his strongest objectives could not match the quality of the Hartnack water immersion objectives.  Every attempt to empirically design a satisfactory water <b>immersion</b> <b>objective</b> had failed.|$|E
3000|$|... min is {{the minimal}} resolvable distance, λ the {{wavelength}} of the light, and α the half aperture {{angle of the}} microscope’s objectivec; it is left open whether λ refers to the wavelength in the immersion medium or in air. Abbe does not discuss explicitly {{the influence of the}} refractive index in the sample and the immersion medium, though he does consider <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives.</b>|$|R
30|$|The image {{analysis}} system was used to grab and analyze images for coke micro-structures and optical textures under reflected light microscope with oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> rapidly and accurately. The system was comprised of color digital camera, interfaces, software, data acquisition and other required equipments. The {{image analysis}} software was used for processing, display and analysis of color or monochrome images of different constituent phases, measurement of dimensions and estimation of gray level and color of different phases present. It was also be capable of carrying out statistical analysis of data.|$|R
50|$|With no {{modification}} to the microscope, i.e. with {{a simple}} wide field light microscope, the quality of optical sectioning is governed by the same physics as the depth of field effect in photography. For a high numerical aperture lens, equivalent to a wide aperture, the depth of field is small (shallow focus) and gives good optical sectioning. High magnification objective lenses typically have higher numerical apertures (and so better optical sectioning) than low magnification <b>objectives.</b> Oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> typically have even larger numerical apertures so improved optical sectioning.|$|R
5000|$|In 1866, {{he became}} a {{research}} director at the Zeiss Optical Works, and in 1886 he invented the apochromatic lens, a microscope lens which eliminates both the primary and secondary color distortion. By 1870, Abbe invented the Abbe condenser, used for microscope illumination. In 1871, he designed the first refractometer, which he described in a booklet published in 1874. [...] He developed the laws of image of non-luminous objects by 1872. Zeiss Optical Works began selling his improved microscopes in 1872, by 1877 they were selling microscopes with homogenous <b>immersion</b> <b>objective,</b> and in 1886 his apochromatic objective microscopes were being sold. He created the Abbe number, a measure of any transparent material's variation of refractive index with wavelength and Abbe's criterion, which tests the hypothesis, that a systematic trend exists {{in a set of}} observations (in terms of resolving power this criterion stipulates that an angular separation cannot be less than the ratio of the wavelength to the aperture diameter, see angular resolution). Already a professor in Jena, he was hired by Carl Zeiss to improve the manufacturing process of optical instruments, which back then was largely based on trial and error.|$|E
50|$|A typical LEEM setup {{consists}} of (see figure):1. Electron gun, {{used to generate}} electrons by way of thermionic or field emission from a source tip. In thermionic emission, electrons escape a source tip (usually made of LaB6) by resistive heating and application of an electric field to effectively lower the energy needed for electrons to escape the surface. Once sufficient thermal vibrational energy is attained electrons may overcome this electrostatic energy barrier, allowing them to travel into vacuum and accelerate down the lens column to the gun potential (because the lenses are at ground). In field emission, rather than heating the tip to vibrationally excite electrons from the surface, the source tip (usually tungsten) is sharpened to a small point such that when large electric fields are applied, they concentrate at the tip, lowering the barrier to escape the surface as well as making tunneling of electrons from the tip to vacuum level more feasible. 2. Condenser/illumination optics, used to focus electrons leaving the electron gun and manipulate and/or translate the illumination electron beam. Electromagnetic quadrupole electron lenses are used, the number of which {{depends on how much}} resolution and focusing flexibility the designer wishes. However, the ultimate resolution of LEEM is usually determined by that of the objective lens.3. Illumination beam aperture allows researchers to control the area of the specimen which is illuminated (LEEM’s version of electron microscopy’s “selected area diffraction”, termed microdiffraction) and is located in the beam separator on the illumination side.4. Magnetic beam separator, needed to resolve the illuminating and imaging beam (while in turn spatially separating the optics for each). There has been much development on the technology of electron beam separators; the early separators introduced distortion in either the image or diffraction plane. However, IBM recently developed a hybrid prism array/nested quadratic field design, focusing the electron beams {{both in and out of}} the plane of the beampath, allowing for deflection and transfer of the image and diffraction planes without distortion or energy dispersion.5. Electrostatic <b>immersion</b> <b>objective</b> lens, used to form a real image of the sample by way of a 2/3-magnification virtual image behind the sample. The uniformity of the electrostatic field between the objective lens and specimen, limited by spherical and chromatic aberrations larger than those of any other lenses, ultimately determines the overall performance of the instrument.6. Contrast aperture, located in the center on the projector lens side of the beam separator. In most electron microscopies, the contrast aperture is introduced into the back focal plan of the objective lens (where the actual diffraction plane lies). However, this is not true in the LEEM, because dark-field imaging (imaging of nonspecular beams) would not be possible because the aperture has to move laterally and would intercept the incident beam for large shifts. Therefore, researchers adjust the excitation of the objective lens so as to produce an image of the diffraction pattern in the middle of the beam separator and choose the desired spot intensity to image using a contrast aperture inserted there. This aperture allows scientists to image diffraction intensities that may be of particular interest (dark field).7. Illumination optics are employed to magnify the image or diffraction pattern and project it onto the imaging plate or screen.8. Imaging plate or screen, used to image the electron intensity so that we can see it. This can be done many different ways including, phosphorescent screens, imaging plates, CCDs, among others.|$|E

5000|$|Oberhaeuser {{appointed}} {{his nephew}} Edmund Hartnack {{a partner in}} the workshop in 1854 and technical director in 1860. Oberhaeuser eventually withdrew from the day to day business of the firm, naming Hartnack as his successor in 1864. By the late 1850s Oberhaeuser and Hartnack had already redesigned their objectives, again following the lead of Amici, to give larger usable apertures and higher resolution. The new series, including their water <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives,</b> would set the standard for excellence for several years. [...] Georges Oberhaeuser died in Paris in 1868.|$|R
25|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} is {{a powerful}} technique to show specifically labeled structures within a complex environment and to provide three-dimensional information of biological structures. However, this information is blurred by the fact that, upon illumination, all fluorescently labeled structures emit light, irrespective of whether they are in focus or not. So {{an image of a}} certain structure is always blurred by the contribution of light from structures that are out of focus. This phenomenon results in a loss of contrast especially when using objectives with a high resolving power, typically oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> with a high numerical aperture.|$|R
50|$|Beyond {{increasing}} numerical aperture, {{there are}} few techniques available to improve optical sectioning in bright-field light microscopy. Most microscopes with oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> are reaching the limits of numerical aperture possible due to refraction limits.Differential interference contrast (DIC) provides modest improvements to optical sectioning. In DIC the sample is effectively illuminated by two slightly offset light sources which then interfere to produce an image resulting from the phase differences of the two sources. As the offset in the light sources is small the only difference in phase results from the material close to the focal plane.|$|R

In this article, we particularly focus our attention on studies toward optimizing the microscope unit. For this purpose, the refractive index and background fluorescence, absorption spectrum for various ionic liquids wre investigated. We also measured {{the images of the}} beam spot of excitation laser at focal point by using an <b>immersion</b> <b>objective</b> and various ionic liquids.

40|$|This {{protocol}} {{describes the}} culture of early stage chick embryos in liquid culture with the epiblast side up. We have designed a special culture chamber, in which the embryo {{is supported by a}} small layer of heavy silicone oil, effectively sealing of the basal side of the epiblast and forming hypoblast from the surrounding medium. Under these conditions the unincubated embryos develop to the fully extended streak stages (HH 4 - 5) during 20 hrs of culture.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the reflection of}} a strongly focused beam from an interface between two dielectric media. If the beam is incident from the optically denser medium, the image generated by the reflected light is strongly aberrated. This situation is encountered in high-resolution confocal microscopy and data sampling based on solid immersion lenses and oil <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives.</b> The origin of the observed aberrations lies {{in the nature of}} total internal reflection, for which there is a phase shift between incident and ref lected waves. This phase shift displaces the apparent reflection point beyond the interface, similarly to the Goos–Hänchen shift...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new method to generate thin (thickness > 200 nm) and ultrathin (thickness < 200 nm) fluorescent layers {{to be used}} for microscope optical characterization. These layers are obtained by ultramicrotomy sectioning of fluorescent acrylic slides. This technique generates sub-resolution sheets with high fluorescence emission and uniform thickness, permitting to determine the z-response of different optical sectioning systems. Compared to the state of the art, the here proposed technique allows shorter and easier manufacturing procedure. Moreover, these fluorescent layers can be employed without protective coverslips, allowing the use of the Sectioned Imaging Property (SIP) -chart characterization method with coverslip-uncorrected <b>objectives,</b> water <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> and micro-endoscopes. © 2014 Optical Society of America...|$|R

The technique can achieve picometer level sensitivity. Cross validation with AFM measurements is obtained through use of vitreous silica step calibration samples. Measurements on the inner surfaces of fibre-sized glass capillaries drawn from high purity suprasil F 300 tubes show a sub-nanometer roughness, and the roughness power spectrum measured in the range [5 x 10 ^- 3 µm^- 1 to 10 ^- 1 µm^- 1] is consistent with the description of the glass surface as a superposition of frozen capillary waves. The surface roughness spectrum of two capillary tubes of differing compositions can be quantitatively distinguished...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence {{correlation}} spectroscopy (FCS) is frequently {{used to measure}} the self-diffusion coefficient of fluorescently labeled probes in solutions, complex media, and living cells. In a standard experiment water <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> and window thickness in the range of 0. 13 – 0. 19 mm are used. We show that successful FCS measurements can be performed using samples of different refractive index placed in cells having windows of different thickness, even much thicker than nominally allowed. Different water, oil, and silicon oil immersion as well as long working distance dry objectives, equipped with the correction collar, were tested and compared. We demonstrate that the requirements for FCS experiments are less stringent than those for high resolution confocal imaging and reliable relative FCS measurements can be performed even beyond the compensation range of the objectives. All these features open new possibilities for construction of custom-made high temperature and high pressure cells for FCS...|$|R
40|$|Our {{insights}} into the basic characteristics of neuronal function were significantly advanced by combining the in vitro slice technique with the visualization of neurons and their processes. The visualization through water <b>immersion</b> <b>objectives</b> requires keeping slices submerged in recording chambers where delivering artificial cerebro-spinal fluid (aCSF) at flow rates of 2 – 3  ml/min results in a limited oxygen supply [Hájos N, Ellender TJ, Zemankovics R, Mann EO, Exley R, Cragg SJ, et al. Maintaining network activity in submerged hippocampal slices: importance of oxygen supply. Eur J Neurosci 2009; 29 : 319 – 27]. Here we review two methods aimed at providing sufficient oxygen levels to neurons in submerged slices to enable high energy consuming processes such as elevated firing rates or network oscillations. The use of these methods may also influence the outcome of other electrophysiological experiments in submerged slices including the study of intercellular signaling pathways.
