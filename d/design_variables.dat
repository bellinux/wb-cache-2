In designing environmentally optimal buildings, the objective is to minimize the total environmental impact associated with all life-cycle stages of the building project. However, building as a process is not as streamlined as an industrial process, and varies from one building to the other, never repeating itself identically. In addition, buildings are much more complex products, composed of a multitude of materials and components each constituting various <b>design</b> <b>variables</b> to be decided at the design stage. A variation of every design variable may affect the environment during all the building's relevant life-cycle stages.|$|E

In the harmony search method, if PAR test gives the answer of “yes,” the new value of a <b>design</b> <b>variable</b> is taken as the value available in the harmony matrix either one row up or down, or few rows up or down.

The side-on design is used, for instance, in the type 931, the first mass-produced PMT.

40|$|Abstract — A {{number of}} multi-objective genetic {{algorithms}} (MOGAs) {{have been developed}} to obtain Pareto optimal solutions for multi-objective optimization problems.

In such cases, there are unsearched areas in the <b>design</b> <b>variable</b> space, and the obtained Pareto solutions may not be truly optimal. In this paper, we propose an optimization method called NSDIRECT-GA to conduct a global search over as much as possible of the <b>design</b> <b>variable</b> space, which improves the reliability of the obtained Pareto solutions. The effectiveness of NSDIRECT-GA was examined through numerical experiments. By NSDIRECT-GA, not only the optimal solutions but also the information of the landscape can be determined, and it is possible to obtain Pareto solutions with higher reliability than with normal MOGAs.

One method for estimating flood risk from two extremes is the <b>design</b> <b>variable</b> method, but this method is typically applied at an individual location along the river reach, so that, it is unclear how feasibly the method can be implemented with output from two dimensional hydraulic models. Adapting the <b>design</b> <b>variable</b> method to a spatial setting presents interesting challenges in terms of computational demand, how to incorporate regions outside the main channel and whether or not the method can be applied independently across grid cell locations. To test these issues, a case study is presented for the Nambucca catchment in the Mid North Coast region, NSW. At this location 144 water level maps were used, based on TUFLOW model output, corresponding to combinations of 12 storm tide return-levels and 12 rainfall event return-levels, from 63 %AEP to 0. 05 %AEP.
