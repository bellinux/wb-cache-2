5|$|Back at city hall, Ron (Nick Offerman) remains <b>immobile</b> in {{his chair}} all day due to a hernia which causes excruciating pain if he moves. Ron remains <b>immobile</b> in his seat well into the night, until the janitors turn the lights off on him. The intern, April (Aubrey Plaza), returns to check on him, and wheels Ron {{out to the car}} on his office chair to bring him to the hospital.|$|E

5|$|During his {{re-examination}} of Iguanodon, David Norman {{was able}} to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and pectoral girdle more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively <b>immobile,</b> with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, and able to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively <b>immobile,</b> and the arms and shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{are mostly}} soft bodied, fragile and almost defenseless {{compared}} to other, larger lifeforms. The immature stages are small, move slowly or are <b>immobile,</b> {{and so all}} stages are exposed to predation and parasitism. Insects then {{have a variety of}} defense strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids. These include camouflage, mimicry, toxicity and active defense.|$|E
5|$|Other {{differences}} between the principal and secondary eyes are that the latter have rhabdomeres that point away from incoming light, just like in vertebrates, while the arrangement is the opposite in the former. The principal eyes are also the only ones with eye muscles, allowing them to move the retina. Having no muscles, the secondary eyes are <b>immobile.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{receiving}} station was formed from the <b>immobile</b> sections of light horse and mounted rifle brigades' field ambulances, a section from the 1/1st Welsh and the 157th Indian Field Ambulances with an operating unit, the Anzac Field Laboratory, and a detachment from an Egyptian hospital. This Receiving Station {{took over the}} site near Jericho, occupied by the main dressing station during the two Transjordan attacks, which could accommodate 200 patients in mud huts, 400 patients in tents, and 700 patients in the abandoned Desert Mounted Corps headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are <b>immobile,</b> these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae have little yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E
5|$|Around 956, Olaf, at Melkorka's urging, {{decided to}} go abroad to seek his fortune. Hoskuld was opposed and would not provide trade wares, and the {{property}} of Olaf's foster-father Thord was mostly in <b>immobile</b> goods and land. In part to arrange financing for his expedition, his mother Melkorka married Thorbjorn the Feeble, a farmer who had previously assisted her {{in the management of}} Melkorkustead. Melkorka and Thorbjorn had a son named Lambi.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} for ceratosaurs, the abelisaurid hand had four basic digits. However, {{it is there}} that any {{similarity}} ends. No wrist bones existed, with the four palm bones (metacarpals) attaching directly to the forearm. There were no finger bones on the first or fourth digits, only one on the second digit and two on the third digit. These two external fingers were extremely short and <b>immobile.</b> Manual claws were very small in Eoabelisaurus, and totally absent in carnotaurines.|$|E
5|$|Data for the abelisaurid forelimbs {{are known}} from Eoabelisaurus and the carnotaurines Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus. All had small forelimbs {{which seem to}} have been vestigial. The bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) were {{extremely}} short, only 25% of the length of the upper arm (humerus) in Carnotaurus and 33% in Aucasaurus. The entire arm was held straight, and the elbow joint was <b>immobile.</b>|$|E
5|$|Great white sharks, {{like all}} other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the {{electromagnetic}} field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even <b>immobile</b> animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E
5|$|Greater yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather {{lay their eggs}} directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, the ground, or in the hollows of stumps. Eggs are cream-colored and blotched with brown spots, particularly around the larger end. Clutch size ranges from one to three, though two is the norm. The chicks are altricial—blind, naked and relatively <b>immobile</b> upon hatching, and grow down feathers later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|E
5|$|<b>Immobile</b> Holliday junctions, with {{asymmetrical}} sequences that {{lock the}} strands {{in a specific}} position, were artificially created by scientists to study their structure {{as a model for}} natural Holliday junctions. These junctions also later found use as basic structural building blocks in DNA nanotechnology, where multiple Holliday junctions can be combined into specific designed geometries that provide molecules {{with a high degree of}} structural rigidity.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Epoch C-Works {{released}} {{a series of}} action figures based on characters from the original Soulcalibur, amongst them Astaroth. The semi-posable figure of Astaroth was packaged with equipable weapons from the title. In August 2003, Todd McFarlane Productions {{released a}}n Astaroth sculpture amongst a set of five based on characters from Soulcalibur II. The <b>immobile</b> figure was modeled after his secondary outfit and stood six inches tall with a base.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 Lü {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} that the articulation between the quadrate and quadratojugal bones in the skull of Nemegtomaia suggested that these bones were movable in relation to each other, which would have affected how the jaws functioned. In 2015 Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues found it unlikely that Nemegtomaia and other oviraptords had bird-like kinesis in their skulls, due to the quadrate bone being <b>immobile.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lepidopterans {{are soft}} bodied, fragile and almost defenseless while the {{immature}} stages move slowly or are <b>immobile,</b> hence all stages {{are exposed to}} predation by birds, small mammals, lizards, amphibians, invertebrate predators (notably parasitoid and parasitic wasps and flies) as well as fungi and bacteria. To combat this, Lepidoptera have developed a number of strategies for defense and protection which include camouflage, aposematism, mimicry, {{and the development of}} threat patterns and displays.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are altricial, meaning that, when hatched, {{they are}} born {{relatively}} <b>immobile</b> and defenseless and therefore require nourishment for a certain duration from their parents. The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there are higher levels of nestling predation than egg predation. The levels of belligerence exhibited by parents therefore increase once eggs hatch {{but there is no}} increase during the egg stage.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, {{followed}} by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and warm-blooded prey (like sea birds). Most species are generalist feeders, {{but a few}} are specialists. They typically hunt non-schooling fish, slow-moving or <b>immobile</b> invertebrates or endothermic prey when in groups. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{constitute}} the phylum Porifera, {{and have been}} defined as sessile metazoans (multicelled <b>immobile</b> animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with choanocytes, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes. All known living sponges can remold their bodies, as most types of their cells can move within their bodies and a few can change from one type to another.|$|E
5|$|Steering {{currents}} remained weak {{giving the}} storm {{a chance to}} fully re-develop its deep convection while <b>immobile</b> at sea. During this time, Tropical Storm Gordon began to spawn tornadoes. As the storm center was well offshore most were probably unreported, but six tornadoes touched down on the Florida coast. Four of the tornadoes were rated F0 on the Fujita scale, two were rated F1, and one was given an F2 rating with estimated wind speeds of 113ndash&157 mph (181ndash&253 km/h).|$|E
5|$|The family Balaenidae {{contains}} two genera and four species. All the Balaenidae whales have no ventral grooves; a distinctive head shape with a strongly arched, narrow rostrum, bowed lower jaw; lower lips that enfold {{the sides and}} front of the rostrum; long, narrow, elastic baleen plates (up to 9 times longer than wide) with fine baleen fringes; and fused cervical vertebrae rendering the head <b>immobile.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the Tumbler was an <b>immobile</b> studio set and not actually the {{interior of}} a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual Tumbler was used for the waterfall sequence.|$|E
5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing {{for a wide range of}} movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less <b>immobile.</b>|$|E
5|$|Theoretically, {{all life}} forms {{are said to}} deserve full {{protection}} {{from all kinds of}} injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than <b>immobile</b> ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|While the pupa is {{generally}} stationary and <b>immobile,</b> {{those of the}} primitive moth families Micropterigidae, Agathiphagidae and Heterobathmiidae have fully functional mandibles. These serve principally to allow the adult {{to escape from the}} cocoon. Besides this, all appendages and the body are separate from the pupal skin and enjoy a degree of independent motion. All other superfamilies of the Lepidoptera are more specialised, have non-functional mandibles, appendages and body attached to the pupal skin, and lose a degree of independent movement.|$|E
5|$|As Tirpitz {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a threat to}} shipping, the British Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided in late August to conduct further attacks against her using Royal Air Force heavy bombers. On 15 September, a force of Avro Lancasters attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted irreparable damage on the battleship. Following this raid she sailed to an anchorage near Tromsø {{to be used as}} an <b>immobile</b> coastal defence battery. Another heavy bomber attack on 29 October caused only minor damage, but in a third raid mounted on 12 November, Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized, sinking with heavy loss of life.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{upon the}} risk for DVT, {{different}} preventive measures are recommended. Walking and calf exercises reduce venous stasis because leg muscle contractions compress the veins and pump blood up towards the heart. In <b>immobile</b> individuals, physical compression methods improve blood flow. Anticoagulation, which {{increases the risk of}} bleeding, might be used in high-risk scenarios. The risk of major bleeding with long-term anticoagulation is about 3% per year, and the point where annual VTE risk is thought to warrant long-term anticoagulation is estimated to be between 3 and 9%. Usually, only when individuals exceed a 9% annual VTE risk is long-term anticoagulation a common consideration. Antithrombin deficiency, a strong or moderately strong risk factor, carries an annual risk of VTE of only 0.8–1.5%; as such, asymptomatic individuals with thrombophilia do not warrant long-term anticoagulation.|$|E
5|$|During the war, both {{ships were}} mainly {{inactive}} due to Argentine neutrality. Rivadavia undertook a last diplomatic cruise to Trinidad, Venezuela, and Colombia in 1946, but both ships were <b>immobile</b> by 1948. Moreno was stricken from the naval register on 1 October 1956 and {{was brought to}} Japan in 1957 for scrapping in a then-world-record 96-day tow. Rivadavia was stricken on 1 February 1957 and scrapped in Italy beginning in 1959. The money gained from selling the two dreadnoughts along with an older armored cruiser, , was used to buy an aircraft carrier from the United Kingdom, Independencia (ex-Warrior).|$|E
5|$|Dvenadsat Apostolov was {{transferred}} to the Sevastopol Port Authority on 1 April 1911, stricken from the Navy List and disarmed on 15 April. She became a depot ship for submarines in 1912. Renamed as Blokshiv (hulk) No. 8 on 4 September 1914, she was used on various harbour duties. <b>Immobile,</b> she was captured by the Germans in Sevastopol in May 1918 and handed over to the Allies in December 1918. She was captured by both sides during the Russian Civil War, but was abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea. Her machinery was removed in 1921. She was used as a stand-in for the Potemkin during the filming of The Battleship Potemkin, while reportedly serving as a mine storage hulk, before she was sold for scrap on 28 January 1931.|$|E
5|$|Evstafi and Ioann Zlatoust {{were reduced}} to reserve in March 1918 in Sevastopol. <b>Immobile,</b> they were {{captured}} by the Germans there in May and {{handed over to the}} Allies the following December. The British wrecked their engines between 22–24 April 1919 when they left the Crimea in order to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians. Later, they were captured by both sides during the Russian Civil War, but were abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920. The ships were then scrapped in 1922–23, although they were not stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925.|$|E
5|$|Evstafi and Ioann Zlatoust {{were reduced}} to reserve in March 1918 in Sevastopol. <b>Immobile,</b> they were {{captured}} there by the Germans in May 1918 and Evstafi was subsequently used by them as an accommodation hulk. Both ships were {{handed over to the}} Allies the following December. The British wrecked both ships' engines on 22–24 April 1919 when they left the Crimea to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians. They were captured by both sides during the Russian Civil War, but were abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920. Evstafi was renamed Revoliutsiia (Revolution) on 6 July 1921. The ships were scrapped in 1922–23, although they were not removed from the Navy List until 21 November 1925.|$|E

5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs {{have been caught}} on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize <b>immobile</b> prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E
5|$|In arid climates, {{the main}} source of erosion is wind. The general wind {{circulation}} moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers downwind of their point of origin, which is known as deflation. Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other <b>immobile</b> organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for {{a large percentage of the}} biomass of land plants.|$|E
5|$|Lesser yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, {{or in the}} hollow of a tree. Eggs are cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots, particularly around the larger end. Two eggs are generally laid. The chicks are altricial—they are blind, naked and relatively <b>immobile</b> upon hatching. The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|E
5|$|Offshore Bataan, eight {{fishermen}} {{were initially}} rendered missing after a boat capsized. In Olongapo City, seven people were buried {{due to a}} landslide. In the downtown Santa Cruz area, all forms of transportation except for the railroad were <b>immobile.</b> The Makati area sustained waist-deep flooding. Due to both Irma and Hal, 14communities in Tarlac were flooded, leaving 375,000people displaced, 116,963of whom were evacuated to 46 evacuation centers. Seven bridges were also damaged. Overall, 511,067people, or 94,661families were directly affected by the typhoon. A total of 253homes were destroyed, with 1,854others partially damaged. Nationwide, 65people were killed due to the typhoon. The storm inflicted $13.7million in damage to infrastructure and $2.3million in damage to agriculture, totaling to approximately $16million.|$|E
