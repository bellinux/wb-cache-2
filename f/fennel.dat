40|$|Nitrate and nitrite are toxicants {{that have}} become {{increasingly}} significant environmental chemicals. Increase in environmental distribution of nitrogenous compounds, especially in surface and ground water, {{has been attributed to}} the intensive use of nitrate as agricultural fertilizers and to increasing amounts of nitrogenous wastes produced by municipalities, industries, and feedlots. The {{purpose of this study is}} to illustrate a fatal nitrate toxicosis in cattle associated with the consumption of <b>fennels</b> (Foeniculum vulgare). Fifteen cows from the same farm suddenly developed weakness, muscular tremors, respiratory distress, and finally convulsions. The affected animals died within 24 to 48 h from the onset of the clinical signs. Five cows underwent a complete post-mortem examination. In all examined animals, gross lesions included presence of dark unclotted blood around the nostrils and the anal region, moderate inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa, and brown discoloration of the skeletal muscles and kidneys. The histological examination showed tubular degeneration and congestion of glomerular vessels in the kidney. Toxicological analysis detected nitrates at 4 672. 2 ppm in the <b>fennels</b> used to feed the animals. The source of exposure to nitrates was identified in the <b>fennels.</b> The <b>fennels</b> were grown in a polluted area of the Campania region in southern Italy and distributed in a public market for human consumption. The waste from the sale of the <b>fennels</b> was fed to the cows. The accumulation of nitrates in some vegetables poses a risk not only for animal health but also for human and environmental safety...|$|R

5|$|Benjamin Grayson {{constructed}} Grayson's Tavern in Danville {{sometime around}} 1785. The asymmetrical, ell-shaped building faces south onto Walnut Street with a front entrance {{on the south}} and a side entrance on the west, which opens onto Constitution Square. The Mary Akin Memorial Herb Garden, located behind Grayson's Tavern, features a variety of herbs that were commonly cultivated in the area during the late 18th and early 19th century, including chives, <b>fennel,</b> honeysuckle, lavender, rosemary, sage, and thyme. The garden is maintained by the Garden Club of Danville and named for one of its long-time members.|$|E
5|$|Elements of {{the dessert}} course are served on dry ice, such as small round white {{chocolate}} balls of ice cream, {{which has been}} taken from the menu at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. Other desserts on the menu include a hollow sphere of chocolate, which a hot chocolate sauce is poured over to dissolve the sphere in order to unveil the ball of milk ice cream within, and a <b>fennel</b> crème brûlée served with Alphonso mango. The wine list starts from around £25, and moves up to a 1961 magnum of Pétrus at £39,000.|$|E
60|$|While these cheerful {{events were}} in course of {{enactment}} within <b>Fennel's</b> pastoral dwelling, an incident having considerable {{bearing on the}} party had occurred in the gloomy night without. Mrs. <b>Fennel's</b> concern about the growing fierceness of the dance corresponded in point {{of time with the}} ascent of a human figure to the solitary hill of Higher Crowstairs {{from the direction of the}} distant town.

5|$|The lake is {{surrounded}} with fringing reedbeds, carr woodland and grassland, which are managed by Bristol Water. The water conditions are eutrophic with run off from local fields and streams. Open-water plant communities are rather sparse, largely comprising <b>fennel</b> pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus), lesser pondweed (Potamogeton pusillus), opposite-leaved pondweed (Groenlandia densa) and water-crowfoot (Ranunculus spp.). On neutral soils around the reservoir, pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), burnet-saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga) and devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) occur, and on calcareous soils fairy flax (Linum catharticum), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule) and salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor subspecies minor) are found.|$|E
5|$|When {{they were}} first cultivated, carrots were grown for their {{aromatic}} leaves and seeds rather than their roots. Carrot seeds {{have been found in}} Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC. Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, <b>fennel,</b> anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century; the Romans ate a root vegetable called pastinaca, which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.|$|E
5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and <b>fennel.</b> Many of these plants grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a large}} wood (<b>Fennels</b> Wood), {{which runs}} {{alongside}} {{a large part of}} Flackwell Heath and consists mainly of Beech trees. It also has an area where people ride their bicycles, this is locally known as 'The Dells'. The wood hit the news in September 2006, as it was briefly closed off, due to a suspicious find relating to the transatlantic aircraft terrorist plot.|$|R

Later that year with cellist André Navarra he set down recordings of Bloch's Schelomo and Tchaikovsky's Variations on a Rococo Theme Op.30 for Parlophone. A recording of The Beggar's Opera featured Dennis Noble, Carmen Prietto, Martha Lipton, Roderick Jones, Marjorie Westbury, John Cameron and William McAlpine.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture {{and fishing}} were the city’s main {{economic}} sources {{until the early}} 20th century. Rimini boasts an important tradition in wine production (Sangiovese, Trebbiano, Rebola, Pagadebit, Albana wines) and an historic {{extra virgin olive oil}} production. The most common crops of the area, besides vineyards and olive groves, are orchards (peaches, nectarines, apricots, persimmons, apples, pears, cherries, kiwifruits and plums), vegetables and legumes (lettuce, zucchini, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, green beans, cauliflowers, <b>fennels,</b> strawberries), seminatives (wheat, barley, grain sorghum, corn, oat), sunflowers and canola. Fishing industry can count on a fleet of about 100 fishing boats, the most consistent of Rimini’s fishing department, which includes the coast between Cattolica and Cesenatico.|$|R
5|$|Herring, a fish {{which takes}} well to salting, became a well {{established}} catch; the busiest harbour was Aberystwyth, which reportedly took up to 1,000 barrels of herring {{in a single}} night in 1724. Many other villages also fished for herring, generally between late August and December. Herring, along with mackerel, trout, salmon and sea trout, were the main fishes found in Welsh cuisine. Salmon was abundant and therefore a staple for the poor. Trout, which would dry out quickly when cooked, would be wrapped in leek leaves for cooking, or covered in bacon or oatmeal. Many fish would be served with <b>fennel,</b> which grew wild in abundance in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Invasive weeds are {{prevalent}} in, {{and damaging}} to, the park. Species common in other formerly occupied {{parts of the}} foothills are also common in the park. Of significant concern, largely for their impact on native flora, are bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera), artichoke thistle (Cynara cardunculus), varieties of broom, Spanish heath (Erica lusitanica), <b>fennel</b> (Foeniculum vulgare), olives, blackberries, common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and dog rose (Rosa canina). In July 2001, Phytophthora cinnamomi, a significant cause of plant disease in the Adelaide Hills, {{was found in the}} park. Mechanical countermeasures, in the form of boot scrubbing stations, have been introduced to control its spread.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{salad is}} {{typically}} made with finely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Variations include {{the addition of}} diced red or green bell peppers, grated carrot, finely shredded cabbage or lettuce, sliced radish, <b>fennel,</b> spring onions and chives, chopped parsley, or other herbs and spices such as mint, za'atar and sumac. Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} project, ‘ClimbAR’ - a rock {{climbing}} documentary - is {{to tell the story}} of a fringe sport/outdoor activity in the state of Arkansas. The history of the sport has been passed down primarily by word of mouth and contained within a small, tight knit group of Arkansas rock climbers since its humble beginnings in the 1980 s. Though many of the original climbers in the state have since moved on, a new generation of adventurers have taken the reins. This film focuses on the newest generation of Arkansas rock climbers. Like many climbers in the state, this story uses Cole <b>Fennel’s</b> guidebooks, “Rock Climbing Arkansas” Vol. I 2 ̆ 6 II, to more accurately portray the wide variety of rock climbing locations in the Ozarks...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Processing and {{selection}} {{of fruits and}} vegetables generate high amounts of wastes that represent an economical and environmental issue for the agroindustry sector. Nevertheless, according to so called “biorefinery” approach, this waste biomass can be exploited for the recovery of value added molecules. In this paper the residues of industrial processing of <b>fennels,</b> carrots, lemons and tomatoes were used as sources of polyphenols. Methods: In order to optimize the recovery of polyphenols, different extraction techniques (maceration, ultrasound and microwave assisted extraction) were used in combination with different extraction media (water, ethanol, methanol and their mixtures). The polyphenols’ fractions were tested for their chemical and biological properties. Results: All the obtained phenol fractions showed high antioxidant power and scavenging ability towards stable radical species and hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the isolated polyphenol mixtures (containing remarkable compounds like quercetin, kaempferol, naringin, hesperetin) also displayed potential activities as anti-cancer, anti-microbial and acetylcholinesterase inhibiting agents. Conclusions: Overall the obtained results showed that the residual matter produced by the industrial processing {{of fruits and vegetables}} contain high amounts of polyphenols. These polyphenolic fractions still retain their biological and antioxidant properties and therefore could be further exploited for other industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sp. and Lactobacillus pentosus were {{variously}} identified from blackberries, prunes, kiwifruits, papaya and <b>fennels</b> by partial 16 S rRNA gene sequence. Representative isolates {{from each}} plant species were screened {{based on the}} kinetics of growth on fruit juices. A protocol for processing and storage of red and greensmoothies (RS and GS) was set up, which included fermentation by selected lacticacid bacteria starters and exo-polysaccharide producing strains. Starters grew and remained viable at ca. 9. 0 log cfu g− 1 during 30 days of storage at 4 °C. No contaminating Enterobacteriaceae and yeast were found throughout storage. Values of soluble solids, total titratable acidity and viscosity distinguished started RS and GS compared to spontaneously (unstarted) fermented smoothies. Color difference dE∗ab and browning index were positively affected by lacticacidfermentation. Consumption of carbohydrates by lacticacid bacteria was limited {{as well as it}} was the lacticfermentation. Consumption of malic acid was evident throughout storage. Polyphenolic compounds and, especially, ascorbic acid were better preserved in started RS and GS compared to unstarted samples. This reflected on the free radical scavenging activity. A statistical correlation was only found between the level of ascorbic acid and free radical scavenging activity. As shown by a ﬁrst-order equation, the rate of degradation of ascorbic acid through storage were found to be higher in the unstarted compared to started RS and GS. Fermentation by lacticacid bacteria clearly improved the sensory attributes of RS and GS...|$|R
5|$|Keith ends his {{relationship}} with Wallace's mother Alicia <b>Fennel</b> (Erica Gimpel) to give Lianne a second chance. Because Celeste refused to pay the $50,000 reward for finding Duncan, Keith sues the Kanes, who agree to pay if Veronica signs away any future claim to their estate. Once Veronica signs, Keith shows her the DNA test that proves he is her father, meaning Veronica never had a claim of the estate. Logan is arrested, and once released he angrily breaks up with Veronica for providing the evidence against him. Logan then explains that when he saw Lilly after returning from Mexico, he knew their relationship was over and wrote a letter which he left in her car.|$|E
5|$|Since European Settlement {{the native}} plant {{life has been}} {{considerably}} affected, with the native manna gum and blue gum woodlands being largely cleared for agricultural uses. The large amount of non-native vegetation in the gully is predominantly {{the result of the}} early agriculture, although some species were introduced by accident. Introduced species include olive trees, hawthorn, <b>fennel</b> and blackberry. With the reduction of native flora, exotic fauna have flourished around the Waterfall Gully region. These include rabbits, blackbirds and starlings. However, not all of the native wildlife has been lost—bats (in particular, Gould's wattled bat), {{can be found in the}} area, as can superb fairy-wrens and Adelaide rosellas, and a large number of unique Australian animals such as kangaroos, koalas and possums can be spotted on some of the walking trails.|$|E
5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, <b>fennel,</b> marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E
60|$|We {{went down}} to the little street--but saw more baskets {{emerging}} from a broad flight of stone stairs, enclosed. So up we went-and found ourselves in the vegetable market. Here the q-b was happier still. Peasant women, sometimes barefoot, sat in their tight little bodices and voluminous, coloured skirts behind the piles of vegetables, and never have I seen a lovelier show. The intense deep green of spinach seemed to predominate, and out of that came the monuments of curd-white and black-purple cauliflowers: but marvellous cauliflowers, like a flower-show, the purple ones intense as great bunches of violets. From this green, white, and purple massing struck out the vivid rose-scarlet and blue crimson of radishes, large radishes like little turnips, in piles. Then the long, slim, grey-purple buds of artichokes, and dangling clusters of dates, and piles of sugar-dusty white figs and sombre-looking black figs, and bright burnt figs: basketfuls and basketfuls of figs. A few baskets of almonds, and many huge walnuts. Basket-pans of native raisins. Scarlet peppers like trumpets: magnificent <b>fennels,</b> so white and big and succulent: baskets of new potatoes: scaly kohlrabi: wild asparagus in bunches, yellow-budding sparacelli: big, clean-fleshed carrots: feathery salads with white hearts: long, brown-purple onions and then, of course pyramids of big oranges, pyramids of pale apples, and baskets of brilliant shiny mandarini, the little tangerine orange with their green-black leaves. The green and vivid-coloured world of fruit-gleams I have never seen in such splendour as under the market roof at Cagliari: so raw and gorgeous. And all quite cheap, the one remaining cheapness, except potatoes. Potatoes of any sort are 1.40 or 1.50 the kilo.|$|R
5|$|Veronica {{connects the}} five {{people who were}} framed to an {{incident}} where a student was publicly harassed in gym class. Keith is still dating Alicia <b>Fennel</b> (Erica Gimpel). Veronica and Wallace spend the night investigating students, and Veronica eventually deduces that Wallace ingested {{a small amount of}} an illegal substance, most likely in a gift basket earlier that year. In a flashback, Veronica and Logan make out in the car until the PCH bikers shoot out the car's windows. Veronica asks Keith for help in finding out the names of a company's shareholders. Veronica believes that one of the lab assistants was paid off to forge the results. The previous summer, Logan was involved with an arson crime. Logan sunbathes with Dick (Ryan Hansen) and Beaver (Kyle Gallner) poolside, and they ogle at the brothers's stepmother, Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter). Veronica sets up the parents and has Principal Clemmons listen in, and it is revealed that Duncan is now dating Veronica. In a flashback, Veronica breaks up with Logan. When Logan starts to get angry, Keith barges in and makes him leave. Logan is carrying on a relationship with Kendall.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} men present at the battle is disputed. A major factor in this {{is the fact that}} no primary sources give the {{number of men}} present at the battle, which leaves modern historians to {{estimate}} the number of men. Historian Leo de Hartog gives the size of the Rus' army as 30,000, while Richard Gabriel and Hector Hugh Munro claim that the size of the Rus' army was 80,000.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, 120* Munro, The Rise of the Russian Empire, p. 81. de Hartog also estimates the size of the Mongol army as 20,000, while Gabriel estimates that it was around 23,000 men.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, p. 118. However, historian John Fennell, an expert on Kievan Rus and early Russian history, and one well-versed in the primary sources, calls many of these figures into doubt, saying the numbers given in the Russian sources (there are no Mongol or Polovtsian sources, at least none that have survived, and other sources from other cultures, if they exist, are rather dubious) are formulaic or exaggerated and the chronicles contradict themselves. The information given in the Novgorod First Chronicle and the Primary Chronicle would imply a total of 11,000 soldiers for the Rus' forces, but <b>Fennel</b> considers even these numbers to be exaggerations. While Russian historians in the Soviet era have traditionally given estimates of around 80,000-100,000, modern Russian historians have taken a revisionist stance with a consensus settling on drastically lower numbers, with the Mongols having a numerical advantage. Russian historian D.G. Khrustalev estimated in 2013 that the Rus' army consisted of 10,000 soldiers (including mercenaries), while the Cumans brought 5,000 cavalry, for a total of 15,000.Khrustalev, p. 416 Carl Sverdrup estimates the army at 8,000, and says 30,000 and 80,000 are enormous exaggerations. The Mongols evidently believed it was a considerable force, given the extreme lengths the Mongols went to dislocate its formations.|$|E
