5|$|Nathan Lovejoy's 1996 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} morphology, {{found that the}} yellow {{stingray}} is the most basal member of a clade that also contains Pacific Urobatis species and the genus Urotrygon of Central and South America.

5|$|During the 20th century both choral and organ musical {{components}} {{developed to}} a high standard and were integral to the liturgy at St James'. In addition, music was offered to the wider community {{in the form of}} recitals, often in ways that <b>elucidate</b> <b>the</b> liturgy and take advantage of church acoustics and sacred settings. Weekday recitals, such as the organ recitals given in 1936 of music by Bach, continued in addition to the music played on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Shivayogi's other {{writings}} {{include a}} scientific encyclopaedia called Vivekachintamani, so well regarded {{that it was}} translated into Marathi language in 1604 and Sanskrit language in 1652 {{and again in the}} 18th century. The writing categorises 1,500 topics based on subject and covers a wide array such as poetics, dance and drama, musicology and erotics. His translation of the Shiva Yoga Pradipika from Sanskrit was done to <b>elucidate</b> <b>the</b> Shaiva philosophy and benefit those ignorant of the original language.|$|E
5|$|The Amanita Genome Project {{was begun}} in Jonathan Walton's lab at Michigan State University in 2004 {{as part of}} their ongoing studies of Amanita bisporigera. The purpose of the project is to {{determine}} the genes and genetic controls associated with the formation of mycorrhizae, and to <b>elucidate</b> <b>the</b> biochemical mechanisms of toxin production. The genome of A.bisporigera has been sequenced using a combination of automated Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing, and the genome sequence information is publicly searchable. The sequence data enabled the researchers to identify the genes responsible for amatoxin and phallotoxin biosynthesis, AMA1 and PHA1. The cyclic peptides are synthesized on ribosomes, and require proline-specific peptidases from the prolyl oligopeptidase family for processing.|$|E

The Qur'an is the holy scripture of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered word of God. The Sunnah consists of the alleged religious actions and quotations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, narrated through his Companions and the Imams (per the beliefs of the Sunni and Shi'ite schools respectively).|$|E
5|$|Later, in 1993, Gerard 't Hooft wrote a {{speculative}} {{paper on}} quantum gravity {{in which he}} revisited Hawking's work on black hole thermodynamics, concluding that {{the total number of}} degrees of freedom in a region of spacetime surrounding a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the horizon. This idea was promoted by Leonard Susskind and is now known as the holographic principle. The holographic principle and its realization in string theory through the AdS/CFT correspondence have helped <b>elucidate</b> <b>the</b> mysteries of black holes suggested by Hawking's work and are believed to provide a resolution of the black hole information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that black holes do not violate quantum mechanics, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which they might preserve information.|$|E
