40|$|Abstract. Fluorination of the zeolite {{has been}} known as a useful method to modify its acidity and surface performance. In this paper, a set of zeolite Hβ were {{impregnated}} with aqueous solution of NH 4 F. The effects of NH 4 F impregnation on the structure and acidity of Hβ was investigated by XRD, BET measurements, NH 3 -TPD, and Py-IR. The change of specific surface area and pore volume of the fluorinated samples with NH 4 F can be attributed the reaction of NH 4 F with non-framework and framework aluminum. The fluorination increases the strength and changes {{the distribution of the}} acid sites; the fluorination also leads to the decrease of the total acid sites and the Brönsted acid sites due to the <b>dealuminization</b> of the samples and the substitution of the OH by fluorine atoms...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} contents (0. 4 %, 0. 7 %, and 1. 0 %, mass fraction) of Mn or Ti additions on the micro structure, shape memory effect and the corrosion behaviour of Cu–Al–Ni shape memory alloys were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, {{differential scanning calorimetry}} and electrochemical and immersion tests in NaCl solution. It was observed that the microstructure, shape memory effect and corrosion characteristics are highly sensitive to the composition variations. It {{was found that the}} highest strain recovery was with 0. 7 % addition of Mn or Ti. This may be attributed to the presence of precipitation with a high volume fraction and the grain refinement. The electrochemical test showed that the formation of oxide layers in both Cu–Al–Ni–Mn and Cu–Al–Ni–Ti shape memory alloys (SMAs) provided good passivation which enhanced the corrosion resistance of the alloys. Immersion test showed that in Cu–Al–Ni–Mn– SMAs, pitting corrosion occurred through feebleness in the oxide layer. A corrosion product adjacent to the pits was rich in Al/Mn oxide and depleted in Cu while inside of the pit it was rich in Cu. In Cu–Al–Ni–Ti– SMAs, localized corrosion occurred {{on the surface of the}} specimens and <b>dealuminization</b> attack was also observed in the matrix...|$|E
