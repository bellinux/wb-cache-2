5|$|The {{earliest}} {{recognition of}} pancreatic cancer has {{been attributed to}} the 18th-century Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, the historical father of modern-day anatomic pathology, who claimed to have traced several cases of cancer in the pancreas. Many 18th and 19th-century physicians were skeptical about the existence of the disease, given the similar appearance of pancreatitis. Some case reports were published in the 1820s and 1830s, and a genuine histopathologic diagnosis was eventually recorded by the American clinician Jacob Mendes Da Costa, who also doubted the reliability of Morgagni's interpretations. By the start of the 20th century, cancer of the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> had become a well-established diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{pancreas}} receives {{blood from}} branches {{of both the}} coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery. The splenic artery runs along the top margin of the pancreas, and supplies the neck, body and {{tail of the pancreas}} through its pancreatic branches, the largest of which is called the greater pancreatic artery. The superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries run along the anterior and posterior surfaces of the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> at its border with the duodenum. These supply the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas.</b>|$|E

40|$|Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are {{presented}} as rare malignant neoplasms. In unusual cases, those neoplasms may arise in solid organs containing neuroendocrine cells, such as <b>the</b> <b>pancreas.</b> Herein <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> a 28 -year-old patient that underwent gastroduodenopancreatectomy after <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> a huge mass (PNET) located in both <b>head</b> and body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> is reported.

30|$|A 61 -year-old {{woman was}} {{referred}} to our hospital with epigastralgia. Abdominal ultrasonographic examination showed 7 -cm-sized mass in <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas.</b> Physical examination was unremarkable, and any symptoms were not presented except for mild epigastric tenderness. She had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 32  years until quitting smoking 8  years before, but not {{had a history of}} tuberous sclerosis complexes, malignancy, habitual alcohol consumption, or diabetes mellitus.|$|R
40|$|Small-cell lung {{carcinoma}} {{represents a}} group of highly malignant tumors characterized by early and widespread metastais even at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> diagnosis. However, <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> is a relatively infrequent site of metastasis by this neoplasm. A 57 -year-old patient was admitted with an intense cough and complaints of abdominal discomfort. A chest X-Ray showed no evidence of lung mass but did show signs of lymphadenopathy. In addition, there was little evidence for malignancy based on a transbronchial needle aspiration. In contrast, there was a mass in <b>the</b> <b>head</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas.</b> We diagnosed a case of small-cell lung carcinoma metastasis in <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> by using an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy. This case demonstrates that endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy is an important tool in <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> metastatic pancreatic neoplasms...|$|R
500|$|Regardless of a tumor's location, {{the most}} common symptom is unexplained weight loss, which may be considerable. A large {{minority}} (between 35% and 47%) of people diagnosed with the disease will have had nausea, vomiting or a feeling of weakness. [...] Tumors in the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> typically also cause jaundice, pain, loss of appetite, dark urine, and light-colored stools. Tumors {{in the body and}} tail typically also cause pain.|$|E
500|$|The exocrine {{group is}} {{dominated}} by pancreatic adenocarcinoma (variations of this name may add [...] "invasive" [...] and [...] "ductal"), which {{is by far the}} most common type, representing about 85% of all pancreatic cancers. Nearly all these start in the ducts of the pancreas, as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This is despite the fact that the tissue from which it arises – the pancreatic ductal epithelium – represents less than 10% of the pancreas by cell volume, because it constitutes only the ducts (an extensive but capillary-like duct-system fanning out) within the pancreas. [...] This cancer originates in the ducts that carry secretions (such as enzymes and bicarbonate) away from the pancreas. About 60–70% of adenocarcinomas occur in the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas.</b>|$|E
500|$|For cancers {{involving}} the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas,</b> the Whipple procedure {{is the most}} commonly attempted curative surgical treatment. This is a major operation which involves removing the pancreatic head and {{the curve of the}} duodenum together ("pancreato-duodenectomy"), making a bypass for food from the stomach to the jejunum ("gastro-jejunostomy") and attaching a loop of jejunum to the cystic duct to drain bile ("cholecysto-jejunostomy"). It can be performed only if the person is likely to survive major surgery and if the cancer is localized without invading local structures or metastasizing. It can, therefore, be performed only in a minority of cases. [...] Cancers of the tail of the pancreas can be resected using a procedure known as a distal pancreatectomy, which often also entails removal of the spleen. Nowadays, this can often be done using minimally invasive surgery.|$|E

40|$|A {{testicular}} varicocele is {{an abnormal}} dilation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pampiniform plexus <b>of</b> veins within <b>the</b> spermatic cord. Due to the asymmetrical drainage pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{right and left}} testicular veins, <b>the</b> vast majority <b>of</b> varicoceles are found on the left side. Isolated right testicular varicoceles occur rarely and should raise clinical suspicion for underlying intra-abdominal pathology. During <b>the</b> dissection <b>of</b> a 67 -year-old male cadaver a unilateral varicocele was discovered in the right spermatic cord. Upon dissection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abdomen, a tumor was found in <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas.</b> <b>The</b> section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferior vena cava where the right testicular vein inserted laid directly posterior to the tumor and was markedly dilated. We hypothesize that this pancreatic tumor impeded venous return into the inferior vena cava from the right testicular vein and not the left renal vein (where the left testicular vein drains) resulting in a unilateral right varicocele (URV). To our knowledge, the relationship between URV and pancreatic cancer has not been previously described in the literature. Our findings suggest URV could be a clinical warning sign <b>of</b> cancer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and/or body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> and may {{be a source of}} discomfort to address in patients with pancreatic cancer in order to improve quality of life...|$|R
40|$|Numerous NADPH-diaphorase {{positive}} neurons were localised in the pancreatic ganglia cultured from newborn guinea pigs. Most {{of these}} ganglia {{were found in}} <b>the</b> <b>head</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas.</b> A majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labelled neurons occurred in groups, although solitary neurons were also present. NADPH-diaphorase labelling was localised mainly in the cell cytoplasm and its processes, but not within the nucleus. There were more nitric oxide synthase (NOS) -immunoreactive neurons in culture as compared with those positive for NADPH-diaphorase. NADPH-diaphorase activity has been colocalised with NOS and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in a subset of neurons in culture. Colocalisation of NADPH-diaphorase with NOS and VIP in cultured neurons was not restricted to the cell body {{but also to the}} proximal and distal processes. Some of these labelled processes made contacts with exocrine acinar and endocrine cells. It is concluded that neuronal nitric oxide (NO) may be influencing <b>the</b> secretory roles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas,</b> thereby participating in homeostasis...|$|R
50|$|The {{basic concept}} behind the pancreaticoduodenectomy {{is that the}} <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas</b> and the {{duodenum}} share the same arterial blood supply (the gastroduodenal artery). These arteries run through the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pancreas,</b> so that both organs must be removed if the single blood supply is severed.

40|$|Alterations in genes {{involved}} in cell cycle regulation {{are common in}} many tumor types. In pancreatic adenocarcinomas, inactivating mutations in the CDKN 2 gene, encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 16, are frequently observed.

In melanoma-prone kindreds with CDKN 2 wild-type status, a mutation in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> targets <b>of</b> p 16, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK 4) was reported, which abolishes p 16 inhibition.
