The tests determined the effect of primary jet heating and ejector duct width on the flow field at a <b>fixed</b> <b>jet</b> exit Mach number of 0. 3. For comparison the rectangular jet without {{the presence of the}} ejector shroud was also studied. Measurements of the mean velocity field, total temperature field, and ejector shroud surface pressure distribution, along with schlieren flow visualization, were made.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{study the effects of}} jet {{velocity}} and the jet insertion depth on the characteristics of the fluidized region obtained when vertical and inclined water jets were submerged below the surface of saturated sand. Experiments were conducted using sand of mean particle size 507 mum. Water was injected into the sand through a tube of semicircular cross-section (internal diameter 0. 55 cm) located at the wall of the tank, forming a half jet. At sufficiently high flowrate a U-shaped fluidized region formed around the jet tube. The fluidized zone was characterized by measuring scour depth, diameter of the fluidized region at the jet insertion depth and diameter of the fluidized region at half the jet insertion depth. For a <b>fixed</b> <b>jet</b> insertion depth, increasing the jet velocity increased the scour depth, the diameter of the fluidized region at the jet insertion depth, and the diameter at half the jet insertion depth. For a <b>fixed</b> <b>jet</b> velocity, the scour depth was independent of the insertion depth, however the two diameters of the fluidized region decreased with increasing jet insertion depth. The profiles obtained for inclined jets were more asymmetric than those for vertical jets. The effectiveness of the 'up-flow washing' technique for the removal of a water-soluble contaminant (CuSO 4) from a saturated bed of sand was investigated for a vertical jet at jet velocities of 213 cm/s and 320 cm/s and jet insertion depths of 5. 5 cm and 7. 5 cm. Up-flow washing removed the contaminant from the sand bed. The cleaned region extended well beyond the boundary of the fluidized region as jet liquid leaked from the fluidized region and percolated through the fixed bed region. An approximate model for the leakage suggested that 10 [...] 20 % of the jet liquid leaked from the fluidized region to the fixed bed region...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} {{particle}} multiplicity in a jet or sub-jet as derived from an energy-multiplicity 2 -particle correlation. This definition avoids {{the notion of}} a globally <b>fixed</b> <b>jet</b> axis and allows for the study of smaller jet cone openings in a more stable way. The results are sensitive to the mean color current 〈C〉A 0 in the jet from primary parton A 0 which takes into account intermediate partonic processes in the sub-jet production where CF < 〈C〉A 0 < Nc at high energies. We generalize previous calculations in Leading Logarithmic Approximation (LLA). The size of the effects related to this jet axis definition are computed for multiplicities in sub-jets with different opening angles and energies by including contributions from the Modified LLA (MLLA) and Next-to-MLLA to the leading order QCD results...|$|E
40|$|The {{spinning}} of slender viscous jets can {{be described}} asymptotically by one-dimensional models that consist of systems of partial and ordinary differential equations. Whereas the well-established string models possess only solutions for certain choices of parameters and set-ups, the more sophisticated rod model that {{can be considered as}} ϵ-regularized string is generally applicable. But containing the slenderness ratio ϵ explicitely in the equations complicates the numerical treatment. In this paper we present the first instationary simulations of a rod in a rotational spinning process for arbitrary parameter ranges with free and <b>fixed</b> <b>jet</b> end, for which the hitherto investigations longed. So we close an existing gap in literature. The numerics is based on a finite volume approach with mixed central, up- and down-winded differences, the time integration is performed by stiff accurate Radau methods...|$|E

It was previously established that trip time reaches a minimum as specific impulse is varied for payload transfers from low earth orbit to synchronous orbit and return via laser-driven rocket propulsion, the computations being based on the perigee-propulsion laser drive described by Minovitch (1972). The present study shows that such minimum occur for all missions and that optimum specific impulse is primarily determined by the mission difficulty. More generally, this optimum specific impulse maximizes payload kinetic energy achievable with a <b>fixed</b> <b>jet</b> power and propulsion time.

40|$|In {{this study}} we show how {{accurate}} jet noise predictions can be achieved within Gold-stein’s generalized acoustic analogy formulation for heated and un-heated supersonic jets using a previously developed asymptotic theory for the adjoint vector Green’s function.

We determine all relevant mean ﬂow and turbulence quantities using Large Eddy Simulations of two axi-symmetric round jets at <b>ﬁxed</b> <b>jet</b> Mach number and diﬀerent nozzle temperature ratios. Certain empirical co-eﬃcients that enter the turbulence length scales formula are tuned for good agreement with the far-ﬁeld noise data.

40|$|Precise {{predictions}} for Higgs production via vector-boson fusion {{play an important}} role when testing the properties of the Higgs boson and probing new-physics effects. While the inclusive cross section changes little when including NNLO and N 3 LO QCD corrections, a differential NNLO calculation with typical VBF cuts shows large corrections of up to 10 % in distributions. In this article, we investigate the dependence of the differential NNLO QCD calculation on the jet definition. Starting from the known results at a <b>fixed</b> <b>jet</b> clustering choice, we use the electroweak H+ 3 jets production cross section at NLO precision to derive NNLO results for H+ 2 jets production for other jet definitions. We find that larger clustering radii significantly reduce the impact of NNLO corrections. The sizable NNLO corrections for distributions are largely caused by the broader energy flow inside jets at NNLO and are to be expected generally for processes with jets at LO.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{computational model}} {{was developed to}} investigate the interaction of two synthetic jets with cross flow in micro-channel. An experimental validation {{of the formation of}} synthetic jet was presented at the same scale as those used in this numerical work. Good agreement was obtained between the experimental results and the numerical data. The numerical approach was then used to perform studies with the two jets being in-phase and 180 °out-of-phase at various operating frequencies and diaphragm amplitudes with <b>fixed</b> <b>jet</b> Reynolds number. The addition of one synthetic jet was shown to achieve greater mixing of flow in the micro-channel than those with single synthetic jet. Velocity field obtained from 180 °out-of-phase configurations show a distinct pattern of vortex formation which results in continuous mixing of the flow in the channel throughout the cycle. When the synthetic jet actuators were driven at different membrane frequencies and amplitudes, the main difference was the variation of the size and number of the vortices downstream and upstream of the office. The structure of the flow in the micro-channel is strongly dependent on the period of the oscillation of the membrane of the synthetic jet actuators. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{study of}} the local and average heat {{transfer}} characteristics of a single round jet impinging on the concave surfaces was conducted in this work to gain in-depth knowledge of the curvature effects. The experiments were conducted by employing a piccolo tube with one single jet hole {{over a wide range}} of parameters: jet Reynolds number from 27, 000 to 130, 000, relative nozzle to surface distance from 3. 3 to 30, and relative surface curvature from 0. 005 to 0. 030. Experimental results indicate that the surface curvature has opposite effects on heat transfer characteristics. On one hand, an increase of relative nozzle to surface distance (increasing jet diameter in fact) enhances the average heat transfer around the surface for the same curved surface. On the other hand, the average Nusselt number decreases as relative nozzle to surface distance increases for a <b>fixed</b> <b>jet</b> diameter. Finally, experimental data-based correlations of the average Nusselt number over the curved surface were obtained with consideration of surface curvature effect.
