5|$|The {{second season}} was widely {{received}} as {{inferior to the}} first, but it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> {{that this may be}} slightly unfair.|$|E
50|$|Nematode parasites in {{the genus}} Acuaria <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted.</b> Adult birds <b>have</b> few predators {{although}} bats (Megaderma lyra) and wintering Asio flammeus <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> to prey on them.|$|R

5|$|While Limp Bizkit's {{popularity}} has {{declined in the}} USA since the mid-2000s, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> in the media that the band still remains highly popular in Russia.|$|E
5|$|In a {{life-cycle}} analysis it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted,</b> that if electricity {{produced by}} photovoltaic panels {{were used to}} manufacture the modules instead of electricity from burning coal, cadmium emissions from coal power usage in the manufacturing process could be entirely eliminated.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> that N. rajah {{produces}} a very extensive root system (for a Nepenthes) and, for this reason, {{it is recommended}} that a wide pot be used to allow for proper development of the root system. This also eliminates the need for frequent re-potting, which can lead to transplant shock and the eventual death of the plant.|$|E
50|$|Gour {{species of}} frogs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{specific}} epithet viviparus ("viviparous") is in error; {{they lay}} eggs {{just like all}} other Enteromius.

5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E
5|$|Modern sources citing Plummer and Bad Elk {{have tended}} {{to discuss the issue}} as defense against {{unlawful}} force; under contemporary law in most jurisdictions, a person may not use force to resist an unlawful arrest. The Plummer quote <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> to be a fabrication, not appearing in the text of the opinion.|$|E
5|$|Scotties, {{while being}} {{described}} as very loving, {{have also been}} described as stubborn.

5|$|The {{animated}} {{television series}} Rugrats <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> for its portrayal of Judaism, a dynamic rarely portrayed in American animated programming during the series' broadcast run (1991–2004). Two episodes {{of the series}} are devoted to Jewish holidays and explaining their history, and the Pickles family is shown to be part-Jewish.|$|E
5|$|The {{congestion}} {{within the}} station itself <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> by Network Rail {{and it is}} keeping the situation under review. Transport for London (TfL) has recommended that specific improvement works (new entrance doors, removal of interior wall, wider stairs to platforms and second station entrance) be carried out between 2014 and 2019.|$|E
50|$|Amoria are nocturnal and prey {{on other}} {{gastropods}} and on bivalves. They generally inhabit areas with well sorted coarse sand. Some Amoria species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> to bite {{people when they}} are handled.

5|$|The fruit bodies grows solitary, scattered, or {{clustered}} {{together on}} soil in both coniferous and deciduous woods, typically {{in spring and}} summer.

5|$|Townsend {{employs a}} variety of vocal {{techniques}} in his work, including screaming, growling or even falsetto. His vocal range <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> to be over 5 octaves (C2 to F7), noting that he mainly masters 2nd and 5th octaves for clean but also raucous vocals & 5th to 7th octaves for purely screamed vocals.|$|E
5|$|While {{the striped}} honeyeater aggressively defends its nest by dive-bombing people and animals who come too close, {{and has been}} {{observed}} singing from display perches, {{it is not known}} to be territorial. It often feeds near other species of honeyeater and no inter-species aggression <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted.</b>|$|E

5|$|A funk {{and dance}} album, Rhythm Killers has a dense sound that {{incorporates}} contrasting musical elements and disparate styles, including reggae, hip hop, hard rock, worldbeat, and downtown music. Arranged in two side-long gapless suites, the album's songs {{are characterized by}} electronic grooves, striking beats, improvisational rhythms, string synthesizers, and cross-rhythms produced by turntable scratches, African and Latin-influenced percussion, and percussive raps. The album <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> by music writers for its electronic rhythms, treatment of African-American music elements, and Laswell's densely layered production.|$|E
5|$|A new extant genus {{discovered}} in 2014, Dendrogramma, {{which appears to}} be a basal metazoan but of unknown taxonomic placement, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> to have similarities with the Ediacaran fauna. It has since been found to be a siphonophore, possibly even sections of a more complex species, though this in turn has raised suspicions for a similar status for at least some ediacaran organisms.|$|E
5|$|A {{pattern of}} lake cycles {{becoming}} {{longer than the}} preceding one <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted.</b> Water from the lake {{may have contributed to}} increased oxygen-18 at Sajama around 14,300 years ago, possibly triggered by evaporation. As the lake level dropped, Lake Poopó would have been disconnected first; the sill separating it from the rest of Lake Tauca is relatively shallow. Coipasa and Uyuni would have remained connected until later. Water levels in Lake Titicaca's Lake Huinaimarca were low by 14,200 BP.|$|E
