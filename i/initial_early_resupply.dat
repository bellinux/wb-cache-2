The authors retrospectively reviewed the results of 22 patients treated for 27 SFA lesions between 1981 and 1986. Mean age was 64. 5 years (fifty-five to seventy-six). Results were analyzed with respect to <b>initial,</b> <b>early</b> ( twelve months) angiographic and clinical success. Indications were claudication (22), nonhealing ulcer (3), and rest pain (2). Mean follow-up was 30. 9 months; 100 % at one year and 92 % at two years. Initial failure occurred in 9 (33 %) lesions. There were 2 early and 2 late failures for a cumulative patency rate of 90. 3 % and 78 % at one and two years, respectively. Predictors of clinical failure were: (1) initial&mdash;age, SFA occlusion, and angio-plasty rating; (2) early&mdash;age, SFA occlusion, degree of atherosclerosis, and angioplasty rating; (3) late&mdash;angioplasty rating. There were 3 complications (11 %). The authors conclude that: (1) 33 % of attempted SFA angioplasties were initially unsuccessful and that the cumulative patency rate was 78 % at two years. (2) Age is predictive of <b>initial</b> and <b>early</b> failure; SFA occlusion, of <b>initial</b> and <b>early</b> failure; degree of atherosclerosis, of early failure; and angioplasty appearance, of <b>initial,</b> <b>early,</b> and late failures.

40|$|Human dental biofilm {{communities}} comprise several species, {{which can}} interact cooperatively or competitively. Bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological {{function of the}} community. Lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. We investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known <b>initial,</b> <b>early,</b> middle, and late colonizers of enamel. Fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. Of six species tested, only the initial colonizer Actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. The initial colonizer Streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. The early colonizer Veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. The biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when Veillonella sp. was present {{as one of the}} partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. All three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i. e., A. oris, Veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer Porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. Further specificity was seen when Fusobacterium nucleatum (a middle colonizer), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and P. gingivalis did not grow with S. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of Veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. We propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with <b>initial,</b> <b>early,</b> middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel...|$|R
