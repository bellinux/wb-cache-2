5|$|In March 2001, the {{official}} website was set up, which revealed the film's original October 26, 2001 release and a redirect to the film's distributor Constantin Films. The website was fully opened in July 2001, and composed of images, plot info, character biographies and downloads. The film was {{planned to have}} an R-rated classification which is what Anderson wanted since he knew the film had to be Rated-R in order to capture the <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> games. In January 2002, the film was officially announced to contain an R rating.|$|E
5|$|Revelations {{emphasizes}} survival, evasion, {{and exploration}} over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. It was designed {{to bring back the}} content and <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series' roots, {{while at the same time}} trying to modernize the gameplay. Revelations was also the first game to support the Nintendo 3DS Circle Pad Pro outside Japan. The game was a moderate commercial success and received generally positive reviews from video game publications. Several critics praised its graphics, sound effects, and horror setting, but some criticized its inconsistent gameplay between scenarios.|$|E

5|$|Sercey retired {{with his}} frigates to Île de France, {{where he learned}} to his <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} he had missed in the Bali Strait. His squadron required extensive repairs, but the Colonial Committee on Île de France remained rebellious over attempts to abolish slavery and denied his ships men and food supplies. Eventually Sercey was forced to disband his squadron, sending four frigates back to France. Seven years after the Bali Strait Incident, in 1804, early in the Napoleonic Wars, another strong French naval squadron encountered a much larger China Fleet at the Battle of Pulo Aura. As in 1797, Nathaniel Dance, the EIC Commodore, managed to bluff the French admiral into believing there were warships among his convoy and the French retired after a brief exchange of gunfire.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Nowe {{becoming}} a fully-fledged Knight of the Seal. During his first mission, Nowe begins {{to doubt the}} ethics of the Knights' methods, as the seals require human sacrifices to remain strong. During a second mission to ensure {{the protection of the}} seal in the District of Soul Flame, Nowe encounters Manah, who kills the guardian Zhangpo and destroys the seal. Manah is sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but uses her magic to escape. After returning from the mission, Nowe is poisoned by Gismor, who reveals to have killed Nowe's adoptive father Oror. Surviving and escaping with Legna, Nowe is pursued by the Knights, including Eris, who wishes to persuade him to return. Nowe and Legna eventually meet up with Manah and join her on her quest to destroy the seals and, in her mind, free the people from the Knights' oppression. On their way to the second seal, Manah shows Nowe the true <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knights' oppression, fully winning him over. The two then fight and kill Lieutenant Hanch, destroying the seal in the District of Hallowed Water. After this, they are joined by Urick, a former Lieutenant of the Knights, to rout a group of bandits. Attacked by the Knights, they are unexpectedly saved by Caim, who is also working to destroy the seals and free his dragon Angelus from the pain of being the Goddess Seal. After taking down Lieutenant Yaha and destroying the seal in the District of Precious Light, Manah is captured by the Knights and sentenced to death. Nowe manages to rescue her and heads for the seal in the District of Shining Life, which was once guarded by Urick before he fled in fear when Caim attacked the district. Urick and Nowe face off against Caim, who mortally wounds Urick before being driven off. Urick dies content and the seal is destroyed.|$|E

25|$|He became {{involved}} in organisations pledged to remembering and recording the <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camps. In 1954 he visited Buchenwald to mark the ninth anniversary of the camp's liberation from the Nazis.

25|$|Many {{historic}} buildings in Ireland were destroyed during the war, most famously the Custom House in Dublin, which was disastrously attacked on de Valera's insistence, to the <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more militarily experienced Collins.

25|$|In Jonathan Swift (16671745), Irish {{literature}} in English found its first writer of real genius. Although {{best known for}} prose works like Gulliver's Travels and A Tale of a Tub, Swift was a poet of considerable talent. Technically close to his English contemporaries Pope and Dryden, Swift's poetry evinces the same tone of savage satire, and <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human body and its functions that characterises much of his prose. Interestingly, Swift also published translations of poems from the Irish.|$|E
25|$|Rydberg's next work, Medeltidens Magi (The Magic of the Middle Ages) 1865 is an {{exposition}} of the magical practices {{and beliefs of}} the Medieval period. According to Rydberg, the contemporary Church was still driven by {{the ideology of the}} Dark Ages, and its dualistic notions of good and evil, represented by God and the Devil, Heaven and Hell, contributed towards the <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> witch-hunts in Europe and America in the recent past. From this point forward, Rydberg was economically successful as a writer.|$|E

25|$|In 1921 Wegner {{testified at}} the trial of Soghomon Tehlirian, the Ottoman Armenian who had killed Talat Pasha in Berlin. Wegner's role was only to confirm the scope and <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armenian {{experience}} during the events that later {{became known as the}} Armenian Genocide. Talat Pasha, the former Minister of the Interior of the Ottoman Empire, had been sentenced to death in absentia for orchestrating the Armenian massacres; Tehlirian, though he killed the former Ottoman administrator in front of several eyewitnesses, was found not guilty on the grounds of temporary insanity.|$|E
25|$|During further questioning— {{and to the}} {{complete}} surprise and <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police— Lee {{then went on to}} confess to starting nine more fatal fires in Hull over the previous seven years. None of the fires was treated with suspicion at the time; inquests recorded misadventure verdicts and arson was never considered. A total of 26 people had died in the blazes, ranging from a six-month-old baby, a young mother and her three small sons, to 11 elderly men in a residential home, Wensley Lodge. Dozens more were burned or suffered from smoke inhalation, or received injuries while escaping.|$|E
25|$|The League's {{publications}} {{included a}} quarterly newsletter, The Ypres Times (first published in October 1921, and still being published {{as late as}} 1938), and books such as The Immortal Salient (1925), a historical record of the battles and a guide for pilgrims to Ypres. An account of the <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditions on the Ypres Salient, written by the war correspondent Philip Gibbs, {{was used for the}} League's information leaflets. Planned publications included the Ypres Book of Valour. The League also had a marching song, called Tramping along to a little tin whistle and an old toy drum, a version of which was published in 1926.|$|E

25|$|Nolan is {{also noted}} for his command and {{problems}} during the Buffalo Soldier tragedy of 1877. This was {{also known as}} the Staked Plains Horror and was a tragic series of events in the hot dry Llano Estacado region of north-west Texas and eastern New Mexico. This was during the 100 degree heat in July of a barren desert. Four soldiers and one buffalo hunter would die from the hot <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desert. The character and loyalty of the men involved would be severely tested as would their honor and duty. Some would be called heroes and others deserters, but most would state they were happy just to have survived.|$|E
25|$|Already {{before the}} Romantic period proper, critics {{had begun to}} stress the {{elements}} of the play that would cause Hamlet to be seen, in the next century, as the epitome of the tragedy of character. In 1774, William Richardson sounded the key notes of this analysis: Hamlet was a sensitive and accomplished prince with an unusually refined moral sense; he is nearly incapacitated by the <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> truth about his mother and uncle, and he struggles against that horror to fulfill his task. Richardson, who thought the play should have ended shortly after the closet scene, thus saw the play as dramatizing the conflict between a sensitive individual and a calloused, seamy world.|$|E
25|$|Among Gillray's best satires on George III are: Farmer George and his Wife, two {{companion}} plates, in one {{of which}} the king is toasting muffins for breakfast, {{and in the other}} the queen is frying sprats; The Anti-Saccharites, where the royal pair propose to dispense with sugar, to the great <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family; A Connoisseur Examining a Cooper; the paired plates A Voluptuary under the Horrors of Digestion and Temperance enjoying a Frugal Meal, satirising the excesses of the Prince Regent (later George IV of the United Kingdom) and the miserliness of his father, George III of the United Kingdom respectively; Royal Affability; A Lesson in Apple Dumplings; and The Pigs Possessed.|$|E
