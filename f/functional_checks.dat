40|$|The German {{remote sensing}} {{satellite}} TerraSAR-X, launched in 2007, hosts a flexible X-Band {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) operating in Stripmap, Spotlight, ScanSAR, and additional experimental modes. For these various antenna beams, its active phased array antenna electronically steers and shapes the patterns in azimuth and elevation direction. The array consists of 384 radiating sub-arrays for horizontal and vertical polarisation each.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this article is to present a case study of {{aircraft}} production customer inspection process and analyze the needs and benefits for such market practice. Enabling operators and owners to closely follow certain production process milestones contributes to a more reliable operation, compliance with customer expectations and proper detection, documentation and rectification of production discrepancies. Nevertheless, although often required by customers, few airframe manufacturers dispose of a formal production inspection program to guide operators and owners through the process. The production inspection program implemented by a large commercial aircraft manufacturer is thoroughly analysed, discussed and benchmarked for future references. The scope of such work includes observations of intermediate inspection activities throughout the aircraft final assembly line up to the end of the aircraft delivery process and consequent technical acceptance. Airframe and systems assembly processes are subject to either visual, operational or <b>functional</b> <b>checks.</b> As a result, production concessions are assessed and dealt with in such a manner to avoid future negative impacts on the aircraft operation, maintenance and airworthiness. Best practices and key tasks are discussed. A customer-oriented, flexible and thorough schedule of activities is perceived as a positive industry practice in the aviation business...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—System-on-a-Chip (SoC) {{design has}} {{become more and more}} complex because Intellectual Property (IP) core with {{different}} functions are integrated within a single chip. Each IPs have completed design and verification but the integration of all IPs may not work together. The bus-based architecture has become the major integration methodology for implementing a SoC. The main issue is to ensure that the IP works correctly after integrating to the corresponding bus architecture. Advanced extensible interface 4 (AXI 4) is an on chip bus architecture introduced by ARM to interact with its peripherals. A synthesizable AXI 4 protocol checker which contains a set of rules to check on-chip communication properties accuracy is proposed to ensure proper SoC integration. A prototype of AXI 4 Master and AXI Slave is also designed to generate the AXI 4 signals. The protocol checker will continuously monitor the signals from AXI 4 Master and AXI 4 Slave to check whether any rule is broken or not. The proposed AXI 4 protocol checker will check both the Write Channel and Read Channel transactions. As the AXI 4 checker is synthesizable it can be used in FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and Emulation where <b>functional</b> <b>checks</b> are difficult to detect and pin point. The AXI 4 Master, AXI Slave and AXI 4 protocol checker have been modeled using Verilog and implemented on Digilent Basys 2 Spartan 3 E FPGA board...|$|E
40|$|For {{calibrating}} {{and monitoring}} the radiometric stability, the radar instrument of TerraSAR-X hosts a passive calibration network coupling into an additional port of the T/R modules. Three {{different types of}} calibration pulses are applied, whereby sets of these pulses are needed at the start and end of each data acquisition. Additionally, TerraSAR-X has been equipped with an additional calibration mode based on the so-called "PN Gating method". The PN Gating mode allows operating the T/R modules under most realistic conditions with the advantage that all modules can be characterised simultaneously. The individual characteristics are found by assigning special calibration pulse sequences with orthogonal codes to the T/R modules. During on-ground characterisation of the TerraSAR-X instrument this technique has established as a crucial diagnostic tool for <b>functional</b> <b>checks</b> as well as T/R module drift and failure monitoring. For the first time ever, this innovative method of PN Gating measurements will be applied for in-flight monitoring of a satellite SAR instrument. Starting with the TerraSAR-X commissioning phase the instrument behaviour can be accurately characterised to guarantee the radiometric stability of the system throughout the mission lifetime. In this paper, the latest results from the in-orbit calibration of TerraSAR-X are shown and compared to on-ground measurements of pre-launch characterisations. The techniques described above are also applicable for characterisation and calibration of other advanced SAR systems coping with multiple mode radar instruments...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{perceived}} quality of powered seat adjusters {{based on their}} sound during operation has become a primary concern for vehicle and seat manufacturers. Historical noise targets based on overall dB(A) at the occupant’s ear have consistently proved inadequate {{as a measure of}} the sound quality of a seat adjuster. Significant effort has been devoted to develop alternative sound quality metrics that can truly discriminate between “good ” and “bad ” seat adjusters. These new metrics have been successfully applied for some years by product development engineers in test labs. However, in the assembly plant the sound quality of the seat adjuster is still assessed subjectively by an operator {{at the end of the}} assembly line. The main problem with this approach is not only the lack of consistency and repeatability across large samples of seat tracks, but also the fact that the only feedback provided from the end-of-line to the product development team is of subjective nature. This subjective information is of little help for the engineers who have to diagnose and remedy the problem. Additionally, since sound quality has become one of the main reasons for rejection at the end of the assembly line, there is the need for integrating sound quality performance checks with the standard quality control or <b>functional</b> <b>checks</b> in the manufacturing environment. Therefore, the new challenge for the seat adjuster manufacturer is to implement at the end of the assembly line an automated Sound Quality-based inspection system that relies exclusively on objective parameters. The authors of this paper have devoted a lot of effort toward developing such a system, and this paper will describe and discuss the main issues related to its design, implementation and validation...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{designs of}} nuclear fuel {{recycling}} plants {{are expected to}} include more ambitious goals for aqueous based separations including; higher separations efficiency, high-level waste minimization, and a greater focus on continuous processes to minimize cost and footprint. Therefore, Annular Centrifugal Contactors (ACCs) are destined to play a more important role for such future processing schemes. Previous efforts defined and characterized the performance of commercial 5 cm and 12. 5 cm single-stage ACCs in a “cold” environment. The next logical step, the design and evaluation of remote capable pilot scale ACCs in a “hot” or radioactive environment was reported earlier. This report includes the development of remote designs for ACCs that can process the large throughput rates needed in future nuclear fuel recycling plants. Novel designs were developed for the remote interconnection of contactor units, clean-in-place and drain connections, and a new solids removal collection chamber. A three stage, 12. 5 cm diameter rotor module has been constructed and evaluated for operational function and remote handling in highly radioactive environments. This design is scalable to commercial CINC ACC models from V- 05 to V- 20 with total throughput rates ranging from 20 to 650 liters per minute. The V- 05 R three stage prototype was manufactured by the commercial vendor for ACCs in the U. S., CINC mfg. It employs three standard V- 05 clean-in-place (CIP) units modified for remote service and replacement via new methods of connection for solution inlets, outlets, drain and CIP. Hydraulic testing and <b>functional</b> <b>checks</b> were successfully conducted and then the prototype was evaluated for remote handling and maintenance suitability. Removal and replacement of the center position V- 05 R ACC unit in the three stage prototype was demonstrated using an overhead rail mounted PaR manipulator. This evaluation confirmed the efficacy of this innovative design for interconnecting and cleaning individual stages while retaining the benefits of commercially reliable ACC equipment for remote applications in the nuclear industry. Minor modifications and suggestions for improved manual remote servicing by the remote handling specialists were provided but successful removal and replacement was demonstrated in the first prototype...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{nuclear power}} plants, {{continuous}} efforts {{are made to}} ensure that plants are operated in safe, reliable and economical manner. While utmost care is taken during design, construction and commissioning of the structures, systems& components (SSCs), continued healthiness has to be ensured during operation phase {{in accordance with the}} design intent. This is primarily achieved through the establishment of a comprehensive life management programme of surveillance, condition monitoring, periodic In-service inspections (ISI) and maintenance, the purpose of which is to ensure that required safety margins are maintained for all important SSCs throughout plant service life. In any industry, the important mechanisms which lead to SSCs degradation are general corrosion, Flow accelerated corrosion, erosion, thermal effects, fatigue and mechanical wear & fretting. In a Nuclear Power Plant, in addition to these, degradation also occurs due to irradiation and creep. Therefore SSCs need to be designed with due consideration of all such degradation mechanisms. During operation phase, the limiting conditions for operation and requirements of surveillance & condition monitoring for all components important to safety are documented in Technical Specification. A plant specific ISI manual defines and elaborates the ISI internal inspection methods and acceptance criteria. The ISI requirements are decided taking into account best industry practices and operational experience and meet the requirements of existing codes and standards. Both these documents are approved by AERB. In pressurized heavy water reactors, major components covered in ISI programme are coolant channels, feeder pipes, steam generators, heavy water heat exchangers, pressure boundary components, relief valves etc. The inspection methods adopted include use of UT, ECT, DPT and visual inspection. In addition to <b>functional</b> <b>checks</b> for some of the components, ferrography, vibration monitoring and thermography etc are also utilized for rotating equipment. The SSCs where unacceptable indications are revealed by ISI are repaired, replaced or isolated. The base line data generated during Pre-Service inspection is used for comparing and trending of observations. The observations made during ISI are subjected to thorough review and analysis by qualified experts to obtain assurance that unacceptable degradation in component quality is not occurring and it remains fit for service. The containment system of a NPP plays a crucial role in minimizing dose to the public in case of an accident situation. The integrity of Primary and Secondary Containment is assessed by conducting integrated leak rate tests in every Biannual Shut Down. The concrete structure is also subjected to NDT checks on a specified frequency to ensure continued healthiness. Indian nuclear power plants have accumulated an operating experience of more than 380 reactor years of operation. Over the years, the programmes for surveillance, condition monitoring and in-service inspections have been improved significantly and match with best in the industry. As a result, there has been no major age related failure in any of the important SSCs and thus continued safe and reliable operation of NPPs is assured. This paper brings out the ISI & health monitoring methodology adopted at Indian NPPs, to ensure safe and reliable operation...|$|E
