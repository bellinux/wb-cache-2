5|$|Joseph {{is said to}} {{have arrived}} in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On {{disembarking}} <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn (or Holy Thorn). This is said to explain a hybrid Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn) tree that only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a sprig of thorn is cut, by the local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John's School, and sent to the Queen.|$|E
500|$|The session, {{held the}} evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful {{until late in the}} night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and {{launched}} into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's [...] "That's All Right". Moore recalled, [...] "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open... <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again.'" [...] Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played [...] "That's All Right" [...] on his WHBQ Red, Hot, and Blue show. Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black. During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing an audio delay echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed [...] "slapback". A single was pressed with [...] "That's All Right" [...] on the A side and [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky" [...] on the reverse.|$|E
2500|$|The African press named Uruguay {{public enemy}} No.1 and {{described}} them as cheats. Suárez was unapologetic about his handball, stating [...] "I {{made the best}} save of the tournament." [...] Suárez boasted after the match of his handball save, claiming that [...] "The 'Hand of God' now belongs to me," [...] {{a reference to the}} handball goal scored by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup. Ghana's coach Milovan Rajevac argued that Suárez's actions were [...] "really shocking," [...] describing the result as a [...] "football injustice." [...] Uruguay's coach Óscar Tabárez defended Suárez: [...] "Saying we cheated Ghana is too harsh a word to use...We also abide by what the referee did. It could have been a mistake. Yes, <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> hand out, but it's not cheating. What else do you want? Is Suárez also to blame for Ghana missing the penalty? We try to be dignified, and if we lose a match, we look for the reasons for it. You shouldn't look to third parties." ...|$|E

60|$|Syme was {{as certain}} that <b>he</b> had <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> blade into his enemy as a {{gardener}} that <b>he</b> has <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> spade into the ground. Yet the Marquis sprang {{back from the}} stroke without a stagger, and Syme stood staring at his own sword-point like an idiot. There was no blood on it at all.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He {{was quiet}} and not brilliant. But still <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> to <b>his</b> painting, and still <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> to <b>his</b> mother. Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she had pondered, or of all that had {{occurred}} to her during the day. He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.|$|R
2500|$|The fifth {{voyage of}} Suomen Joutsen {{was the longest}} the ship had ever done under the Finnish flag. After leaving Helsinki on 9 October 1935, the ship stopped briefly at Lisbon, Portugal, and then {{continued}} across the Atlantic, eventually arriving in the Panama canal on 26 December. It took eleven {{and a half hours}} to transit the [...] canal. After leaving Panama behind, Suomen Joutsen headed south and crossed the Equator on 4 January 1936 with appropriate ceremonies. Later the ship stopped at Callao in Peru and Valparaiso in Chile, where five men escaped after a local barkeeper had offered them full upkeep for playing at his bar. The men were later caught by local officials and returned to Finland, where they were sentenced for six months in prison. After leaving Chile, Suomen Joutsen sailed around the Cape Horn without major difficulties and arrived in Buenos Aires on 21 March. From Argentine, the ship continued to Rio de Janeiro, where she encountered the Brazilian school ship Almirante Saldanha, whose purchase had been inspired by the previous visit of the white swan of Finland. Suomen Joutsen sailed out on 14 April and due to heavy weather and headwinds, it took seven weeks to reach the Azores. On 9 May, Captain Konkola turned 50 and after the crew had sung [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] at 6:30 in the morning, <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head out from the cabin door and yelled [...] "Steward, give them booze!" [...] Suomen Joutsen arrived in Helsinki on 4 July 1936. After a number of disagreements regarding the use of tugboats in the foreign ports, Captain Konkola decided to sail the full rigged ship {{all the way to the}} harbour, crossing the narrow Kustaanmiekka strait at full sail. Finally, when the bow had already been moored at Katajanokka, he allowed the tugboat to push the stern against the pier and the fifth voyage was over.|$|E
2500|$|Rav Hana (or {{some say}} Hanin) bar Bizna {{said in the}} name of Rabbi Simeon the Pious that because Joseph sanctified God's Name in private when he {{resisted}} Potiphar's wife's advances, one letter from God's Name was added to Joseph's name. Rabbi Johanan interpreted the words, [...] "And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work," [...] in [...] to teach that both Joseph and Potiphar's wife had the intention to act immorally. Rav and Samuel differed in their interpretation of the words [...] "he went into the house to do his work." [...] One said that it really means that Joseph went to do his household work, but the other said that Joseph went to satisfy his desires. Interpreting the words, [...] "And there was none of the men of the house there within," [...] in [...] the Gemara asked whether it was possible that no man was present in a huge house like Potiphar's. A Baraita was taught in the School of Rabbi Ishmael that the day was Potiphar's household's feast-day, and they had all gone to their idolatrous temple, but Potiphar's wife had pretended to be ill, because she thought that she would not again have an opportunity like that day to associate with Joseph. The Gemara taught that just at the moment reported in [...] when [...] "she caught him by his garment, saying: ‘Lie with me,' Jacob's image came and appeared to Joseph through the window. Jacob told Joseph that Joseph and his brothers were destined to have their names inscribed upon the stones of the ephod, and Jacob asked whether it was Joseph's wish to have his name expunged from the ephod and be called an associate of harlots, as [...] says, [...] "He that keeps company with harlots wastes his substance." [...] Immediately, in the words of [...] "his bow abode in strength." [...] Rabbi Johanan said {{in the name of}} Rabbi Meir that this means that his passion subsided. And then, in the words of [...] "the arms of his hands were made active," [...] meaning that <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> hands in the ground and his lust went out from between his fingernails.|$|E
