Within some cave passages, sediments and stalagmites have been dated to {{establish}} an absolute chronology for {{at least part of}} the dale’s evolution. Much of the excavation of Kingsdale dates back to fluvial erosion early in the Pleistocene; the dale was then modified by pre-Devensian glaciers and excavated to almost its present depth. Devensian ice increased the depth profile by only a few metres, before leaving moraines that impounded a short-lived lake at the lower end of the dale. A post-Devensian channel now cuts through the main recessional moraine at Raven Ray, beneath which lies a deep buried valley. Kingsdale is the most westerly of the classic Yorkshire Dales, lying between Whernside and Gragareth, near the southwest-ern tip of the Craven Uplands, almost due north of Ingleton (Fig. 1). Its magnificent U-shaped <b>glaciated</b> <b>trough,</b> alterna-tively described as parabolic in profile, is perfectly straight, some 6 km long and c. 700 m wide. It cuts through Carbonif-erous rocks belonging mainly to the Great Scar Limestone Group (Kilnsey and Malham formations) of the Askrigg Block, so that its walls feature a succession of limestone scars...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this PhD thesis is twofold: Firstly, processes, {{patterns}} and timing of the last deglaciation in the Barents Sea are reconstructed and secondly, depositional conditions on the Barents shelf during Holocene are elucidated. This cumulative PhD thesis encompasses an introductory part and five papers - three as first-author and two as co-author. Three papers {{are focused on the}} most prominent geomorphological freature of the western Barents shelf, 850 km long cross-shelf trough Bjørnøyrenna (The Bear Island Trough). One detailed study examines processes and timing of the first step of glacial retreat in outer Bjørnøyrenna and establishes a minimum age of 17 cal ka for initial deglaciation. A second study focuses on a grounding line system in uppermost Bjørnøyrenna, witnessing a surge-type readvance towards the final collapse of the marine-based Barents Sea Ice Sheet. A third study focuses on contrasting ice stream flow regimes and processes observed from glacial maximum over initial deglaciation towards final deglaciation. Two additional studies are located in the relatively small formerly <b>glaciated</b> <b>trough</b> Kveithola, north-west of Bjørnøya (Bear Island). The first focuses on the most recent deglaciation history and establishes an indirect deglaciation age for Spitsbergenbanken 14. 2 - 13. 9 cal ka ago. The other reconstructs the complex glacial retreat through Kveithola and associated processes based on geophysical data. As a whole, this PhD thesis improves existing chronology during deglaciation and Holocene for the Barents Sea, advances existing depositional models of ice-marginal and deglacial processes as well as it adds to established conceptional models of glacial retreat. While presented Holocene data is less conclusive, it might create the awareness that the large Storegga tsunami at 8. 2 cal ka may have had an erosional impact on shelf sediments and thereby motivate further research...|$|E

(2014), Large-Scale Rock Slope Failures in the Eastern Pyrenees: Identifying a Sparse But Significant Population in Paraglacial and Parafluvial Contexts. Geografiska Annaler: Series A, Physical Geography, 96 : 357 – 391. doi: 10. 1111 /geoa. 12060], which has been published in final form at [URL] first overview of large-scale rock slope failure (RSF) in the Pyrenees addresses the eastern third of the range. Around 30 principal RSFs > 0. 25 km 2 and 20 lesser or uncertain cases have been identified from remote imagery and groundtruthing. Compared with other European mountain ranges, RSF incidence is relatively sparse, displays no obvious regional trend or spatial clustering, and occurs across diverse landscape types, if mainly on metamorphic rocks. A transition is observed from paraglacial RSFs in formerly-glaciated valleys to what are here termed ‘parafluvial’ RSFs, within wholly or mainly fluvial valleys but where slope failure is not directly provoked by or linked to river erosion. RSFs are particularly found in three topographic settings: (i) at cirque and trough-head thresholds (transition zones of elevated instability between cirque and main <b>glaciated</b> <b>trough</b> walls); (ii) near the upper or outer periphery of the ice field, where glacial adaptation of fluvial valleys is incomplete; and (iii) in fluvial valleys beyond glacial limits where incision is locally intense. RSF is absent from the range divide, from within cirques, and from most main valleys. In the montane areas, RSF is strongly associated with vestiges of preglacial summit surfaces, confirming that plateau ridges are less stable than sharpened crests and horns. RSF is contributing significantly to the progressive destruction of this paleic relief. The overall sparsity of RSF indicates insufficient rock mass stresses, including rebound after concentrated bedrock erosion. This may reflect a relatively weak imprint of glacial erosion, including breaching, {{in a context of}} relatively low mean rates of neotectonic uplift, possibly signalling overall that eastern Pyrenees landscapes are close to dynamic equilibrium.

50|$|Although icesheets have {{repeatedly}} covered the Monadh Liath, {{they have done}} little to change its character: there are no corries away from the Munros fringe, and only a few short <b>glaciated</b> <b>troughs,</b> notably Glen Killin on the north. It has just become recognised that thin ice on the plateau is frozen to the ground, but as it starts to flow into the troughs it thickens, accelerates, and warms up so it can erode and enlarge them. This has occurred as recently as the very last (Younger Dryas) glacial period ~12000 years ago.|$|R

Whereas the sedimentary processes of large, low-gradient TMFs have received considerable interest, {{little attention has been}} paid to the other end member of this landform class, i. e. TMFs with higher slope gradients. Detailed swath-bathymetric data and seismic profiles from the continental margin offshore Troms, northern Norway cover three high-gradient TMFs (the Andfjorden, Malangsdjupet and Rebbenesdjupet TMFs; slope gradients generally between 1 ° and 15 °), as well as inter-fan areas, which include two submarine canyons (the Andøya and Senja Canyon) and the Malangsgrunnen inter-fan slope. The present-day morphologies of the Andfjorden and Malangsdjupet TMFs have evolved from sediment transport and distribution through gully-channel complexes. The Andfjorden TMF has later been affected by a large submarine landslide that remobilized much of these complexes. The Rebbenesdjupet TMF is dominated by a number of small and relatively shallow slide scars, which are inferred to be related to small-scale sediment failure of glaciomarine and/or contouritic sediments. The canyons cut into the adjacent TMFs, and turbidity currents originating on the fans widened and deepened the canyons during downslope flow. The Malangsgrunnen shelf break and inter-fan slope acted as a funnel for turbidity currents originating on the upper slope, forming a dendritic pattern of gullies. A conceptual model for the high-gradient TMFs on the Troms margin has been compiled. The main sediment input onto the TMFs has occurred during peak glacials when the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet reached the shelf edge. The overall convex fan form and progradational seismic facies show that these glacigenic deposits were repeatedly distributed onto the fan. On the Andfjorden and Malangsdjupet TMFs, gully-channel complexes occur within such deposits. It is thus inferred that the steep slope of these TMFs promoted rapid transformation from small-scale slumps and debris flows on the upper slope, into partly erosive turbidity currents. These flows continued into the deep sea, thus promoting efficient sediment by-pass across the TMFs. This model can be applied to other TMFs {{situated at}} the mouths of other <b>glaciated</b> cross-shelf <b>troughs.</b> In contrast, low-gradient TMFs are found to be dominated by glacigenic debris flow deposits. Furthermore, gully-channel complexes demonstrating the presence of erosive turbidity currents on high-gradient TMFs are rare on low-gradient TMFs. Large submarine landslides occur at both high- and low-gradient TMFs...|$|R
