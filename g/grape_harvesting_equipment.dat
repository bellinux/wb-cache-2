40|$|<b>Grape</b> <b>harvest</b> dates {{have been}} {{recorded}} in many European locations for several centuries, and potentially contain important information about past climate. In this study, we systematically analyse the relationship of <b>grape</b> <b>harvest</b> dates recorded in the Burgundy region (France) with different climate data sets {{in order to understand}} the connection between climatic conditions and the time of harvest. The results point to a primary dependence of the <b>grape</b> <b>harvest</b> on the temperature from April to August. The strength of this connection depends on the winter to summer temperature relationship and increases over the last 100 years. The <b>grape</b> <b>harvest</b> date is also related to the winter temperature. This connection is non-stationary on interannual, but stable on decadal-to-multidecadal time scales. Therefore, the <b>grape</b> <b>harvest</b> date can be used for independent reconstructions of local April-to-August temperature on interannual time scales as well as remote winter temperature on decadal-to-multidecadal time scales...|$|R
