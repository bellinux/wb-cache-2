5|$|In <b>Finland</b> {{a special}} {{branch of the}} Research Institute for the Languages of <b>Finland</b> has {{official}} status as the regulatory body for Swedish in <b>Finland.</b> Among its highest priorities is to maintain intelligibility with the language spoken in Sweden. It has published Finlandssvensk ordbok, a dictionary {{about the differences between}} Swedish in <b>Finland</b> and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|<b>Finland</b> {{was a part}} of Sweden {{from the}} 13th century until the loss of the Finnish territories to Russia in 1809. Swedish was the sole {{administrative}} language until 1902 as well as the dominant language of culture and education until Finnish independence in 1917. The percentage of Swedish speakers in <b>Finland</b> has steadily decreased since then. The Swedish-speaking population is mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of Ostrobothnia, Southwest <b>Finland</b> and Nyland where the percentage of <b>Finland</b> Swedes partly is high, with Swedish being spoken by more than 90% of the population in several municipalities, and on Åland, where Swedish is spoken by a vast majority of the population and is the only official language. Swedish is an official language also in the rest of <b>Finland,</b> though, with the same official status as Finnish. The country's public broadcaster, Yle, provides two Swedish-language radio stations, Yle Vega and Yle X3M, as well a TV channel, Yle Fem.|$|E
5|$|<b>Finland</b> {{was divided}} into two {{operational}} zones. Northern <b>Finland</b> was the staging area for Army Norway. Its goal was to execute a two-pronged pincer movement on the strategic port of Murmansk, named Operation Silver Fox. Southern <b>Finland</b> was still under {{the responsibility of the}} Finnish Army. The goal of the Finnish forces was, at first, to recapture Finnish Karelia at Lake Ladoga as well as the Karelian Isthmus, which included Finland's second largest city Vyborg.|$|E

Salo assisted on the go-ahead {{goal in the}} third period before Canada tied up the score and won 5–4 in overtime. Several months later, at the 2004 World Cup, Salo helped <b>Finland</b> to the final, notching three assists in seven games. For his third straight national team appearance, however, <b>Finland</b> was eliminated by Canada, losing the championship game 3–2.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{during the}} 1930s, the {{diplomatic}} climate between <b>Finland</b> and the Soviet Union gradually improved. From the 1920s, the Soviet Union had offered different non-aggression pacts with <b>Finland</b> {{but they were}} all rejected. Now the offer was renewed as part of a series of agreements with the countries on the Soviet Union's western border. In 1932, the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with <b>Finland,</b> re-affirmed in 1934 for ten years.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October 1920, <b>Finland</b> and Soviet Russia {{signed the}} Treaty of Tartu, {{confirming}} the new Finnish-Soviet border {{as the old}} border between the autonomous Grand Duchy of <b>Finland</b> and Imperial Russia proper. In addition, <b>Finland</b> received Petsamo, with its ice-free harbour on the Arctic Ocean. The treaty did not prevent the Finnish government from allowing volunteers {{to cross the border}} to support the East-Karelian Uprising in 1921 however, nor expatriate Finnish communists from causing disturbances in <b>Finland.</b> In 1923 both countries signed the Border Peace Agreement, which normalized the border.|$|E

5|$|Swedish is {{the sole}} {{official}} national language of Sweden, and one of two in <b>Finland</b> (alongside Finnish). As of 2006, {{it was the first}} or sole native language of 7.5 to 8 million Swedish residents. In 2007 around 5.5% (c. 290,000) of the population of <b>Finland</b> were native speakers of Swedish, though the percentage has been declining steadily since <b>Finland</b> became part of Russia after the Finnish War 1808–1809. The <b>Finland</b> Swedish minority is concentrated in the coastal areas and archipelagos of southern and western <b>Finland.</b> In some of these areas, Swedish is the predominant language; in 19 municipalities, 16 of which are located in Åland, Swedish {{is the sole}} official language.

5|$|The Finns assured Yartsev that <b>Finland</b> was {{committed}} to a policy of neutrality, and the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev was {{not satisfied with the}} reply, given Finland's military weakness. He suggested that <b>Finland</b> could cede, or lease, some islands in the Gulf of <b>Finland</b> along the seaward approaches to Leningrad, a suggestion the Finns rejected. Earlier in the mid-1930s, the Soviet ambassador in Helsinki, Eric Assmus, and the Leningrad Bolshevik party leader Andrei Zhdanov, had presented a similar proposal.|$|E

5|$|The legend {{strongly}} {{emphasizes that}} Henry was a Bishop of Uppsala, not a Bishop of <b>Finland</b> {{which became a}} conventional claim later on, also by the church itself. He stayed in <b>Finland</b> out of pity, but was never appointed as a bishop there. The legend does not state whether there had been bishops in <b>Finland</b> before his time or what happened after his death; it does not even mention his burial in <b>Finland.</b> The vita is so void of any concrete information about <b>Finland</b> {{that it could have}} been created anywhere. The Latin is scholastic and the grammar is in general exceptionally good.|$|E
5|$|The only {{reference}} to Bishop Thomas during his episcopate in <b>Finland</b> {{is a letter}} signed by him in Nousiainen in 1234, which granted certain lands around the parish to his chaplain Wilhelm. The lands {{may be related to}} the papal permission from Pope Gregory IX in early 1229 that authorized the church to take over all non-Christian places of worship in <b>Finland.</b> The letter is the oldest surviving letter written in <b>Finland.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The note precipitated {{a crisis}} in Finland: {{activating}} the military provisions of the treaty would have frustrated <b>Finland's</b> post-war policy of neutrality in international affairs and greatly damaged <b>Finland's</b> relations with the West. One of the crucial goals of Finnish foreign policy was to reinforce the credibility of <b>Finland's</b> neutrality {{in the eyes of}} Western powers which were skeptical of the country's ability to resist Soviet influence.|$|R

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War gave <b>Finland</b> {{a window of opportunity}} to achieve this. The Finns sought aid from both the German Empire and the Bolsheviks to that end, and on 6 December 1917, the Senate of <b>Finland</b> declared the country's independence. The new Bolshevik Russian government was weak, and soon the Russian Civil War would break out. Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin could spare no troops or attention for <b>Finland,</b> and consequently, Soviet Russia recognized the new Finnish government just three weeks after the declaration of independence. In 1918, the Finns fought a short civil war, where the pro-Bolshevik Red Guards were armed by 7,000 to 10,000 Russian troops stationed in <b>Finland.</b>|$|E
5|$|Together {{with his}} alleged murderer Lalli, Henry {{remains one of}} the most {{recognized}} people from the early history of <b>Finland.</b> His feast is celebrated by the majority Lutheran Church of <b>Finland,</b> as well as by the Roman Catholic Church of <b>Finland.</b> He is commemorated in the liturgical calendars of several Protestant and Anglican churches.|$|E

5|$|Åland is a {{collection}} of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between Sweden and <b>Finland.</b> The islands are almost exclusively Swedish-speaking, but in 1809, the Åland Islands, along with <b>Finland,</b> were taken by Imperial Russia. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian October Revolution, <b>Finland</b> declared its independence, but most of the Ålanders wished to rejoin Sweden. The Finnish government considered the islands {{to be a part of}} their new nation, as the Russians had included Åland in the Grand Duchy of <b>Finland,</b> formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League's Council, but <b>Finland</b> would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created. In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of <b>Finland,</b> but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.|$|E
