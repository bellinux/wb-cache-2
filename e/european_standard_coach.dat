Its thirty four {{national}} members work together to develop <b>European</b> <b>Standards</b> (ENs) in various sectors to build a European internal market {{for goods and services}} and to position Europe in the global economy. CEN is officially recognised as a <b>European</b> <b>standards</b> body by the European Union; the other official <b>European</b> <b>standards</b> bodies are the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) and the <b>European</b> Telecommunications <b>Standards</b> Institute (ETSI).|$|R

25|$|There is a CEN {{standardisation}} initiative, Identification of Fixed Objects In Public Transport ('IFOPT'), {{to develop}} NaPTAN concepts into a <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> for stop identification {{as an extension}} to Transmodel, the <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> for Public Transport information.|$|R
25|$|In the European Community (EC), eye {{protection}} requirements are specified in <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> EN 207. In addition to EN 207, <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> EN 208 specifies requirements for goggles for use during beam alignment. These transmit {{a portion of}} the laser light, permitting the operator to see where the beam is, and do not provide complete protection against a direct laser beam hit. Finally, <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> EN 60825 specifies optical densities in extreme situations.|$|R
50|$|The CEN {{standard}} (Identification of Fixed Objects In Public Transport or 'IFOPT') integrates many concepts {{used in the}} NaPTAN <b>standard</b> into a <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> for stop identification as {{an extension}} to Transmodel which is the <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> for Public Transport information.|$|R
40|$|Standards are {{produced}} for many different products and services, {{and may be}} created for company, national, re-gional or global application. In Europe there are three dif-ferent categories of standard: International standard – a standard adopted by an international standardization organi-zation; <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> – a standard adopted by a Eu-ropean standardization body; National standard – a stand-ard adopted by a national standardization body and {{made available to the}} public. Harmonized standards play a spe-cial role in the EU.

It provides a means of specifying the capacity of an enclosure to protect its contents from external impacts. The IK Code was originally defined in <b>European</b> <b>Standard</b> BS EN 50102 (1995, amended 1998).
