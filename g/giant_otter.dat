5|$|Even if without direct predation, the <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> {{must still}} {{compete with other}} predators for food resources. Duplaix {{documented}} interaction with the neotropical otter. While the two species are sympatric (with overlapping ranges) during certain seasons, {{there appeared to be}} no serious conflict. The smaller neotropical otter is far more shy, less noisy, and less social; at about a third the weight of the <b>giant</b> <b>otter,</b> it is more vulnerable to predation, hence, a lack of conspicuousness is to its advantage. The neotropical otter is active during twilight and darkness, reducing the likelihood of conflict with the diurnal <b>giant</b> <b>otter.</b> Its smaller prey, different denning habits, and different preferred water types also reduce interaction.|$|E
5|$|More recently, habitat {{destruction}} and degradation {{have become the}} principal dangers, and a further reduction of 50% is expected in <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> numbers within the 20 years after 2004 (about the span of three generations of giant otters). Typically, loggers first move into rainforest, clearing the vegetation along riverbanks. Farmers follow, creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats. As human activity expands, <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> home ranges become increasingly isolated. Subadults leaving in search of new territory find it impossible to set up family groups. Specific threats from human industry include unsustainable mahogany logging {{in parts of the}} <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> range, and concentrations of mercury in its diet of fish, a byproduct of gold mining. Water pollution from mining, fossil fuel extraction, and agriculture is a serious danger; concentrations of pesticides and other chemicals are magnified at each step in the food chain, and can poison top predators such as the <b>giant</b> <b>otter.</b>|$|E
5|$|The longest {{documented}} <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> lifespan in {{the wild}} is eight years. In captivity, this may increase to 17, with an unconfirmed record of 19. The animal is susceptible {{to a variety of}} diseases, including canine parvovirus. Parasites, such as the larvae of flies and a variety of intestinal worms, also afflict the <b>giant</b> <b>otter.</b> Other causes of death include accidents, gastroenteritis, infanticide, and epileptic seizures.|$|E

40|$|The local {{success of}} {{protected}} areas for effective biodiversity conservation depends largely on ensuring the integration of local communities and the persistence of wildlife species and ecological processes. We investigated the perceptions of riverine residents living around a sustainable-use protected area towards <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> (Pteronura brasiliensis). Between March and December 2011, we conducted 41 interviews with riverine residents {{in the region of}} the National Forest of Amapá (AP, Brazil). These interviews revealed a strong negative attitude towards <b>giant</b> <b>otters,</b> highlighted by recent reports of otters being killed in 12. 2 % of the interviews. Generalized linear models showed that years of education and age weakly predicted attitudes towards otters in the study area (i. e., respondents with the longest time in education and older were less likely to dislike otters and to consider <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> as damaging income or fishing activities, respectively). These results suggested that to conserve <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> in this region efforts should focus on environmental education and long-term research projects...|$|R
5|$|Other {{countries}} {{have taken a}} lead in designating protected areas in South America. In 2004, Peru created {{one of the largest}} conservation areas in the world, Alto Purús National Park, with an area similar in size to Belgium. The park harbors many endangered plants and animals, including the <b>giant</b> <b>otter,</b> and holds the world record for mammal diversity.

40|$|Few <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{have been}} {{measured}} and weighed and its actual size is controversial in the literature. This study presents the weight-length relationship of Amazonian <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> using 15 captive individuals. The maximum length and weight were 163 cm and 22. 5 kg, and 162 cm and 28. 8 kg, for the males and females, respectively. The weight-length relationships {{were not significantly}} different between the sexes (t = 0. 658, d. f. = 11, P> 0. 05) and can be expressed by the equation: W= 1. 48 x 10 - 5 L 2. 81. Considering that some of the <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> used in this study were old individuals (more than 10 years old), and that all the animals analyzed were healthy, it is possible to assume that the weight-length relationships obtained are probably a close approximation of the relationship of <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> of the Amazon region and can be used by institutions that keep this species in captivity as a base to quickly assess the animal’s nutritive status...|$|R

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} by Koepfli and Wayne in 1998 found the <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> {{has the highest}} divergence sequences within the otter subfamily, forming a distinct clade that split away 10 to 14 million years ago. They noted that the species may be the basal divergence among the otters or fall outside of them altogether, having split even before other mustelids, such as the ermine, polecat, and mink. Later gene sequencing research on the mustelids, from 2005, places the divergence of the <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> somewhat later, between five and 11 million years ago; the corresponding phylogenetic tree locates the Lontra divergence first among otter genera, and Pteronura second, although divergence ranges overlap.|$|E
5|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> is very {{sensitive}} to human activity when rearing its young. No institution, for example, has successfully raised <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> cubs unless parents were provided sufficient privacy measures; the stress caused by human visual and acoustic interference can lead to neglect, abuse and infanticide, as well as decreased lactation. In the wild, it has been suggested, although not systematically confirmed, that tourists cause similar stresses: disrupted lactation and denning, reduced hunting, and habitat abandonment are all risks. This sensitivity is matched by a strong protectiveness towards the young. All group members may aggressively charge intruders, including boats with humans in them.|$|E
5|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> shows {{a variety}} of adaptations {{suitable}} to an amphibious lifestyle, including exceptionally dense fur, a wing-like tail, and webbed feet. The species prefers freshwater rivers and streams, which are usually seasonally flooded, and may also take to freshwater lakes and springs. It constructs extensive campsites close to feeding areas, clearing large amounts of vegetation. The <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> subsists almost exclusively on a diet of fish, particularly characins and catfish, but may also eat crabs, turtles, snakes and small caiman. It has no serious natural predators other than humans, although it must compete with other species, including the neotropical otter and caiman species, for food resources.|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> {{excavate}} dens for breeding and resting. One family of <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> which we have observed on the Brazilian Pantanal, also use a long cave in a rocky cliff, particularly when raising cubs. The cave is not above the highest flood level, but does not usually flood, unlike excavated dens, which are very susceptible to flooding. Nearby caves were used by Neotropical Otters (Lontra longicaudis) and Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) ...|$|R
40|$|According to the "social {{intelligence}} hypothesis," {{species with}} complex social interactions have more sophisticated communication systems. <b>Giant</b> <b>otters</b> (Pteronura brasiliensis) live in groups with complex social interactions.

The objectives of the current study were to describe the airborne vocal repertoire of <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> in the Pantanal area of Brazil, to analyze call types within different behavioral contexts, and to correlate vocal complexity with level of sociability of mustelids to verify whether or not the result supports the social intelligence hypothesis. The behavior of nine <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> groups was observed. Vocalizations recorded were acoustically and statistically analyzed to describe the species' repertoire. The repertoire was comprised by 15 sound types emitted in different behavioral contexts. The main behavioral contexts of each sound type were significantly associated with the acoustic variable ordination of different sound types. A strong correlation between vocal complexity and sociability was found for different species, suggesting that the communication systems observed in the family mustelidae support the social intelligence hypothesis.

5|$|Adult giant otters {{living in}} family groups have no known serious natural predators, however {{there are some}} {{accounts}} of black caimans in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on giant otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by the jaguar, cougar, and anaconda, but {{this is based on}} historical reports, not direct observation. Pups are more vulnerable, and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a <b>giant</b> <b>otter,</b> as evidenced by scarring on individuals.|$|E
5|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to the present species, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> shares the South American continent with three of the four members of the New World Lontra genus of otters: the neotropical river otter, the southern river otter, and the marine otter. (The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) is the fourth Lontra member.) The <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> seems to have evolved independently of Lontra in South America, despite the overlap. The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) of Asia may be its closest extant relative; similar behaviour, vocalizations, and skull morphology have been noted. Both species also show strong pair bonding and paternal engagement in rearing cubs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> is {{a highly}} social animal and lives in {{extended}} family groups. Group sizes are anywhere from two to 20 members, but likely average between three and eight.

5|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> is an {{especially}} noisy animal, with a complex repertoire of vocalizations. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> {{may be the most}} vocal. Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick hah barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of nonhostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn pups squeak to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities. An analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in neonates.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the diet of <b>giant</b> <b>otters,</b> Pteronura brasiliensis (Zimmermann, 1780) in the Balbina reservoir (01 º 55 'S, 59 º 29 'W), to compare it with literature data on the diet of <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> from non-dammed areas, and to verify {{the effects of the}} seasonal changes in water levels on the feeding habits of Balbina otters. A total of 254 feces samples were collected and identified according to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Teleostei fish were present in 100 % of the samples; two samples also presented monkey fur (n = 1) and sloth fur (n = 1), suggesting that the diet of P. brasiliensis, in the reservoir, is almost exclusively based on fish. Ten fish families were identified in our samples, six of which were exclusive to the Balbina Lake (not present in the diet of <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> from non-dammed areas). These six fish families, however, were present in less than 3 % of the samples. The fish families with highest representation in the diet of <b>giant</b> <b>otters</b> from non-dammed areas also appeared with higher frequencies in the Balbina Lake, suggesting that the otters have not changed their diet substantially after the implementation of the reservoir. During the high-water period, when the fish are dispersed into the flooded forest and are not very easy to catch, the otters seem to have an opportunistic feeding habit. By contrast, during the low-water period, when prey items are widely available and easier to catch in the reservoir, their feeding habits are more selective...|$|R
40|$|Commercial hunting was {{determinant}} in {{the disappearance}} of <b>giant</b> river <b>otters</b> along areas of historical occurrence in the Brazilian Amazonia.

Four years of field surveys were carried out to confirm the presence of <b>giant</b> river <b>otters</b> in the area and to assess local threats to the species. Information on the human impact on this otter population was compiled based on 83 interviews with residents. Areas of overlap used by both otters and humans resulted in negative interactions. The identified threats included: perception of otters as competitors for subsistence fisheries; conversion of natural areas into annual crops; removal of cubs to be raised as pets; and potential disease transmission from domestic animals. Mitigation and monitoring of these threats are paramount for the maintenance of <b>giant</b> river <b>otters</b> in the area...|$|R
5|$|The {{species can}} hunt singly, in pairs, and in groups, relying on sharp {{eyesight}} to locate prey. In some cases, supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental, {{a result of}} group members fishing individually in close proximity; truly coordinated hunting may only occur where the prey cannot be taken by a single <b>giant</b> <b>otter,</b> such as with small anacondas and juvenile black caiman. The <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> seems to prefer prey fish that are generally immobile on river bottoms in clear water. Prey chase is rapid and tumultuous, with lunges and twists through the shallows and few missed targets. The otter can attack from both above and below, swiveling at the last instant to clamp the prey in its jaws. Giant otters catch their own food and consume it immediately; they grasp the fish firmly between the forepaws and begin eating noisily at the head. Carter and Rosas have found captive adult animals consume around 10% of their body weight daily—about , in keeping with findings in the wild.|$|E
5|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>otter</b> muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, the <b>giant</b> <b>otter</b> {{interacts with}} {{indigenous}} groups, who often practice traditional hunting and fishing.
