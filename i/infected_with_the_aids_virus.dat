40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel approach, termed the ‘phage amplification assay’, for the rapid detection and identification of specific bacteria. The technique {{is based on}} the phage lytic cycle with plaque formation as the assay end-point. It is highly sensitive, quantitative and gives results typically within 4 h. The assay comprises four main stages : (1) phage infection of target bacterium; (2) destruction of exogenous phage; (3) amplification of phage within infected host and (4) plaque formation from <b>infected</b> host <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> of helper bacteria. A key component of this assay is a potent virucidal agent derived from natural plant extracts, pomegranate rind extract (PRE). In combination with ferrous sulphate PRE can bring about an 11 log-cycle reduction in phage titre within 3 min. This is achieved without any injury to the infected target bacteria. Subsequently, any resulting plaques are derived only from infected target organisms. Data are presented for a range of bacterial hosts including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. The detection limit for Ps. aeruginosa was 40 bacteria ml− 1 in a time of 4 h and 600 bacteria m− 1 for Salm. typhimurium. Application of the principles of this technology to other bacterial genera is discussed...|$|R

Even though <b>the</b> leafhopper is <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> virus, the virus does not replicate within the leafhopper and causes no harm to them. BCTV cannot {{be passed on to}} their offspring. The only way for offsprings to be <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> virus is if they fed on any plants <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> BCTV. Once the beet leafhoppers ingest the virus, it moves from their digestive tract to the salivary glands. Once the infected leafhoppers migrate and feed on healthy plants, they transmit the virus by eating the phloem. The infected beet leafhoppers are able to infect various plants {{for the rest of their}} lifetime.|$|R

Other estimates place the rate as high as 5 percent in the urban population and 3 percent in rural regions.

While working in Centocor, Tse Wen Chang invented this technology in 1983. When the Changs were setting up Tanox in 1986, they bought the rights on these antibody matrix patents from Centocor to help formulate their first business plan. Tanox made efforts to develop “immunosorbent cytometry” methodology to determine the immunocyte profile, such as the concentrations and proportions of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in blood, for monitoring the immune status of individuals <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>virus,</b> human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which was causing expanding epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the anti-IgE program and other therapeutic antibody programs eventually absorbed all resources Tanox had, and the antibody matrix program was not pursued further.|$|E

40|$|Live {{vaccines}} containing attenuated parasite strains {{are increasingly}} {{used to control}} chicken coccidiosis. In this paper antibody responses elicited by infections with wild-type and attenuated strains of Eimeria tenella and E. necatrix were characterized by immunoblotting and ELISA with homologous and heterologous antisera. Few differences between antisera from birds <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> wild and attenuated strains of E. tenella were evident in immunoblots conducted with merozoite antigen preparations from both E. tenella strains, however the reactivity of sera raised in birds <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wild-type strain was noticeably more intense. In ELISAs conducted with merozoite antigen preparations, antisera from birds <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wild-type strains of E. tenella and E. necatrix consistently produced a significantly higher (P < 0. 05) antibody response than antisera from birds <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> attenuated strains. Likewise, avidity ELISAs conducted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> E. tenella strains demonstrated that antibodies in birds <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wild-type strain were of significantly higher avidity (P < 0. 05) than antibodies in birds <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> attenuated strain. The differences in the antibody responses are probably due {{to changes in the}} attenuated strain as a result of selection for precocious development and the less severe tissue damage and inflammation of the intestine resulting from infection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> attenuated strain...|$|R
