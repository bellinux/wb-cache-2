40|$|Introduction Within DAI and {{the game}} {{theoretical}} literature a fundamental question is often posed: Given bounded rationality and knowledge, what conditions produce cooperative and/or altruistic interagent behaviour? One line of enquiry involves the application of simple learning rules within game theoretic environments (Liebrand & Messick 1996). This approach assumes that agents are individual satisficing learners. Another approach applies selective mimicry from a spatial "neighbourhood" based on maximum payoff (Nowak & May 1992). Although elegant, and able to produce cooperation, neither can produce sustained altruism - where individual needs are driven by {{the needs of a}} group to the <b>individuals</b> <b>detriment.</b> Here, a fresh perspective on cooperation is applied which is a synthesis of these two approaches yet moves beyond them. A "memetic" (Bura 1994, Dennett 1995, Hales 1997) approach is developed which takes it's inspiration from theories concerning the cultural evolu...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of individuals or communities {{different from the}} prevalent religious, ethnic, linguistic, political or sexual groups {{has always been one}} of the most problematic issues faced by national States. The liberal conception of State privileges <b>individual</b> in <b>detriment</b> of collective entities as a subject of right, excluding a priori community rights. Historical linguistic groups represent one of the most ancient and complicated questions for testing the capacity of a National State to manage domestic differences, since they have been seen as a threat to the process of unification and nationalization of the masses and individualization of the right. ...|$|R

Simon Chesterman writes, as always, with compelling clarity and authority." ...|$|R
50|$|The pro-cure {{perspective}} {{is a view}} of autism as a disorder characterized by various impairments, mostly in communication and social interaction. Although positive traits such as savant syndrome may be recognized, they are not seen as outweighing the negatives. Pro-cure organizations generally favor the medical model of disability with regards to autism. They believe that the atypical behaviors of autistic <b>individuals</b> are a <b>detriment</b> to those individuals' success, both socially and professional, and should therefore be reduced or eliminated through therapy. Autistic people's life experiences are viewed as sub-standard and a burden to their caretakers.|$|R
5000|$|Bohannan and Dalton {{argue that}} these {{societal}} restrictions exist in traditional egalitarian societies in order to inhibit the accumulation of wealth by a few <b>individuals,</b> to the <b>detriment</b> of the community. Trading restrictions that prevent the exchange of wealth objects {{in the hands of}} only a few for other kinds of goods ensures the availability of subsistence goods for all of the group's members. Sillitoe adds that the highly valued [...] "wealth" [...] items (such as the brass rods in the Tiv example) are not locally produced, hence politically ambitious leaders cannot step up their production of these goods thereby maintaining an egalitarian social order.|$|R

METHODSAn exploratory study with qualitative thematic analysis of data, based on conceptual aspects of care and the right to health, from semi-structured interviews with 20 adolescent mothers ascribed by Family Health teams. RESULTSMaternal reports indicate that child health care requires responsibility and protection, with health practices that promote child advocacy. Gaps in assistance which preclude the full guarantee of the right to child health care were also highlighted. CONCLUSIONThe right to health care assumed different meanings, and the forms to guarantee them were linked to <b>individual</b> behavior in <b>detriment</b> to broader actions that consider health as a social product, connected to the guarantee of other fundamental rights...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Tissue {{weighting}} factors, w[subscript T], used {{to convert}} equivalent dose to effective dose, account {{for differences in}} radiosensitivity of various organs {{in the human body}} and allow users to compare <b>individual</b> organ <b>detriment</b> to whole body risk. They are explicitly calculated in ICRP 26, 60, and 103, although the methods of calculation, as well as the weighting factors themselves, vary greatly between reports. The ICRP 26 report bases its weighting factors solely on fatal cancer risk for eleven organs, whereas ICRP 60 and 103 use detriment (with unique definitions in each report) to calculate the tissue weighting factors for twenty‐two and twenty‐eight organs, respectively. Each new report introduces levels of uncertainty into the calculation of w[subscript T], which ultimately may reduce the significance of individual weighting factors. A review of the three calculational methods used in ICRP 26, 60, and 103 is covered, as well as an examination of the uncertainties introduced by each weighting factor parameter utilized in ICRP 103 and the total uncertainties of the various w[subscript T] values. Finally, the effective dose is calculated for several exposure scenarios using the ICRP 26 and 60 methodologies for comparison to ICRP 103 effective dose calculation and uncertainties thereof...|$|R

40|$|Violence, in some form, {{has always}} been present in human history, {{assuming}} different characteristics in different social and economic contexts. It {{is the focus of}} the subject discussed in this article 1, above all in contemporary urban capitalist society. Based on a history of criminal law, this paper analyzes the central place of the concept of the criminal during the history of modern society. Based on the observed data the article reflects on the eruption of <b>individual</b> violence in <b>detriment</b> to other forms of violence present in the capitalist social order. It examines how the processes of criminalization and social control employed by the state apparatus elect a common enemy to be combated: the delinquent. Supported by critical criminology theory, it discusses the contributions of these ideas to Social Work and how social workers can use them in their education and professional activity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we criticize the constructivist movement, which {{according}} to our view has overestimated the role of <b>individual</b> constructions, in <b>detriment</b> to the ontological dimension of scientific knowledge. It will be developed based on some critical papers directed to the constructivist movement and on {{an analysis of the}} reception of Thomas Kuhn's ideas by research in science teaching. One of our conclusions will suggest that constructivism does not place enough emphasis in the grasping of a reality that is associated to the physical world. That ends up reflecting a weakening of scientific knowledge in face of other forms of knowledge., establishing a kind of epistemological relativism among the various forms of knowing. In this sense, we present Mario Bunge's ideas on the role of models in science and their linkages to reality. Thus, we aim at minimizing the excesses contained in constructivist and realist theses, that is, the trend to view each human construction as an activity that does not have any links to the ontological dimension of the world, and to see all realism as a purge of human action...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} of birds in flocks, once the winter has arrived, and the maintaining of this status until spring, when bird flocks split to form pairs, {{as well as}} the rituals of reproduction are all biological rhythms so ordinary for people that they are perceived as facts and do not rise a particular interest for study. This certainly associates randomness with the fly of the flock in search for food, search made until the revival of the Nature when the individual can distinguish himself, without the help of the heard, and this because the environment has become better, assuring the survival by itself. This is how far the knowledge in this area of study goes. Present day studies – especially over seas ones – approach either the monospecific associations (in order to establish the relations between individuals), the polispecific ones, especially aquatic, or the link between these associations and the abiotic factors. There are few or no studies at all concerning the minor polispecific associations of birds from a skirt of a forest, what causes them, etc. In this area of study the interest was focused on the <b>individuals</b> phenomena, in <b>detriment</b> of the global one; in fact, the global one actually represents the erratic hyemal flock and it caused a limited approach to this issue...|$|R
40|$|The 3 rd IRT International Scientific Conference {{will take}} place in Egypt from Saturday 24 th to Monday 26 th of October 2009. The Conference, {{promoted}} by the Helwan University, is organized by ARCES University College, the Research Center CRUEC and the Embassy of Italy in Egypt with the cooperation of the Palermo University. The theme of the conference regards the development and the territories of the Mediterranean in an Integrated Relational Tourism approach, while respecting the cultural and environmental sustainability. For some years the process of globalization has been creating a standardization in the consumption and the behaviour of <b>individuals,</b> to the <b>detriment</b> of local identities. The imposition of external models has led to the subsequent abandonment of certain traditional and cultural values in many regions of the world. The concentration of the population in cities has increased while areas in the interior have lost their value, especially their economic worth. These territories have progressively gone from being functional to the economy of urban areas (primary sector) to becoming indifferent containers of inconvenient functions or ”something else”. IRT can be realized through an active participation of all the key players of local development such as government offices, businesses and local communities. The Conference by a multy-disciplinary approach to tourism, aims to give prominence to the awakened territory, whose three main challenges are a territorial re-alignment of the economies, a re-assessment of the cultural identity and a recomposition of social group...|$|R
60|$|When men {{proceed in}} this {{irregular}} mode, the first contributor {{is apt to}} grow peevish with his neighbors. He is but too well disposed to measure their means by his own envy, and not by the real state of their fortunes, which he can rarely know, and which it may in them {{be an act of}} the grossest imprudence to reveal. Hence the odium and lassitude with which people will look upon a provision for the public which is bought by discord at the expense of social quiet. Hence the bitter heart-burnings, and the war of tongues, which is so often the prelude to other wars. Nor is it every contribution, called voluntary, which is according to the free will of the giver. A false shame, or a false glory, against his feelings and his judgment, may tax an <b>individual</b> to the <b>detriment</b> of his family and in wrong of his creditors. A pretence of public spirit may disable him from the performance of his private duties; it may disable him even from paying the legitimate contributions which he is to furnish according to the prescript of law. But what is the most dangerous of all is that malignant disposition to which this mode of contribution evidently tends, and which at length leaves the comparatively indigent to judge of the wealth, and to prescribe to the opulent, or those whom they conceive to be such, the use they are to make of their fortunes. From thence it is but one step to the subversion of all property.|$|R
40|$|It {{seems to}} be a human {{attribute}} to want to know about things. Is there life on other planets? What lies beyond the beach of this newly discovered land? Why are these Galapagos finches so similar to each other, yet so different? What might have been the body temperature of dinosaurs? What is it about camels that makes them so good in the desert? How can crocodiles live in salt water, and how do their hearts work? What are echidnas doing on Thredbo 2 ̆ 7 s ski slopes in mid winter? Answering some of these questions has involved "use of wildlife" in the sense I take the symposium title to mean: an invasive procedure of some sort, with the animal either released or killed subsequently. The title of this paper, which was given to me, might imply that the onus is on the researcher to justify a project which involves the use of wildlife. Perhaps the question should be "Why NOT conduct research on wildlife?" or, better, "WHEN NOT conduct research on wildlife?", in which case the answer might be "when the population will be harmed, and when the work cannot be conducted humanely". Some research, however, which may be necessary for proper management, results in treatment to animals which may not be humane. For example, testing a virus for control of cane toads or rabbits, or checking that chlamydia really does harm koalas, all require the experimental infection of healthy <b>individuals,</b> to their <b>detriment.</b> Developing immunocontraception to eradicate possums from New Zealand, if it were possible, would be biologically desirable but would likely involve experiments causing individual harm. Thus, assessment of what harm is acceptable is usually subjective, will differ in different contexts, and different researchers will draw the line at different places. Ethics committees are particularly valuable for these difficult issues because they force researchers to focus on the ethical implications of their research. I will argue that, even though interaction between wild species is more about predation than respect, respect and care for other animals is a worthy human aspiration, that we should extend this care to all other animals, native and exotic, captive and free, that judgment of the scientific merit of research is more the province of funding bodies than ethics committees, and that ethics committees should focus primarily on assessment of probable pain and suffering rather than on philosophy...|$|R
60|$|For, {{what is the}} {{peculiar}} character of the modern world--the difference which chiefly distinguishes modern institutions, modern social ideas, modern life itself, from those of times long past? It is, {{that human beings are}} no longer born to their place in life, and chained down by an inexorable bond to the place they are born to, but are free to employ their faculties, and such favourable chances as offer, to achieve the lot which may appear to them most desirable. Human society of old was constituted on a very different principle. All were born to a fixed social position, and were mostly kept in it by law, or interdicted from any means by which they could emerge from it. As some men are born white and others black, so some were born slaves and others freemen and citizens; some were born patricians, others plebeians; some were born feudal nobles, others commoners and roturiers. A slave or serf could never make himself free, nor, except by the will of his master, become so. In most European countries it was not till towards the close of the middle ages, and {{as a consequence of the}} growth of regal power, that commoners could be ennobled. Even among nobles, the eldest son was born the exclusive heir to the paternal possessions, and a long time elapsed before it was fully established that the father could disinherit him. Among the industrious classes, only those who were born members of a guild, or were admitted into it by its members, could lawfully practise their calling within its local limits; and nobody could practise any calling deemed important, in any but the legal manner--by processes authoritatively prescribed. Manufacturers have stood in the pillory for presuming to carry on their business by new and improved methods. In modern Europe, and most in those parts of it which have participated most largely in all other modern improvements, diametrically opposite doctrines now prevail. Law and government do not undertake to prescribe by whom any social or industrial operation shall or shall not be conducted, or what modes of conducting them shall be lawful. These things are left to the unfettered choice of individuals. Even the laws which required that workmen should serve an apprenticeship, have in this country been repealed: there being ample assurance that in all cases in which an apprenticeship is necessary, its necessity will suffice to enforce it. The old theory was, that the least possible should be left to the choice of the individual agent; that all he had to do should, as far as practicable, be laid down for him by superior wisdom. Left to himself he was sure to go wrong. The modern conviction, the fruit of a thousand years of experience, is, that things in which the individual is the person directly interested, never go right but as they are left to his own discretion; and that any regulation of them by authority, except to protect the rights of others, is sure to be mischievous. This conclusion, slowly arrived at, and not adopted until almost every possible application of the contrary theory had been made with disastrous result, now (in the industrial department) prevails universally in the most advanced countries, almost universally in all that have pretensions to any sort of advancement. It is not that all processes are supposed to be equally good, or all persons to be equally qualified for everything; but that freedom of individual choice is now known to be the only thing which procures the adoption of the best processes, and throws each operation into the hands of those who are best qualified for it. Nobody thinks it necessary to make a law that only a strong-armed man shall be a blacksmith. Freedom and competition suffice to make blacksmiths strong-armed men, because the weak-armed can earn more by engaging in occupations for which they are more fit. In consonance with this doctrine, it is felt to be an overstepping of the proper bounds of authority to fix beforehand, on some general presumption, that certain persons are not fit to do certain things. It is now thoroughly known and admitted that if some such presumptions exist, no such presumption is infallible. Even if it be well grounded in a majority of cases, which it is very likely not to be, there will be a minority of exceptional cases in which it does not hold: and in those it is both an injustice to the <b>individuals,</b> and a <b>detriment</b> to society, to place barriers in the way of their using their faculties for their own benefit and for that of others. In the cases, on the other hand, in which the unfitness is real, the ordinary motives of human conduct will on the whole suffice to prevent the incompetent person from making, or from persisting in, the attempt.|$|R
