Steel wheels were both stronger and cheaper to manufacture, and could be painted any color the owner desired.|$|R

40|$|A wheel {{assembly}} for an electric vehicle includes a <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> that is concentrically disposed about a central axis. A propulsion-braking module is disposed within an interior {{region of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>rim.</b> The propulsion-braking module rotatably supports the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> for rotation about the central axis. The propulsion-braking module includes a liquid cooled electric motor having a rotor rotatable about the central axis, and a stator disposed radially inside the rotor relative to the central axis. A motor-wheel interface hub is fixedly attached to the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim,</b> and is directly attached to the rotor for rotation with the rotor. The motor-wheel interface hub directly transmits torque from the electric motor to the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> at a 1 : 1 ratio.

40|$|Beneficial, as-manufactured, {{residual}} {{compressive stresses}} in <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> are introduced during the rim quenching operation. Such compressive stresses {{are known to}} help inhibit the formation of rim fatigue cracks and thus are important to wheel safety. This paper describes measurements of stresses in new <b>wheel</b> <b>rims</b> at a wrought wheel manufacturing facility, and also use of rim stress measurement for used wheels on the French National Railways (SNCF) and Belgian National Railways (SNCB). Ultrasonic stress measurements made using commercially available Electro-Magnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) and Piezo-Electric Transducer (PET) systems are described. The implications of <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> residual stress on wheel service performance {{and the potential for}} use of <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> residual stress measurement techniques in North America are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} detect leaks {{on the surface of}} a <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> manufactured by aluminum die casting and forging. Leaks in the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> may be caused by temperature gradient differences during the cooling period, impurities, or flowing air bubbles in the die casting process. We developed a new low-cost approach to detect leaks that only required a short inspection time by observing the movement of soap bubbles on the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> surface. We designed new light sources to minimize mirror image effects and irregular luminance distributions on the curved <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> surface. A preprocessing procedure for image processing was also developed to determine the bubble configurations using threshold and morphology techniques. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the inspection system. The results demonstrated that leaks generated during the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> manufacturing process could be accurately detected even under various environmental lighting conditions...|$|R
