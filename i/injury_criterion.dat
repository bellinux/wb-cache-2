50|$|Crashworthiness is {{the ability}} of a {{structure}} to protect its occupants during an impact. This is commonly tested when investigating the safety of aircraft and vehicles. Depending {{on the nature of the}} impact and the vehicle involved, different criteria are used to determine the crashworthiness of the structure. Crashworthiness may be assessed either prospectively, using computer models (e.g., LS-DYNA, PAM-CRASH, MSC Dytran, MADYMO) or experiments, or retrospectively by analyzing crash outcomes. Several criteria are used to assess crashworthiness prospectively, including the deformation patterns of the vehicle structure, the acceleration experienced by the vehicle during an impact, and the probability of injury predicted by human body models. Injury probability is defined using criteria, which are mechanical parameters (e.g., force, acceleration, or deformation) that correlate with injury risk. A common <b>injury</b> <b>criterion</b> is the Head impact criterion (HIC). Crashworthiness is assessed retrospectively by analyzing injury risk in real-world crashes, often using regression or other statistical techniques to control for the myriad of confounders that are present in crashes.|$|E

"The chassis of the Wheldon's#77 {{impacted}} a post {{along the}} right-side {{of the tub}} and created a deep defect in the tub that extended from the pedal bulkhead, along the upper border of the tub, and through the cockpit. As the race car passed by, the pole intruded into the cockpit and made contact with the drivers' helmet and head. Dan's injury was limited to his head injury. Dan appeared to suffer two distinct head forces. The first head force created a level of Head <b>Injury</b> <b>Criterion,</b> {{also known as a}} HIC number, that normally does not produce any injury. During the initial crash sequence, the accident data recorder measured 12 or 13 impacts. During that timeframe one of those impacts measured a measurable HIC number for Dan - that's the number that does not normally cause injury. The number was low enough. The second force was a physical impact, and it was the second force that caused a non-survivable blunt force injury trauma to Dan's head."

40|$|Rotational {{acceleration}} of the head {{is known to be}} the cause of traumatic brain injuries. It was hypothesized that by introducing anisotropy in a foam liner in head protection applications, for example, protective helmets, rotational acceleration transmitted to the head can be further mitigated. Therefore, composite foam with a cylinder/matrix configuration with anisotropy at “macro level” is proposed as a smart structural solution to replace single layer foam headliners of the same weight and thickness. In this paper, a parametric study on the cylinder/matrix configuration is performed and the results are compared with these of single layer expanded polystyrene foam. The structure is subsequently optimized for the best performance in mitigation of rotational acceleration and velocity. Oblique impact results show that the parameters such as the number of cylinders in a given structure, and the compliance of the matrix foam significantly affect the extent of rotational acceleration and velocity mitigation. Optimized composite foam configurations are subsequently proposed and they demonstrate a mitigation of rotational acceleration and velocity up to 44 and 19 %, respectively.

40|$|In car–pedestrian accidents, lateral bending and {{shearing}} kinematics {{have been}} identified as principal injury mechanisms causing permanent disabilities and impairments to the knee joint. Regarding the combined lateral bending and shearing contributions of knee joint kinematics, developing a coupled knee <b>injury</b> <b>criterion</b> is necessary for improving vehicle countermeasures to mitigate pedestrian knee injuries. The advantages of both experimental tests and finite element (FE) simulations were combined to determine the reliable injury tolerances of the knee joint. First, 7 isolated lower limb tests from postmortem human subjects (PMHS) were reported, with dynamic loading at a velocity of 20 km/h. With the intention of replicating relevant injury mechanisms of vehicle–pedestrian impacts, the experimental tests were categorized into 3 groups by the impact locations on the tibia: the distal end to prioritize pure bending, the middle diaphysis to have combined bending and shearing effects, and the proximal end to acquire pure shearing. Then, the corresponding FE model was employed to provide an additional way to determine exact injury occurrences and develop a robust knee <b>injury</b> <b>criterion</b> by the variation in both the lateral bending and shearing contributions through a sensitivity analysis of impact locations. Considering the experimental test results and the subsequent sensitivity analysis of FE simulations, both the tolerances and patterns of knee joint injuries were determined to be influenced by impact locations due to various combined contributions of lateral bending and shearing. Both medial collateral ligament and cruciate ligament failures were noted as the onsets of knee injuries, namely, initial injuries. Finally, a new <b>injury</b> <b>criterion</b> categorized by initial injury patterns of knee joint was proposed by coupling lateral bending and shearing levels. The developed <b>injury</b> <b>criterion</b> correlated the combined joint kinematics to initial knee injuries based on subsegment tests andFEsimulations conductedwith a biofidelic lower limbmodel.

We validate the proposed BIC limits against (i) the critical limit HIC 15 = 700, (ii) the Diffuse Axonal Injury Tolerance Criterion (DAITC) for head rotations that has been derived from the K-V model and from experiments with animal brains, and (iii) recent experimental data on strain levels leading to permanent neuronal damage.

40|$|A {{review of}} a few Swedish {{research}} projects on soft tissue neck injuries in car collisions is presented together with some new results. Efforts to determine neck injury mechanisms {{was based on a}} hypothesis stating that injuries to the nerve root region in the cervical spine are a result of transient pressure gradients in the spinal canal during rapid neck bending. In experimental neck trauma research on animals, pressure gradients were observed and indications of nerve cell membrane dysfunction were found in the cervical spinal ganglia. The experiments covered neck extension, flexion and lateral bending. A theoretical model in which fluid flow was predicted to cause the transient pressure gradients was developed and a neck <b>injury</b> <b>criterion</b> based on Navier-Stokes Equations was applied on the flow model. The theory behind the Neck <b>Injury</b> <b>Criterion</b> indicates that the neck injury occurs early on in the rearward motion of the head relative to the torso in a rear-end collision.
