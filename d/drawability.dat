50|$|A classic form of sheetforming is deep drawing, {{which is}} done by drawing a sheet {{by means of a}} punch tool {{pressing}} on the inner region of the sheet, whereas the side material held by a blankholder can be drawn toward the center. It has been observed that materials with outstanding deep <b>drawability</b> behave anisotropically (see: anisotropy). Plastic deformation in the surface is much more pronounced than in the thickness. The lankford coefficient (r) is a specific material property indicating the ratio between width deformation and thickness deformation in the uniaxial tensile test. Materials with very good deep <b>drawability</b> have an r value of 2 or below. The positive aspect of formability with respect to the forming limit curve (forming limit diagram) is seen in the deformation paths of the material that are concentrated in the extreme left of the diagram, where the forming limits become very large.|$|E

These studies are a continuation of experiences in presenting the characteristics of technological plasticity of strips made of magnesium alloy which have been cast between rolls in vertical and horizontal systems called ‘twin-roll casting’. In the context of previous experiments conducted at the Institute of Material Technology of the Silesian University of Technology in cooperation with the Technical University - Bergakademie Freiberg (Germany), <b>drawability</b> of these strips at elevated temperatures has been comprehensively defined while using forming limit curves. Due to low formability of magnesium alloys at ambient temperature, formability tests - including cup forming tests presented in this paper - have been carried out in heated dies at temperature range of 200 °C to 350 °C.

Forming of {{titanium}} sheets, especially {{titanium alloy}} sheets, {{is very difficult}} due to low <b>drawability</b> caused by a high ratio of the yield point to the tensile strength Re/Rm, usually more than 90 %. Although <b>drawability</b> of titanium sheets can be enhanced by forming at elevated temperatures it is avoided due to the high costs and difficulties associated with {{the operation of the}} process. Therefore the authors have developed an unconventional stamping method allowing for forming of almost unworkable materials at ambient temperature, such as Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy.

40|$|Polypropylene {{homopolymer}} melts containing up to 50 {{percent by}} weight of talc filler (24 vol%) were tested on a Gottfert Rheotens melt strength testing unit. Melt strength and <b>drawability</b> parameters were measured from these tests to evaluate changes in the extensional behavior of the melt induced by filler addition. It {{was found that the}} melt strength of the polypropylene was decreased for talc additions of less than 40 wt% (17. 5 vol%) under all test conditions. Addition of 50 wt% talc improved the melt strength under all testing conditions. <b>Drawability,</b> defined as the stretch ratio at strand break, decreased with increased filler loading. The melt strength of all materials was found to decrease with increased temperature within the range 180 [degrees]C to 210 [degrees]C. The melt strength of all melts showed dependence on the test extrusion rate, and this dependence was well described by an exponential relationship. Highest dependencies were seen for the unfilled and 50 wt% talc-filled polymer. While it was found that addition of 50 wt% talc provided improvement in melt strength, high melt strength alone was a poor indicator of the melt processability, as <b>drawability</b> was also regarded as an important consideration...|$|E

The process has a simple tooling set in which a circular blank can be easily deformed by a flat headed square punch through a conical die with a square aperture. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to study the influences of the geometric parameters on the formability of square cup {{in order to find}} out the optimum setup dimensions of the present process. The effects of die fillet radius, die corner radius, die throat length, punch profile radius; punch corner radius, punch shape factor, relative die clearance and blank thickness on the <b>drawability</b> of square cup were mainly investigated. Cup <b>drawability</b> was also studied with the change of material strain hardening exponent, n, strength coefficient, K, average anisotropy, R, and friction coefficients between die-sheet-punch to find the best operating conditions. The limiting drawing ratio (LDR) was used to evaluate the effects of all these parameters on the square cup <b>drawability.</b> The LDR's, maximum drawing loads, cup thickness, cup height and modes of failure were predicted. The analysis reveals that the determination of the optimum setup dimensions of our developed process has increased the drawing ratio up to 3. 1 for brass alloy (67 / 33 Cu-Zn) and 3. 15 for aluminum (Al 99. 5 w) in a single-drawing stroke. Experiments have been also done in order to compare and verify the FE-predictions. Successful square cups with drawing ratio of 3. 07 for brass and 2. 93 for aluminum were produced.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years {{research}} activities have been focused on the modification of fiber properties with nano-scaled additives. One of the most important fields of research is the alteration of mechanical properties such as the tenacity and the specific breaking load. In this study, we determined the influence of nano-phyllosilicates on the <b>drawability</b> of polyamide 6 multifilament yarns. It was first demonstrated that the <b>drawability</b> of the fibers drastically increased in an industrially relevant high-speed melt spinning process. Structural properties of the material are identified by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Changes in the crystalline properties {{as well as in the}} alignment of the silicates are compared with the stress–strain curves of the fibers, and a molecular mechanism for the drawing process is derived from these experiments. In a first step, a significant phase transition in the crystalline structure unaffected by the silicates occurs for low draw ratios (DRs). Beyond this point, where unmodified fibers start to break, a gliding between the silicate layers takes place, which is responsible for an extended <b>drawability</b> of the fibers. This mechanism leads to new possibilities for fiber processing, which can be used to research ultra-fine filaments in future studies...|$|E

In particular, Limiting Drawing Ratio exhibits the peak value at 250 degrees C. As far as the effect of punch speed is concerned, it depends on temperature: at 200 degrees C <b>drawability</b> increases with decreasing punch speed whilst a reverse behaviour is observed at 250 and 300 degrees C.

40|$|Semi-crystalline {{polymers}} containing amorphous and crystalline regions {{usually have}} intimately mixed chains. The resulting topological constraints (entanglements) in the amorphous regions limit the <b>drawability</b> in the solid state. By controlled synthesis {{the number of}} entanglements can be reduced. Ultimately, crystals composed of single chains are feasible, where the chains are fully separated from each other. If such separation can be maintained in the melt a new melt state can be formed. Here we show that through slow and carefully controlled melting such polymer crystals form a heterogeneous melt with more entangled regions, where the chains are mixed, and less entangled ones, composed of individually separated chains. Chain reptation, required for the homogenization of the entanglement distribution, {{is found to be}} considerably hindered. The long-lived heterogeneous melt shows decreased melt viscosity and provides enhanced <b>drawability</b> on crystallization.

40|$|Detailed SEM {{work has}} shown that {{about a quarter of}} {{crystals}} belonging to the α fibre formed by cold rolling up to reductions of 85 %, are of uniform microstructure with relatively small misorientation. The remainder are indistinguishable from the polycrystalline mass, which is mostly of γ orientations. At rolling reductions above 85 %, α grains begin to split their orientations by deformation banding, thus producing lattice curvature which allows recrystallization of α {{at the expense of other}} α components in the same original grain. This α recrystallization deteriorates the deep <b>drawability</b> of IF steel and since the process requires deformation banding a natural explanation of the optimum rolling reduction for good <b>drawability</b> is provided. The best cold rolling reduction is that which optimizes γ recrystallization by producing deformation banding in γ components without producing deformation banding in α components. Uniform microstructures and small lattice curvature allows α to be consumed by other orientations, and this condition is obtained in the 80 - 85 % cold rolling range. © 2004 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|We {{consider}} planar upward {{drawings of}} directed graphs on arbitrary surfaces where the upward direction {{is defined by}} a vector field. This generalizes earlier approaches using surfaces with a fixed embedding in R 3 and introduces new classes of planar upward drawable graphs, where some of them even allow cycles.

In particular, we show the coincidence of the classes of planar upward drawable graphs on the sphere and on the standing cylinder. These classes coincide with the classes of planar upward drawable graphs with a homogeneous field on a cylinder and with a radial field in the plane. A cyclic field in the plane introduces the new class RUP of upward drawable graphs, which can be embedded on a rolling cylinder. We establish strict inclusions for planar upward <b>drawability</b> on the plane, the sphere, the rolling cylinder, and the torus, even for acyclic graphs.

40|$|Friction aided {{deep drawing}} {{based on the}} Maslennikov process is {{investigated}} as a method to facilitate the deep drawing of sheet metals with poor <b>drawability.</b> Aluminium foils and thin sheets of 0. 1 - 0. 4 nun in thickness are used {{as a model for}} the material with poor <b>drawability.</b> An auxiliary metal punch is used together with a polyurethane ring to increase the drawing efficiency and to improve the dimensional accuracy of the drawn cup. The effect of drawing conditions such as thickness, hole diameter and the hardness of the polyurethane ring on the cup height are mainly investigated. Also, the optimum number of drawing operations required to achieve a given drawing ratio is examined by repeating compression and unloading the polyurethane ring. The experimental results show that even for foil and thin sheets, deep cups with drawing ratios of 2. 25 and with good shape and dimensional accuracy can be obtained by repeating the drawing operation about ten times. The achievable drawing ratio is appreciably larger when compared with that obtained by the conventional deep drawing process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
