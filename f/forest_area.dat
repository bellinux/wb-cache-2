Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack the impression that the city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.|$|E
5|$|Initial public {{reaction}} to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens–Gifford Pinchot National <b>Forest</b> <b>area,</b> but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The United States Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.|$|E

Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea <b>Forest</b> <b>area</b> and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin disease are disproportionately prevalent.|$|E

On 1 April 2010, the Government of Tamil Nadu announced that it would initiate action to declare the sanctuary as a tiger reserve because of the consistent sighting of tigers in the <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> and the tiger reserve declaration would strengthen wildlife conservation efforts, as the sanctuary managers will get more financial support from the central government and the Government of India may also provide support to appoint an additional anti-poaching watchers and fund the establishment of anti-poaching camps.|$|E

25|$|Forestry has an {{important}} part {{to play in the}} amelioration of the conditions in semi-arid and arid lands. If properly planned, forestry can make {{an important}} contribution to the general welfare of the people living in desert areas. The living standard {{of the people in the}} desert is low. They can not afford other fuels like gas, kerosene etc. Fire wood is their main fuel, of the total consumption of wood about 75 percent is firewood. The forest cover in desert is low. Rajasthan has a <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> of 31150km2. which is about 9% of the geographical area. The <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> is mainly in southern districts of Rajasthan like Udaipur and Chittorgarh. The minimum <b>forest</b> <b>area</b> is in Churu district only 80km2. Thus the forest is insufficient to fulfill the needs of firewood and grazing in desert districts. This diverts the much needed cattledung from the field to the hearth. This in turn results into the decrease in agricultural production. Agroforestry model is best suited to the people of desert. Some Institutes have done good work in Agroforestry.|$|E
50|$|The <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> {{is divided}} into two zones, the Permanent Domain (PD) and the Rural Domain (RD). The PD {{consists}} of classified forests, national parks, and <b>forest</b> <b>areas.</b> This includes major <b>forested</b> <b>areas</b> made up of 231 classified <b>forest</b> <b>areas,</b> 9 national parks and 3 forest reserves, 7 semi-classified forests, and 51 unclassified <b>forests.</b> The total <b>area</b> of the national parks and reserves is 1,959,203 hectares. Forest exploitation activities are prohibited in the classified <b>forest</b> <b>areas,</b> which cover an estimated 4,196,000 hectares. However, for maintenance purposes, limited logging is permitted occasionally in classified forests, which amounted to 148,271 cu m in 2003. These forests are spread throughout the country in three zones: 31.8 percent in the humid dense forest in the south, 30.5 percent in the semi-deciduous forests of central Ivory Coast, and 33.7 percent in the savannah forests in the north. The RD, where logging is permitted, covers 66 percent of the total land area of Ivory Coast. However, the effective area forforestry production is estimated at 2.9 million hectares.|$|R

Agricultural and urban watersheds potentially produce more pollutantsthan <b>forested</b> <b>area.</b> It is considered that <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> has potential in storing and protecting water supply {{in such a way that}} water distribution and quality can be guaranteed. The objective of the study was to determine the relationship between the percentages of <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> in a watershed with the water quality. Thestudy was conducted in 2010 in GrojokanSewu Sub-watershed, Karanganyar District, Central Java. Using GIS (Geographic Information System), this sub-watershedwas divided into four sub-sub-watershedswith different percentages of <b>forested</b> <b>areas.</b> Water samples were collected in each sub-sub-watershedto find out the relationship between the <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> and the total dissolvedsolids, turbidity, sodium, nitrite, nitrate, sulfate and organic matters. The statistical analysis indicates relationships in quadratic form between sodium, nitrite, TDS, sulfate and organic matters with the percentage of <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> (R 2 = 0. 99, R 2 = 0. 99, R 2 = 0. 98, R 2 = 0. 95 and R 2 = 0. 77, respectively). The relationships are different from those of turbidity and nitrate that have low R 2 (R 2 = 0. 28 and R 2 = 0. 36) values. It implies that the <b>forested</b> <b>area</b> is capable to reduce sodium, nitrite, TDS, sulfate and organic matters, and thus water pollutants can be reduced by forest formation as it can filter water through retention of sediments and nutrients...|$|R
