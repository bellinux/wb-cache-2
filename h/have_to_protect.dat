Villagers earlier practiced shifting cultivation, growing millets such as raagi, thinai and kambu. Later the Forest Department forbade shifting cultivation and restricted cultivation to the allotted lands. The crops now are rice in rainy season and butter beans otherwise, though with a more diverse population a few vegetables such as eggplant and tomatoes are grown. Farmers here <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> their crops from wild elephants, gaur, wild boar, deer and sometimes peacocks. A complex and well maintained system of small canals distributes water from the Manalar to irrigate the fields.|$|E

The groans and screams of the dead people involved in this network of selfish schemer — Mir Mustafa Khan will form an eternal curse upon it, as long as the Talysh Mountains stand firm, the bitter mourning the unfortunate fate of the Talysh people.|$|E

500|$|Following the divestment, Walsh joined Grand Met's US-headquartered food {{division}} as CFO. In 1989, Grand Met {{used the}} proceeds from the Intercontinental sale to initiate a hostile takeover of Pillsbury, owner of the Green Giant and Häagen-Dazs brands, for $5.7 billion. The Grand Met offer was held by analysts to be a generous one for a struggling company that was under-performing in its industry. Walsh subsequently admitted to overvaluing the Green Giant vegetables division. Grand Met was attempting to diversify, and was attracted to Pillsbury's brands, which they believed held under-exploited potential for international growth. Writing in Businessweek, Mark Maremont accused Pillsbury of being [...] "lax" [...] in exploiting Häagen-Dazs' potential overseas. Walsh said: We thought Pillsbury had powerful brands, but it had kind of lost its way. We felt we could leverage its brands and its technologies. They had under-resourced their R and done {{a number of things}} to make the number, make the number. Cost reduction is a way of life, {{but you have to be}} responsible about it. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the seed today because that will be the tree that bears fruit in the future. I don't think Pillsbury had done that.|$|E

For the role of Elektra, many actresses were looked into with considerations including Penélope Cruz, Salma Hayek, Natalie Portman, Lucy Liu, Jessica Alba, and Katie Holmes. A short-list was eventually made, giving the choices of Jennifer Garner, Jolene Blalock, Mía Maestro and Rhona Mitra, with Garner finally becoming the actress to land the role. Garner said of the character, [...] "I think she's strong and cool and beautiful and smart. She'd be a good role model." [...] Garner noted the costume would be different, as Elektra in comics often wears red satin but in the film wears black leather. Garner explained, [...] "he red would never have worked for hiding a harness, and I know this sounds ridiculous, but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> your skin a little bit. They throw me around so much on the rooftop [...] I got cut through the leather, so imagine if I hadn't had anything." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the strike}} force was recovered, {{much of the}} Home Fleet sailed away from the Norwegian coast to refuel. A group {{comprising}} Formidable, Furious, two cruisers and several destroyers set a course for the two fleet oilers, and the escort carrier group withdrew so that the carriers could refuel their escorts. At 5:25 pm, Nabob {{was struck by a}} torpedo fired from U-354. The carrier suffered serious damage and 21 fatalities but was able to continue limited flight operations. Shortly afterwards U-354 torpedoed the frigate [...] as the latter searched for Nabobs attacker. Nabob was forced to return to the Home Fleet's base at Scapa Flow that evening, escorted by Trumpeter, a cruiser and several destroyers. Formidable and Furious covered their withdrawal; during this period Furious also refuelled from the Home Fleet's tankers. The departure of both escort carriers meant that the mine-dropping component of Operation Goodwood had to be cancelled. Bickertons stern was wrecked by the torpedo, and she could have potentially been salvaged. However, the force's commander did not want to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> two crippled ships, and the frigate was scuttled at around 8:30 pm on 22 August. Shortly after the attacks on Nabob and Bickerton, Seafires from 894 Naval Air Squadron shot down two German Blohm & Voss BV 138 reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Animal rights {{organization}} PETA accused the film's producers of using animals {{that had previously}} been abused. Two chimpanzees who appear in the movie, Cody and Sable, were surrendered by their owner to settle a lawsuit that documented allegations of beatings and mistreatment. The film's director, Tom Shadyac, said of PETA's criticisms [...] "They're not wrong. There's a certain amount of hypocrisy whenever you work with animals, even to show, which we hope we're showing, that respect of all of God's creation...I don't know. I respect their criticism." [...] PETA was also critical of Birds & Animals Unlimited, the primary animal supplier to the film, for alleged serious and continuing violations of the U.S. Animal Welfare Act, including failure to comply with veterinary care requirements and failure to provide shelter from heat and sunlight, which PETA details and claims it can document. A Universal Studios spokesperson declared: [...] "The live animals used in the filming of Evan Almighty were supplemented by a great number of computer-generated animals, {{but it would have been}} impossible to depend on CGI exclusively as some key scenes in the film demonstrate the need for peaceful and productive co-existence between man and animals. One of the most prominent, inescapable messages of the film is the responsibility that humans <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> and care for animals." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{allowing}} {{directors and}} writers {{to work within}} Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has [...] "big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but {{the way that you}} get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit." [...] For the Russos in The Winter Soldier, they {{had to deal with the}} idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. being infiltrated by Hydra, with Joe saying, [...] "how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film." [...] Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team [...] "come up with conceptually what we want to do" [...] for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling.

500|$|Several critics {{noted the}} album's {{extensive}} exploration of sexuality. Having been a singer {{since the age}} of nine, Beyoncé felt [...] "stifled" [...] by the perception she was a role model for young children, and now into her thirties, believed she had [...] "earned the right to [...] express any and every side of self". Addressing the album's sexual content specifically, the singer said [...] "I don't at all have any shame about being sexual and I'm not embarrassed about it and I don't feel like I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> that side of me." [...] Several critics described Beyoncés sex songs as a celebration of monogamous love. [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] is a duet with her husband Jay-Z, and features lyrics heavily laden with double entendres that explore lust within their sexual relationship. It fuses intermittent trap beats with heavy bass, skittering synthesizers and drums, and Arabic-scale vocal arpeggios. Beyoncé's vocals are diverse, including a melodramatic chorus sung in her upper register and a half-rapped second verse. [...] "Blow" [...] veers from a thumping jazz beat created with sparse piano chords and guitars to a [...] "swinging electro-funk groove" [...] with elements of neo-disco. Its erotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics include a running cunnilingus metaphor of [...] "licking Skittles" [...] in its chorus. The slow-jam [...] "Rocket" [...] is a homage to D'Angelo's soul-infused [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] (2000). Described by Entertainment Weeklys Nick Catucci as a [...] "slippery, six-and-a-half-minute funk excursion", Beyoncé adopts a slow, harmonious vocal as she instructs her love interest to watch her perform a striptease.|$|E

At that moment, Cortez was {{not looking at the}} fighters. As Ortiz let go, Mayweather took advantage of Ortiz not having his hands up and unloaded a left hook which wobbled Ortiz. Ortiz then looked at the referee, and Mayweather connected with a flush right hand to Ortiz's face. Ortiz fell to the canvas, and was unable to beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 jeered Mayweather. After the fight Ortiz claimed that he was merely obeying the referee's instructions when he was [...] "blindsided" [...] by Mayweather, who defended his actions by saying that [...] "In the ring, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> yourself at all times".|$|E
2500|$|Some Conservative Christians {{believe that}} the use of sex toys is immoral. The Southern Baptist preacher Dan Ireland has been an outspoken critic of such devices and has fought to ban them on {{religious}} and ethical grounds. Ireland has stated [...] "There are moral ways and immoral ways to use a firearm ... There is no moral way to use one of these devices." [...] According to Ireland, [...] "Sometimes you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the public against themselves....These devices should be outlawed because they are conducive to promiscuity, because they promote loose morals and because they entice improper and potentially deadly behaviors." [...] On the other hand Heidi Johnson, a Lutheran Christian pastor, teaches that [...] "in the Christian tradition, we are called to love God with all our heart, strength, mind, and soul...Sex toys are presented as a medium to engage in body love, self care, and exploring your sexuality as one of the ways we love God with all of our holistic being." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the trial}} ended, the District Attorney's office {{received}} numerous open record requests for the videotape. David McDade inquired of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia whether the videotape {{had to be}} released under the Open Records Act. The Council concluded that [...] "if no one has filed for a protection order ... claiming that disclosure of the video tape would invade individual privacy, we can find no reason why disclosure of the video tape is not required under ... the Open Records Act." [...] Ignoring {{the fact that it}} was the Legislature that wrote the Open Records Law (and which caused the initial controversy by refusing to apply the [...] "Romeo and Juliet" [...] clause retroactively), Georgia State Sen. Emanuel Jones said he would introduce legislation to block district attorneys from handing over photographic images in sex cases. [...] "'I'm going to call it the David McDade Act,' Jones said. 'Sometimes we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> our kids from district attorneys.'" [...] Because the participants shown having sex in the video were under 18, the videotape constitutes child pornography under federal law. [...] The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act prohibits prosecutors from allowing defendants in criminal proceedings to possess a copy of any evidence that constitutes child pornography, even if the purpose is to mount a defense against the charge. Under this law, Wilson and his defense team are prohibited from having a copy of the videotape that prosecutor McDade has distributed to anyone else who has requested it.|$|E
