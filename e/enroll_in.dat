40|$|This study compares drug use, injecting {{and sexual}} {{risk-taking}} behaviour among pregnant injecting drug users (IDUs) <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), non-pregnant women IDUs <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> MMT and women IDUs not <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> treatment. There {{was no significant}} difference between pregnant IDUs <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> MMT and women IDUs not <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> treatment in terms of their injecting risk-taking behaviour. Both groups reported significantly higher levels of injecting risk-taking behaviour compared to (non-pregnant) women <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> MMT. Pregnant women <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> MMT reported a significantly lower methadone dose compared to non-pregnant women in MMT. There was a trend for pregnant women <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> MMT to report a higher level of heroin use compared to non-pregnant women in MMT. The lack of evidence for a difference in level of injecting risk-taking behaviour between pregnant IDUs <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> MMT and women IDUs not <b>enrolled</b> <b>in</b> treatment suggests the need for additional strategies among pregnant IDUs to reduce IDU and injecting risk-taking behaviour. Possible strategies include maintenance on higher doses of methadone and the application of relapse prevention strategies...|$|R
