He acted in Renoir's 1936 film Partie de campagne and in the 1939 La Règle du jeu, for which he played a butler and served as second assistant. Renoir made Cartier-Bresson act so he could understand <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> {{be on the other}} side of the camera. Cartier-Bresson also helped Renoir make a film for the Communist party on the 200 families, including his own, who ran France. During the Spanish civil war, Cartier-Bresson co-directed an anti-fascist film with Herbert Kline, to promote the Republican medical services.|$|E

She tried to make Ruby seem [...] "as innocent as possible" [...] to make viewers question her true allegiance, and to [...] "bring more of a humanity" [...] to Ruby than Cassidy had. For example, taking from the third season finale in which Dean is sent to Hell, Cortese portrayed the character as having some guilt over his death, even though Ruby was not responsible for it. The actress also acknowledged that Ruby was likely manipulating Sam when she claimed to remember <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> be human, but suggested that {{there was also an}} element of truth to her character's words.|$|E
