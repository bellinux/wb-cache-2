40|$|Current Confrontation Clause {{doctrine}} is confused-in its reasoning {{more than in}} its results-and Professor Friedman 2 ̆ 7 s proposed alternative would eliminate much of the confusion. 2 ̆ 7 Professor Friedman 2 ̆ 7 s key substantive insight is that the word 2 ̆ 2 witnesses 2 ̆ 2 in the Clause should be construed more narrowly, but that when the Clause does indeed apply, it lays down a bright-line rule, not a mushy balancing test. Professor Friedman 2 ̆ 7 s key methodological insight is that the Confrontation Clause is 2 ̆ 2 very distinct 2 ̆ 2 from ordinary hearsay doctrine. To interpret the Clause properly, we need to look, first and foremost, to constitutional law, not evidence law. All this is, I think, exactly right. But in crafting his proposed alternative, Professor Friedman fails to carry his substantive and methodological insights to their logical conclusions. He argues that 2 ̆ 2 witnesses 2 ̆ 2 under the Confrontation Clause should not encompass all out-of-court declarants, but should include all those who make accusatory statements {{with the understanding that}} those statements will later be presented to a factfinder at trial. Substantively, his definition of 2 ̆ 2 witnesses, 2 ̆ 2 though cleaner and narrower than that adopted by the Supreme Court, is still a tad too broad. Methodologically, his definition unwittingly reflects residual traces of hearsay doctrine and tends to slight constitutional text, history, and structure. Professor Friedman 2 ̆ 7 s proposal is vastly more coherent than current doctrine, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> better still...|$|E
