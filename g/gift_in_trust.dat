In 1905, the council was given Norwood Oval as a <b>gift</b> <b>in</b> <b>trust,</b> and managed it thereafter.|$|E
5000|$|Jowett {{gives an}} account of the {{creation}} of the first Amharic Bible, in which he himself played a part. [...] In about 1809, the French consul at Cairo, M. Asselin de Cherville, met an elderly Abyssinian named Abu Rumi, who had been both interpreter to the traveller James Bruce in North Africa and an instructor to the philologist Sir William Jones. Asselin wished to have some important book translated into Amharic, the vernacular language of Abyssinia, as a linguistic exercise, and employed Abu Rumi to translate the Bible. Asselin remarked, however, [...] "I blushed while I offered a salary to a man the most simple, the most virtuous, and the most disinterested, that I ever met with." [...] In 1819, after he had finished the whole translation, Abu Rumi died of the plague at Cairo. In 1820, while on a visit to Cairo, Jowett saw this work in manuscript, entered into negotiations with Asselin, and on 10 April 1820 bought it for the British and Foreign Bible Society [...] "on terms which appeared to... be equitable to all parties". The manuscript consisted of 9,539 pages [...] "...in the hand-writing of the Translator, Abu Rumi; which is a bold and fine specimen of the Amharic character". Jowett wrote in 1822: [...] The publication of the Amharic Scriptures will be as the lighting of a Pharos on the inhospitable shores of the Red Sea!... This remarkable work, therefore, British Christians may well accept as a <b>gift</b> <b>in</b> <b>Trust</b> for Abyssinia.|$|E

30|$|Although {{meditation}} is {{the main}} explanatory variable in this study, assets are another {{important factor in the}} estate planning decision; therefore, the relationship between assets and estate planning decisions is explored. Estate planning saves time and yields a tax-planning advantage when individuals deal with wills, <b>gifts</b> <b>in</b> <b>trust,</b> insurance trusts, estate and gift tax returns, gifts or purchases of stock, and family estate plans, among others (Madura and Gill 2016). Estate planning helps explore options involved in tax planning, such as the valuation of intra-family gifts of minority interests in a closely held family business context, limited liability companies, and the use of charitable techniques (Business Wire 2006). Intestate death can create more problems for foreigners in India, where intestate succession takes a long time for settlement. A local will made in India helps probate assets easily (Global Property Guide 2015).|$|R
5000|$|Carryover basis, also {{referred}} to as a transferred basis, applies to inter vivos <b>gifts</b> and transfers <b>in</b> <b>trust.</b> [...] Generally, a taxpayer's basis in property is the cost to acquire the property. [...] However, there is an exception for inter vivos <b>gifts</b> and transfers <b>in</b> <b>trust.</b> [...] For <b>gifts,</b> to calculate a gain, the donee has the same basis in the property as the donor's adjusted basis in the property. [...] The same rule applies for calculating a loss, unless the donor's adjusted basis is greater than the fair market value of the property {{at the time of the}} <b>gift.</b> [...] <b>In</b> this case, the loss does not carry over and the basis is the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift.|$|R
40|$|During {{times of}} {{economic}} turmoil, certain private charitable institutions operating {{in urban areas}} often face financial problems. In the past, these institutions - hospitals, community service centers, and the like - were partially reimbursed by government welfare funds for their 2 ̆ 2 public services 2 ̆ 2 expenditures. But as the pressures on municipal budgets have increased, these reimbursements become delayed, and sometimes uncertain. A charitable corporation contemplating a petition in bankruptcy might wish to seek cy pres relief from the bankruptcy court. Cy pres, a common feature of state law, provides that a <b>gift</b> <b>in</b> <b>trust</b> or otherwise which is determined {{to have been made}} pursuant to a general charitable intent can be judicially modified to carry out, as nearly as possible, the donor 2 ̆ 7 s presumed wishes. However, the dearth of case law involving such bankruptcies has left unclear whether the two proceedings could be combined-that is, whether a bankruptcy court, as part of a plan of reorganizations, could modify restrictions on charitable endowments in a fashion similar to state cy pres relief. This Article will examine the nature of the cy pres doctrine and the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to determine whether the court may grant such relief to financially distressed charities...|$|E
