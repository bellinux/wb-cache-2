500|$|At that time, a Parisian ballet {{audience}} typically {{consisted of}} two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a [...] "Bohemian" [...] group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would [...] "acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions [...] began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: [...] "Everything available was tossed <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>direction,</b> but we continued to play on". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with {{the intervention of the}} police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. Things grew noticeably quieter during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final [...] "Sacrificial Dance" [...] was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.|$|E
2500|$|In {{doing so}} they {{activated}} [...] "a kind of reverse thrust, and [...] lights became dazzlingly bright". To match {{the speed of}} the aircraft from their sideways approach, the objects displayed what Terauchi described as a disregard for inertia: [...] "The thing was flying as if {{there was no such thing}} as gravity. It sped up, then stopped, then flew at our speed, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>direction,</b> so that to us it [...] standing still. The next instant it changed course. ... In other words, the flying object had overcome gravity." [...] The [...] "reverse thrust" [...] caused a bright flare for three to seven seconds, to the extent that captain Terauchi could feel the warmth of their glows.|$|E

30|$|In conclusion, we have {{demonstrated}} a yeast-based whole-cell biocatalyst capable of transforming polyunsaturated fatty acids into medium-chained aldehyde, the medium-chained biofuel precursor. The comparative proteomics analysis offered {{an approach to}} study the overall protein in the cells and potentials as catalyst. This study lay foundation <b>in</b> <b>our</b> future <b>direction</b> to synthesize medium-chained hydrocarbons through metabolic engineering approaches.|$|R
25|$|Thus {{to detect}} alien civilizations through their radio emissions, Earth {{observers}} either need more sensitive instruments or must hope for fortunate circumstances: that the broadband radio emissions of alien radio technology are {{much stronger than}} our own; that one of SETI's programs is listening to the correct frequencies from the right regions of space; or that aliens are deliberately sending focused transmissions <b>in</b> <b>our</b> general <b>direction.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Before {{the album}} was recorded, the band's keyboardist, Johnny Rogers, {{departed}} the band. Brighton Rock wanted a harder sound, with lead vocalist Gerry McGhee stating, [...] "We didn't really feel that keyboards were part of us anymore. There's really no place for them <b>in</b> <b>our</b> musical <b>direction</b> now." [...] Rogers was replaced for touring purposes by a second guitar player, Greg Bioleau, who previously played with McGhee in his first band, The Rockers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{star has}} a {{relatively}} high proper motion of 1.4″ per year and is moving <b>in</b> <b>our</b> general <b>direction</b> with a radial velocity of −10.8 km/s. HD 4628 will make its closest approach to the Sun in about 32,000 years, when it comes within [...] No definitive companion has yet been found in orbit around this star. In 1958 it was thought to have stellar companion that was also a flare star, but this was subsequently disproved.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{target a}} context-awareness {{approach}} to sensors, proposing a first extension of sensor ontologies <b>in</b> this <b>direction.</b> <b>Our</b> proposal aims at emulating the human cognitive ability, {{taking advantage of}} Linked Data, {{in order to improve}} the human understanding of reality through sensors...|$|R

30|$|In [13] we {{improved}} Theorem  6.1 <b>in</b> several <b>directions.</b> <b>Our</b> {{results are}} established in any normed {{space and the}} sets C_ 1,...,C_n are not necessarily bounded. Moreover, we show that the set of all boundedly linearly regular tuples is not only residual, but has, in fact, a porous complement.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of two novels that have rarely been examined {{in relation to}} each other: Charles W. Chesnutt’s The Colonel's Dream and Sutton E. Griggs’s Pointing the Way.

6000|$|... "Suddenly my eye {{caught the}} glint of a shaded lantern {{at the other side}} of the moat. It {{vanished}} among the mound-heaps, and then appeared again coming slowly <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E

60|$|You are now to {{conceive}} us proceeding <b>in</b> <b>our</b> different <b>directions</b> across the bare downs. Yonder flies little Benjie to the northward with Hemp scampering at his heels, both running {{as if for}} dear life {{so long as the}} rogue is within sight of his employer, and certain to take the walk very easy so soon as he is out of ken. Stepping westward, you see Maggie's tall form and high-crowned hat, relieved by the fluttering of her plaid upon the left shoulder, darkening as the distance diminishes her size and as the level sunbeams begin to sink upon the sea. She is taking her quiet journey to the Shepherd's Bush.|$|R

At Loughrea we went away <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own <b>directions,</b> and poor Tom with Barney Smith rode home to Ahaseragh. But not a word did he speak to anyone, even to Barney; nor did Barney dare to speak a word to him. He trotted all the way to Ahaseragh in moody silence, {{thinking}} of the terrible ill that had been done him. I have known Tom for twenty years, and I think that if he loves any man he loves me. But he parted from me that day without a word." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove the {{persistence}} of hyperbolic invariant tori in generalized Hamiltonian systems, which may admit a distinct number of action and angle variables.

We also consider the persistence problem of hyperbolic tori on sub-manifolds. Comment: LaTeX, 17 page...|$|R

5000|$|In January 2009, Q-Notes began {{rebranding}} its {{print edition}} and online presence. A new layout for the print edition accompanied an online redesign and new editorial strategy. Former editor Matt Comer wrote, [...] "With <b>our</b> change <b>in</b> aesthetics comes a change <b>in</b> <b>our</b> editorial <b>direction.</b> <b>Our</b> bi-weekly print {{issues will be}} more future-oriented and contain less reporting of events past, while GoQnotes.com takes up a more robust daily presence with online only reporting of Carolinas, national and international events and news...In an effort to maintain our new, robust website and editorial direction, qnotes will be implementing a sort of “web first” model. Stories slated to appear <b>in</b> <b>our</b> print editions will be published as they are completed, or {{as a set of}} stories in the day or two after we dispatch our content to our printer. No more waiting the painfully slow and long five days between press time and street date." ...|$|R
30|$|In this way, if any ellipse gets a large {{covariance}} {{component in}} one direction and a small component <b>in</b> another <b>direction,</b> <b>our</b> measure will have a considerable increase. This sensibility could not be reached if we would have considered other metrics, like area, this would not be interesting since the uncertainty about the feature position is actually high.|$|R
