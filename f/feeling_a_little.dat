Al Trautwig, commentating for American TV network ABC, likened Findeisen to [...] "a ragdoll" [...] after the fall. Former ski jumper Jeff Hastings, co-commentating, said: [...] "I'm <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sick to my stomach, Al... I can't believe this. I've never seen ski flying like this... So many falls." [...] Findeisen was barely conscious and had to be stretchered away, later going into cardiac arrest but surviving.|$|E

[...] Dave Grohl, the lead singer and guitarist of the Foo Fighters and former drummer for Nirvana, made a small cameo, along with his then-wife Jennifer Youngblood, in the episode during the scene wherein Modell sneaks into the FBI building. Grohl, who has an active interest in UFO lore, called the episode [...] "his acting debut".|$|E

500|$|The role is {{regarded}} as groundbreaking. According to Felicia Lee of The New York Times, Pope is the only dramatic protagonist role played by a black woman on American network television since 1974, when Teresa Graves starred as Christie Love in Get Christie Love! for one series. Among her prominent comedic predecessors, Diahann Carroll played the title role in Julia from 1968 to 1971. Pope {{is regarded}} as a post-racial character, yet possibly the most complex black female lead in television history. Although the show does not touch upon race that often, regarding her much publicized affair with Grant, Pope once said [...] "I'm <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> I don't know, Sally Hemings-Thomas Jefferson about all this." [...] Pope has given Washington a role as a standard bearer for middle-class and upper middle-class, educated black women.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Timberlake assures {{his love}} {{interest}} {{that they are}} [...] "making love like professionals" [...] and declares: [...] "If you’ll be my strawberry bubblegum, I’ll be your blueberry lollipop". In addition, he sings about the girl's many characteristics and sensual qualities, and proclaims that he will love her until they [...] "make it pop". The Boston Globes James Reed wrote that the lyrics are silly, but irresistible, while Sarah Dean of The Huffington Post found [...] "Strawberry Bubblegum" [...] as seductive as its title, but according to her, [...] "if you had {{too much of it}} you might end up <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sick". Additionally, Timberlake sings lyrics about he has [...] "recipe for a good time". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club felt that the lyrics' sense of humor is somewhat similar to [...] "Pop" [...] by 'NSYNC.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] {{talks about}} Aguilera {{adopting}} a new persona and new musical experiments. At the beginning, Aguilera admits that [...] "Tonight I'm <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> out of control". At the pre-chorus, she sings [...] "The old me's gone and I feel brand new, {{and if you}} don't like it, fuck you", which takes aim at anyone who dismisses her new style; meanwhile, she declares her musical departure from her previous 1940s and 1950s inspired album Back to Basics (2006) at the chorus with the line, [...] "I'm not myself tonight, tonight I'm not the same girl". The song also evokes sexual theme, with lyrics such as [...] "I'm dancin' a lot, I'm takin' shots and I'm feelin' fine/ I'm kissin' all the boys and girls". Writing for Billboard magazine, Michael Menachem opined that Aguilera channeled a [...] "more 'Euro-glamorous' version" [...] of her previous alter ego [...] "Xtina", featured in her 2002 hit [...] "Dirrty" [...] from Stripped.|$|E

500|$|For {{most of his}} life, Bizet had {{suffered}} from a recurrent throat complaint. A heavy smoker, he may have further undermined his health by overwork during the mid-1860s, when he toiled over publishers' transcriptions for up to 16 hours a day. In 1868, he informed Galabert {{that he had been}} very ill with abscesses in the windpipe: [...] "I suffered like a dog". In 1871, and again in 1874, while completing Carmen, he had been disabled by severe bouts of what he described as [...] "throat angina", and suffered a further attack in late March 1875. At that time, depressed by the evident failure of Carmen, Bizet was slow to recover and fell ill again in May. At the end of the month, he went to his holiday home at Bougival and, <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better, went for a swim in the Seine. On the next day, 1 June, he was afflicted by high fever and pain, which was followed by an apparent heart attack. He seemed temporarily to recover, but {{in the early hours of}} 3 June, his wedding anniversary, he suffered a fatal second attack. He was 36 years old.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Josh Modell of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode was [...] "boring" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and was particularly disappointing following the episode [...] "Fishsticks" [...] the previous week. Modell said, [...] "South Park episodes don't get much lazier or uninspired than this one. It was like half an idea stretched out forever and ever, and {{with very little}} payoff." [...] Carlos Delgado of If Magazine said the episode plot was too silly and lacked laughs: [...] "All in all, I was left <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cheated. [...] "Pinewood Derby" [...] wasn’t funny, it was just weird." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said the episode was told with [...] "the warp-speed storytelling style that is making this season one of South Parks best". Travis Fickett of IGN said {{he was happy to}} see an episode centered on Randy Marsh, who he said is an excellent character; Fickett said of [...] "Pinewood Derby", [...] "This isn't a great episode but its fast-paced lunacy in the South Park tradition and most of the genre tropes it riffs on are dead on." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote it}} is [...] "an uncommonly good movie, {{entertaining}} and actually inspirational". Writing for Film Journal International, Doris Toumarkine praised its pace and how [...] "Atchison takes spelling competitions and conveys {{the excitement of}} the 'sport,' the appeal of the 'game,' the thrill of the win, [...] the crushing blow of the loss." [...] Hornaday from The Washington Post called the film [...] "a triumph on many levels" [...] and proclaimed, [...] "It's that nod to the collective ... that makes Akeelah and the Bee so special." [...] She especially appreciated that South Los Angeles was presented without stereotypes. Jane Clifford of U-T San Diego felt the film would appeal to both children and adults, and stated that every time she tried to predict its plot [...] "it took a sharp turn. A turn that leaves you facing your stereotypes and <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sheepish." [...] Dana Stevens, writing for The New York Times, asserted, [...] "The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee," [...] and [...] "a trio of crack performances" [...] can turn [...] "a formulaic sports picture" [...] into a [...] "tale that manages to inspire without being sappy." [...] Shantayaé Grant of The Jamaica Observer wrote that [...] "acting is spectacular, the emotions are real and this story of black triumph is simply phenomenal." [...] New York Press critic affirmed that Akeelah and the Bee [...] "resurrects a nearly lost idea of what an art-movie really is" [...] because it has [...] "dramatic attention to character and place, psychology and existence." ...|$|E

2500|$|In The Observers {{issue of}} 18 April 1937, [...] "Torquemada" [...] (Edward Powys Mathers) wrote: [...] "It is rather for herself {{than for the}} four awkwardly shaped Poirot stories which make up Murder in the Mews that I give Agatha Christie first place [...] this week. There is {{sufficient}} in the latest exploits of the little Belgian {{to remind us that}} his creator is our queen of detective writers, but by no means enough to win her that title if she had not already won it. [...] The last and shortest tale, Triangle at Rhodes, is just the one which should have been made the longest, since it is a problem depending entirely on the unfolding of the characters of four people. Mrs Christie has not given herself room for such unfolding, and is therefore constrained to tear the buds brutally apart. This plot would, I think, have furnished forth a whole novel. In the other three stories, each of that long-short form which used to be sacred to the penny detective adventure story, Poirot is but palely himself, and in each case the plot, though clever, is not brilliant. In the name piece the motive of the second crime is legitimately baffling; in The Incredible Theft I kept pace with Poirot; in Dead Man's Mirror, <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cheated, I myself cheated by backing the most exterior of outsiders." ...|$|E
2500|$|Manhunt 2 was {{met with}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews. Positive reception came from the game's presentation of graphic violence and its psychological horror-based storyline. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd said the game was [...] "not as shocking as you'd expect, but Manhunt 2 still satisfies your primal instincts", and that the game was better {{to play on the}} PSP platform. Mikel Reparaz from GamesRadar stated that [...] "if you're in the mood for something creepy and horrific that'll leave you <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dirty, Manhunt 2s still-shocking murders and eerie, is-it-real-or-am-I-just-insane storyline won't disappoint." [...] Game Informer gave the Wii version of the game 7.75/10, saying [...] "Manhunt 2 is every bit as grim and brutal as the first [...] the writing, as is typical of Rockstar's games, is top-notch, and Daniel {{and the rest of the}} characters do come off the screen as very real and human [...] It's a testament to this quality that I was really driven to see the tale out to its end." [...] Similarly, Nintendo Power gave the Wii version 7.5/10, stating that while the game does deliver for the most part, they were disappointed by the way external influences led Rockstar to change the game, and that the story, while interesting, is [...] "highly predictable". [...] Yahoo! reviewed the PSP version, stating [...] "there's simply never been a game quite as squeamishly immersive as this [...] it's even more terrifying for seeming like the most real thing in a game this year." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gertsmann {{scored the}} console {{versions}} 7.2 out of 10, writing [...] "the game's strong production values aren't {{backed up by}} an equally compelling story or game." [...] He called Nicholas Kang [...] "completely unlikeable" [...] and [...] "an unnecessarily cocky jerk." [...] However, he also wrote, [...] "in terms of its presentation, True Crime delivers quite well. The graphics are very sharp and are most impressive when you're out on the road. Los Angeles looks startlingly realistic, {{right down to the}} maze of freeway on- and off-ramps." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime is a game that simply lacks polish and, in some cases, feels unfinished. It makes decent attempts with its different styles of gameplay, but none of them are particularly well done." [...] He scored the PC version 6.3 out of 10, writing [...] "the game's transition from console to PC wasn't handled as smoothly as you might have expected, thus leaving a game that was already a little uneven <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> broken in some spots." [...] He called the controls [...] "pretty terrible" [...] and argued [...] "the fact that the PC version doesn't have any sort of gamepad support certainly doesn't help." [...] He was also critical of the graphics, writing [...] "True Crime looks like a PlayStation 2 game that's been ported up, touched up a little bit, and shipped." [...] He called the multiplayer mode [...] "ill-conceived," [...] arguing [...] "the online mode actually detracts from the overall package rather than enhancing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a comics {{festival in}} Barcelona, a Japanese artist visits Paris, but falls sick. After <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better, he visits the Louvre. When he feels dizzy, he is transported {{to what is}} {{described}} as the [...] "space-time of [...] reveries" [...] by a guardian of the Louvre. The guardians are the souls of each piece of art, with the guardian he meets being of the Winged Victory of Samothrace. On his second day at the Louvre, {{he looks at the}} paintings of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. While looking at Recollection of Mortefontaine, he meets Asai Chū, who had worked on introducing Western-style art to Japan. He is then transported to an art gallery in Ueno which is exhibiting Chū's works posthumously and hears the writer Natsume Sōseki speaking of Chū's work. Transported into another Corot drawing, he meets Chū again and they glance upon Corot working on that drawing. On Sunday, the man travels to Auvers-sur-Oise, the final resting place of Vincent van Gogh. Going behind the church of Auvers, he meets van Gogh, who lets him visit his apartment and see his paintings. Back in the present, he visits Charles-François Daubigny's house and finally, van Gogh's grave. A few days later, on a Tuesday when the Louvre is closed, he is transported to Paris in 1939 during the evacuation of the museum at the start of World War II. The man learns about the difficult process, which was led by , including the transport of the Mona Lisa, The Raft of the Medusa, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.

2500|$|In 1989, Jobs {{first met}} his future wife, Laurene Powell, when [...] {{he gave a}} lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where she was a student. Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene [...] "was {{right there in the}} front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her ... kept losing my train of thought, and started <b>feeling</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> giddy." [...] After the lecture, Jobs met up with her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner. From that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, {{for the rest of his}} life. Powell's father died when she was very young, and her mother raised her in a middle class New Jersey home similar to the one Jobs grew up in. After she {{received}} her B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania, she spent a short period in high finance but found it didn't interest her, so she decided to pursue her MBA at Stanford instead. In addition, unlike Jobs, she was athletic and followed professional sports. She also brought as much self-sufficiency to the relationship as he did and was more of a private than public person. Jobs proposed on New Year's Day 1990 with [...] "a fistful of freshly picked wildflowers." [...] They married on March 18, 1991, in a Buddhist ceremony at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. Fifty people, including his father, Paul, and his sister, Mona, attended. The ceremony was conducted by Jobs's guru, Kobun Chino Otogawa. The vegan wedding cake was in the shape of Yosemite's Half Dome, and the wedding ended with a hike (during which Laurene's brothers had a snowball fight). Jobs is reported to have said to Mona: [...] "You see, Mona , Laurene is descended from Joe Namath, and we're descended from John Muir." ...|$|E
