5000|$|In English law, frankalmoign(e) {{was also}} known as [...] "tenure in free alms". Gifts to {{religious}} institutions in <b>free</b> <b>alms</b> were defined first as gifts to God, then to {{the patron saint of}} the religious house, and finally to those religious serving God in the specific house.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the above}} example makes clear {{it was a}} {{freehold}} tenure as it was held in perpetual possession, which is equivalent to [...] "hereditable" [...] in secular terms. Religious houses in receipt of <b>free</b> <b>alms</b> could not recognise a secular lord. The gift of land or other property made over to God and to a patron Saint was inalienable, {{and the relationship between}} the grantor and the religious house was subsidiary.|$|E

50|$|Brayton, loosely {{translated}} as ‘Broad Acres’ {{is an ancient}} manorial estate which formed a joint township with Aspatria. After the Norman Conquest it was granted by Alan, son of Waldieve to Ughtred who became the first Lord of the manor in the seignory of Aspatria and barony of Allerdale. An inquisition held in 1578 records a William Bewley owning Brayton by fealty only, sometime the lands of the Bishop of Carlisle in <b>free</b> <b>alms.</b> It was subsequently possessed by a junior member of the Salkeld family, whose three co-heiresses sold it to Sir Wilfrid Lawson, who had previously married the heiress of Isel. At this time the Brayton manorial estate comprised 20 houses, 20 tofts, 20 gardens, 260 acre of land, 100 acre of meadow, 200 acre of pasture and 300 acre of moor.|$|E
50|$|After the Norman conquest, Shabbington Manor {{represented}} two knight's fees. The tenancy {{was held}} by the Valognes family until 1299 when Joan de Valognes, widow of Robert de Grey, alienated the manor in <b>free</b> <b>alms</b> to the Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem. Joan held the manor until her death in 1312, but in 1326-29 her grandson and heir John de Grey disputed the Hospitallers' tenure and successfully reclaimed the manor. John de Grey died in 1359 leaving Shabbington to his son John de Grey, 2nd Baron Grey de Rotherfield, to whom the Hospitallers surrendered their claim in 1360. Robert de Grey, 4th Baron Grey de Rotherfield died in 1388 with no male heir, so when his daughter Joan married John, Lord Deyncourt in 1401, Shabbington joined his estate of Wooburn Deyncourt.|$|E
40|$|Author’s note 1 : Fig 1 p. 34 Item 5. Presently reads 'Grant in <b>free</b> <b>alms</b> by William Tison to Rufford Abbey (Cistercian) {{of land in}} ‘Arthes’ in Averham in East Riding of Yorkshire'. It {{should read}} 'Grant in <b>free</b> <b>alms</b> by William Tison to Rufford Abbey (Cistercian) of land in ‘Arthes’ in Averham, south west of the village of Kelham in Nottinghamshire'. Authors note 2 : Page 200, ‘The Death of Earl Godwine’. Whilst Geoffrey Gaimar’s Estoire des Engleis, {{extensively}} reports the public trial of Earl Godwine for complicity {{in the death of}} Alfred, brother of Edward the Confessor, he does not describe his death resulting from trial-by-bread. This thesis examines the historical writing of the twelfth-century Yorkshire historian Alfred of Beverley, compiler of a Latin chronicle covering the history of Britain from its supposed foundation by Brutus down to the time of Henry I. From the late Middle Ages until the eighteenth century Alfred enjoyed a considerable reputation amongst chroniclers, antiquaries and topographers but by the mid-nineteenth century scholarly opinion had come to consider his work highly derivative, uninformative and of little historical value. The chronicle was printed by Thomas Hearne in 1716, but was never edited in the Rolls Series and the text has remained largely neglected until today. Alfred’s sources in the chronicle have been identified and his use of them examined. The circumstances and date of compilation have been reconsidered and supported by internal evidence from the text, a date of compilation of c. 1148 - c. 1151 x 1154 is proposed. Alfred’s purpose and intended audience of the work has been considered and evidence for the work’s dissemination and reception from the twelfth to the seventeenth century has been gathered in order to assess the place of the work in medieval historiography. This study finds the Historia to be a text of considerable historical interest and value. It shares common features with historical narratives {{of the first half of}} the twelfth century in attempting to provide a comprehensive account of the island’s past, but does so in a more concise, less discursive literary manner. It reveals the application of the methodologies of scholastic exegesis to the writing of history, in its language, textual organization and in the interrogation of authorities that it engages in to determine the veracity of historical data. The text is an important witness for the dissemination of the important twelfth-century source texts it uses. It is the first Latin chronicle to incorporate Geoffrey of Monmouth’s British history into its narrative fabric (Henry of Huntingdon’s c. 1139 abbreviation of Geoffrey’s history was inserted as a self-standing ‘Letter to Warinus’). Alfred’s critical reception of the Galfridian material is examined in the thesis. The extensive borrowings from Henry of Huntingdon, Geoffrey of Monmouth, John of Worcester and the Durham Historia Regum, provide important evidence for the dissemination of these texts, which the thesis examines. A finding of the study is that the Historia has been powerfully influenced by Henry of Huntingdon’s Historia Anglorum in its structure and thematic approach. The later reception of Alfred’s Historia by Ranulph Higden in his Universal Chronicle Polychronicon is examined and the impact that this had on Alfred’s later reception in historiography, from William Caxton to William Camden is traced and explored...|$|E
5000|$|Monasteries {{had also}} {{supplied}} <b>free</b> food and <b>alms</b> {{for the poor}} and destitute, and {{it has been argued that}} the removal of this and other charitable resources, amounting to about 5 per cent of net monastic income, was one of the factors in the creation of the army of [...] "sturdy beggars" [...] that plagued late Tudor England, causing the social instability that led to the Edwardian and Elizabethan Poor Laws. This argument has been disputed, for example, by G.W.O. Woodward, who summarises: No great host of beggars was suddenly thrown on the roads for monastic charity had had only marginal significance and, even had the abbeys been allowed to remain, could scarcely have coped with the problems of unemployment and poverty created by the population and inflationary pressures of the middle and latter parts of the sixteenth century.|$|R
50|$|The Domesday Book {{records the}} {{population}} of Bradefelda manor, including Bradfield St Clare and Bradfield St George. Bradefelda/fella existed before the Conquest. The book states that then (i.e. before the Conquest), as in 1086, there were fifteen villans and eighteen bordars; 'then' one slave, and in 1086 six slaves; and three free men. Over these men St. Edmund (the Abbey of Edmund the Martyr) had sake and soke with regard to every customary due. They {{were not allowed to}} sell their lands without the Abbot's say so. In the same place (i.e. Bradfield) other men had more rights: there were in 1086, as before the Conquest, nine free men who could sell their lands but the soke and service belonged to the Abbey or anyone who purchased the land. The Book also records that the church of this 'vill' owned ten and a half acres of <b>free</b> land for <b>alms.</b>|$|R
