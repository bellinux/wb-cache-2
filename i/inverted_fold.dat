These rifts were areas where the crust was greatly attenuated and more subject to deformation in response to nearby plate boundary tectonics. Data from observations based on seismic reflection profiles and wells over the Missour basin for hydrocarbon exploration and field mapping were used to understand the basin evolution, structural styles, and inversion timing of the nearby Atlas Mountains. Hercynian and Mesozoic normal faults were reactivated into high-angle reverse and thrust faults in the Mesozoic during the Jurassic, early Cretaceous (early Alpine phase), and the Paleogene (late Alpine phase). The reactivation of synrift normal faults of the paleo-Atlas rifts inverted previous half grabens into anticlinal structures, with the axis of the half graben centered below the axis of the inverted anticline.

40|$|Abstract. – The {{northern}} {{margin of}} the Basque-Cantabrian Basin was analysed combining stratigraphic and structural data from both surface and subsurface together with reflectance of vitrinite data from oil wells. The use of cross-sec-tion balancing techniques in addition to thermal modelling enabled us to reconstruct the tectonic, burial and thermal evolutions of the basin margin {{as well as those}} of the Landes High to the N in two different periods. The section resto-ration at the end of the Cretaceous shows a northern basin margin structure influenced by evaporites related to south-dipping normal faults. The reconstruction in middle Eocene times yielded up to 1 800 m of Paleocene-middle Eocene deposits on top of the basin margin. Subsequent tectonic inversion related to the Pyrenean compression led to the north-directed thrusting of basement units and to the formation of thrust slices or <b>inverted</b> <b>folds</b> in the cover along the northern {{margin of the}} basin. Tectonic subsidence analysis together with maturity data provided evidence that oil was generated in the basin during the late syn-rift and post-rift stages in the Late Cretaceous and became overmature during the period of incipient inversion after 55 Ma. In the autochthonous Landes High, the oil was generated after the tectonic inversion period 37 Ma.

40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{presented}} that 5 + 5 TMS and 7 + 7 TMS <b>inverted</b> repeat <b>fold</b> transporters {{are members of a}} single superfamily named the Amino acid-Polyamine-organoCation (APC) superfamily. However, the evolutionary relationship between the 5 + 5 and the 7 + 7 topological types has not been established. We have identified a common fold, consisting of a spiny membrane helix/sheet, followed by a U-like structure and a V-like structure that is recurrent between domain duplicated units of 5 + 5 and 7 + 7 <b>inverted</b> repeat <b>folds.</b> This fold is found in the following protein structures: AdiC, ApcT, LeuT, Mhp 1, BetP, CaiT, and SglT (all 5 + 5 TMS repeats), as well as UraA and SulP (7 + 7 TMS repeats). AdiC, LeuT and Mhp 1 have two extra TMSs after the second duplicated domain, SglT has four extra C-terminal TMSs, and BetP has two extra TMSs before the first duplicated domain. UraA and SulP on the other hand have two extra TMSs at the N-terminus of each duplicated domain unit. These observations imply that multiple hairpin and domain duplication events occurred during the evolution of the APC superfamily. We suggest that the five TMS architecture was primordial and that families gained two TMSs on either side of this basic structure via dissimilar hairpin duplications either before or after intragenic duplication. Evidence for homology between TMSs 1 - 2 of AdiC and TMSs 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 of UraA suggests that the 7 + 7 topology arose via an internal duplication of the N-terminal hairpin loop within the five TMS repeat unit followed by duplication of the 7 TMS domain. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The Mura-Zala basin {{was formed}} due to ENE-WSW {{trending}} crustal extension {{in the late}} early and middle Miocene (19 – 11 Ma).

50|$|In {{the extreme}} {{northwest}} of the county between Drumlanrig Castle and Dalveen Pass {{in the south and}} the Spango and Kello Waters on the north, there is a broad development of Arenig, Liandeilo and Caradoc strata, represented by Radiolarian cherts, black shales, grits, conglomerates, greywackes and shales which rise from underneath the central Tarannon belt and are repeated by innumerable folds, in the cores of the arches of Arenig cherts there are diabase lavas, tuffs and agglomerates which are typically represented on Bail Hill east of Kirkconnel. Along the southern margin of the Tarannon belt, the Wenlock and Ludlow rocks follow in normal order, the boundary between the two being defined by a line extending from the head of the Ewes Water in Eskdale, southwest by Lockerbie to Mouswald. These consist of greywackes, flags and shales with bands of dark graptolite shales, the finer sediments being often well ground. They are likewise repeated by <b>inverted</b> <b>folds,</b> the axial planes being usually inclined to the southeast. The Silurian tableland in the {{northwest of the}} county is pierced by intrusive igneous rocks in the form of dikes and bosses, which are regarded as of Lower Old Red Sandstone age. Of these, the granite mass of Spango Water, northeast of Kirkconnel, is an excellent example. Along the northwest margin of the county, {{on the north side of}} the fault bounding the Silurian tableland, the Lower Old Red Sandstone occurs, where it consists of sandstones and conglomerates associated with contemporaneous volcanic rocks. The Upper Old Red Sandstone forms a narrow strip on the south side of the Silurian tableland, resting uncomfortably on the Silurian rocks and passing upwards into the Carboniferous formation. It stretches from the county boundary east of the Ewes Water, southwest by Langholm to Birrenswark. Along this line these Upper Red sandstones and shales are overlaid by a thin zone of volcanic rocks which point to contemporaneous volcanic action in this region at the beginning of the Carboniferous period. Some of the vents from which these igneous materials may have been discharged are found along the watershed between Liddesdale and Teviotdale in Roxburghshire.|$|R

Whereas multiband PIFAs exhibit two resonant modes, which operate by sharing the same available antenna volume, the FICA structure is synthesised in order to sustain three resonant modes that better reuse the volume. The implementation of volume reuse allows spreading of the reactive electromagnetic energy associated with each resonant mode across the entire antenna volume. This results in FICA modes exhibiting a lower Q factor and a wider fractional bandwidth than the corresponding PIFA modes.|$|R

40|$|Database-derived potentials, {{compiled}} from frequencies of sequence and structure features, {{are often used}} for scoring the compatibility of protein sequences and conformations. It is often believed that these scores correspond to differences in free energy with, in addition, a term containing the partition function of the system. Since this function {{does not depend on}} the conformation, the potentials are considered to be valid for scoring the compatibility of different conformations with a given sequence ('forward folding'), but not of sequences with a given structure ('inverted folding'). This interpretation is questioned here. It is argued that when many body-effects, which dominate frequencies {{compiled from}} the protein database, are corrected for, the potentials approximate a physically meaningful free energy difference from which the partition function term cancels out. It is the difference between the free energy of a given sequence in a specific conformation and that of the same sequence in a denatured-like state. Two examples of denatured-like states are discussed. Depending on the considered state, the free energy difference reduces to the commonly used scoring scheme, or contains additional terms that depend on the sequence. In both cases, all the terms can be derived from sequence-structure frequencies in the database. Such free energy difference, commonly defined as the folding free energy, is a measure of protein stability and can be used for scoring both forward and <b>inverted</b> protein <b>folding.</b> The implications for the use of knowledge-based potentials in protein structure prediction are described. Finally, the difficulty of designing tests that could validate the proposed approach, and the inherent limitations of such tests, are discussed. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|The {{development}} {{and structure of}} Neoproterozoic III volcanosedimentary basins in the northeastern part of the Arabian shield record periods of uplift, erosion, extension, subsidence, compression, and strike-slip faulting that postdated the completion of terrane amalgamation in the northern East African orogen (EAO) and predated the initiation of a passive margin on the northern flank of the Gondwana supercontinent. The oldest basins, dating from 650 Ma, include as much as 8000 m sandstone, conglomerate, bimodal volcanic rocks, and limestone, and were deposited in a large area (approximately 72, 000 km 2) of locally fault-controlled subsidence (Murdama basin) and in narrow grabens (Bani Ghayy basins). The regional unconformity {{at the base of}} the basins bevels the newly amalgamated terranes and exposes greenschist-, and locally amphibolite-, and granulite-grade metamorphic rocks, indicating possibly> 10 km uplift and erosion in parts of the region prior to deposition. The basins were closed and <b>inverted</b> by <b>folding</b> at about 650 Ma and unconformably overlain by rocks of the Jurdhawiyah group and Hibshi formation, which were deposited between 640 and 620 Ma in fault-controlled basins following a further phase of uplift and erosion.

A final phase of Neoproterozoic III basin formation resulted in deposition of the Jibalah group (580 – 570 Ma) in small, isolated, pull-apart basins caused by strike- and dip-slip movements on faults of the Najd fault system.

5000|$|Inverted repeats {{are often}} {{described}} as [...] "hotspots" [...] of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomic instability. Long inverted repeats are deemed to greatly influence {{the stability of the}} genome of various organisms. This is exemplified in E. coli, where genomic sequences with long inverted repeats are seldom replicated, but rather deleted with rapidity. Again, the long inverted repeats observed in yeast greatly favor recombination within the same and adjacent chromosomes, resulting in an equally very high rate of deletion. Finally, a very high rate of deletion and recombination were also observed in mammalian chromosomes regions with inverted repeats. Reported differences in the stability of genomes of interrelated organisms are always an indication of a disparity in inverted repeats. The instability results from the tendency of <b>inverted</b> repeats to <b>fold</b> into hairpin- or cruciform-like DNA structures. These special structures can hinder or confuse DNA replication and other genomic activities. Thus, inverted repeats lead to special configurations in both RNA and DNA that can ultimately cause mutations and disease.The illustration shows an inverted repeat undergoing cruciform extrusion. DNA in the region of the inverted repeat unwinds and then recombines, forming a four-way junction with two stem-loop structures. The cruciform structure occurs because the inverted repeat sequences self-pair to each other on their own strand.|$|R
30|$|Plant small RNAs are {{generally}} 20 to 24  nt {{in length and}} may be classified based {{on a series of}} different criteria. There are two predominant sizes of small RNAs in most plant species, 21 and 24  nt. The 21 nt sRNAs are usually microRNAs (miRNAs), at least in Arabidopsis and rice, that mainly function by cleaving a specific target mRNA in a post-transcriptional manner, based on sequence homology between the miRNA and target mRNA. The 24  nt sRNAs are usually short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that predominately control gene expression at the transcriptional level by inducing modifications to silence DNA and histones [3]. These activities take place in heterochromatic regions of the genome. Plant sRNAs may also be categorized as miRNAs or siRNAs based on their origin: miRNAs are derived from imperfectly matched stem-loop structures that are formed from single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) precursors, whereas siRNAs are derived from perfectly—or nearly perfectly—matched double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) produced by the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (with genes named as “RDR 1,” “RDR 2,” etc.) or from ssRNA transcripts including <b>inverted</b> repeats that <b>fold</b> back to form a dsRNA region [4, 5]. The larger class of siRNAs can be further subdivided into categories including trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs), natural cis-antisense transcript derived siRNAs (nat-siRNAs) and heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs). This division is based on the distinct biogenesis pathway of each subgroup [5].|$|R
5000|$|The lophophore {{and mouth}} are {{mounted on a}} {{flexible}} tube, called the [...] "invert" [...] {{because it can be}} turned inside-out and withdrawn into the polypide, rather like the finger of a rubber glove; in this position the lophophore lies inside the <b>invert</b> and is <b>folded</b> like the spokes of an umbrella. The invert is withdrawn, sometimes within 60 milliseconds, by a pair of retractor muscles that are anchored {{at the far end of}} the cystid. Sensors at the tips of the tentacles may check for signs of danger before the invert and lophophore are fully extended. Extension is driven by an increase in internal fluid pressure, which species with flexible exoskeletons produce by contracting circular muscles that lie just inside the body wall, while species with a membranous sac use circular muscles to squeeze this. Some species with rigid exoskeletons have a flexible membrane that replaces part of the exoskeleton, and transverse muscles anchored on the far side of the exoskeleton increase the fluid pressure by pulling the membrane inwards. In others there is no gap in the protective skeleton, and the transverse muscles pull on a flexible sac which is connected to the water outside by a small pore; the expansion of the sac increases the pressure inside the body and pushes the invert and lophophore out. In some species the retracted invert and lophophore are protected by an operculum ("lid"), which is closed by muscles and opened by fluid pressure. In one class, a hollow lobe called the [...] "epistome" [...] overhands the mouth.|$|R
40|$|The Donbas Foldbelt (DF) is a thrust-faulted and <b>folded,</b> <b>inverted,</b> {{segment of}} the Dniepr-Donets Basin (DDB). It lies between the Scythian and East European {{platforms}} north of the Black Sea and is conventionally thought to have formed in the Early Permian {{as part of the}} late Palaeozoic Hercynian-Uralian orogenic frame of cratonic Europe. The DDB itself formed as a result of Late Devonian intracratonic rifting and contains a thick, up to 22 km, late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary succession. The deformed strata preserved at the erosional surface of the DF are mainly Carboniferous. The Donets {{segment of the}} DDB displays mild inversion structures that are transitional to those in the DF. Recently acquired regional seismic reflection data in the Donets part of the DDB allow these structures to be imaged in the subsurface for the first time. A widespread Early Permian unconformity occurring throughout the DDB is much more pronounced on its southern margin than on its northern one and appears to be related to profound uplift of the southern flank of the basin and the neighbouring Ukrainian Shield rather than to crustal shortening. Faults associated with the Early Permian unconformity are extensional in style. Gentle folds and other local structures in the southern flank and axis of the Donets segment are mainly located in areas associated with Early Permian salt movements. No significant development of compressional structures of Early Permian age {{can be seen in the}} seismic data where it is available. In contrast, there is ample evidence of latest Cretaceous-earliest Tertiary compressional deformation in the DDB, including the subsurface expression of structures along strike of the main folds of the DF. A review of geological evidence in the DF also indicates that the main period of shortening that can be definitely constrained in time is latest Cretaceous-earliest Tertiary. The eastern part of the DF records intense Late Triassic-aged (Cimmerian) deformation but none of clearly Permian age.

40|$|There {{are more}} than 100 oil and gas fields in Iraq, {{containing}} more than 137 billion barrels of recoverable oil and more than 106 TCF of recoverable gas. Of this large resource, about 25 billion barrels of oil and 11 TCF of gas have been produced to date. Nearly all of {{the oil and gas}} occurs in fields located within the Mesopotamian foredeep, Gotnia Basin, and Zagros foldbelt. Minor discoveries and shows have been found on the Arabian platform along the western flank of the Mesopotamian foredeep. There is one gas discovery (Akkas field) on the Arabian platform in western Iraq. Ninety-eight percent of the oil and gas occurs in reservoirs of Cenozoic and Cretaceous age. The largest reserves occur in: 1) carbonate rocks of the Kirkuk Group (Lower Miocene–Oligocene), in fields within the Zagros foldbelt of northeastern Iraq, the largest being Kirkuk field; 2) carbonate rocks of the Mishrif Formation (Turonian–Cenomanian), in fields within the Mesopotamian fore-deep and Zagros foldbelt in southern and central Iraq, including Rumaila, West Qurna, Majnoon, Halfayah, Zubair, and Buzurgan fields; and 3) siliciclastic rocks of the Zubair Formation (Albian– Barremian), in fields within the Mesopotamian foredeep and Zagros foldbelt in southern and central Iraq, including East Baghdad, Rumaila, West Qurna, and Zubair fields. Large reserves also occur in carbonate rocks of the Upper Cretaceous above the Mishrif Formation and in the Lower Cretaceous below the Zubair Formation. Smaller reserves occur in other Neogene and Paleogene carbonates and siliciclastics, in Jurassic and Triassic carbonates, and in Ordovician siliciclastics. Most of the oil and gas that have been discovered were generated from organic-rich, oil-prone carbonates of the Jurassic Sargelu and Naokelekan Formations. These source rocks are widely distributed and mature for oil and gas generation across the Mesopotamian foredeep and Zagros foldbelt. Lesser amounts of oil and gas are derived from: 1) Upper and Lower Cretaceous oil-prone source rocks within the Zagros foldbelt; 2) Triassic oil-prone source rocks in northwestern Iraq; and 3) Silurian gas-prone source rocks in western Iraq. The oil generated from the Jurassic source rocks migrated vertically to fill stacked reservoir intervals in many fields. Lateral migration of oil occurred along the western margin of the Mesopotamian foredeep, as proven by small fields and large seeps that are located where source rocks are absent or immature for oil or gas generation. The tectonics and sedimentation during the Phanerozoic created the source-rich setting of Iraq. Sedimentation was widespread across Iraq during most of the Paleozoic, although intervals of strata are absent and interpreted either not to have been deposited or to have been eroded following deposition. A notable example is the absence of Early and Middle Devonian strata from Iraq. The distribution of Pre-Permian strata, including the gas-prone Silurian source rocks, and therefore the Paleozoic hydrocarbon system and plays, was controlled in large part by erosion at the unconformity that separates Late and Early Carboniferous. Following siliciclastic infill of the topography at this unconformity, Iraq was covered by platform-wide deposition of carbonate sediments on an east-dipping ramp in the Permian, Triassic, and Early Jurassic. Continental fragments rifted from the northern and eastern margins of Arabia during these times, after which a large portion of eastern Iraq subsided. This intra-shelf basin, named the Gotnia Basin, was the location of organic-rich “starved” sedimentation in the Middle to Late Jurassic that formed the important Sargelu and Naokelekan source rocks. The Gotnia Basin was rimmed by carbonate shelf margins. The Gotnia Basin filled with anhydrite and salt layers in the latest Jurassic and then continued to fill throughout the Cretaceous, primarily by prograding carbonate and siliciclastic sediments that entered the basin along the southern, western, and northern margins. These progradational deposits contain the major reservoir units of Iraq, whereas the basinal sediments include most of the sealing facies, predominantly marine shales, as well as some locally important source rocks. The basinal area continued to contract by sedimentary infill until the Turonian, when the Arabian plate was disturbed by a compressional event related to the initial closing of the Tethys Ocean. This event is marked by a hiatus in deposition and, at least locally, erosion at an unconformity. Faults were <b>inverted</b> and <b>folding</b> of anticlines in the Mesopotamian foredeep (and probably in the Zagros foldbelt) occurred at this event. Marine waters flooded across this unconformity in the Late Turonian and Coniacian, with renewed carbonate deposition. Ophiolites were obducted onto Arabia in the middle part of the Late Cretaceous and are present in far northeastern Iraq. At the same time, thick calcareous and muddy sediments filled rapidly subsiding extensional grabens present in western Iraq. A subsiding trough formed in the position of the existing Mesopotamian foredeep and Zagros foldbelt of Iraq, and siliciclastic sediments started to fill the deep-water trough from the north and northeast due to the encroaching Tethys closure. Basinal carbonate and shale were deposited {{in the center of the}} trough in the Paleocene and Eocene, while the basin was partly filled by prograding carbonate shelf margins located on the southwestern and north-eastern sides of the basin. This continued through the Oligocene and Early Miocene, until the remaining basins were filled with anhydrite of the Dhiban Formation and the overlying carbonates of the Jeribe Formation in the Early Miocene. Deposition throughout the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic provided the burial for the Mesozoic source rocks to generate oil and gas. Closure of the Tethys Ocean continued, with local uplift and erosion of areas of Iraq in the Early Miocene. Thick evaporitic deposits of the Fatha Formation lap onto and over the older Cenozoic strata. The marine seaway along the Mesopotamian foredeep was closed by the Middle Miocene, with ensuing non-marine siliciclastic deposition and folding associated with west-verging shortening deformation in the Zagros foldbelt. Oil and gas plays are proven and their distribution is well known for the Cenozoic and most of the Cretaceous. The deeper plays of the Lower Cretaceous, Jurassic, and older reservoirs are less well explored in the Mesopotamian foredeep, Gotnia Basin, and Kirkuk embayment of the Zagros foldbelt. Exploration is occurring in the marginally drilled interior of the Kurdistan region of the Zagros foldbelt in northeastern Iraq. Paleozoic plays in western Iraq are also marginally explored...|$|R
