5|$|They {{contain a}} wide array of physiognomical representations. Van Gogh's mental and {{physical}} condition is usually apparent; he may appear unkempt, unshaven or with a neglected beard, with deeply sunken eyes, a weak jaw, or having lost teeth. Some show him with <b>full</b> <b>lips,</b> a long face or prominent skull, or sharpened, alert features. His hair may be the usual red, or at times ash coloured.|$|E
5|$|The nude {{female figure}} is realistically sculpted in high-relief. Her eyes, beneath distinct, joined eyebrows, are hollow, presumably to accept some {{inlaying}} material– a feature common in stone, alabaster, and bronze sculptures of the time, but {{not seen in}} other Mesopotamian clay sculptures. Her <b>full</b> <b>lips</b> are slightly upturned at the corners. She is adorned with a four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk. Her head is framed by two braids of hair, with the bulk of {{her hair in a}} bun in the back and two wedge-shaped braids extending onto her breasts.|$|E
25|$|Cobb {{has been}} {{described}} as having a round shape, bushy eyebrows, <b>full</b> <b>lips,</b> and a triple chin, with a cigar always hanging from his mouth.|$|E
2500|$|Lip plumper is a {{cosmetic}} product {{used to make}} <b>lips</b> appear <b>fuller.</b> These products work by irritating {{the skin of the}} lips with ingredients such as Capsaicin. [...] This makes the lips swell slightly, temporarily creating the appearance of <b>fuller</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I am {{glad you}} are come! I {{could not have}} helped telling, {{if you had been}} away a whole week! But, Ethel, does papa believe it?" [...] Poor Mary's <b>full</b> <b>lip</b> swelled, and her eyes swam, ready to laugh or weep, in full faith in her sister's answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't, then," [...] she said, with a {{smile that}} showed her thin face at its {{thinnest}} and left her lip caught on her teeth till she brought it down voluntarily. It was a small but <b>full</b> <b>lip</b> and pretty, and this trick of it had a fascination. She added, gravely, [...] "I don't believe you will like my ice-tea." ...|$|R
25|$|Siska, {{a runaway}} little princess from the Realm of Darkness. Resembles Berengaria superficially. She has large, oblique and ice-grey eyes, <b>full</b> <b>lips,</b> and {{magnificent}} hair, straight, black and silk-shining. She distance to young Tsi and his animal, giant squirrel Tjick.|$|E
25|$|The {{descriptions}} of the title character in Carmilla and of Lucy in Dracula are similar, and have become archetypes for {{the appearance of the}} waif-like victims and seducers in vampire stories as being rosy-cheeked, slender, languid, and with large eyes, <b>full</b> <b>lips,</b> and soft voices. Additionally, both women sleepwalk.|$|E
25|$|<b>Full</b> <b>lips</b> with an accentuated border {{have often}} been {{associated}} with beauty and youth. Tribal peoples worldwide have introduced various materials into and through {{the upper and lower}} lips of all genders to enhance beauty. The perceived ideal size of lips has varied over time and in different cultures.|$|E
60|$|She {{had gone}} a little pale, and her white teeth were holding down her <b>full</b> under <b>lip.</b>|$|R
50|$|Females {{often have}} <b>fuller</b> <b>lips</b> than males so lip filling {{is often used}} in feminization. Injectable fillers are low risk but tend to absorbed after 6 months or so, and many {{implants}} have higher complication rates like infection or rejection. Use of fat harvested from the person can result in lumps and doesn't last long. The longest lasting and least risky results appear to arise from use of acellular dermis products.|$|R

25|$|Some {{art historians}} once {{identified}} {{the child as}} a young Cosimo I de' Medici, but it is now generally accepted to be Giulia. The child in the portrait {{appears to be a}} little girl, rather than a boy, and her expression is anxious. Maria Salviati, who is dressed soberly as befitted a widow, is seen sheltering the vulnerable child against her side. Art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues that the girl's demeanor in the portrait is different than would have been expected for the child Cosimo, whose family anticipated his role as a strong leader from his earliest days. It would have been to Cosimo I's advantage to commission a portrait depicting his mother as an exemplary widow, affectionately bringing up the orphaned daughter of Cosimo I's predecessor. The child's <b>full</b> <b>lips,</b> round nose, and curly reddish hair also bear little resemblance to known portraits of Cosimo as a child, though they do to portraits of the young Alessandro. Other girls of about the right age who were at court during this period also do not resemble the child in the portrait. The portrait might {{be one of the first}} in Renaissance-era Europe of a girl of presumed African and European ancestry. This painting is in the permanent collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
500|$|The tomb, {{along with}} many other {{artefacts}} from Lycia of the period, is in the Greek Archaic style. [...] If the dating is accurate (480–470BC) the Archaic style continued in Lycia for some time after it had become unfashionable in Greece. [...] The sculptures may have been carved by Ionian Greek craftsmen, if not they are heavily influenced by them. [...] There are some features of the carvings that definitely suggest a non-Greek origin. [...] The female faces have a sensuous look with <b>full</b> <b>lips</b> and large eyes that are typically Lycian.|$|E
500|$|The black hennin is long, {{truncated}} {{and relatively}} plain [...] with a transparent veil which falls {{around the back}} of her neck, resting briefly on her shoulder. Probably it was kept relatively unadorned so as not to distract from the [...] necklace. Her costume is mostly black or brown, with a wide but high neckline and white fur lined hems on the sleeves. Portinari has dark eyes, a strong nose, <b>full</b> <b>lips</b> and a pointed chin. Her visible hand, folded in prayer but unrealistically off center, wears what looks like a jeweled ring. The dark sleeves of her dress contain red or rouge velvet-like cloth tightened by a white belt. Her hair is shaved back to achieve the high forehead and sculptural look fashionable at the time.|$|E
60|$|He paused abruptly, and his {{somewhat}} <b>full,</b> sensitive <b>lips</b> were pressed tightly {{together as}} if to suppress an insistent outburst of passion.|$|R
50|$|Lips: Lips {{contain a}} huge number of nerve endings and are {{considered}} to be an erogenous zone. Men report experiencing more pleasure from the stimulation of their lips than women do (see below for sex differences in stimulation). In addition to stimulation of the lips by touching, men can be visually stimulated by looking at a woman’s lips. It has also been reported that men prefer women with <b>fuller</b> <b>lips</b> because they are an indicator of youth.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted up}} {{her face to}} his, and the <b>full</b> life-breathing <b>lips</b> met the wasted dying ones in a sacred kiss of promise.|$|R
2500|$|Like all {{the vampires}} in the Twilight series, Edward is {{described}} as being impossibly beautiful. At various points in the series, Bella compares him to the mythical Greek god Adonis. His skin is [...] "like marble"—very pale, ice cold, and sparkles in the sunlight. She describes his facial features as being perfect and angular—high cheekbones, strong jawline, a straight nose, and <b>full</b> <b>lips.</b> His hair, which is always messy, retains the unusual bronze shade that he inherited in his human life from his biological mother. His eyes, once green, are now described as topaz. His appearance changes if he goes too long without feeding: his eyes darken, becoming almost black, and purple bruises appear beneath his eyes. Edward is 6'2", and has a slender but muscular body.|$|E
60|$|Her <b>full</b> <b>lips,</b> drinking, smiled. Rather stale {{smell that}} incense leaves next day. Like foul flowerwater.|$|E

60|$|Miss Charlecote felt that, {{under the}} name of Phoebe, this last reproof was chiefly {{addressed}} to her; and perhaps Phoebe understood the same, for there was the slightest of all arch smiles about her <b>full</b> <b>lip</b> and downcast eye; and though she said nothing, her complete faith in her brother's explanation, and her Christian forgiveness of Lucilla, did not quench a strong reserve of wondering indignation at the mixed preferences that had thus strangely settled down upon the old curate.|$|R
5000|$|Dina Kennedy : Mike's younger sister, {{described}} as 'one {{of those old}} pen-and-ink sketches of fairies: slight as a dancer, with skin that never tans, <b>full</b> pale <b>lips</b> and huge blue eyes'.|$|R
60|$|Her arms round his knees, {{and she was}} {{exquisite}}ly beautiful, exquisite in her whole-hearted love, her whole-hearted abnegation--she, a proud Roman lady kneeling at his feet, her <b>full</b> red <b>lips</b> {{asking for}} a kiss.|$|R

60|$|He paused. There was a moment's silence. His {{face was}} within {{a foot of}} hers, lowering, black, bestial. Her eyes met his without a tremor. Her <b>full,</b> sweet <b>lips</b> only curved into a faintly contemptuous line.|$|R
500|$|A 1968 {{episode of}} , [...] "Plato's Stepchildren", which first aired on November 22, 1968, is often {{referred}} to as the first interracial kiss on American television. This claim is disputed by some who contend that in the scene in question, <b>full</b> <b>lip</b> contact between William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols did not occur, as the actors turned their heads away from the camera at the last moment to present the illusion of a kiss, meaning that this scene was not a true kiss. The latter point has been disputed, with Shatner claiming that he and Nichols' lips never fully touched and Nichols asserting that the kiss was real.|$|R

60|$|He {{stretched}} {{out his hand to}} meet that of a dapper, clean-shaven man, with hardly a hair on his head, a long, broken nose, <b>full</b> <b>lips,</b> and cold grey eyes under rectangular brows.|$|E
6000|$|He rose {{to go out}} of earshot. Then a door slammed, and he saw her at {{the window}} above him, her waist on a level with his head; flushed, with her grey eyes ominously bright, her <b>full</b> <b>lips</b> parted. And he said: ...|$|E
60|$|The finely-arched brow was {{a little}} elevated, the soft dark eyes were fully opened, the nostril of the {{delicate}} nose slightly dilated, the small, yet rich, <b>full</b> <b>lips</b> just parted; and over the clear, transparent visage, there played a vivid glance of gratified intelligence.|$|E

40|$|Audio-driven facial {{animation}} is {{an interesting}} and evolving technique for human-computer interaction. Based on an incoming audio stream, a face image is animated with <b>full</b> <b>lip</b> synchronization. This requires a speech recognition system in the language in which audio is provided to get the time alignment for the phonetic sequence of the audio signal. However, building a speech recognition system is data intensive and is a very tedious and time consuming task. We present a novel scheme to implement a language independent system for audio-driven facial animation given a speech recognition system for just one language, in our case, English. The method presented here {{can also be used}} for text to audio-visual speech synthesis. 1...|$|R
