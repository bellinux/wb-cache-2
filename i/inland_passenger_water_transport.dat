40|$|Fabrics with {{automatic}} one-way <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> ability are highly desirable for applications in daily life, industry, health, and defense. However, {{most of the}} studies on one-way <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> fabrics only report the qualitative <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> results. The lack of quantitative measure makes it hard to assess the directional transport quality. Here, it is proved that a hydrophilic fabric after being electrosprayed with a thin layer of hydrophobic coating on one side shows one-way <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> ability. By using moisture management tester, the <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> property is qualitatively characterized and the effect of hydrophobic fabric layer thickness on one-way <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> feature is examined. The hydrophobic fabric layer thickness is found to {{play a key role in}} deciding the one-way transport ability. When a plain woven fabric with an overall thickness of 420 μm and average pore size of 33 μm is used as fabric substrate, a hydrophobic fabric layer thickness between 22 and 62 μm allows the treated fabric to show a one-way droplet transport feature.

40|$|Quantification of free <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> in peritoneal {{dialysis}}. BackgroundIn {{peritoneal dialysis}} (PD) total net ultrafiltration (NUF) {{is dependent on}} transport through small pores and through water channels in the peritoneum. These channels are impermeable to solutes, and therefore, crystalloid osmotic-induced free <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> occurs through them. Several indirect methods to assess free <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> have been suggested. The difference in NUF between a 3. 86 % and a 1. 36 % solution gives a rough indication, but is very time consuming. The magnitude of the dip in dialysate/plasma (D/P) sodium in the initial phase of a 3. 86 % exchange {{is another way to}} estimate free <b>water</b> <b>transport.</b> In the present study, a method was applied to calculate free <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> by calculating sodium-associated <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> in one single 3. 86 % glucose dwell. MethodsForty PD patients underwent one standard peritoneal permeability analysis (SPA) with a 1. 36 % glucose solution, and another with a 3. 86 % glucose solution. At different time points intraperitoneal volume and sodium concentration were assessed. This made it possible to calculate total sodium transport. By subtracting this transport (which must have occurred through the small pores) from the total fluid <b>transport,</b> free <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> remained. These results were compared with the other methods to estimate free <b>water</b> <b>transport.</b> ResultsFor the 1. 36 % glucose dwell, total transcapillary ultrafiltration in the first hour (TCUF 0 - 60) was 164 mL, transport through the small pores was 129 mL, and free <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> was 35 mL (21 %). For the 3. 86 % glucose solution, total TCUF 0 - 60 was 404 mL, transport through the small pores was 269 mL, and free <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> was 135 mL (34 %). The contribution of free <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> in the first minute (TCUF 0 - 1) was 39 % of the total fluid transport. From the 40 patients, 11 patients had ultrafiltration failure (NUF < 400 mL after 4 hours). For these patients the contribution of free water to TCUF 0 - 1 was significantly lower than for those with normal ultrafiltration (20 % vs. 48 %, P < 0. 05). A strong correlation was present between free <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> as a percentage of total fluid transport and the maximum dip in D/P sodium (r = 0. 84). The correlation was not significant with the difference in net ultrafiltration of 3. 86 % and 1. 36 % solutions (r = 0. 24, P = 0. 3). ConclusionThe method applied here is the first direct quantification of free <b>water</b> <b>transport,</b> calculated from a single standard peritoneal function test. It offers a quick possibility to evaluate patients suffering from ultrafiltration failure. In these patients free <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> was impaired, but the origin of this impairment is still to be determined...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of both pore structure and <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> on {{the durability of}} porous building stones is evaluated. The {{aim of this study}} on porous building stones was to establish direct relationships between pore structure and <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> using a principal component analysis. The pore structure was described in terms of its porosity, pore size distribution (quantified by mean pore radius) and specific surface area whilst <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> was characterised by means of water permeability (saturated flow) and capillary imbibition (unsaturated flow). The principal component analysis shows that there is a positive correlation between <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> coefficients (permeability and capillary absorption) and pore radius, whereas a negative correlation is recorded as regards surface area. A linear relationship between the square root of permeability and capillary absorption coefficient is also found, which may be easily estimated by means of a simple capillary imbibition test. Moreover, the principal component analysis presents the influences of <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> and pore structure parameters on durability, quantified by the percentage of weight loss after salt crystallization. Thus, durability has a negative correlation with pore radius and <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> coefficients, and a positive correlation with the surface area. As a consequence, <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> is closely related to pore structure properties and is a reliable indication of the durability of porous building stones...|$|R

40|$|Tidal {{propagation}} in, {{and division}} of net <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> over different channels in an estuarine network are analyzed using a newly developed idealized model. The water motion {{in this model}} is governed by the cross-sectionally averaged shallow water equations and is forced by tides at the seaward boundaries and by river discharge. Approximate analytical solutions are constructed {{by means of a}} harmonic truncation and a perturbation expansion in a small parameter, being the ratio of tidal amplitude and depth. The net <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> results from an imposed river discharge and from residual <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> generated by nonlinear tidal rectification. Two new drivers are identified that contribute to the net <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> in tidal estuarine networks, viz. the generation of residual <b>water</b> <b>transport</b> due to gradients in dynamic pressure and due to a coupling between the tidally averaged and quarter diurnal currents through the quadratic bottom stress.
