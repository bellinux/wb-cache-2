At the time the project was being driven primarily by Captain Harding of the US Navy, and they were concentrating entirely on a shipboard system. Dippy convinced them that an airborne version was definitely possible, leading to some interest by the US Army Air Force. The Navy was unhappy about this turn of events. Dippy also instituted a number of simple changes that would prove extremely useful in practice. Among these, he outright demanded that the airborne LORAN receivers be built physically similar to the Gee receivers, so that they could be swapped out in service simply by replacing the receiver unit. This would prove extremely useful; RAF Transport Command aircraft could swap their receivers when moving to or from the Australian theatre. Dippy also designed the ground station timing equipment.|$|E
2500|$|LORAN, {{short for}} long range navigation, was a {{hyperbolic}} {{radio navigation system}} developed in the United States during World War II.

2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to switch to}} the long-range role meant that the high accuracy of the <b>Gee</b> <b>system</b> was not needed, which greatly reduced the {{need to address the}} timing problems. This change in purpose also demanded the use of lower frequencies, which could reflect off the ionosphere at night and thus provide over-the-horizon operation. Two frequency bands were initially selected, 1.85 and 1.95MHz for nighttime use (160 meters), and 7.5MHz (40 meters). The 7.5MHz, labeled [...] "HF" [...] on early receivers, was never used operationally.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Both gastrojejunostomy (GJJ) and stent {{placement}} {{are commonly}} used palliative treatments of obstructive symptoms caused by malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). OBJECTIVE: Compare GJJ and stent placement. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized trial. SETTING: Twenty-one centers in The Netherlands. PATIENTS: Patients with GOO. INTERVENTIONS: GJJ and stent placement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were medical effects, quality of life, and costs. Analysis was by intent to treat. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were randomized to GJJ and 21 to stent placement. Food intake improved more rapidly after stent placement than after GJJ (<b>GOO</b> Scoring <b>System</b> score > or = 2 : median 5 vs 8 days, respectively; P <. 01) but long-term relief was better after GJJ, with more patients living more days with a <b>GOO</b> Scoring <b>System</b> score of 2 or more than after stent placement (72 vs 50 days, respectively; P =. 05). More major complications (stent: 6 in 4 patients vs GJJ: 0; P =. 02), recurrent obstructive symptoms (stent: 8 in 5 patients vs GJJ: 1 in 1 patient; P =. 02), and reinterventions (stent: 10 in 7 patients vs GJJ: 2 in 2 patients; P <. 01) were observed after stent placement compared with GJJ. When stent obstruction was not regarded as a major complication, no differences in complications were found (P =. 4). There were also no differences in median survival (stent: 56 days vs GJJ: 78 days) and quality of life. Mean total costs of GJJ were higher compared with stent placement ($ 16, 535 vs $ 11, 720, respectively; P =. 049 [comparing medians]). Because of the small study population, only initial hospital costs would have been statistically significant if the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing had been applied. LIMITATIONS: Relatively small patient population. CONCLUSIONS: Despite slow initial symptom improvement, GJJ was associated with better long-term results and is therefore the treatment of choice in patients with a life expectancy of 2 months or longer. Because stent placement was associated with better short-term outcomes, this treatment is preferable for patients expected to live less than 2 months.

40|$|Enteral stent {{placement}} {{has emerged}} as a safe and effective palliative treatment option for patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). In an attempt to further optimize this treatment new enteral stents have been designed. This study is the first to describe the results regarding technical success, clinical success, complication rate, and stent dysfunction of the Evolution duodenal stent (Cook Medical, Limerick, Ireland). A total of 46 patients with symptomatic malignant GOO were included in this prospective multicenter cohort study. All patients who successfully received an Evolution duodenal stent were followed until death. The technical and clinical success rates were 89 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 77 % - 95 %) and 72 % (95 %CI 58 % - 83 %), respectively. The <b>GOO</b> Scoring <b>System</b> score, the Global Health Score, and the EuroQol visual analog scale improved significantly (GOOSS and Global Health Score P < 0. 0001; EuroQol P = 0. 005) when scores before stenting were compared with scores after stent placement. Median survival was 87 days, and stent patency was observed in 67 % for up to 395 days, accounting for death unrelated to the stent as a competing risk. Stent dysfunction occurred in 14 patients (30 %) (stent ingrowth n = 9; stent migration n = 2; extrinsic compression on the stent n = 2; food impaction n = 1).

Palliation of obstruction {{is the primary}} aim of treatment in these patients. Self-expandable metal stents have emerged as a promising treatment option. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} safety and efficacy of a new non-foreshortening nitinol duodenal stent. A total of 52 patients with symptomatic malignant GOO were studied in this prospective multicenter cohort study. All patients received a D-Weave Niti-S duodenal stent (Taewoong Medical, Seoul, South Korea). Patients were followed up until withdrawal of informed consent or death. The cause of GOO was pancreatic cancer in the majority of patients (62 %). The technical and clinical success rates were 96 % and 77 %, respectively. The <b>GOO</b> Scoring <b>System</b> score improved significantly (P < 0. 0001) when the scores before stenting were compared with the mean scores until death. Median survival was 82 days and stent patency was observed in 75 % for up to 190 days, accounting for death as a competing risk. In 13 patients (25 %) stent dysfunction occurred (tumor ingrowth in 11, stent migration in two). Over time, the body mass index, the World Health Organization performance score, and the EuroQol visual analog scale revealed a not significant change (P = 0. 52, P = 0. 43, and P = 0. 15, respectively), whereas the global health status improved significantly (P = 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Gastric outlet {{obstruction}} (GOO) is {{most commonly}} a complication of advanced distal gastric, periampullary, or duodenal malignancy. Palliation of obstruction {{is the primary}} aim of treatment {{in most of these}} patients. Self-expandable metal stents have emerged as an effective treatment option. Objective: Our purpose was to investigate the efficacy and safety of a newly developed enternal metal stent (WallFlex) Design: Prospective multicenter cohort study. Setting: Three tertiary referral centers (2 academic). Patients: Fifty-one consecutive patients with symptomatic malignant GOO from January 2005 to February 2006. Intervention: Placement of a self-expandable metallic stent (WallFlex). Main Outcome Measurements: The primary end point was defined as improvement of the <b>GOO</b> scoring <b>system</b> {{for the remainder of the}} patient's lives. Secondary end points focused on efficacy and safety and global quality of life. Results: The Gastric Outlet Obstruction Scoring System score improved (P <. 001), the body mass index decreased (P <. 001), and the World Health Organization performance score improved (P =. 002) when the score before stenting was compared with the mean score until death. Global Of life did not improve. Technical and clinical success was achieved in 98 % and 84 % of the patients. Median survival was 62 days (75 % alive at 35 days, 25 % alive at 156 days). Median stent patents was 307 days (75 % functional at 135 days, 25 % functional at 470 days). Stent dysfunctional was proven in 7 patients (14 %), migration in 1 (2 %), and tumor overgrowth or ingrowth in 6 (12 %) Limitations: Lick of a control group. Conclusion: Placement of a WallFlex enternal stent in patients with nonresectable malignant GOO is safe and provides a statistically significant and clinically relevant relief of obstructive symptoms with a low need for reintervention.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} duodenal stenting for palliation of gastroduodenal malignant obstruction by using a gastric outlet obstruction score (GOOS). METHODS: A prospective, non-randomized study was performed at a tertiary center between August 2005 and April 2010. Patients were eligible if they had malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) and were not candidates for surgical treatment. Medical history and patient demographics were collected at baseline. Scheduled interviews were made {{on the day of}} the procedure and 15, 30, 90 and 180 d later or unscheduled as necessary. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (6 male, 9 female; median age 61 years) with GOO who had undergone duodenal stenting were evaluated. Ten patients had metastasis at baseline (66. 6 %) and 14 were unable to accept oral intake (93. 33 %), including 7 patients who were using a feeding tube. Laboratory data showed biliary obstruction in eight cases (53. 33 %); all were submitted to biliary drainage. Two patients developed obstructive symptoms due to tumor ingrowth after 30 d and another due to tumor overgrowth after 180 d. Two cases of stent migration occurred. A good response to treatment was observed, with a mean time of approximately 1 d (19 h) until toleration of a liquid diet and slightly more than 2 d for both soft solids (51 h) and a solid food/normal diet (55 h). The mean time to first failure to maintain liquid intake (GODS >= 1) was 93 d. During follow-up, the mean time to first failure to maintain the previously achieved GODS of 2 - 3 (solid/semi-solid food), considered technical failure, was 71 d. On the basis of oral intake a GODS is defined: 0 for no oral intake; 1 for liquids only; 2 for soft solids only; 3 for low-residue or full diet. CONCLUSION: Enteral stenting to alleviate gastroduodenal malignant obstruction improves quality of life in patients with limited life expectancy, which can be evaluated by using a <b>GOO</b> scoring <b>system.</b> (C) 2012 Baishideng.

50|$|Truhe: This {{system was}} based on the British <b>GEE</b> <b>system.</b> After British units were {{captured}} the Germans set up a project to 'clone' the units. The first unit was the FuG 122 which allowed the reception of British GEE signals. Units in France received these units and were able to navigate using British signals. The Germans then developed the concept to produce FuG 123 receivers which would allow a wider turning range. This allowed the Germans to setup GEE chains of their own further inside Germany where the British GEE signals were unusable. There seems to have been some idea of using frequencies very close to the British frequencies to make jamming by the Allies hard to do without jamming their own <b>GEE</b> <b>system.</b> One chain became operational around Berlin.|$|E

50|$|Eager to {{test the}} <b>Gee</b> <b>system,</b> {{prototype}} sets were used on target indicator aircraft well before the production sets were available in the number required for large raids. On 15 May 1941, such a set provided an accurate fix at a range of 400 miles {{at an altitude of}} 10,000 feet. The first full transmitter chain was completed in July 1941, but in testing over the North Sea the sets proved to be unreliable. This was traced to the power supplies and tubes, and corrections were designed and proved that summer.|$|E
5000|$|By {{this time}} the team had become much more {{familiar}} with the British <b>Gee</b> <b>system,</b> and were aware of their work on [...] "strobes", a time base generator that produced well-positioned [...] "pips" [...] on the display {{that could be used for}} accurate measurement. They met with the Gee team in 1941, and immediately adopted this solution. They also found that Project 3 and Gee called for almost identical systems, with similar performance, range and accuracy. But Gee had already completed basic development and was entering into initial production, making Project 3 superfluous.|$|E

The 7.5 MHz, labeled [...] "HF" [...] on early receivers, was never used operationally.|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} Loran-C. Testing {{of the new}} system was intensive, and overwater flights around Bermuda {{demonstrated}} that 50% of fixes lay within a 260 foot m circle. This was a dramatic improvement over the original Loran-A, meeting the accuracy of the <b>Gee</b> <b>system</b> but at much greater range. The first chain were set up using the original experimental Cytac system, along with a second in the Mediterranean in 1957. Further chains covering the North Atlantic and large areas of the Pacific followed. At the time global charts were printed with shaded sections representing the area where a 3 mile km accurate fix could be obtained under most operational conditions.|$|E
5000|$|A {{more useful}} system was {{introduced}} in the <b>Gee</b> <b>system,</b> which used two timed signals that allowed the navigator on the bomber to determine their location. It could be used anywhere within line-of-sight of the transmitter stations in the UK, and generally provided a reasonable signal up to about 500 km, depending on the aircraft's altitude. Gee was read on an oscilloscope display about [...] across, which limited the accuracy of the timing measurements. As a result, Gee was accurate on the order of kilometers, which was extremely useful for navigation and area bombing, but did not provide the accuracy needed for pinpoint bombing.|$|E
5000|$|When {{examining}} the signal on the expanded display, timing {{was based on}} 1/10th of a Gee unit, or 6.66 μs. This corresponds to a distance of 1.24 mi. It was assumed that an operator under good conditions could measure the peaks of the pulse envelope within a 1/10th of a calibration mark, or 0.124 mi. This is the basic accuracy of the <b>Gee</b> <b>system,</b> at least at shorter ranges and at [...] In practice the accuracy was a function of range from the transmitters, varying roughly with the square of distance. At short ranges accuracies of 165 yd were reported, while at long range over Germany it was quoted to about 1 mi.|$|E
50|$|O’Brien's friend, Harvey F. Schwarz, {{was chief}} {{engineer}} of the Decca Record company in England. In 1939 O’Brien sent him {{details of the}} system {{so it could be}} put forward to the British military. Initially Robert Watson-Watt reviewed the system but he did not follow it up, deeming it too easily jammed (and likely due to the existing work on the <b>Gee</b> <b>system,</b> being carried out by Watt's group). However, in October 1941 the British Admiralty Signal Establishment (ASE) became interested in the system, which was then classified as Admiralty Outfit QM. O’Brien brought the Californian equipment to the UK and conducted the first marine trials between Anglesey and the Isle of Man, at frequencies of 305/610 kHz, on 16 September 1942.|$|E
50|$|Further {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in the northern Irish Sea in April 1943 at 70/130 kHz. It was decided that the original frequencies were not ideal, and a new system using a 14 kHz inter-signal spacing was selected. This led to the common 5, 6, 8 and 9f frequencies, used throughout {{the life of the}} Decca system. 7f was reserved for a Loran-C-like extension, but never developed. A follow-up test was carried out in the Irish Sea in January 1944 to test a wide variety of upgrades and production equipment. By this time the competing <b>Gee</b> <b>system</b> was known to the Admiralty and the two systems were tested head-to-head under the code names QM and QH. QM was found to have better sea-level range and accuracy, which led to its adoption.|$|E
50|$|Multilateration is {{a common}} {{technique}} in radio navigation systems, where it is known as hyperbolic navigation. These systems are relatively easy to construct {{as there is no}} need for a common clock, and the difference in the signal timing can be measured visibly using an oscilloscope. This formed the basis of a number of widely used navigation systems starting in World War II with the British <b>Gee</b> <b>system</b> and several similar systems introduced over the next few decades. The introduction of the microprocessor greatly simplified operation, greatly increasing popularity during the 1980s. The most popular hyperbolic navigation system was LORAN-C, which was used around the world until the system was shut down in 2010. Other systems continue to be used, but the widespread use of satellite navigation systems like GPS have made these systems largely redundant.|$|E

50|$|The first {{hyperbolic}} {{system to}} be developed was the British <b>Gee</b> <b>system,</b> developed during World War II. Gee used a series of transmitters sending out precisely timed signals, with the signals leaving the stations at fixed delays. An aircraft using Gee, RAF Bomber Command's heavy bombers, examined the time of arrival on an oscilloscope at the navigator's station. If the signal from two stations arrived at the same time, the aircraft must be an equal distance from both transmitters, allowing the navigator to determine a line of position on his chart of all the positions at that distance from both stations. More typically, the signal from one station would be received earlier than the other. The difference in timing between the two signals would reveal them to be along a curve of possible locations. By making similar measurements with other stations, additional lines of position can be produced, leading to a fix. Gee was accurate to about 165 yards (150 m) at short ranges, and up to a mile (1.6 km) at longer ranges over Germany. Gee remained in use long after World War II, and equipped RAF aircraft {{as late as the}} 1960s (approx freq was by then 68 MHz).|$|E
