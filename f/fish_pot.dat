40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{response of}} fish to pots is poorly understood {{but is a}} vital component of the fish capture process. Here, the behaviour of gadoids prior to and after capture in different baited <b>fish</b> <b>pot</b> designs was observed using in situ video footage. Bottom set and floated/lifted versions, respectively, of a collapsible and of a rigid pot were compared. A low entrance and high escape rate limited cod (Gadus morhua) catches, whilst a low encounter rate limited saithe (Pollachius virens) catches. Both species approached pots by swimming upstream. Cod tended to encounter and inspect pots more than saithe, which showed more cautious responses, characterised by a reluctance to inspect the pots at close range. Cod were thus more likely to enter the pots, and these differences in behaviour explain the observed differences in capture efficiency between the species. Once inside the pot, cod showed slow swimming (milling) and tended to search the pot walls in attempts to escape. Saithe tended to hang still and {{were less likely to}} escape than cod. With regards to the effect of pot design on behaviour, cod encountered pots less when they were floated/lifted above the seabed whilst saithe encountered floated and bottom set pots at the same rate. Entrance and escape rates for both species were not affected by floating collapsible pots above the seabed. The probability of capture for a fish was dependant on species and fish size, as well as social attraction and repulsion effects from other fish already caught. The findings of this study have important implications for future pot design and optimisation and contribute towards efforts to establish a pot fishery for gadoids in Norway...|$|E
40|$|Humphead wrasse, {{known as}} the Napoleon fish (Cheilinus undulatus), is the largest living {{member of the family}} Labridae. It is slow growing but can grow to a maximum size {{exceeding}} 2 m and 190 kg. This species was the first commercially important coral reef food fish to be listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix II in 2004 because of its vulnerable status and the ongoing threat to its conservation from international trade. Like many coral reef fishes, the humphead wrasse, Cheilinus undulatus, aggregate in reef areas when they spawn and this spawning behaviour makes them highly vulnerable to overfishing. Assessment of the spawning aggregations of this species was conducted in the municipalities of Sibutu and Sitangkai in the province of Tawi-Tawi, Philippines. Key informant interviews (KII) with fishermen, mariculturists, and other stakeholders and focus group discussions (FGD) with local government leaders, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management (FARMC) members, mariculturists, and exporters were conducted. Guided by the results of these KII and FGDs, underwater visual census of mameng (local common name for Napoleon wrasse) populations (juvenile and mature) were conducted to document spawning aggregation sites. Since there was no photo-documentation of actual spawning aggregations of mameng in the reef areas, indirect measures were used. Result of the KII and FGD indicated that the Baligtang Reef in Sipangkot and Tando Owak are major sources of spawners. Anecdotal accounts of Bajau fishermen showed that Dungun Dungon, Baligtang reef, Tando Owak and Tugalan are traditional fishing grounds for mameng spawning aggregations. From the length-frequency analysis of mameng caught by hook and line and <b>fish</b> <b>pot</b> in the Baligtang Reef in Sipangkot, the estimated length at maturity of this species was found to be 25 - 35 cm. There were 134 individuals caught within this size range so they are considered potential spawners. Another indirect proof used was the underwater documentation of juvenile humphead wrasse which were regularly observed and photographed in association with seagrass beds and branching coral reefs in Baligtang Reef in Sipangkot, Sitangkai. Gonadal study also indicated that the mameng caught in this area had mature and ripe gonads but the number of mature fish depends on the season. These were the basis of declaring Spawning Aggregation Sites in Tando Owak and Dungun Dungun in Sibutu and Baligtang Reef, Sipangkot and Tugalan in Sitangkai. These were declared as marine protected areas by ordinance of the municipal Sangguniang Bayan of the two municipalities. Management and enforcement plans have been developed and Bantay Dagat have been trained to protect the spawning aggregations and this strategy aims to protect the wild stocks of humphead wrasse. Protecting the spawners would ensure that there would be enough recruits, prevent recruitment overfishing and enhance the wild stocks...|$|E

40|$|In fisheries, catch counts {{consist of}} non-negative values, usually with excess zeros {{and a heavy}} right tail. Several {{generalized}} linear models {{can be used in}} the analysis of such data since these methods do not rely on the assumption of normality. In our study, the question of interest is to determine the effect of vent sizes in <b>fishing</b> <b>pots</b> on the count of legal and sublegal black sea bass, after removing important effects such as vessel, string within vessel, soaking time, and <b>fishing</b> <b>pot</b> position. In the experiments, four pots were investigated with various circular escape vent sizes (2. 382 ̆ 2, 2. 752 ̆ 2, 3. 102 ̆ 2, and 3. 402 ̆ 2 as the diameter). Our main interest is to find out the ideal vent size which gives the best legal size black sea bass catch count and minimizes the sublegal size catch count. ^ The Poisson regression model is the most widely used methodology to analyze count data. Different Poisson models are used in the analysis of the black sea bass catch count. We start with the standard Poisson model, and continue with the regression for Poisson rates. In order to account for over-dispersion, a Poisson model with scaled deviance as well as a negative binomial regression model are discussed. Since the count data contain excess zero counts, a Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP) model is used. From the results of the last analysis, we can conclude that over-dispersion is not only induced by excess zero counts in the data, but also contributed by the right tail. ^ Because of the hierarchical structure in parts of the data, random components are introduced in the above mentioned models by assuming random intercepts. The mixed effect models are fitted to the black sea bass catch count data using Poisson, negative binomial, ZIP and Zero Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) models. All mixed effect models are fitted using both parametric and Bayesian approaches to analysis. After comparison of the performance of all models, the ZINB model is recognized as the best fitting model as indicated by smallest Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) and Negative Cross-validatory Log-likelihood (NLL) values when using a Bayesian approach. ^ Ninety-five percent credible intervals are computed for both legal and sublegal size black sea bass, and we conclude that vent sizes of 2. 382 ̆ 2 and 2. 752 ̆ 2 have larger average counts of legal size black sea bass than pots with vent sizes of 3. 102 ̆ 2 or 3. 402 ̆ 2, after adjusting for important covariates; vent sizes of 2. 752 ̆ 2 have significantly less sublegal catch counts than vent sizes of 2. 382 ̆ 2 and 3. 102 ̆ 2, as well as having a tendency to hold less sublegal catch than 3. 402 ̆ 2. Therefore, we can conclude that a vent size of 2. 752 ̆ 2 is the ideal choice, since it maximizes the retention of legal size black sea bass {{and at the same time}} minimizes the retention of sublegal size black sea bass in the <b>fishing</b> <b>pots.</b> ...|$|R

In order to explore the potential social resilience of marine-dependent livelihoods to environmental change, interviews with fishers and marine-based tourism operators in the Caribbean island of Anguilla were undertaken, to identify the impacts of hurricane events on marine livelihoods, the perceptions of resource-users and their potential adaptability to future change. For both sectors of resource-users, {{there is evidence that}} they have diversified livelihoods to achieve financial security, which may provide resilience to future climate related impacts or resource variability. In addition, specific behavioural changes that have been developed following previous hurricane events, e. g. removal of <b>fish</b> <b>pots</b> during hurricane months, or bringing boats to shore, indicate fishers' flexibility to changing conditions. However, strong personal and cultural attachment to occupations, particularly among fishers, may hinder resilience. Additionally, the reliance of all of these marine resource-users on the climate-dependent tourism industry may undermine their capacity to cope with future environmental change. Many of these problems are common throughout the Caribbean, as thousands of marine-dependent livelihoods are vulnerable to marine degradation and climate change impacts.

On the other hand, fishing traps has experienced less changes, in terms of the fishing methods, but the increase in power of the boats (going from rawing to onboard engines, ultrasound incorporation, etc) and the introduction of winch that facilitate the knitting of the pots, has multiplied the fishing power of the boats and has consequently, the effort performed (going from taking 10 - 15 <b>fishing</b> <b>pots</b> per <b>fishing</b> day in the 80 s to 40 - 50 nowadays).

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the size {{selectivity}} of cod in static fishing gears such as pots and traps. In this field study, floating <b>fishing</b> <b>pots</b> were equipped with 40, 45 and 50 mm square mesh escape windows in order to estimate the size selectivity of cod at different mesh sizes. Relationships between selectivity parameters and mesh size, as well as an optimal mesh size for the escape window with respect to current minimum landing size of cod in the Baltic Sea were sought. The results show that the floating pot is not only species selective when used in the Baltic Sea cod fishery, the implementation of an escape window reduced the proportion of undersized bycatch in the pots by more than 90 %. The estimated length at 50 % retention was found to be a direct function of fish body length (girth) and mesh size of the escape window, while the estimated selection range remained unchanged regardless of mesh size. Optimal mesh size, with respect to the length at 50 % retention and current minimal landing size of 38 cm in the Baltic, was determined to be 45 mm. Strong indications (significant on the 0. 01 probability level in the case of 50 and 40 mm escape windows) suggested that the relative fishing power of the pots increased with the implementation of an escape window. This result could be explained as a "saturation effect", i. e. the probability of cod entering the pot is likely to be negatively dependent on cod density in the pot. The high species selectivity and the low catch rate of undersized fish have consolidated the floating pots position as a highly benign fishing method and the foremost alternative gear for the future coastal cod fishery in the Baltic Sea.
