Using PIEMINV, an original dataset of European industry patents in the Italian region of Piedmont, we analyse the characteristics of inventors with diverse experience in projects involving interactions with universities, governed by <b>institutional</b> <b>contracts</b> or personal contracts. Our results suggest that reliance among inventors of the two forms of governance is almost equal, and that unilateral governance forms are preferred when there are high levels of trust among the parties based on embeddedness in local social and education networks. This is likely because it involves less cumbersome and more direct interactions. We find also that knowledge characteristics are not particularly important discriminants of the choice between governance forms: the advantage of shared governance seems to reside mainly in the possibility to mitigate monitoring and asymmetric information problems in contexts of relatively low levels of mutual knowledge and trust...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{decentralized}} development approaches have {{been encouraged to}} realize the goal of poverty reduction. In the agricultural sector Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) and Joint Forest Management (JFM) projects have been promoted {{with a view to}} improve service provision in a watershed context. Improved service provision it is presumed would improve access of resource poor households to watershed services such as irrigation and Non Timber Forest Products (NTFP’s). Improved access to watershed services it is argued would reduce poverty through increases in agricultural productivity and farm incomes. This paper draws on evidence from a post-project evaluation of a Ford Foundation supported watershed management project in northern India to argue that participatory watershed management projects need not necessarily safeguard the interests of poorer rural households. We demonstrate that given a particular <b>institutional</b> <b>contract</b> as in Haryana, irrigation service provision by contractors proved to be more effective than provision by a community organization in ensuring that water allocation, collection of Irrigation Service Fees (ISF) and routine maintenance of irrigation infrastructure was undertaken.

This type of management accounting behavior is called income smoothing or income smoothing behavior. Provided that other conditions are identical, managers prefer smoothed income to income that fluctuates greatly. Smoothed income enables a firm to avoid discounting in the capital market owing to business performance fluctuation and simultaneously brings about desirable consequences with respect to <b>institutional</b> <b>contracts</b> the firm has entered into with stakeholders (financial covenants, delisting requirements, management compensation contracts, etc.).

40|$|Public-private {{partnerships}} {{have emerged}} {{in recent years as}} an important policy option to ensure service provision in the water resources sector. However, there is very little analysis of past experience of partnerships between the public sector and various arms of the private sector: water companies, NGO's or even farmers groups. Further, there is limited conceptualization of what is meant by partnerships between the public and private sectors.

Today’s system of funding the public higher education system {{is based on the assumption}} that the state has the obligation to provide the funding, while the institutions and the students carry little responsibility compared to the resources allocated to them. Without an own financial effort from the student s’ side comes little responsibility for the quality of the received tuition, while without financial effort on the educational institution’s side there is little preoccupation for providing a quality service. It is of the utmost urgency that the present funding system be modified, in a fashion that would allow creating an educational system acting as a competitive educational services market, where the access to state funds should be granted selectively to universities and students depending on the performance demonstrated by certain indicators.

40|$|As {{networked}} {{information services}} on the Internet continue to grow, so {{the problem for}} libraries of controlling access and management of these services increases. There are three problem areas for libraries: • computer security with regard to open networks: confidentiality, identification and authentication, and document integrity • authorisation: who is authorised to do what on which resources? • cost recovery: libraries will need to develop cost recovery charging mechanisms {{as the amount of}} electronic information increases and the costs of electronic licences rise. Current approaches to networked access to electronic information sources favour user direct access and payment, or institutional site licences. Both methods involve multiple connections and interfaces. The former also requires multiple registration procedures and different payment systems while the latter provides no cost-recovery mechanism for libraries. Moreover both approaches give rise to inflation in information prices. Against this background, smart cards are being introduced in libraries as means of controlling user identity and of electronic payment. But current applications in libraries of campus cards and of public payment cards do not yet integrate all the functionalities required by libraries. The TOLIMAC project aims to meet libraries' requirements in terms of user authentication, authorisation, secure communication and charging mechanism. It has developed a smart card-based management system of networked information services for libraries, providing access control and payment mechanisms. These new functionalities enable libraries to agree a new type of <b>institutional</b> <b>contract</b> with providers, based on actual use of their services. By placing libraries as key intermediaries between users and providers, the TOLIMAC system sets a new electronic information management concept for access control and charging functions.

40|$|Institutions are strikingly {{absent from}} most {{economic}} theory, certainly from growth theory. In standard theory {{it is simply}} assumed that the needed institutional environment is there,within which economic agents can make their optimizing decisions. At the same time, indescriptive growth studies, particularly in economic history and most influentially inNorth (1990), the importance of good <b>institutional</b> <b>contract</b> enforcement has been emphasizedfor long. Good institutions guarantee property rights and minimize transaction costs,creating an environment conducive to economic growth. The considerable sunk costs of mostinvestments create large disincentives against binding resources to projects in an uncertain institutional environment. Until recently, empirical studies measuring just how important institutions are for growthand investment have been scarce. This has mainly been {{due to a lack}} of data concerning thequality of institutions. It is obviously impossible to find data which totally conforms toa most broad definition of institutions such as Schmieding's (1993, p. 233), stating thatthey ' [...] . encompass not only bureaucracies and administrations but also, and moreimportantly, the entire body of formal laws, rules and regulations as well as theinformal conventions and patterns of behavior that constitute the non-budget constraintsunder which economic agents can pursue their own individual ends'. Nevertheless, there hasincreasingly been data around which at least describes specific aspects of this definition,which covers both 'rule of law', or 'formal' institutions (enforced by the state), and'civil society', or 'informal' institutions (enforced by convention). This data has beenused to construct measures of the quality of institutions which have been applied in(cross-country) growth empirics. The initial studies have proxied the quality ofinstitutions indirectly, using universally observable and thus 'objective' measures. Recently some studies have used more direct ways to try and capture the quality ofinstitutions, using survey and thus 'subjective' measures. In this paper the most important empirical studies on the relationship betweeninstitutions and growth and investment, and the applications to transition countries,will be surveyed. A special focus on transition countries is considered justifiable,mainly because the transition process seems to a large extent about institutionaltransformation, so it may be expected that institutions 'matter' here in particular. In section 1 the main problems in (cross-country) growth empirics will be treated,showing as an important aside which (economic) variables have been found to be robustlyrelated to growth and investment. Section 2 and 3 will judge the empirical relevancefor growth and investment of respectively the objective and subjective institutionalmeasures which have been used in the literature.

A number of mechanisms, such as the repeat purchase mechanism (Klein and Leffler (1981)) and efficiency wages (Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984)), have been offered as solutions to the problem of enforcing an incomplete contract. It is shown that the efficiency of these solutions is very sensitive to the characteristics of the good or service exchanged. In general, neither the repeat purchase mechanism nor efficiency wages is the most efficient in the set of possible relational contracts. In many situations, total output may be increased through the use of performance pay and through increasing the quality of law. contract, law and economics, reputation, repeated games, incomplete <b>contracts,</b> transactions costs, <b>institutional</b> economics, <b>contract</b> enforcement...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{seeks to}} discuss the {{question}} of "openness" in e-Science. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on 12 in-depth interviews with principal investigators, project managers and developers involved in UK e-Science projects, together with supporting documentary evidence from project web sites. The approach was to explore the juxtaposition of research governance at the institutional level and local research practices at the project level. Interview questions focused on research inputs, software development processes, access to resources, project documentation, dissemination of outputs and by-products, licensing issues, and <b>institutional</b> <b>contracts.</b> Findings: The findings suggest that, {{although there is a}} widely shared ethos of openness is everyday research practice, there are many uncertainties and yet-to-be resolved issues, despite strong policy imperatives towards openly shared resources. Research limitations/implications: The paper concludes by observing a stratification of openness in practice and the need for more nuanced understanding of opennness at the level of policy making. This research was based on interviews within a limited number of e-Science/Social Science projects and the intention is to address this in future work by scaling the study up to a survey that will reach the entire UK e-Science/Social Science community. Practical implications: The fundamental challenge in resolving openness in practice and policy, and thereby moving towards a sustainable infrastructure for e-Science, is the coordination and integration of goals across e-Science efforts, rather than one of resolving IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) issues, which has been the central focus of openness debates thus far. Originality/value: The question of openness has previously been posed on the macro-level of research policy, e. g. whether science as a whole can be characterized as open science, in relation to the dissemination of published outputs, e. g. Open Access. Instead, a fine-grained perspective is taken focusing on individual research projects and the various facets of openness in practice.

40|$|Providing a more {{complete}} framework for assessing the efficiency of government intervention requires {{moving away from the}} idealistic perspective typically found in the normative approach to traditional public economics, contend the authors. Such a move requires viewing the government not as a monolithic entity but as many different government bodies, each with its own constituency and regulatory tools. Not only is the"multitiered"government limited in its ability to commit, but interest groups influence the regulatory process and impose significant transaction costs on government interventions and on their outcome. The authors discuss the nature of those transaction costs and argue that the overall design of the government is the result of their minimization. Among the points they make in their conclusions: 1) Safeguards built into regulatory contracts sometimes reflect and sometimes imply transactions costs which influence, or should influence, the optimal tradeoff between rent and efficient in ways practitioners sometimes ignore. 2) Most of the literature on transaction costs arising from government failures would agree that to be sustainable, regulatory institutions should be independent, autonomous, and accountable. How these criteria are met is determined by the way transaction costs are minimized, which in turn drives the design of the regulatory framework. In practice, for example, if there at commitment problems, short-term <b>institutional</b> <b>contracts</b> between players are more likely to ensure autonomy and independence. This affects the duration of the nomination of the regulators. Short-term contracts may be best, but contracts for regulators typically last four to eight years and are often renewable. The empirical debate about the design of regulators'jobs is a possible source of tension. Practitioners typically recommend choosing regulators based on professional rather than political criteria, but that {{may not be the best}} way to minimize regulatory capture. Professional experts are likely to come from the sector they are supposed to regulate and are likely to return to it sooner or later (as typically happens in developing countries). On the other hand, electedregulators are unlikely to be much more independent than professional regulators; they will simply represent different interests. Practitioners and theorists alike emphasize different sources of capture and agree that one way to deal with its risk is to make sure the selection process involves both executive and legislative branches.

It also examines and discusses current policies that address dual practice. In this regard, the article provides some qualified support for the use of “rewarding ” policies to retain physicians in the public sectors of more developed countries, while “limiting ” policies are recommended for devel-oping countries — with the caveat that the policies should be accompanied by the strengthening of <b>institutional</b> and <b>contracting</b> environments.
