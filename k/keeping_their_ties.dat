50|$|As {{commonly}} seen strict churches employ various {{means of}} <b>keeping</b> <b>their</b> <b>ties</b> in their church strong while limiting excessive access {{to other groups}} such as dress code, eating habits, and rituals that prevent mixing with other groups. The implication of these, “strict demands ‘strengthen’ a church in three ways; they raise overall levels of commitment, they increase average rates of participation, and they enhance the net benefits of membership.” Complying with these demands prevent {{the members of a}} church from free loading within the group and promote group solidarity. The strict rules that govern and regulate a church actually help and promote the strength of the ties within the group. Those who don’t comply with these strictures are screened out leaving only those who do comply and comply earnestly.” These strict doctrines and regulations serve to keep the church strong and together while screening out members that may actually harm the church unintentionally by being free loaders within the group.|$|E
40|$|To {{fulfill its}} mission, {{the immune system}} must {{maintain}} {{a complete set of}} different cellular subpopulations that play specific roles in immune responses. We have investigated the mechanisms regulating CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T (Treg) cell homeostasis. We show that the expression of the high-affinity IL- 2 Ralpha endows these cells with the capacity to explore the IL- 2 resource, ensuring <b>their</b> presence while <b>keeping</b> <b>their</b> number <b>tied</b> to the number of CD 4 + T cells that produce IL- 2. We show that such a homeostatic mechanism allows the increased expansion of T cells without causing disease. The indexing of Treg cells to the number of activated IL- 2 -producing cells may constitute a feedback mechanism that controls T cell expansion during immune responses, thus preventing autoimmune or lymphoproliferative diseases. The present study highlights that maintenance of proportions between different lymphocyte subsets may also be critical for the immune system and are under strict homeostatic control...|$|R
