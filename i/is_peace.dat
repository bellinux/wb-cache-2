In many English {{classrooms}} throughout the world, there are students who mistrust or even fear {{each other because}} they belong to groups {{with a history of}} conflict based on national, political, ethnic, or other differences. Intergroup conflict often endures because people do not have the opportunity to interact with each other personally and rely instead on long-standing stereotypes. The actions of governments often make solutions difficult to reach; nevertheless, there are many instances where bridging cultural divides has reduced the tension between conflicting groups. Teachers and nonprofit organizations have long been involved in bringing conflicting groups together in educational contexts in order to promote mutual acceptance of dissimilar worldviews and cultures. For several reasons, the English as a second/foreign language (ESL/EFL) classroom is an especially ideal setting to deal with intergroup conflict. Successful language teaching uti-lizes methods designed to engage students in communicative activities based on their backgrounds, opinions, and other personal characteristics. A classroom composed of students with widely different cultures offers lots of potential for excitement and discov-ery, as well as for creating empathy and advancing the acquisition of English. This article will describe some ESL/ EFL activities that promote this type of interpersonal tolerance betwee...|$|R

25|$|Despite this setback, Mohamoud {{would be}} a {{supporting}} for the women’s voices in Somaliland, as the Kulmiye Party was the only party to appoint a woman as Vice-Chair. During the next elections, Mohamoud was rewarded by garnering the largest national votes, only less than the total votes the incumbent party obtained during the previous presidential election. Through his stewardship, the Kulmiye Party has grown {{to be the largest}} party in Somaliland. Despite the ruling party’s continuous hold to power after its term expired, and its unwillingness to hold free and fair elections, Mohamoud continued to pursue political change through the democratic process by working closely with traditional elders and the international community, whose interest <b>is</b> <b>peace</b> and stability in the Horn of Africa. Thus, when he ran as the Kulmiye Party candidate for president he was able to defeat incumbent President Dahir Rayaale Kahin of the United Peoples' Democratic Party (UDUB) in the 2010 presidential election.|$|E
25|$|The Sir Charles Clore Jewish-Arab Community Centre in the Kiryat Wolfson {{neighbourhood}} runs youth {{clubs and}} programs for Jewish and Arab children. In 1990, Mohammed Faheli, an Arab resident of Acre, founded the Acre Jewish-Arab association, which originally operated {{out of two}} bomb shelters. In 1993, Dame Vivien Duffield of the Clore Foundation donated funds for a new building. Among the programs offered <b>is</b> <b>Peace</b> Child Israel, which employs theatre and the arts to teach coexistence. The participants, Jews and Arabs, spend two months studying conflict resolution and then work together to produce an original theatrical performance that addresses the issues they have explored. Another program is Patriots of Acre, a community responsibility and youth tourism program that teaches children to become ambassadors for their city. In the summer, the centre runs an Arab-Jewish summer camp for 120 disadvantaged children aged 5–11. Some 1,000 children {{take part in the}} Acre Centre's youth club and youth programming every week. Adult education programs have been developed for Arab women interested in completing their high school education and acquiring computer skills to prepare for joining the workforce. The centre also offers parenting courses, and music and dance classes.|$|E

500|$|As a {{film about}} the {{struggle}} between freedom and the state, V for Vendetta takes imagery from many classic totalitarian icons both real and fictional, including the Third Reich and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. For example, Adam Sutler primarily appears on large video screens and on portraits in people's homes, both common features among modern totalitarian regimes and reminiscent {{of the image of}} Big Brother. The slogan [...] "Strength through Unity. Unity through Faith" [...] is displayed prominently across London, similar in cadence to [...] "War <b>is</b> <b>Peace.</b> Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength" [...] in Orwell's book. There is also the state's use of mass surveillance, such as closed-circuit television, on its citizens. Valerie was sent to a detention facility for lesbianism and then had medical experiments performed on her, reminiscent of the persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. The name [...] "Adam Sutler" [...] and his hysterical style of speech are inspired by Adolf Hitler although Jews appear to have been replaced by Muslims as a target for persecution. Norsefire has replaced St George's Cross with a national symbol similar to the modern Cross of Lorraine (both crossbars near the top). This was a symbol used by Free French Forces during World War II, as it was a traditional symbol of French patriotism that could be used as an answer to the Nazis' swastika.|$|E
