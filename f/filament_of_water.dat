50|$|The {{effects of}} {{friction}} and viscosity in diminishing {{the velocity of}} running water were noticed in the Principia of Sir Isaac Newton, who threw much light upon several branches of hydromechanics. At {{a time when the}} Cartesian system of vortices universally prevailed, he found it necessary to investigate that hypothesis, {{and in the course of}} his investigations he showed that the velocity of any stratum of the vortex is an arithmetical mean between the velocities of the strata which enclose it; and from this it evidently follows that the velocity of a <b>filament</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> moving in a pipe is an arithmetical mean between the velocities of the filaments which surround it. Taking advantage of these results, Italian-born French engineer Henri Pitot afterwards showed that the retardations arising from friction are inversely as the diameters of the pipes in which the fluid moves.|$|E
40|$|Two {{stations}} only 20 km apart {{were observed}} to have quite different biological and biogeochemical characteristics. The first site had low concentrations of chlorophyll and sufficient nutrients to support phytoplankton growth. The second site had {{high concentrations of}} chlorophyll, depleted nutrient concentrations and significant export of phytodetrital material had taken place. The two sites were located in the Polar Frontal Zone of the Southern Ocean to the northwest of the Crozet Islands. The main physical {{difference between the two}} sites was in the depth of the mixed layer. At the first site, the mixed layer was deep and well mixed, whereas the second site had a shallow, stratified layer; otherwise the horizontal gradients of physical properties were weak. Survey data from the surrounding area showed that the productive site was located {{on the edge of a}} <b>filament</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> drawn into a developing meander of the Subantarctic Front. Remotely sensed data provided a history of the growth of the meander in the Subantarctic Front and its development into an eddy in the Polar Frontal Zone. The dynamics associated with the filament in the meander were clearly important in driving the primary productivity, as an intrusion of saline water into adjacent fresher water generated a shallow mixed layer and conditions suitable for phytoplankton growth. The dynamics promoting conditions favourable to phytoplankton growth continued to operate as chlorophyll was enhanced in the eddy after the main bloom had died away. Later measurements suggested that the surface layer had changed from diatom dominated to a coccolithophore or calcite-rich community...|$|E
40|$|Identifying {{the source}} of {{atmospheric}} rivers: Are they rivers of moisture exported from the subtropics or footprints left behind by poleward travelling storms? The term atmospheric river is used to describe corridors <b>of</b> strong <b>water</b> vapor transport in the troposphere. <b>Filaments</b> <b>of</b> enhanced <b>water</b> vapor, commonly observed in satellite imagery extending from the subtropics to the extratropics, are routinely used {{as a proxy for}} identifying these regions <b>of</b> strong <b>water</b> vapor transport. The precipitation associated with these <b>filaments</b> <b>of</b> enhanced <b>water</b> vapor can lead to high impact flooding events. However, there remains some debate as to how these filaments form. In this paper we analyse the transport <b>of</b> <b>water</b> vapor within a climatology of wintertime North Atlantic extratropical cyclones. Results show that atmospheric rivers are formed by the cold front which sweeps up water vapor in the warm sector as it catches up with the warm front. This causes a narrow band <b>of</b> high <b>water</b> vapor content to form ahead of the cold front {{at the base of the}} warm conveyor belt airflow. Thus, water vapor in the cyclone's warm sector, and not long-distance transport <b>of</b> <b>water</b> vapor from the subtropics, is responsible for the generation <b>of</b> <b>filaments</b> <b>of</b> high <b>water</b> vapor content. A continuous cycle of evaporation and moisture convergence within the cyclone replenishes water vapor lost via precipitation. Thus, rather than representing a direct and continuous feed of moist air from the subtropics into the centre of a cyclone (as suggested by the term atmospheric river), these filaments are, in-fact, the result <b>of</b> <b>water</b> vapor exported from the cyclone and thus they represent the footprints left behind as cyclones travel polewards from subtropics...|$|R
40|$|During CTD and {{plankton}} {{surveys in}} the Nordic Seas in November 1991 - 1994, a CTD section has been worked across the Arctic Front between the Lofoten and Greenland Basins. Along this front Isopycnic surfaces slope down from upper layers on its cold {{side in the}} Greenland Basin to intermediate depths of 800 to 1000 m in the warmer <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> the Lofoten Basin. While it earlier has been concluded that intermediate water masses are formed in the Greenland and Iceland Seas during winter, {{it has not been}} clear whether intermediate water sinks in to the Norwegian Sea along the Arctic Front to the northeast of Jan Mayen. The present sections show that such formation may occur in November. This is indicated by narrow <b>filaments</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> which is less saline than the ambient water. This water seems to be brought to the front by mesoscale eddies on its cold side. The heaviest water is supplied at depths between about 100 and 500 m. It is therefore not affected by summer warming so that sinking plumes may in principle occur in all seasons. The occurrence of such plumes in two of the four sections suggest that such events may be rather frequent although they are episodic. In general, this may therefore be an important mechanism for formation <b>of</b> intermediate <b>water...</b>|$|R
40|$|Double [...] {{diffusive}} processes {{occur when}} two fluids withdifferent diffusivities are combined. The condition for saltfingers is that warm and saline water lies over cold and less saline <b>water.</b> Saltfingers are <b>filaments</b> <b>of</b> saline <b>water.</b> They have a width {{ranging from a}} few mm to a few cm. The filaments evolve through layers along the background gradients of temperature and salinity. The formation of saltfingers is nonlinear and depends on manyparameters such as initial stability and the ratio of diffusivities(also known as Lewis and Prandtl Number). Double diffusive processes, such as saltfingering, are thought to havean impact on large scale processes by modifying transport and mixing processes. However, the details of large scale effects {{as a result of}} small scalemixing by saltfingering are still unclear. In particular, saltfingers are interesting for...|$|R
50|$|The theorem of Torricelli was {{employed}} by many succeeding writers, but particularly by Edme Mariotte (1620-1684), whose Traité du mouvement des eaux, published {{after his death}} in the year 1686, is founded on a great variety of well-conducted experiments on the motion of fluids, performed at Versailles and Chantilly. In the discussion of some points he committed considerable mistakes. Others he treated very superficially, and in none of his experiments apparently did he attend to the diminution of efflux arising from the contraction of the liquid vein, when the orifice is merely a perforation in a thin plate; but he appears to have been the first who attempted to ascribe the discrepancy between theory and experiment to the retardation <b>of</b> the <b>water's</b> velocity through friction. His contemporary Domenico Guglielmini (1655-1710), who was inspector of the rivers and canals at Bologna, had ascribed this diminution of velocity in rivers to transverse motions arising from inequalities in their bottom. But as Mariotte observed similar obstructions even in glass pipes where no transverse currents could exist, the cause assigned by Guglielmini seemed destitute of foundation. The French philosopher, therefore, regarded these obstructions as the effects of friction. He supposed that the <b>filaments</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> which graze along the sides of the pipe lose a portion of their velocity; that the contiguous filaments, having on this account a greater velocity, rub upon the former, and suffer a diminution of their celerity; and that the other filaments are affected with similar retardations proportional to their distance from the axis of the pipe. In this way the medium velocity of the current may be diminished, and consequently the quantity <b>of</b> <b>water</b> discharged in a given time must, from the effects of friction, be considerably less than that which is computed from theory.|$|R

40|$|A {{thin layer}} <b>of</b> fresh <b>water</b> from summer monsoon rain and river runoff in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) has {{profound}} influence on air-sea interaction {{across the south}} Asian region, but the mechanisms that sustain the low-salinity layer are as yet unknown. Using the first long time series of high-frequency observations from a mooring in the north BoB and satellite salinity data, we show that fresh water from major rivers is transported by large-scale flow and eddies, and shallow salinity stratification persists from summer through the following winter. The moored observations show frequent 0. 2 - 1. 2 psu salinity jumps with time scales of 10 min to days, due to O(1 - 10) km submesoscale salinity fronts moving past the mooring. In winter, satellite sea surface temperature shows 10 km wide <b>filaments</b> <b>of</b> cool <b>water,</b> in line with moored data. Rapid salinity and temperature changes at the mooring are highly coherent, suggesting slumping of salinity-dominated fronts.

40|$|At {{continental}} margins, energetic deep-ocean eddies can transport shelf water offshore in filaments that {{wrap around}} the eddy. One example {{is that of}} Gulf Stream warm-core rings interacting with the Mid-Atlantic Bight shelf. The rate at which shelf water is exported in these filaments is a major unknown in regional budgets of volume, heat, and salt. This unknown transport is constrained using a series of idealized primitive equation numerical experiments wherein a surface-intensified anticyclonic eddy interacts with idealized shelf–slope topography. There is no shelfbreak front in these experiments, and shelf water is tracked using a passive tracer. When anticyclones interact with shelf–slope topography, they suffer apparent intrusions <b>of</b> shelf–slope <b>water,</b> resulting in a subsurface maximum in offshore transport. The simulations help construct an approximate model for the <b>filament</b> <b>of</b> exported <b>water</b> that originates inshore of any given isobath. This model is then used to derive an expression for the total volume <b>of</b> shelf–slope <b>water</b> transported by the eddy across that isobath. The transport scales with water depth, radius, and azimuthal velocity scale of the eddy. The resulting expression {{can be used with}} satellite-derived eddy properties to estimate approximate real-world transports ignoring the presence of a shelfbreak front. The expression assumes that the eddy’s edge is at the shelf break, a condition not always satisfied by real eddies. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (OCE- 1059632) National Science Foundation (U.

40|$|Satellite {{thermal imagery}} and in situ {{biological}} and physical data are presented that describe the spatial variability of phytoplankton biomass and species composition {{in relation to}} the physical structure at the sea surface during persistent upwelling off northern California. Surface patterns in temperature, geostrophic velocity, chlorophyll, and particle size structure show that the coastal zone was dominated by two water masses separated by a well-defined physical boundary. This boundary is apparent in satellite thermal imagery as a cold front and in dynamic height as a meandering jet in the California Current. On the landward side of the front (jet) we observed cold, coastal water that was relatively enriched in phytoplankton biomass, due to the presence of large diatoms. On the seaward side of the front (jet) we observed relatively warm water where the phytoplankton biomass was low and the diatoms were largely absent. Broad tongues and narrow <b>filaments</b> <b>of</b> cold, chlorophyll-rich <b>water</b> that extended over 100 km offshore were present in our study area.

40|$|A {{thorough}} understanding of environmental variability greatly {{increases the likelihood of}} naval mission success. Present-day naval operations are increasingly focused on coastal-littoral waters rather than the open ocean. Historical data records may be sparse or inexistent in these areas. Survey methodologies to rapidly collect data in unknown, dangerous and contested shallow territorial seas are required. This work applies space filling designs to build sampling strategies that can provide accurate estimations of oceanographic fields with a modest navigation time. The design results from sequentially optimizing a cost metrics that combines the benefit of a potential sample location in filling up the holes in space and the cost of visiting that point and collecting a measurement. Optimization is done using a Simulated Annealing approach. The space filling approach has been employed to carry out a rapid environmental assessment of the Bay of Palma de Mallorca, Balearic Islands (Spain). The considered region occupies an extension of 65. 18 Km 2, being the longest and widest measures 12. 4 and 4 km, respectively. The design parameters were a survey time limited to 5 h, a navigation speed of 15 knots and a measuring time of 300 s. The designed survey was physically performed in 4 h and 25 min using the R/V IMEDEA 1 equipped with two thermosalinometers at 2 m deep. The environmental characterization shows the existence of a westward temperature gradient with a thin <b>filament</b> <b>of</b> warm <b>waters</b> intruding the centre area of the bay. Results indicate that space filling designs seem adequate to rapidly characterize the environment of a marine region where no prior oceanographic knowledge is available.
