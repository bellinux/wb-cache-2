5|$|Although {{there were}} various small incidents, three major {{accidents}} {{led to a}} red flag for the session. The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry, driven by Guillaume Moreau, went off at the Porsche Curves during the second hour. The car could {{not return to the}} test session due a bent chassis caused by the heavy impact. The second red flag involved the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry going off the track at the same location in the hands of Vitaly Petrov, becoming briefly airborne after contact with the concrete wall. In the final incident, almost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hour</b> of the session, the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also went off at the Porsche Curves, and briefly caught fire.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, McCool was {{recalled}} for {{the match}} against Northamptonshire. He took 1/19 {{in the first}} innings before coming in at {{the fall of the}} fifth wicket and scoring an unbeaten 50 as Australia declared at 8/352. McCool only bowled three overs in the second innings and went wicketless as Australia won by an innings. Johnson, the incumbent Test spinner, took 4/59. In the second match before the Second Test, against Yorkshire, McCool made only four and seven not out before Australia declared in their second innings. After not being bowled in the first innings, he took 2/33 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hour</b> of the match as Yorkshire ended at 4/85 to secure a draw. McCool was overlooked for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded the same XI that had won the First Test by eight wickets. Bradman's men went on to complete a crushing win by 409 runs, and Johnson registered match figures of 3/75.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{moved on}} to Lord's for the Second Test and Australia {{compiled}} 350 in its first innings. Tallon came to the crease with Australia at 6/225 after Hassett and Bill Brown had gone in quick succession, joining Johnson in the middle. Johnson struggled to score, while Tallon did so freely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hour.</b> After Johnson fell for four at 7/246, Lindwall then joined Tallon and the pair survived to the close of play. England were well placed when Australia ended at stumps on 7/258 with Tallon on 25. Tallon had dominated the scoring late in day, making 25 of the 33 runs added. The crowd was optimistic about England's position and some immediately camped outside the turnstiles upon leaving the ground.|$|E

5|$|Although still wary of one another, the Russian and Austrian commanders were {{satisfied}} with the result of their cooperation. They had outfought Frederick's army in a test of nerve, courage and military skills. Elizabeth of Russia promoted Saltykov to Generalfeldmarschall and awarded a special medal to everyone involved. She also sent a sword of honor to Laudon. The price of this rout, though, was high: 26 percent Austrian and Russian losses would not usually qualify as a victory. The storming of field works typically resulted in a disproportionate number of killed over wounded. The conclusion of the battle in hand-to-hand struggle also increased casualties on both sides. Finally, subsequent cavalry charges and the stampeding flight of men and horses had caused many more injuries. Regardless of the losses, though, Saltykov and Laudon remained on the field with intact armies, and with extant communications between one another. The Prussian defeat remained without consequences when the victors did not capitalize on the opportunity to march against Berlin, but retired to Saxony instead. If Saltykov had sought the coup de grâce <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hour</b> of the battle, he did not follow through with it.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{continued}} {{to employ a}} leg side field, as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump. During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot and then {{put his hands on}} his hips. During the 15 minutes before the tea break, Bradman did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd for his lack of scoring. The Australian captain reached the tea break on 78; 55 minutes after the resumption of play he played a cover drive against Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes. It was his 28th Test century, and his 18th in Ashes Tests; the last 29 runs took 70 minutes. It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets. Nevertheless, Bradman had appeared comfortable after the early stages of his innings, and patiently scored most of his runs between mid-off and mid-on, often from the back foot. After the Australian captain had reached his milestone, many of the spectators began to leave the ground, content with what they had seen. Bradman added a further 30 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hour</b> to end with 130. Australia batted to stumps on the second day without further loss, ending at 4/293, a lead of 128.|$|E

25|$|While his battlecruisers {{drew the}} fire of the British fleet, Scheer slipped away, laying smoke screens. Meanwhile, from about 19:16 to about 19:40, the British battleships were also {{engaging}} Scheer's torpedo boats, which executed several waves of torpedo attacks to cover his withdrawal. Jellicoe's ships {{turned away from the}} attacks and successfully evaded all 31 of the torpedoes launched at them – though, in several cases, only just barely – and sank the German destroyer , attributed to a salvo from Iron Duke. British light forces also sank V48, which had previously been disabled by HMS Shark. This action, and the turn away, cost the British critical time and range <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hour</b> of daylight – as Scheer intended, allowing him to get his heavy ships out of immediate danger.|$|E

Just east of Cape Sidi Ferruch was Beer Green, assaulted by No. 1 Commando, and Beer White assaulted by 168 Regt., US 34th Infantry Division. US Navy transports were in the majority at Charlie Beach {{to the east of}} Algiers, and it is likely that no LCAs were employed there during the initial landings.|$|E
25|$|McGrath trod on a cricket {{ball and}} injured his ankle {{the morning before}} the start of the 2nd Test at Edgbaston and was unable to play in the match in which England amassed 407 runs in one day against the McGrath-less bowling attack to win by 2 runs. He was rushed back when not fully fit for the 3rd Test at Old Trafford, where he earned another 5-wicket haul in the 2nd innings of a drawn game, batting in a last-wicket {{partnership}} with Brett Lee <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hour</b> of the Test to deny an English victory. He then missed the 4th Test at Trent Bridge, which England won by 3 wickets, with an elbow injury. McGrath returned for the final Test at The Oval but he, and the rest of the Australian team, were unable to force a result and the match was drawn, giving England the series win. McGrath's injury problems are seen as a key factor in England regaining the Ashes, as their victories came in matches in which he was absent.|$|E

25|$|Bob Barber's father arrived {{that morning}} from England {{in time to}} see his son play the innings of his life. The attacking opener hit the Australian bowlers all over the ground in his 185 in under five hours with 19 fours. It was his only Test century, his highest First Class score and the 234 runs he added for the first wicket with Geoff Boycott – whose 84 gave him 1,000 Test runs – was the third highest opening {{partnership}} for England in Australia. He was out on 308/2, after which England collapsed to 328/5 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hour</b> of the first day. John Edrich made a solid 103, but Colin Cowdrey, M.J.K. Smith, Dave Brown and Jim Parks were all caught by Wally Grout off Neil Hawke, whose 7/105 was his best bowling in Tests. Grout snapped up Fred Titmus off Doug Walters (1/38) to give him five catches and reduce England to 395/8, but Dave Allen made 50 not out adding 93 runs for the last two wickets with Edrich and Jeff Jones, whose 16 was his highest Test score as England made 488.|$|E
25|$|The {{final round}} of the Pura Cup was also played out; the winner of the Bushrangers–Warriors match at Junction Oval in Melbourne would join the Bulls in the final, while a draw would see it come down to {{quotient}} with other sides. The Tigers finished first, winning their third match in succession after bowling the Bulls out for 176 and 140, while Michael Bevan scored a century and captain Daniel Marsh made 96 not out. The Redbacks and the Blues played out a match with three declared innings at Adelaide; South Australia batted first, making seven for 541 after centuries from Shane Deitz, Cameron Borgas and Mark Cosgrove, and the Blues responded with six for 314 before declaring, knowing that their only chance of qualifying for the final would be a win in this game. The Redbacks batted for 27 overs, making three for 115 before setting the Blues 343 in a minimum of 100 overs. The Blues were five for 233 after 80 overs, when the Redbacks took the new ball , but Paul Rofe took three wickets in thirteen balls. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hour,</b> the Redbacks needed two wickets, and claimed the last when Aaron O'Brien was bowled for 48 by former Australian Test bowler Jason Gillespie with seven balls remaining.|$|E
500|$|This left Johnson and Tallon {{as the new}} men at the crease. Johnson {{struggled}} to score, while Tallon did so freely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hour.</b> Edrich had Johnson caught behind for four to leave Australia at 246/7. Johnson had contributed only four of the 30 runs scored {{while he was at}} the crease. Lindwall joined Tallon and the pair survived to the close of play. England were well placed when Australia ended at stumps on 258/7 with Tallon on 25 and Lindwall on 3. Tallon had dominated the scoring late in the day, making 25 of the 33 runs added. Bowes believed that Yardley attacked very well, keeping the pressure on Australia by rotating his bowlers effectively so his three main bowlers were always at the crease. O'Reilly praised Evans's agile display in his stumping attempts as the fastest and best he had seen. The English crowd were optimistic about England's position and some of them immediately camped outside the turnstiles upon leaving the ground.

500|$|Bradman added {{a further}} 30 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hour</b> {{to end with}} 130. Hassett also batted patiently, with one period of 20 minutes during which his score {{remained}} on 30. Australia batted to stumps {{on the second day}} without further loss, ending at 293/4, a lead of 128, with Hassett on 41. Young had bowled 32 overs to a leg side field, conceding only 53 runs. Fingleton described the afternoon day's play as a [...] "very shrewd display of tactics" [...] and said that although the proceedings and the progress of the Australian batsmen had been slow, they were [...] "never...dull". He added: [...] "Bradman was on top by virtue of the facts that his side was well ahead of England, his own score was 130 and he was also unconquered." [...] However, O'Reilly disagreed and said the Australians had not made enough progress as they should or could have. He said the batsmen failed to capitalise on the fatigue of the bowlers late in the day by not going on the attack in search of quick runs, instead of their [...] "monotonously dull" [...] strategy of patient attrition. O'Reilly claimed that in containing the opposition batsmen, the English attack had [...] "shared the honours of the day withif they did not actually steal them fromBradman." [...] Bradman and Hassett had made physical gestures indicating their displeasure at England's tactics, but O'Reilly felt Yardley had no choice after his team had squandered the initiative with their poor batting, and claimed it was up to the Australians to turn their advantage into a decisive, match-winning position. Arlott disagreed with O'Reilly, and said Australia [...] "had time to build...without risk or hurry on a gentle and accommodating...wicket. Given a winning opportunity, it is characteristic of the Australians that they will never dissipate it by over-anxiety or by carelessness." ...|$|E
500|$|The catastrophic {{loss was}} due to more than these three issues, though. Indeed, he {{violated}} his own rules of strategy and tactics because he faced an enemy he despised, and this brought out the worst of his generalship. In this way, the loss at Kunersdorf {{was similar to that}} of the Battle of Hochkirch. There, the British envoy traveling with the Prussian Army attributed Frederick's loss to the contempt in which he held the Austrians and his unwillingness to give credit to intelligence that did not agree with his imagination; certainly, this contempt for the Austrians and the Russians contributed to his loss at Kunersdorf as well. Yet, as Herbert Redman notes, [...] "...seldom in military history has a battle been so completely lost by an organized army in such a short space of time." [...] The loss was not only due to Frederick's unwillingness to accept that the Russians, whom he despised, and the Austrians, whom he despised only slightly less, had any military acumen. At Hochkirch, Frederick demonstrated good leadership by rallying his troops against the surprise attack; Prussian discipline and the bonds of regimental cohesion had prevailed. Importantly, the Prussian army at Kunersdorf was not the same army that had fought at Hochkirch, because it had already fought, and lost, there. Over the winter, Frederick had cobbled together a new army, but it was not as well-trained, well-disciplined, and well-drilled as his old one. He failed to accept this. Arguably Frederick's worst defeat, at Kunersdorf, his army panicked and discipline disintegrated before his eyes, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hour</b> of the battle. The few regiments that held together, such as that of Lestwitz, were the exception. Frederick had demanded more of his men than they could bear.|$|E
