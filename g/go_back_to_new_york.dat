5|$|Veronica asks Beaver {{how she got}} chlamydia—Woody had it, and Beaver {{transmitted}} it to her {{the night}} she was raped (revealing that he, not Duncan, raped her). Beaver is about {{to blow up the}} plane that has both Woody and Keith on it. Beaver pushes a button, and there is a flash in midair. Beaver tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead of facing the consequences of his actions. Aaron and Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) are in bed, and while she is in the shower, Clarence Weidman (Christopher B. Duncan) appears and shoots him in the head. The scene moves to Australia, where we learn that Duncan organized the murder. Jackie meets Wallace and tells him that she had to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> where she is actually from, in order to care for her two-year-old son, whom she left with her mother, when she came to Neptune to reconnect with Terrence. Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not ever on the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E

After Amira has received money to remain silent about Bart's actions in Dubai, she goes at Chuck's and tells him she will help him find what he is hiding. Meanwhile, Nate goes out for a drink with Sage (Sofia Black-D'Elia), a girl who wants to interview him. As Dan is heading to his apartment in Brooklyn, he discovers his father and Ivy in bed together.|$|E
500|$|Gaga further {{elaborated}} on {{the inspiration}} behind the song as walking towards the light force {{in her life}} and peering towards the devil in the back, while clutching onto {{the source of the}} light. [...] "I sing about what a holy fool I am, and that although moments in my life are so cruel and relationships can be so cruel I’m still in love with Judas. I still go back again to those evil things," [...] she said. During her interview with Google, Gaga added to the song's meaning as honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring themselves into the light. One has to learn to forgive themselves in order to move on with their life. With Popjustice she clarified that {{she has a lot of}} things that have haunted her from her past, including her choices, men, drug abuse, being afraid to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> confronting old romances. Hence [...] "Judas" [...] represented something that was not good for her, something she could not escape. Gaga said: [...] "I keep going back and forth between the darkness and the light in order to understand who I am." ...|$|E

[...] "I didn't {{have to go in}} and test [...] the process proceeded swiftly." [...] Judy [...] told me that Greenlee was a bad girl who comes to Pine Valley and causes trouble. It was the summer; I figured there wasn't going to be anything going on in L.A. [...] why not <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York?</b> Plus, I never get to play the bad girl and delve into the dark side. I'm always playing the good girl.
