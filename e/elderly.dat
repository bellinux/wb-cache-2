The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the level of self-care behaviors and its related factors in community dwelling <b>elderlies</b> in Sari, 2014. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014 on 120 <b>elderlies</b> in Sari city. Multi-stage randomized sampling metod was done from 10 health centers. Data collection was done with self-care questionnare (standard by Ministry of Health). Reliability of this questionnaire calculated 0 / 83 with Cronbach's alpha test on 30 <b>elderlies.</b> Data analyzed by SPSS. v. 16 software with using descriptive statistics(such as mean, abundance and median) and inferential statistics (such as t-test, Spearman and Pearson correlation and chi-square tests). Results: From 120 <b>elderlies</b> 50 % were man that the most of them were married (64. 5 %), with average economic status (56. 7 %) and illiterate (60 persons). The mean and standard deviation of total self-care and physical, mental, emotional and spiritual dimensions were 128. 42 ± 11. 98, 39. 10 ± 4. 22, 18. 15 ± 3. 07, 34. 75 ± 4. 35 and 36. 40 ± 5. 16 respectively. There is a significant relationship among psychological self-care with education level (p= 0. 001) and lifestyle of <b>elderlies</b> (p= 0. 026). Also there is a significant and meaningful relationship among spiritual self-care with educational level of <b>elderlies</b> (p= 0. 001) and lifestyle of them (p= 0. 003).

5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the <b>elderly.</b> The <b>elderly</b> are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the <b>elderly</b> can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the <b>elderly</b> as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the <b>elderly</b> only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the <b>elderly</b> such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the <b>elderly</b> due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E

40|$|Background Old age is {{a period}} of life in which <b>elderlies</b> face with {{complications}} such as increasing risk of chronic diseases, loneliness, isolation, mental and physical disabilities, and reduction of individual independence. These factors cause the quality of life to reduce. Objectives This study compared {{the quality of life of}} <b>elderlies</b> in daycare and boarding nursing homes in Semnan, Iran and identified the differences in characteristics of quality of life. It can also help researchers to reduce the problems of <b>elderlies.</b> Materials and Methods This cross-sectional study was performed on 30 <b>elderlies</b> living in boarding nursing homes and 43 in daycare nursing homes. Collecting the data was conducted via a special questionnaire (SF- 36), measuring different aspects of quality of life. Results On the basis of SF- 36 test and comparing various aspects of quality of life among the <b>elderlies</b> residing in boarding and daycare nursing homes, significant differences were observed in domains of quality of life, including physical restrictions (P < 0. 001), restrictions in psycho-emotional function (P < 0. 001), energy and fatigue (P < 0. 008), psycho-emotional function (P < 0. 001), social function (P < 0. 001), physical pain (P < 0. 001), and public health (P < 0. 01). However, the difference was not significant in physical function (P = 0. 437). Conclusions The results showed that the <b>elderlies</b> living in daycare centers had better qualities of lives physically and mentally. Therefore, to improve their qualities of lives in two general physical and mental domains, items such as providing family communications inside or outside the nursing homes as well as planning to fulfill mental and psychological needs besides physical issues like mobility and balance should be considered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract AIMSThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how depressive symptoms mediate different motor control requirements in <b>elderlies</b> and to assess the concurring effects fomented by the interaction between aging and depressive symptoms, providing indirect measures of brain functionality. METHODS Sixty-eight <b>elderlies</b> were paired in terms of age and gender and were equally distributed into depressed and nondepressed groups, according to their score on the Beck Depression Questionnaire. The participants performed the Grooved Pegboard Test placing and withdrawing pegs while execution time and error rate were measured. RESULTS This investigation revealed that depressive symptoms exert a broad effect upon motor control, although that the symptom intensity, as well as the interaction between aging and depression intensity, were exclusively correlated with withdrawal task, suggesting that there is a greater effect upon motor acts with higher frontal lobe requirements. CONCLUSION The discrimination of motor control aspects provides a valuable contribution for the understanding of the underlying neurophysiology of the interaction between aging and depression as it represents an indirect measure of cerebral dysfunction. Further, these findings may still have clinical implications, as they can promote more rational approaches to the elaboration of preventive measures that help maintain the functional capability of depressed <b>elderlies...</b>|$|R

But, the results of clinical trial regarding the effects of multivitamin complex on mood disorders are inconclusive. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of multivitamin complex supplementation on mood disorder, anxiety and depression in <b>elderlies</b> over 60 years old. Materials and Methods In this clinical trial, 120 aged people with mild depression were randomly allocated to receive multivitamin complex tablet or placebo once daily with their meal for twelve weeks. At the beginning and end of the study, dietary intake, anthropometric indices and scores of depression, anxiety and mood disorders were assessed. Results This trial was completed by 114 <b>elderlies</b> after 12 weeks. The mean depression score was not different in two groups after intervention. The mean score of anxiety and mood disorders after intervention did not differ between groups. Similar results were obtained for weight and Body Mass Index. Significant enhancement of energy intake was illustrated by the measurement of participants’ dietary intake. Conclusion The present study revealed that consuming a multivitamin complex in tablet form for 12 weeks had no effect on depression, anxiety and mood disorders in <b>elderlies</b> but can increase their appetite resulting in increase of their energy intake. * Corresponding Author: Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Nutrition and Food Security Research Center.

30|$|Though a {{great number}} of assistive medical robots and devices are {{developed}} for older adults, yet there is lack of research studies related to acceptance of assistive technology from older adults and their caretakers’ perspective [35]. We believe {{that it is important to}} conduct further research work surrounding this field. The declined acceptance of older adults of assistive technologies is mainly related to the limited knowledge and the embarrassed emotions [27]. Moreover, [17] it is found out that there are two primary factors affecting use of assistive technology: abilities and attitudes. In accordance with conducted ethnographic studies, older adults incline to utilize assistive technology when the dignity and autonomy of them are maintained [26]. Ethnographic studies provided a series of recommendations to robot designers and developers. The recommendations are in terms of robot dimensions which should be fit within <b>elderly’s</b> place, robot interface which should be easy to use, and interaction feature which should meet <b>elderly’s</b> abilities.|$|R
