50|$|Ghana’s Obuasi {{region is}} known to host arsenopyritic goldbearing ore bodies. According to company reports, during the 1990s, an arsenic {{precipitation}} plant was installed at the Pompora Treatment Plant for the commercial recovery of arsenic from the roaster flue gases. At the time, the recovered arsenic trioxide was sold to Europe for commercial applications. As the market for arsenic declined, the treatment plant was shut down in 2000 and about 10,000 metric tons (t) of arsenic was stockpiled in bags at Obuasi. After {{the introduction of the}} Biox treatment process, the arsenic trioxide was converted to arsenic pentoxide and deposited in tailings dams. AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (the company that was formed through the merger of Ashanti Goldfields Ltd. and AngloGold Ltd.) reported that inadequate storage of the stockpiled bags allegedly caused arsenic contamination to the Pompora stream. The problem was identified during the company’s <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>study</b> prior to the merger. AngloGold Ashanti constructed a lined storage dam at the old heap leach site. The company planned to move the arsenic to a new facility where it will be stored and gradually disposed of by blending it into the Biox process circuit where it will be chemically stabilized and deposited as a component of the tailings residue in the new Sansu Tailings Storage Facility. The company estimates that it will take about 6 years to dispose of the arsenic.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{capacity}} of solar thermal power plants (50 MWel and more) and large required investment, concentrating solar power (CSP) projects are subject to an extensive project development process. Predicting the energy yield of a CSP plant is a crucial task in this process. Mathematical models predicting the system’s energy yield are required to assess single CSP projects (e. g. feasibility or <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>studies),</b> compare different plant options (e. g. technology, site), optimise technology configuration (e. g. solar field size, storage capacity), investigate the influence of component characteristics (e. g. receiver characteristics), and to assess system performance during commissioning, among other things. The models used for these tasks differ in complexity and required accuracy, e. g. a model used for project assessment during commissioning {{has to be more}} rigorous than a model used for a pre-feasibility study. At the moment, numerous modelling approaches exist, and project developers use their own internal system models and assessment methodology. These models often lack validation, and no standard or benchmark for comparison yet exists for electricity yield analysis of CSP plants. In addition, most current models of CSP system performance do not treat uncertainties inherent in parameters and processes of the complex system. These conditions fail to alleviate concerns about technology risk and hinders the acceptance of CSP technology by potential investors. To solve this problem, an international working group is being initiated within SolarPACES Task I to define guidelines for electricity yield analysis of CSP plants. ...|$|R
40|$|With 620 MWel in {{operation}} [1] {{and more than}} 2. 000 MWel under construction, concentrated solar power (CSP) experiences a renaissance mainly in Spain and the USA, but also in many {{other countries in the}} earth’s sunbelt. Due to their large capacity (50 MWel and more) and thus large investment, CSP projects are characterised by an extensive project development process. In several stages of this process, mathematical models of the system predicting its energy yield are required, among others to:  assess single CSP projects (e. g., feasibility or <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>studies),</b>  compare different CSP concepts (e. g., technology, site),  optimise a project (e. g., solar field size, storage capacity),  investigate the influence of component characteristics (e. g., receiver characteristics),  optimise the operation strategy (e. g., on-line surveillance) or to  assess system performance during commissioning. The models used for these different tasks differ in complexity and accuracy, e. g. the accuracy of a model used for project assessment during commissioning has to be higher than a model used for a pre-feasibility study. At the moment, numerous modelling approaches exist and every project developer uses his own system model and assessment methodology. This confusing situation hinders the acceptance of CSP technology by potential investors. This paper presents a methodology for structuring systems into sub-systems. This is the first step towards a standardized modelling approach for CSP systems. It is not the intention of the authors to present a final model and assessment methodology but to start a broader discussion on this important topic. In fact, it aims at initiating an international working group, devoted to the definition of guidelines for modelling, simulation and assessment of CSP systems, covering all CSP technologies such as solar towers, parabolic troughs, linear Fresnel collectors and solar dishes...|$|R
40|$|Valuable {{data for}} {{geotechnical}} interpretation and integration into effective Australian underground mine planning may often be available, yet {{is not always}} fully appreciated or utilised, particularly {{in the early stages}} of mine planning or in <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>studies.</b> There may be considerable benefits associated with early prioritisation of geotechnical evaluation and impact on mine planning. Unidentified, misinterpreted, or ill-defined adverse geological and related geotechnical resource characteristics can pose significant business risk to underground coal projects and operations. Preliminary resource definition in the early conceptual mine planning stages attributes significant focus (entirely warranted) on resource quality and structural geology constraints. Yet detailed geotechnical data analysis and interpretation, which may have a substantial down stream impact and sensitivity with respect to future mine planning strategies, at times is given lower priority, or scoped and resourced in the later stages of a bankable feasibility study. Through extensive mine planning experience and observation of downstream process impacts, it has been found there is often data available for geotechnical analysis that does not readily stand out or is not adequately understood or utilised, available at the early (conceptual) stages of mine planning. Part of the issue may be that exploration geologists are not necessarily experienced geotechnical engineers and do not necessarily recognise or understand all important parameters. Subject to appropriate application of experienced professionals data can be manipulated to provide key geotechnical hazard assessment at minimal cost, and provide a framework for understanding and optimising the mine planning process. Although there is no single prescribed strategy for resource evaluation from a geotechnical perspective, potential business risks and mitigation approaches can and should be adopted at the conceptual mine planning stage. There has been a recent focus in the metals industry to provide a reporting framework for geotechnical classification of mining projects. This paper outlines the strategies and gives examples of key analyses adopted in mine planning and discusses the relative merits of adopting a reporting framework as a tool for geotechnical classification in mine planning...|$|R

40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&A) {{have become an}} important strategy for international expansion, even though numerous acquisitions fail to achieve their financial and strategic objectives. The risk associated with transactions partly depends {{on the extent to}} which the insight into the target company actually holds true. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is performed to eliminate this information asymmetry. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is an audit conducted prior to the planned transaction. It can be described as a purposeful and systematic investigation of business opportunity and risk during on-going sale negotiations. The importance of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is emphasized widely in the academic literature as well as among M&A practitioners. On the other hand, researches and practitioners have differing views on what and how much is enough for a <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> audit. Therefore, this study examines the role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> in a cross-border acquisition process. The main objective of the research is fulfilled by examining the reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> recognizing the elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and analyzing the need and opportunities for enhancing the utilization of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> For the empirical part of this qualitative study five expert interviews were conducted among experienced Finnish acquirers and advisors. In addition, five expert interviews conducted for a distinct study were utilized as a secondary source of data. The results of this study present fundamental reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> However, conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is not always self-evident.

40|$|Cambridge University Press 2013. In {{the context}} of {{corporate}} accountability, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and complicity are two important concepts. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> as ‘the care that a reasonable person exercises to avoid harm to other persons or their property’. In the business context, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> refers to the ‘research and analysis of a company or organization done {{in preparation for a}} business transaction’, or the ‘duty of a firm’s directors and officers to act prudently in evaluating associated risks in all transactions’. Complicity, on the other hand, is described as ‘association or participation in… a wrongful act’. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> and complicity are thus different notions. This chapter will explore the various possible connections between these two concepts.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M & A) {{are a big}} part of the corporate finance world. Everyday investment bankers arrange M & A transactions, which bring separate companies together to form larger ones. The key principle behind buying a company is to create shareholder value over and above that of the sum of the two companies. Two companies together are more valuable than two separate companies; at least that's the reasoning behind M & A. Before an M & A transaction, companies usually require some kind of evaluation of the company that is to be acquired. This evaluation is then used to determine whether the transaction should take place, and what the target price should be for the acquiring company. The most commonly known method used to do such an evaluation is known as a <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> The <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process can be a long drawn out process, which can be extremely disruptive to an organisation. <b>Due</b> <b>diligences</b> can take several months to complete in a complex organization. The issue surrounding the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process is that it is not a standardized procedure and each organization or specialist carries out the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process differently, when considering a merger and acquisition. The problem is that there is no one structure, format or model which can make the necessary information available to the decision-makers of the acquiring company without going through the complete <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process. If a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model was available, which could give pertinent information to decision-makers, huge <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> costs could be saved. Therefore the main study objective of this dissertation is to determine the value of a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> before an M & A, and whether a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model would be beneficial to decision-makers of manufacturing companies. The study will lead to the development of a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model that can be used by South African manufacturing organisations for M & A. A combination of the theoretical techniques, literature review data and the empirical study data will be used to determine what should be included in a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model, which can be used by decision-makers to determine whether or not to pursue the merger and acquisition.

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to provide new {{evidence}} and address the partially lacking understanding of business angel decision-making. This thesis studies the issue by investigating both the investment criteria and the rejection criteria business angels use to decide whether an opportunity should advance beyond the initial screening stage to the <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> The <b>study</b> focuses on the pitch meetings, in which entrepreneurs try to sell their ideas and equity to business angels in exchange for capital. DATA: The unique hand-coded data on business angels is sourced from a TV show called the Dragons' Den. By analysing the latest two UK production seasons, I was able to observe the decision-making process of seven business angels, of which three were female. The total number of observed pitch meetings amounts to 129, which consists of 27 successful pitches and 102 declined ones. The empirical evidence of business angel rejection criteria is based on 241 rejection reason provided by the investors. The above-average sample size {{is considered to be}} reasonable in the area of studying business angel decision-making. RESULTS: The results suggest that business angels invest primarily in early stage or start-up companies seeking for expansion financing. In their investment decision-making, business angels place emphasis on the entrepreneur, product and financials and intend to add value by taking hands-on roles. On the other hand, the partially contradictory findings to prior literature suggest, that the most important rejection criteria are related to financials, product and market. My findings also suggest that the investor fit criteria and investors' gender is affecting the decision-making of business angels...|$|R
