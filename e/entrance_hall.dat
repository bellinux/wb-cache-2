5|$|Internally, {{the south}} range {{includes}} three 16th- or early-17th-century stone fireplaces that {{have probably been}} reused from the earlier house. The north room of the attic floor and principal room {{on the first floor}} include 16th- or early-17th-century timber panelling. The room over the <b>entrance</b> <b>hall</b> features late-17th-century panelling. Two period staircases feature; one from each of the 16th and 17th centuries. The windows in the <b>entrance</b> <b>hall</b> and north room of the east range include armorial stained glass windows dated 1567, 1567 and 1575. The stairwell includes windows with 17th-century German stained glass taken from the adjacent church of St Peter and other, undated stained glass.|$|E

5|$|Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania {{purchased}} the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House for $60,000 in 1887, and resided {{there for a}} time. Cameron expanded the home significantly, almost entirely rebuilding its interior. After the renovation, the front entrance opened onto a square <b>entrance</b> <b>hall.</b> A fireplace adorned the hall. Large rooms {{on either side of}} the <b>entrance</b> <b>hall</b> were used as office space. A broad staircase led from the <b>entrance</b> <b>hall</b> up to the second floor, where there were four large rooms. The rooms opened on to one another, permitting the second floor to be opened up into something approaching a single large ballroom. The windows on the second floor reached to the floor. An iron veranda ran around the entire second floor. The home contained a total of 30 rooms after the renovation. Cameron did not, however, renovate the exterior, which remained much the same as it always had. Henry Adams was a frequent guest of the Camerons, playing often with their daughter Martha to alleviate his bouts of depression.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{a number}} of rooms feature period wall and ceiling decorations {{including}} the <b>entrance</b> <b>hall,</b> which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded panelling and cornices, a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster ceiling and an arabesque frieze. The stairwell is lit from above with a roof light and features a cantilevered stair with iron balusters from the 1825 adaptation with a later brass handrail.|$|E
5|$|Large {{pieces of}} glass screens and metal {{shoulder}} eaves extend horizontally; {{the station is}} lit and transparent. The specially designed lighting, the clear tempered glass, the insulating glass, and the truss system emphasize {{the functions of the}} space and bring a bright look to the building. The 6-meter tall lobby on the ground floor is connected by the escalators coming up from the <b>entrance</b> <b>hall</b> and the platforms built underground.|$|E

5|$|Opened in 2011, Brilliant Birds is a {{walk-through}} aviary housing {{several species}} of exotic birds, including Nicobar pigeons, Bali starlings, lilac-breasted rollers, chestnut-backed thrush, and Victoria crowned pigeons. A selection of amphibians, invertebrates and fish are also displayed in the building's main <b>entrance</b> <b>hall,</b> including axolotl, blue poison dart frogs, mudskippers, figure 8 pufferfish, banded archerfish, blind cave fish, and a colony of leafcutter ants.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} centres on the double-height <b>entrance</b> <b>hall,</b> {{with the}} theme of Time. The painted ceiling depicts the astrological signs of the constellations, arranged in the positions they held when the house was first occupied. A large stained glass window contains four female figures representing Dawn, Noon, Twilight and Night. A mosaic floor in the <b>entrance</b> <b>hall</b> contains a labyrinth design, with the centre depicting the myth of Theseus slaying the Minotaur. The garden's entrance door, also covered in bronze, is decorated with a relief of the Madonna and Child. As elsewhere, Burges incorporated earlier designs, the bronze doors echoing those at Cork Cathedral, and the maze floor recalling an earlier ceiling at Burges's office at 15 Buckingham Street. Emblems adorn the five doors on the ground floor, each one relevant to their respective room. A flower marked {{the door to the}} garden, with the front door marked by a key. The library is indicated by an open book, the drawing or music room by musical instruments, and the dining room by a bowl and flask of wine.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} <b>entrance</b> <b>hall,</b> {{reception and}} family bedrooms {{were placed on}} the first floor above a low semi-basement containing service rooms. The two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single broad flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south. These staircases have since been replaced by simpler designs.|$|E

25|$|MAX Light Rail {{stations}} vary in size, but {{are generally}} simple and austere. There are no faregates or specially segregated areas.

Official concessionaires sometimes open coffee shops at stations.|$|R
5|$|Upon opening, {{the house}} {{featured}} two dining rooms with student rooms arranged along lengthy hallways radiating {{from the center}} of the structure. The nine tower floors were only accessible via the ground level, from the dorm's primary <b>entrance</b> <b>hall.</b> An exterior fire escape led down the back of Jewett's tower but was replaced with an interior stairwell during the 2003 renovation.|$|E
5|$|A bronze-covered door, {{with relief}} panels {{depicting}} figures, opens onto the <b>entrance</b> <b>hall.</b> In Burges's time {{the door had}} a letterbox, {{in the form of}} Mercury, the messenger of the gods. The letterbox is now lost, but a contemporary copy is in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum. The porch contains a white marble seat and column, and on the floor is a mosaic of Pinkie, a favourite poodle of Burges. Cartooned by H.W. Lonsdale, it resembles the cave canem floor at Pompei.|$|E
5|$|The Otis {{elevators}} are {{spanned by}} a series of neo-deco light bands extending wall to wall. The lobby extends completely through the block, with a giant <b>entrance</b> <b>hall</b> at Monroe Street and a 16-story full-height atrium in the link between the AT and USG towers (also designed by Smith) as both towers share a common appearance. The building boasts two public lobbies and a mezzanine-level lobby. The lobbies are among the most lavish in Chicago, and they are all decorated with patterned marble floors and walls, bronze, gold-leaf oak trim, and stylized lighting fixtures.|$|E

This includes Tirto Adhi Soerjo, Djamaluddin Adinegoro, Sam Ratulangi, and Ernest Douwes Dekker.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} reception {{rooms are}} on the ground floor with large sash windows opening immediately into the porticos and the colonnades, and therefore onto the gardens, a situation unheard of in the grand villas and palaces of Renaissance Italy. The mansion contains a series of 18th century salons decorated and furnished in the style of that period, with polychrome marble floors, and painted ceilings depicting classical scenes of Greek and Roman mythology. Of particular note is the <b>entrance</b> <b>hall,</b> which resembles a Roman atrium with marbled columns and a painted ceiling copied from Robert Wood's Ruins of Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} best-understood mansio {{was built on}} a stone base about 130CE. It was at least two storeys high and fronted by a {{colonnade}} with a tiled roof, probably supported on wooden columns. In {{the centre of the}} colonnade, a large door formed the main entrance to the interior of the building. Through the <b>entrance</b> <b>hall</b> was a colonnaded atrium or courtyard with a plastered floor, the central area probably being open to the sky and perhaps containing a herbaceous garden. Timber posts resting on these foundations {{around the edges of the}} colonnade supported a balcony above.|$|E

40|$|Between the {{two world}} wars Belgrade saw a surge in housing construction, {{including}} many rental apartment buildings, so-called 'luxury city palaces'. In addition to richly decorated street façades in the style of academism, eclecticism and Art Deco, architects paid much attention to the design of <b>entrances</b> and <b>entrance</b> <b>halls.</b> The <b>entrance</b> frequently was the main element of the façade even in buildings in a moderate modernist style. Since this aspect of architectural design is scantily documented, this paper seeks to identify its main trends in the 1920 s and 1930 s and to establish a typology of <b>entrances</b> and <b>entrance</b> <b>halls</b> of residential buildings. It also outlines the parameters and social circumstances that played a role in giving special attention to this element of residential buildings, and examines whether Belgrade architects pursued a sort of total design inspired by European models...|$|R

5|$|Hearst first {{bought the}} monastery {{intending}} {{to replace the}} family retreat at Wyntoon, {{on the bank of}} the McCloud River near Mount Shasta in remote Northern California. The original building was his mother's Bernard Maybeck-designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929. Hearst wanted to replace it with a great stone building fitted with towers and turrets—an eccentric castle folly that was to be larger than its predecessor. To prepare for the arrival of the Spanish stones, Morgan drew up plans with the monastery's chapter house serving as the castle's <b>entrance</b> <b>hall,</b> and the large church enclosing a swimming pool. Other stones were designated as cladding for walls and rooms on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{locomotives}} had additional embellishments. No. 34050 Royal Observer Corps {{was presented}} with an ROC long-service medal in July 1961. The ceremony took place at Waterloo station, and included Commandant ROC Air Commodore Wight-Boycott. The cab side was given {{a representation of the}} medal and its ribbon, which was displayed until the engine was withdrawn from service and scrapped in the late 1960s. The original nameplate and crest were recovered and displayed in the <b>entrance</b> <b>hall</b> of ROC Headquarters at RAF Bentley Priory until 1996 when they were transferred to the RAF Museum at Hendon. Another locomotive that featured a second crest was 34067 Tangmere, which was given the airfield's crest for the cab side, as it did not feature on the nameplate crest.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} Lal Masjid was extensive. The <b>entrance</b> <b>hall</b> was {{completely}} burned out, the ceiling scorched, {{and the red}} walls above the oval doorway blackened. However, the mosque itself sustained less damage than the Jamia Hafsa seminary. Bullet casings were found all over the mosque roof, and the inside of Lal Masjid was turned coal black from the militants trying to set the mosque on fire using gasoline bombs. Militants used the mosque's two white minarets as vantage points, resulting in damage to the minarets. One minaret was completely destroyed, and its speakers were hanging from their wires. The dome, however, was not damaged during the 36-hour battle. The {{director general of the}} Inter Services Public Relations said photographs of the bodies seem to indicate that there were foreigners among the dead.|$|E
50|$|A {{terminus}} of {{the first}} German long distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe.
