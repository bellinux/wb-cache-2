40|$|Mobile {{applications}} {{increasingly are}} being used by first responders and soldiers to support their missions. These users operate in resource-constrained, edge environments characterized by dy-namic context, limited computing resources, intermittent network connectivity, {{and high levels of}} stress. In addition to efficient battery management, mobile applications operating in edge environments require efficient resource usage of onboard sensors to capture, store, and send data across networks that may be intermittent. The traditional method for building mobile applications is to use native software development kits (SDKs) on a particular mobile platform, such as An-droid or iOS. However, HTML 5 has recently evolved to a stage where it supports many of the development features that native SDKs support. The advantages of using HTML 5 not only in-clude cross-platform development and deployment, but also that mobile <b>edge</b> <b>applications</b> would not have to be deployed on mobile devices, potentially leading to an easier distribution and testing process because they simply run inside the web browser that already exists on the device.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effect of}} choice of actuator technology and associated power systems architecture on the mass cost and power consumption of implementing active flow control systems on civil transport aircraft. The research method {{is based on the}} use of a mass model that includes a mass due to systems hardware and a mass due to the system energy usage. An A 320 aircraft wing is used as a case study application. The mass model parameters are based on first principle physical analysis of electric and pneumatic power systems combined with empirical data on system hardware from existing equipment suppliers. Flow control methods include direct fluidic, electromechanical-fluidic and electro-fluidic actuator technologies. The mass cost of electrical power distribution is shown to be considerably less than that for pneumatic systems, however this advantage is reduced by the requirement for relatively heavy electrical power management and conversion systems. A trade exists between system power efficiency and the system hardware mass required to achieve this efficiency. For short duration operation the flow control solution is driven towards lighter, less power efficient systems, whereas for long duration operation there is benefit in considering heavier but more efficient systems. It is estimated that a practical electromechanicalfluidic system for flow separation control may have a mass up to 40 % of the slat mass for a leading <b>edge</b> <b>application</b> and 5 % of flap mass for a trailing <b>edge</b> <b>application.</b> Nomenclature a Actuator diaphragm peak-to-peak displacement, m A Cross sectional area of pipe, orifice, or exposed plasma electrode,...|$|R
