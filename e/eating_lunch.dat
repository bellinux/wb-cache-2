5|$|By late December 1899, mining had {{compromised}} Joppenbergh's integrity {{enough to}} cause a series of landslides, followed by a large cave-in on December19. Four collapses occurred that day, beginning at 8AM, and culminating in the 11:30AM collapse of the Black Smoke Mine shaft network. Though it was initially believed that fifteen workers had been killed, the collapse happened while all 150 men were outside of the mountain, <b>eating</b> <b>lunch.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{speech of}} girls {{at a high}} school in New Zealand was {{analysed}} after spending one year at the school conducting interviews with the girls. Expressions of identity and social group membership have been identified. One dichotomy among the social grouping of the girls is where they choose to <b>eat</b> <b>lunch,</b> namely whether they <b>eat</b> <b>lunch</b> in the common room or not. This paper investigates phonetic differences for the word like among its different grammatical categories. It also investigates whether a particular girlâ€™s realisation of the word like can be predicted by whether or not she <b>eats</b> <b>lunch</b> in the common room. It appears that girls who <b>eat</b> <b>lunch</b> in the common are significantly more likely to have monophthongisation in the word like, and that {{this is especially true for}} quotative like. These results suggest that it is necessary to have a model of speech production which can account for socially ascribed phonetic variation within a single word which has different grammatical categories. 1...|$|R

25|$|A Jefferson County Sheriff's Deputy, Neil Gardner, was {{assigned}} to the high school as a full-time uniformed and armed school resource officer. Gardner usually ate lunch with students in the cafeteria, but on April 20 he was <b>eating</b> <b>lunch</b> in his patrol car at the northwest corner of the campus, watching students in the Smokers' Pit in Clement Park. The security staff at Columbine did not observe the bombs being placed in the cafeteria, since a custodian was replacing the school security video tape as it happened. The bags holding the bombs were first visible on the fresh security tape, but they were not identified as suspicious items. No witness recalled seeing the duffel bags being added to the 400 or so backpacks already in the cafeteria.|$|E

25|$|Stalin {{worked into}} the evenings, <b>eating</b> <b>lunch</b> at 4 or 5pm and dinner no earlier than 9pm; other senior {{political}} figures had to accommodate his unusual working patterns. He {{spent much time}} in the Kremlin cinema, where he enjoyed watching films with other high-ranking officials late at night; he had a particular fondness for the Western genre. Stalin enjoyed alcoholic beverages, and at dinner parties and other social events would encourage those around him to join in, hoping that in a drunken state they would reveal secrets. He enjoyed practical jokes, for instance by putting a tomato on the seat of Politburo members and waiting for them to sit on it, and encouraged singing at social events. As an infant, Stalin had displayed a love of flowers, and later in life he became a keen gardener. His dacha in the Moscow suburb of Volynskoe was surrounded by a 50-acre park, with Stalin devoting much attention to its agricultural activities. Stalin was also an accomplished billiards player.|$|E
25|$|Five {{independent}} {{witnesses were}} called to testify {{on behalf of the}} defense as to Collins' whereabouts on the dates Karen Sue Beineman had disappeared and her body had been found. Four of these witnesses were employees of a motorcycle sales firm which Collins had visited on the afternoon of Beineman's disappearance. Each testified on August 6. The timing of these four witnesses' recollections as to when Collins had actually entered the motorcycle shop varied slightly, although consensus among three of these men was that he had entered the premises as they were <b>eating</b> <b>lunch,</b> which they typically did anytime between one and two p.m. Upon cross-examination, the time factor of these witnesses as to when they had actually seen Collins expanded to between noon and two p.m. Two of these employees had signed statements affirming the time Collins had entered their premises was approximately two p.m., although one of these witnesses stated he had been repeatedly harassed by an Ann Arbor Police Sergeant as to the actual time he had seen Collins.|$|E

500|$|Joppenbergh Mountain is {{a nearly}} [...] {{mountain}} in Rosendale Village, a hamlet {{in the town}} of Rosendale, in Ulster County, New York. The mountain is composed of a carbonate bedrock overlain by glacially deposited material. It was named after Rosendale's founder, Jacob Rutsen, and mined throughout the late 19thcentury for dolostone that was used in the manufacture of natural cement. Extensive mining caused a large cave-in on December 19, 1899, that destroyed equipment and collapsed shafts within Joppenbergh. Though it was feared that several workers had been killed, the collapse happened while all the miners were outside, <b>eating</b> <b>lunch.</b> Since the collapse, the mountain has experienced shaking and periodic rockfalls.|$|E
500|$|Olga left Gatchina for {{the first}} time in the early fall of 1888 when the {{imperial}} family visited the Caucasus. On 29 October, their return train approached the small town of Borki at speed. Olga's parents and their four older children were <b>eating</b> <b>lunch</b> in the dining-car when the train lurched violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. The Tsar crawled out from beneath the crushed roof, and held it up with [...] "a Herculean effort" [...] so that the others could escape. There were 21 fatalities. Empress Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own clothes. An official investigation found that the crash was an accident, but it was widely assumed that two bombs had been planted on the line.|$|E
500|$|In the seventh-season episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] (1995), Lisa {{permanently}} {{becomes a}} vegetarian, distinguishing her {{as one of}} the first primetime television characters to make such a choice. The episode was written by David S. Cohen (in his first solo writing credit) who jotted down the idea one day while <b>eating</b> <b>lunch.</b> Then-executive producer David Mirkin, who had recently become a vegetarian, quickly approved the idea. Several of Lisa's experiences in the episode are based on Mirkin's own experiences. The episode guest stars musician Paul McCartney, a committed vegetarian and animal rights activist. McCartney's condition for appearing was that Lisa would remain a vegetarian for the rest of the series and would not revert the next week (as is common on situation comedies). The trait stayed and is one of the few permanent character changes made in the show. In the season 13 episode [...] "She of Little Faith" [...] (2001), Lisa underwent another permanent character change when she converted to Buddhism.|$|E

500|$|Monger saw {{the sixth}} track [...] "The State of Dreaming" [...] as a solemn {{offering}} {{from the record}} for its intellectual lyrical content, which he described as one of several tracks that [...] "reveal the lonely rebel, defiantly <b>eating</b> <b>lunch</b> alone, secretly wishing for acceptance." [...] "Power & Control" [...] was detailed as an electropop track by Emily Mackay from The Quietus, while Laura Snapes from Pitchfork commented that Diamandis repeatedly delivers the lyrics [...] "I am weak" [...] with an [...] "increasingly ephemeral voice" [...] as it progresses. Snapes also felt that [...] "Living Dead" [...] was a more [...] "vulnerable moment" [...] from Electra Heart, and compared it to the [...] "snappy [...] taut" [...] works of English duo Soft Cell. Monger recognised inspiration from American singer Lana Del Rey in [...] "Teen Idle" [...] and felt that it represented [...] "the feral blood of an army of disenfranchised high-school loners coming into their own". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse suggested that [...] "The Valley of the Dolls" [...] drew inspiration from the 1967 film of the same name, and described [...] "Hypocrates" [...] as a [...] "sparkling guitar-pop tune" [...] that takes stylistic influences from 1960s pop music and details the power struggle between romantic partners. Electra Heart closes with its 12th track [...] "Fear and Loathing", which experiments with electronic music styles; Petridis made particular note of its minimal production, which according to him, places emphasis on Diamandis' [...] "coolly enunciated and slightly folky" [...] vocals.|$|E
