5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The <b>interrogation</b> <b>signal</b> was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E

A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals ("pings"). When a hydrophone/transducer receives a specific <b>interrogation</b> <b>signal</b> it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal. To measure distance, one transducer/projector transmits an <b>interrogation</b> <b>signal</b> and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer/hydrophone reply. The time difference, scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two, is the distance between the two platforms. This technique, when used with multiple transducers/hydrophones/projectors, can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water.|$|E
25|$|Signaling {{between the}} reader and the tag is done in several {{different}} incompatible ways, depending on the frequency band used by the tag. Tags operating on LF and HF bands are, in terms of radio wavelength, {{very close to the}} reader antenna because they are {{only a small percentage of}} a wavelength away. In this near field region, the tag is closely coupled electrically with the transmitter in the reader. The tag can modulate the field produced by the reader by changing the electrical loading the tag represents. By switching between lower and higher relative loads, the tag produces a change that the reader can detect. At UHF and higher frequencies, the tag is more than one radio wavelength away from the reader, requiring a different approach. The tag can backscatter a signal. Active tags may contain functionally separated transmitters and receivers, and the tag need not respond on a frequency related to the reader's <b>interrogation</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E

Unfortunately, to provide a sufficient ranging accuracy, FM chirp-based <b>interrogation</b> <b>signals</b> must be wideband {{at the expense of}} a high-noise level that must be counteracted by adopting extremely high transmitter power levels (> 1 KW) and mechanical-steered high-directional antennas.

5000|$|SHORAN used {{ground-based}} transponders {{to respond}} to <b>interrogation</b> <b>signals</b> sent from the bomber aircraft. By measuring the round-trip time to and {{from one of the}} transponders, the distance to that ground station could be accurately determined. The aircraft flew an arcing path that kept it at a predetermined distance from one of the stations. The distance to a second station was also being measured, and when it reached a predetermined distance from that station as well, the bombs were dropped. The basic idea was similar to the Oboe system developed by the Royal Air Force, but in Oboe the transponder was on the aircraft. This limited Oboe to guiding a single aircraft per ground station, while SHORAN could guide dozens, limited only by how rapidity the ground station's transponders could respond.|$|R
40|$|Existing {{approaches}} for information extraction in {{wireless sensor networks}} are heavily geared towards in-network processing, which generally incurs excess delay and energy consumption due to the attendant tasks of information routing and coordination between nodes. In this paper, we introduce an alternative concept of Active Wireless Sensing in which a wireless information retriever (WIR) interrogates a select ensemble of nodes for rapid and energy-efficient retrieval of desired information. Active Wireless Sensing has two primary attributes: i) the sensor nodes are “dumb ” in that they have limited computational ability, and ii) the WIR is computationally powerful, is equipped with an antenna array, and directly interrogates the sensor ensemble with wideband space-time waveforms. Our approach {{is based on an}} intimate connection between Active Wireless Sensing and wideband multi-antenna wireless channels in multipath propagation environments: the sensor nodes play the role of active scatterers and generate a multipath response to WIR’s <b>interrogation</b> <b>signals.</b> We illustrate the basic communication architecture in Active Wireless Sensing and the corresponding signal processing at the WIR. Preliminary simulation results are presented to illustrate a fundamental rate versus reliability tradeoff in Active Wireless Sensing. 1...|$|R

50|$|Secondary {{surveillance}} radar (SSR) is a radar system used in {{air traffic control}} (ATC), that not only detects and measures the position of aircraft i.e. bearing, but also requests additional information from the aircraft itself such as its identity and altitude. Unlike primary radar systems that measure the bearing of targets using the detected reflections of radio signals, SSR relies on targets equipped with a radar transponder, that replies to each <b>interrogation</b> <b>signal</b> by transmitting a response containing encoded data. SSR {{is based on the}} military identification friend or foe (IFF) technology originally developed during World War II, therefore the two systems are still compatible. Monopulse secondary {{surveillance radar}} (MSSR), Mode S, TCAS and ADS-B are similar modern methods of secondary surveillance.|$|E
5000|$|Later {{in the war}} Bomber Command {{desired to}} deploy a new {{navigation}} system not for location fixing, but to mark a single spot in the air.

The Oboe system provided this already; Oboe sent an <b>interrogation</b> <b>signal</b> from stations in the UK, [...] "reflected" [...] them from transceivers on the aircraft, and timed {{the difference between the two}} signals using equipment similar to Gee. However, Oboe had the major limitation that it could only guide a single aircraft at a time and took about 10 minutes to guide a single aircraft to its target. A system able to guide more aircraft at once would be a dramatic improvement.|$|E
40|$|Most {{existing}} {{information extraction}} schemes in sensor networks rely on in-network processing that requires information routing and coordination between sensor nodes and incurs a corresponding overhead in delay and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose {{a viable alternative}} – Active Wireless Sensing (AWS) – in which a Wireless Information Retriever (WIR) queries a select ensemble of nodes to obtain desired information in a rapid and energyefficient manner. AWS has two primary attributes: i) the sensor nodes are “dumb ” in that they have limited computational ability, and ii) the WIR is computationally powerful, is equipped with an antenna array, and directly interrogates the sensor ensemble with wideband space-time waveforms. AWS is inspired by an intimate connection with communication over multipath channels: the sensor nodes act as active scatterers and produce a multipath response to the WIR’s <b>interrogation</b> <b>signals.</b> We develop the basic communication architecture in AWS and explore various signaling and reception strategies at the WIR, and encoding strategies at the sensors. The basic communication architecture is quite flexible and can cater {{to a variety of}} information retrieval tasks. In particular, we illustrate the framework in two extreme information retrieval tasks: high-rate information retrieval corresponding to distributed independent sensor measurements, and low-rate retrieval corresponding to localized correlated measurements. A low-complexity interference suppression technique is proposed for significantly increasing the capacity and reliability of high-rate information retrieval. Performance analysis reveals a fundamental rate versus reliability tradeoff in AWS and is illustrated with accompanying simulation results...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{main and}} tail rotor systems of a {{helicopter}} must be maintained in a damage-free condition {{to ensure the safety}} of the helicopter. The components of the rotor system require regular maintenance and inspection, and some of the components are difficult to inspect. Accordingly, an integrated sensor system that continuously monitors the structural integrity of the rotor system is needed to assure the safety of flight and reduce the cost of maintenance of the rotor system. This smart monitoring system could also provide immediate information on the dynamic loading in the rotor system. This information could define the performance limit of the helicopter based on the condition of the rotor system. The operator will then be able to adjust the flight condition and prevent damage from occurring or propagating. The challenges in designing this monitoring system are related to the operating conditions of the helicopter. These include significant aerodynamic and external damping in bending and torsion modes, moderate nonlinearities in the system, large dynamic loads, and difficulty in actuating pure <b>interrogation</b> <b>signals</b> in the airborne condition. In this paper, piezoceramic sensors and actuators and different techniques for damage detection that use symmetry properties of the structure and no structural model are tested in a static condition for health monitoring {{of a helicopter}} flexbeam.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} SSR {{is to improve}} the ability to detect and {{identify}} aircraft while automatically providing the Flight Level (pressure altitude) of an aircraft. An SSR ground station transmits interrogation pulses on 1030 MHz (continuously in Modes A, C and selectively, in Mode S) as its antenna rotates, or is electronically scanned, in space. An aircraft transponder within line-of-sight range 'listens' for the SSR <b>interrogation</b> <b>signal</b> and transmits a reply on 1090 MHz that provides aircraft information. The reply sent depends on the interrogation mode. The aircraft is displayed as a tagged icon on the controller's radar screen at the measured bearing and range. An aircraft without an operating transponder still may be observed by primary radar, but would be displayed to the controller without the benefit of SSR derived data. It is typically a requirement to have a working transponder in order to fly in controlled air space and many aircraft have a back-up transponder to ensure that condition is met.|$|E

In addition the system presents automatic evaluation and alarms, which provide both location data and sensor readout data of the monitored area. This system is a stand-alone modular system in which a common two wire line installed bow-to-stern and top-to-bottom, connects, integrates, evaluates, and powers a multiplicity of sensors. The United States Navy uses this system to provide safety and survivability by monitoring environmental gases, liquid levels, and power, temperature, and humidity levels on ships and in office buildings. The automatic monitoring system operates {{in a manner similar}} to an automatic, multiscriber, party-line telephone system. The system is controlled by the Scanner/Display unit which interrogates each of the 150 possible sensors according to the program stored in a microprocessor. This patented system provides a separate address for each sensor transponder, permitting all of the transponders to be simply connected in parallel across a common, twisted pair transmission line. The interrogating signal is also used to provide power (6 V - 2 mA) for the sensor transponders and their associated sensors. This further simplifies the system by eliminating the need for a separate source of power at each sensor location. Each sensor is interrogated with a 15 -bit sequence which specifies: (1) the address of the sensor which is to reply, (2) the parameter to be reported (e. g. voltage, temperature, humidity, etc.) And (3) the desired precision (which sets the length of the reply).
