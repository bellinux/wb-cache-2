Behaviour of 14 Sanan and Jamnapari goats (14 Kg- 37 Kg) <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> stilted house was observed using an ethograme for six one hour sessions in two days (rainy and hot). Each session lasted for five minutes. Frequency and times spent on seventeen mutually exhaustive behaviours were recorded. Goats spent significantly (P< 0. 05) more time on eating (31 %) than any of the other behaviours. Other important behaviours were resting (11 %), licking (10 %), ruminating (10 %) and walking (9. 5 %). Goats spent a substantial time on behaviours such as lying (7. 3 %), running (6. 3 %), freezing (6 %) and animal interaction (5. 7 %). The time budget on behaviours such as saltate (0. 5 %), sniffing (0. 59 %), chattering (0. 59 %) and importantly on drinking (0. 6 %) were very low. Behaviors such as freezing, head movement, animal interaction, saltate, running, rumination, chattering and chirping were affected by the climatic condition of the day.

40|$|Brucellosis {{is a major}} {{constraint}} for small-scale goat farming {{systems in}} Mexico. This study estimated the prevalence of testing positive to brucellosis and identified and quantified risk factors in goats from small-scale farms of Michoacán that had participated in a brucellosis campaign (i. e. vaccination, serological testing, culling and awareness) and of Jalisco that had negligible brucellosis campaign participation. A cross-sectional serological survey was conducted among 1, 713 goats of 83 flocks. The prevalence of testing positive to brucellosis was higher (38 %) in Jalisco than in Michoacán (11 %). Logistic regression analysis indicated that goats from Michoacán had lower odds to test positive for brucellosis (odds ratio (OR) = 0. 32, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 21 – 0. 48) compared to goats from Jalisco. Goats in zero-grazing systems had lower odds than goats in grazing systems (OR= 0. 22, 95 % CI 0. 09 – 0. 57).

None of the claw health or locomotion traits differed for the trimming methods. No interactions were found between flooring and trimming method. Floor effects were significant for several traits. Cows on the rubber-topped floors had significantly fewer sole hemorrhages (prevalence of 22 vs. 48 % in mo 3) and larger claws (claw length 76. 1 ± 5. 0 vs. 72. 5 ± 4. 9 mm; heel height 49. 3 ± 6. 3 vs. 46. 0 ± 6. 4 mm; claw diagonal 129 ± 6. 4 vs. 125 ± 6. 9 mm), spent more time standing in the alleys (55. 4 ± 2. 8 vs. 49. 6 ± 2. 8 %), and had higher activity (61. 0 ± 3. 7 vs. 53. 0 ± 3. 7 steps/h). This suggests greater claw comfort on rubber flooring compared with concrete flooring. Kinetic patterns during claw-floor contact while walking were similar for all treatments.

25|$|Domesticated {{horses are}} also subject to {{inconsistent}} movement between stabling and work; they must carry or pull additional weight, and in modern times, {{they are often}} kept and worked on very soft footing, such as irrigated land, arena footing, or <b>stall</b> bedding. <b>In</b> some cases, management is also inadequate. The hooves of horses that are <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>stalls</b> or small turnouts, even when cleaned adequately, are exposed to more moisture than would be encountered in the wild, {{as well as to}} ammonia from urine. The hoof capsule is mostly made from keratin, a protein, and is weakened by this exposure, becoming even more fragile and soft. Shoes do not prevent or reduce damage from moisture and ammonia exposure. Rather, they protect already weakened hooves. Further, without the natural conditioning factors present in the wild, the feet of horses grow overly large and long unless trimmed regularly. Hence, protection from rocks, pebbles, and hard, uneven surfaces is lacking. A balanced diet with proper nutrition also is a factor. Without these precautions, cracks in overgrown and overly brittle hoof walls are a danger, as is bruising of the soft tissues within the foot because of inadequately thick and hard sole material.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} take a holistic approach to assessing dry sow welfare in relation to gestation accommodation. Multiple factors that affect the welfare of a sow were considered. In addition, the multitude of systems in New Zealand {{that are used to}} accommodate dry sows in groups were captured. Commercial pig farms (n= 20 farms, 7, 912 sows total) were chosen to represent the spectrum of different layouts and management practices in order to obtain data {{from a wide range of}} different systems. During each on-farm visit, data concerning housing, management, sow behaviour, welfare and productivity were collected. A number of criteria were used to describe the farms (group size, stall duration, presence of bedding, feeding method, feeding frequency). Sows <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>stalls</b> for more than 5 weeks (n = 3 farms) had significantly higher injury scores than sows that were <b>in</b> <b>stalls</b> for a shorter length of time or sows that were not <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>stalls</b> for any period during mating or pregnancy. Sows fed twice daily had significantly higher stereotypies (P< 0. 05) than those fed at a different frequency. A welfare index (WI) was calculated for each farm. This index incorporated each farm‟s total scores for injuries, stereotypies, coat condition, soiling and lameness. A low WI represented a lower presence of indicators that were associated with compromises to welfare. Hence, a low WI represented good welfare. For each farm, the minimum possible WI was 0. 33, whilst the maximum possible WI was 5. 0. The mean WI was 0. 65 (± 0. 14 SD). Overall, there was not a high prevalence of indicators of compromised welfare. Out of the 20 farms, with an average herd size of 395. 60 sows per farm; only 10 sows in total were lame. Only three farms had sows with a coat condition score above 0 (normal). There was no difference between mean piglets born alive per litter (BA) for stalls (12. 65 ± 0. 36) vs. group housed sows for the entire gestation (12. 27 ± 0. 43), or for the number of piglets weaned per sow per year (stalls: 23. 70 ± 0. 59 W/S/Y, groups: 24. 92 ± 1. 23 W/S/Y). As a result of this study, it is clear that there is no perfect or ideal system for keeping dry sows, because a sow‟s needs change throughout different stages of the production cycle. Therefore the implication is that in any housing system, both the advantages and disadvantages relating to a sow‟s welfare will also change over time. In light of this, operators need to understand the variation both between and within systems and how best to manage them...|$|R

[...] As the name implies, a horse is tied, usually to a ring in front of a hay manger, and cannot turn around <b>in</b> a tie <b>stall.</b> [...] But if the stall is wide enough, it can lay down. [...] Tie stalls were used {{extensively}} prior to the 20th century, and barns with tie stalls are still seen in some regions, particularly in poorer countries, at older fairgrounds and agricultural exposition facilities, but are not used as often in modern barns.|$|R
40|$|The {{differences}} in stabling conditions {{may influence the}} microbiota in airway of healthy horses, and consequently result changes in airway infections. Diagnosis of airway affections may be reach by using tracheobronchial (TB) wash and pulmonary biopsy as well. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the pulmonary and TB microbiota in healthy horses submitted to different stabling. Eighteen healthy adult male quarterhorses were distributed in two groups: Group 1 (nine animals maintained in extensive regimen); and Group 2 (nine animals <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> <b>stall</b> conditions). The washes were carried out using physiologic solution in TB lumen through the intravenous catheter (14 G x 30 cm). Pulmonary biopsies were collected using semiautomatic Tru-cut needles (16 G x 20 cm). The material collected was submitted to microbiological culture. No trickiness was observed in the animals. At least one species of bacteria grown in wash tracheobronchial culture in the horses studied. In TB washes was observed predominance both of Gram negative and facultative aerobic microorganisms. In 38. 5 % out of the washes were isolated Gram-positive coccus, predominantly Staphylococcus. Escherichia coli and Enterobacter were isolated in 3 % and 11 %, respectively. The culture of airway in stabling animals showed a higher number of isolates in both wash and biopsy techniques comparing to the horses <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> extensive regimen...|$|R

Mrs Girvan <b>kept</b> <b>goats</b> <b>in</b> stone-built goat rees or pens on the good grazing near Garry Loch. The feral billy goats were wont to interfere with these nanny goats and this was another reason for their demise.|$|R
500|$|She viewed Arabians as {{requiring}} a smart and gentle approach. She advocated for trainers {{who used the}} methods of master horsemen such as Ray Hunt and Tom Dorrance, with Dorrance's philosophy being especially suitable for Arabians. She considered the breed to be inherently gentle, and pointed out that any horse can become [...] "hot" [...] if they are <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a <b>stall</b> 24hours a day, fed a lot of grain, and never ridden. Varian explained the nature of Arabian horses by analogy, comparing them to precocious children who show their ability with delight, but cannot be bullied or pushed around.|$|R
