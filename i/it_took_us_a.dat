500|$|After {{recording}} the song at Cosmos Studios and Kinglet Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, the band felt relieved {{to have a}} song that they were happy to release as their debut single. Band member Liam Payne called the song [...] "perfect", and Harry Styles said, [...] "When we were recording in the studio we knew instantly that we wanted this track to be our first single." [...] Styles spoke to MTV News, [...] "I think for us we wanted to release something that wasn't cheesy but it was fun. It kind of represented us, I think <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> while to find it but I think we found the right song." [...] Payne added, [...] "We always wanted [...] {{to be something that}} people didn't expect and then when we heard it, it wasn't what we expected either so it kind of fitted perfectly." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
2500|$|At first, Eon FM played {{songs that}} [...] "would not be played elsewhere", having no {{playlist}} and avoiding Top 40 songs. Said Armstrong, [...] "we {{thought we were}} going to be the beginning of a new era. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> while to realise we were wrong." ...|$|E
30|$|<b>It’s</b> <b>taken</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{little over}} 2 {{years from the}} idea to the launch and you can imagine {{there are lots of}} stories and anecdotes to fill many pages. However, being a {{responsible}} editor in chief, I’ll spare you the reminiscences. At the same time, (you have guessed my agenda) I hope that a brief editorial has a better chance of being read.|$|R

60|$|There was an unaccountable strangeness about Harris. It was {{something}} more than mere ordinary tiredness. He pulled the boat against {{a part of the}} bank from which it was quite impossible for us to get into it, and immediately went to sleep. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> immense amount of screaming and roaring to wake him up again and put some sense into him; but we succeeded at last, and got safely on board.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm {{sorry we}} are so late,' he was saying. 'We couldn't find a button-hook, so <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> long time to button our boots. But you were to the moment.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{long time}} to reach the carcass, and arduous labor to remove the great pelt. But at last the thing was accomplished, and we {{returned}} to camp dragging the heavy trophy behind us.|$|E
60|$|My {{teeth were}} chattering. These {{operations}} of salvage had taken time, and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> further unconscionable time {{to cover the}} distance {{between us and the}} brig as she lay hove-to, her maintopsail aback and her headsails drawing.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is useless," [...] said Leonard at last, {{throwing}} {{down his}} knife in despair; [...] "this wood is like iron, <b>it</b> would <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> week {{to cut through}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's {{the only}} way. And {{we might as}} well hurry, for it is getting late and <b>it</b> will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> good three hours to get back with such loads." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{long time}} to work around the islands and draw in close to Anoroc. In the leisure afforded we took turns working on our map, and {{by means of the}} compass and a little {{guesswork}} we set down the shoreline we had left and the three islands with fair accuracy.|$|E
6000|$|There was a noble good lot of {{them down}} cellar, and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> whole hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape. Then we heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes the old man, with a candle {{in one hand and}} a bundle of stuff in t'other, looking as {{absent-minded}} as year before last. He went a mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle and thinking. Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|From the top I had a {{good view}} of the offing, and of the coast for leagues. We were now quite a mile at sea, and, though the tide was no longer of any use to us, we were drawing through the water quite at the rate of two knots. I thought that the flood had made, and that <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> little on our lee-bow, hawsing us up to windward. Just as I had got the last lanyard fastened, the canoes began to appear, coming round the island by the farther passage, and {{promising}} to overtake us in the course of the next twenty minutes. The crisis demanded decision, and I determined to get the jib on the ship. Accordingly, I was soon on deck.|$|E
5000|$|Dave: [...] "It {{sounds like}} {{more than four}} people are playing, when in {{actuality}} there are almost zero overdubs &#8212; that's why <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> such <b>a</b> {{short amount of time}} record." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alas, alas!' he sighed; 'what in {{the world}} shall I do? Why, <b>it</b> would <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> year, {{possibly}} our whole lives, to eat up twelve oxen and twelve tons of bread.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>it</b> will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> {{few days}} to get settled down," [...] {{answered}} Dave, resting {{on the top of}} a table. [...] "I don't feel much like unpacking yet, do you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Well, after a great {{search for}} what was best and most convenient, Friday, at last, whose {{judgment}} in such affairs was much superior to mine, pitches upon a kind of wood the most fitting for it. To this day I cannot tell {{the name of the}} tree, nor describe it any other way, than only by saying, that it is like what we call fustic, or between that and the Niacaragua wood, being much of the same colour and smell. But though my man exceeded me in the knowledge of the most proper tree, yet I shewed him a much better and clearer way to make a canoe than ever he knew before; for he was for burning the hollow or cavity of the tree, in order to make this boat; but I then told him how he might do it with tools, learning him at the same time how to use them, which indeed he did very dexterously; so that in a month's time we finished it, making it very handsome, by cutting the outside in the true shape of a boat. After this <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> full fortnight before we could get her into the water, which we did as it were inch by inch, upon great rollers; but when she was in, she would have carried twenty men, with all the ease imaginable.|$|E
60|$|On {{the ninth}} day {{after leaving the}} canoes, having done, as I reckon, about a hundred and twenty miles, we began {{to emerge from the}} trees, which had grown smaller until they were mere shrubs. Their place was taken by an immense {{wilderness}} of bamboo, which grew so thickly that we could only penetrate it by cutting a pathway with the machetes and billhooks of the Indians. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> long day, traveling from seven in the morning till eight at night, with only two breaks of one hour each, to get through this obstacle. Anything more monotonous and wearying could not be imagined, for, even at the most open places, I could not see more than ten or twelve yards, while usually my vision was limited to the back of Lord John's cotton jacket in front of me, and to the yellow wall within a foot of me on either side. From above came one thin knife-edge of sunshine, and fifteen feet over our heads one saw the tops of the reeds swaying against the deep blue sky. I do not know what kind of creatures inhabit such a thicket, but several times we heard the plunging of large, heavy animals quite close to us. From their sounds Lord John judged them to be some form of wild cattle. Just as night fell we cleared the belt of bamboos, and at once formed our camp, exhausted by the interminable day.|$|E
60|$|We {{got out of}} {{the boat}} and ran to the buck, which was shot through the spine and stone dead. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> quarter of an hour or more to clean it and cut off as much of the best meat as we could carry, and, having packed this away, we had barely light enough to row up into the lagoon-like space, into which, there being a hollow in the swamp, the river here expanded. Just as the light {{vanished}} we cast anchor about thirty fathoms {{from the edge of the}} lake. We did not dare to go ashore, not knowing if we should find dry ground to camp on, and greatly fearing the poisonous exhalations from the marsh, from which we thought we should be freer on the water. So we lighted a lantern, and made our evening meal off another potted tongue in the best fashion that we could, and then prepared to go to sleep, only, however, to find that sleep was impossible. For, whether they were attracted by the lantern, or by the unaccustomed smell of a white man for which they had been waiting for the last thousand years or so, I know not; but certainly we were presently attacked by tens of thousands of the most blood-thirsty, pertinacious, and huge mosquitoes that I ever saw or read of. In clouds they came, and pinged and buzzed and bit till we were nearly mad. Tobacco smoke only seemed to stir them into a merrier and more active life, till at length we were driven to covering ourselves with blankets, head and all, and sitting to slowly stew and continually scratch and swear beneath them. And as we sat, suddenly rolling out like thunder through the silence came the deep roar of a lion, and then of a second lion, moving among the reeds within sixty yards of us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what time it is, good people? Half-past six, and the Custances are to dine with <b>us</b> at <b>a</b> quarter-past-seven. <b>It</b> will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> good hour to get down; what shall we do?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Buchanan {{explained}} the song's concept and lyrical interpretation during a track by track {{analysis of the}} album on the group's official website, saying: [...] "This song is about reacting to the press when they slag you off, about how they judge you. When we heard the song we loved it. To be honest, any publicity is good publicity whether it's positive or negative, and <b>it's</b> <b>taken</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> while to get that. When the press write something negative and something that's untrue, it's hard {{to look at that}} in a positive way. We could really relate to the song." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} would {{certainly}} be the best plan. At present we are groping altogether in the dark, and <b>it</b> will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> fortnight at least to make that row of holes close to each other, as you propose." ...|$|R
50|$|P. Simon : It wasn't easy. The {{first issue}} was {{prepared}} in January '41. We printed {{it with a}} child's printing press. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> month to print 50 copies. Each copy consisted of a single sheet of paper, printed front and back.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2001 interview, Lucy Lippard noted, [...] "Lee was {{extraordinarily}} intense, one of {{the first}}, if not the first person (along with Ian Wilson) who did the life-as-art thing.

6000|$|... "What a pity," [...] said Frank, as he {{crouched}} behind a projecting rock, [...] "that it's out of shot! <b>It</b> would <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> hour {{at least to}} get behind it, and there's little chance, I fear, of its waiting for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} start soon, Ralph. <b>It</b> may <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> hour, or even two, {{to get down}} to the water; for we must go along like ghosts, so as not to alarm the sentries; and we shall have walls to get over, and all sorts of difficulties." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Farther than that, lad. It {{must be one}} of the mansions {{along the}} Strand. A fire always looks closer than it is.

5000|$|Apparently he'd {{run through}} the prized {{fighting}} chickens and got the best rooster's chain wrapped around his foot.

5000|$|Martin Truex Jr. {{scored the}} pole {{for the race}} {{with a time of}} 28.284 and a speed of 190.921 mph.

We feel like we made some mistakes throughout qualifying and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> while to figure out this three round deal. Things have really been going well for us and clicking well. I love this race track. We’ve really been able to perform well here.” ...|$|E
5000|$|My {{brother and}} I had {{suspected}} the apartment {{would be in}} disorder. But what we found exceeded our worst expectations. Like most [...] "Messies" [...] my mother {{would do anything to}} make sure no one ever saw the inside of her home. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> entire month to clean out the apartment, and we had to work our way through mountains of things. We unearthed a lot of documents about our family history, including photos going back to the 1880s, film footage from the 30s and 40s, and all the home movies my mother shot from the 1960s onward. This precious material - roughly seventy years of an unusual family history - became the first impulse for making a film. And the possibility of filming in the apartment, without interference from relatives.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Talks, De Palma {{said that he had}} 8 or 9 high-speed cameras to film Cassavetes exploding. [...] "The first time we did it, it didn't work. The body parts didn't go towards the right cameras and this whole set was covered with blood. And <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> almost <b>a</b> week to get back to do take two." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>us</b> half <b>an</b> hour’s hard labour, after that, {{before it}} was {{properly}} up, and then we cleared the decks, and got out supper. We put the kettle on to boil, up in {{the nose of the}} boat, and went down to the stern and pretended to take no notice of it, but set to work to get the other things out.|$|R
