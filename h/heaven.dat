5|$|During the Qin dynasty, {{the first}} Qin emperor's {{legitimacy}} to rule was ultimately decided by {{his ability to}} conquer others. However, {{by the time of}} Wang Mang's (r. 9–23 AD) reign, the Mandate of <b>Heaven</b> was considered the only legitimate source of imperial authority. This concept was given greater prominence after the state officially sponsored the worship of <b>Heaven</b> over that of the Five Powers in 31 BC. Moreover, the philosophy of the scholar Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC), which held that a dynasty's rule on earth was bound to greater cosmological cycles in the universe, was officially sponsored by the Han court from Emperor Wu's (r. 141–87 BC) reign onward. The emperor was expected to behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, lest he incur the wrath of <b>Heaven</b> and bring an end to his reign. He became the highest priest in the land. By performing certain religious rites and rituals, the emperor acted as a sacred link between <b>Heaven</b> and Earth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Heaven</b> is {{represented}} by an entrance to the Heavenly City, which is in a contemporary Gothic style illuminated by long, thin rays of light. The saved approach clasping their hands in prayer, and are greeted at the entrance by an angel. Only a few souls pass through the heavenly gates at a time. The imagery of a church as an earthly representation of <b>Heaven</b> was popularised in the 13th century by theologians such as Durandus; the gate to <b>Heaven</b> in this work resembles {{the entrance to the}} Beaune hospice. The way to <b>Heaven</b> is shown clearly as a gilded church– the saved ascend a set of steps, turn right, and disappear from sight. It is fully enclosed in a single panel, whereas Hell extends onto the adjoining panel, perhaps hinting that sin contaminates all around it.|$|E

50|$|In {{the present}} day, the <b>Heavens</b> are in disarray {{due to the}} lack of Akuto flowing into the <b>Heavens.</b> The <b>Heavens,</b> divided into kingdoms, battle each other. The Magical Kingdom is blamed for using the Akuto the most and the other kingdoms seek to destroy the Magical Kingdom in hopes of {{preserving}} what little is left of the Akuto. Should the <b>Heavens</b> be destroyed due to a lack of Akuto, the floating islands in the sky will fall to the Earth and the <b>Heavens</b> and human civilization will perish. The Magical Kingdom is led by their king Munto who believes the only way to save the <b>Heavens</b> from destruction is to seek out Yumemi Hidaka who holds the key to restoring the Akuto to the <b>Heavens.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the Harivansh Puraan, the Parijata, baobab tree, {{is called}} a Kalpavriksha, or wish bearing tree, which apart {{from the village of}} Kintoor, near Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, is only found in <b>heaven.</b> The tree has mythological link with prince Arjuna of the Pandava clan who is said to have brought it from <b>heaven.</b> His mother Kunti after whom the village Kintoor is named used to offer flowers from this tree to worship Lord Shiva. It is also said that Lord Krishna brought this tree from <b>heaven</b> to please his wife Satyabhama.|$|E
5|$|Purgatory is a {{temporary}} condition for the purification of souls who, although destined for <b>Heaven,</b> are not fully detached from sin and thus cannot enter <b>Heaven</b> immediately. In Purgatory, the soul suffers, and is purged and perfected. Souls in purgatory may be aided in reaching <b>heaven</b> by the prayers of the faithful on earth and by the intercession of saints.|$|E

5|$|William <b>Heaven</b> was {{succeeded by}} his son the Reverend Hudson Grosset <b>Heaven</b> who, thanks to a legacy from Sarah Langworthy (née <b>Heaven),</b> was able to fulfill his life's {{ambition}} of building a stone church on the island. St Helen's was completed in 1896, and stands today as a lasting memorial to the <b>Heaven</b> period. It has been designated by English Heritage a Grade II listed building. He {{is said to have}} been able to afford either a church or a new harbour. His choice of the church was not however in the best financial interests of the island. The unavailability of the money for re-establishing the family's financial soundness, coupled with disastrous investment and speculation in the early 20th century, caused severe financial hardship.|$|E

5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish <b>Heaven,</b> where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} <b>Heaven,</b> and thus he should do more to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish <b>Heaven,</b> where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his many other roles, the emperor acted as the highest priest in the land who made sacrifices to <b>Heaven,</b> the main deities known as the Five Powers, and the spirits (shen 神) of mountains and rivers.

If the emperor did not behave according to proper ritual, ethics, and morals, he could disrupt the fine balance of these cosmological cycles and cause calamities such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, epidemics, and swarms of locusts.|$|E
