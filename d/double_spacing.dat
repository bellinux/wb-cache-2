50|$|Leading {{can be used}} {{to enhance}} the {{readability}} of a page or block of text. The standard leading used in printing is usually +2 points for mechanically set body text, or +20% in digital typesetting. In both cases, with a 10 pt font the usual leading is 12 pt, creating a 10/12 ratio, which is considered single spacing. Some type designers recommend a leading between 120% and 145% of the font size.Double spacing is an entrenched practice due to the era of typewriters and, in academic settings, to allow the addition of handwritten comments and proofreading. Typewriters had a limited number of options for leading, and <b>double</b> <b>spacing</b> was chosen as a default. <b>Double</b> <b>spacing</b> can increase the amount of unused white space on a page and lessen the number of lines on a page. Too much leading can cause continuity problems, as the eyes of the reader are required to travel a greater distance between lines of text.|$|E

The objective {{is to build a}} data structure so that given any query point q in the space, it is possible to efficiently determine a point of S whose distance from q is within a factor of (1 + ε) of the distance between q and its nearest neighbor in S. In this paper we obtain the following space-time tradeoffs. Given a parameter γ ∈ [2, 1 /ε], we show how to construct a data structure of space nγ O(dim) log(1 /ε) space that can answer queries in time O(log(nγ)) +(1 /(εγ)) O(dim). This is the first result that offers space-time tradeoffs for approximate nearest neighbor queries in <b>doubling</b> <b>spaces.</b> At one extreme it nearly matches the best result currently known for <b>doubling</b> <b>spaces,</b> and at the other extreme it results in a data structure that can answer queries in time O(log(n/ε)), which matches the best query times in Euclidean space.
