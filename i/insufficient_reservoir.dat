40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to problems of data assimilation, also known as history matching, of oilfield production data by adjustment of the location and sharpness of patterns of geological facies. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed using gradient based approaches with a level set parameterization of the geology. Gradient-based methods are robust, but computationally demanding with real-world <b>reservoir</b> problems and <b>insufficient</b> for <b>reservoir</b> management uncertainty assessment. Recently, the ensemble filter approach has been used to tackle this problem because of its high efficiency from the standpoint of implementation, computational cost, and performance. Incorporation of level set parameterization in this approach could further deal with the lack of differentiability with respect to facies type, but its practical implementation is based on some assumptions that are not easily satisfied in real problems. In this work, we propose to describe the geometry of the permeability field using B-spline curves. This transforms history matching of the discrete facies type to the estimation of continuous B-spline control points. As filtering scheme, we use the ensemble square-root filter (EnSRF). The efficacy of the EnSRF with the B-spline parameterization is investigated through three numerical experiments, in which the reservoir contains a curved channel, a disconnected channel or a 2 -dimensional closed feature. It is found that the application of the proposed method to the problem of adjusting facies edges to match production data is relatively straightforward and provides statistical estimates of the distribution of geological facies and {{of the state of the}} reservoir. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

The process involves injecting gas through the tubing-casing annulus. Injected gas aerates the fluid to reduce its density; the formation pressure is then able to lift the oil column and forces the fluid out of the wellbore.

To enhance the financial revenues this operation has usually always been a subject for optimization to reach the most rewarding design before its operational establishment. Evolutionary approaches have recently been successfully applied to almost every aspect of engineering problems. This study reviews the general facts and ideas related to the gas lift and its optimization and further focus on the application and evaluation of genetic programming for such a purpose. It has been concluded that genetic programming is fully capable in aiding faster gas lift optimizations while is also stable and applicable to a very broad range of operating conditions.

30|$|Shale gas {{reservoirs}} {{have some}} unique attributes which make hydraulic fracturing {{a viable option}} for natural gas production. Unlike conventional gas <b>reservoirs,</b> <b>insufficient</b> permeability, the ultra-low porosity of shale rock, and the limited reservoir contact, but the widespread organic matter in shale, cannot offer production in a commercial quantity without stimulation processes. Development of shale resources {{is still in its}} early stages and most wells are at the early stage of their working lifetime. Moreover, reservoir simulations and modeling of unconventional reservoirs has gained much attention in the recent years. Many studies have been conducted from the shale pore scale up to reservoir scales to improve the understanding of flow behavior in complex shale formations. Among them, researchers such as Brown et al. (2009), Cipolla et al. (2010), Moghanloo and Javadpour (2014), Omidvar Eshkalak (2013), Aybar et al. (2014 a, b, c, 2015), and Eshkalak et al.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{artificial}} reservoirs {{has increased dramatically}} in last hundred years, a time when anthropogenic soil erosion rates have also increased in many areas. Previous estimates of total organic carbon burial in reservoirs are generally {{in the range of}} 0. 2 to 0. 4 Pg yr- 1. However, a variety of data sources suggest that total global clastic sedimentation in reservoirs may be 35 Pg yr- 1 or more. If this sediment averages 2 % organic carbon then total carbon burial in reservoirs is ~ 0. 7 Pg yr- 1. In areas where soil surface erosion is a minor part of sediment yield the fractional organic carbon content may be lower. Considerable uncertainty regarding the magnitude of carbon burial in reservoirs results from: 1) rapid increases in numbers of reservoirs; 2) under-representation of small reservoirs in available datasets; 3) <b>insufficient</b> data on <b>reservoir</b> sedimentation rates and the organic carbon content of reservoir sediments; and 4) temporal change in sedimentation rates.

40|$|Chimpanzees in west central Africa (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) are endemically {{infected}} with simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVcpzPtt) that {{have crossed the}} species barrier to humans and gorillas on at least five occasions, generating pandemic and nonpandemic forms of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) as well as gorilla SIV (SIVgor). Chimpanzees in east Africa (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) are also {{infected with}} SIVcpz; however, their viruses (SIVcpzPts) have never been found in humans. To examine whether {{this is due to}} a paucity of natural infections, we used noninvasive methods to screen wild-living eastern chimpanzees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Uganda, and Rwanda. We also screened bonobos (Pan paniscus) in the DRC, a species not previously tested for SIV in the wild. Fecal samples (n = 3, 108) were collected at 50 field sites, tested for species and subspecies origin, and screened for SIVcpz antibodies and nucleic acids. Of 2, 565 samples from eastern chimpanzees, 323 were antibody positive and 92 contained viral RNA. The antibody-positive samples represented 76 individuals from 19 field sites, all sampled north of the Congo River in an area spanning 250, 000 km(2). In this region, SIVcpzPts was common and widespread, with seven field sites exhibiting infection rates of 30 % or greater. The overall prevalence of SIVcpzPts infection was 13. 4 % (95 % confidence interval, 10. 7 % to 16. 5 %). In contrast, none of the 543 bonobo samples from six sites was antibody positive. All newly identified SIVcpzPts strains clustered in strict accordance to their subspecies origin; however, they exhibited considerable genetic diversity, especially in protein domains known to be under strong host selection pressure. Thus, the absence of SIVcpzPts zoonoses cannot be explained by an <b>insufficient</b> primate <b>reservoir.</b> Instead, greater adaptive hurdles may have prevented the successful colonization of humans by P. t. schweinfurthii viruses...|$|R

In situ, bone marrow MYH 9 megakaryocytes were irregularly shaped, appearing leaky with poorly defined limits. The demarcation mem-branes were abnormally organized and poorly developed, pointing to an <b>insufficient</b> <b>reservoir</b> for the future formation of plate-lets. The cytoskeletal-rich peripheral zone was lacking due {{to the absence of}} the myo-sin filament network that normally sur-rounds the granular zone in wild-type cells. In vitro studies of cultured cells showed that MYH 9 megakaryocytes were unable to form stress fibers upon adhesion to colla-gen, suggesting that the leaky shape results from defects in internal tension and anchor-age to theextracellularenvironment. Surpris-ingly, the proportion of cells extending pro-platelets was increased in MYH 9 megakaryocytes and the proplatelet buds were larger.

40|$|Gas lift is an {{artificial}} lift technique which {{is intended to}} be used in oil and gas production systems to enhance the oil recovery rate. The technique is used in production systems which suffers from insufficient production rates because of inadequate reservoir pressure. The principle is to inject extra gas, from an external source, into the fluid mixture flowing out of the reservoir. This reduces the weight of the fluid column, which in turn enables the reservoir pressure to lift the mixture of fluids up to the surface. Thus, the restriction in production rate, resulting from <b>insufficient</b> <b>reservoir</b> pressure, is resolved. The casing heading instability cycle is a phenomenon which may occur in such gas lift systems at certain pressure and flow conditions. In such a case, a blocking constraint leads to an accumulation of gas that is building up a high pressure in the container storing the extra gas. Eventually the pressure is able to overcome the blocking constraint which further leads to a production flow blow out at the surface. This process repeats itself {{over a period of several}} hours. The resulting flow regime may be damaging to the receiving surface equipment. It also leads to a decrease in the average production rate, which is highly undesirable. In this thesis a new low order mathematical model to describe the casing heading instability is presented. The model is further compared and fitted to a gas lift case implemented in the advanced OLGA flow simulator, which is regarded as the real flow process in this thesis. A controllability analysis is performed on the newly fitted model, and the results of the analysis are used to investigate which control structures that seems reasonable for stabilizing the casing heading instability. The most promising control strategies are further tested in simulations, both on the low order model and on the advanced flow simulator. The results from the analysis, which is further confirmed in simulations, show that out of the measurement candidates that were considered in this thesis, the bottom hole pressure, i. e., the pressure measured in the well or near the depth of the producing formation, is the single best measurement to use for both disturbance rejection and stabilization of the system. However, this measurement is known to be unreliable, if at all available, because of its location in a harsh environment. Another control structure which showed promising results both in analysis and simulations is therefore concluded as the better choice. This is a cascaded control structure, which only relies on realistically available top side pressure measurements. It proved successful in stabilizing the system. </p...|$|E
5000|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is used {{to increase}} {{the rate at which}} fluids, such as petroleum, water, or natural gas can be recovered from subterranean natural reservoirs. Reservoirs are typically porous sandstones, limestones or dolomite rocks, but also include [...] "unconventional reservoirs" [...] such as shale rock or coal beds. Hydraulic fracturing enables the extraction of natural gas and oil from rock formations deep below the earth's surface (generally 5000 - 20000 ft), which is greatly below typical groundwater reservoir levels. At such depth, there may be <b>insufficient</b> permeability or <b>reservoir</b> pressure to allow natural gas and oil to flow from the rock into the wellbore at high economic return. Thus, creating conductive fractures in the rock is instrumental in extraction from naturally impermeable shale reservoirs. Permeability is measured in the microdarcy to nanodarcy range. Fractures are a conductive path connecting a larger volume of reservoir to the well. So-called [...] "super fracking," [...] creates cracks deeper in the rock formation to release more oil and gas, and increases efficiency. [...] The yield for typical shale bores generally falls off after the first year or two, but the peak producing life of a well can be extended to several decades.|$|R
40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) establishes {{and maintains}} a lifelong persistence following infection in an immunocompetent host. The determinants {{of a stable}} virus-host relationship are poorly defined. A nonhuman primate model for HCMV was used to investigate virological and host parameters of infection in a healthy host. Juvenile rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were inoculated with rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV), either orally or intravenously (i. v.), and longitudinally necropsied. None of the animals displayed clinical signs of disease, although hematologic abnormalities were observed intermittently in i. v. inoculated animals. RhCMV DNA was detected transiently in the plasma of all animals at 1 to 2 weeks postinfection (wpi) and in multiple tissues beginning at 2 to 4 wpi. Splenic tissue was the only organ positive for RhCMV DNA in all animals. The location of splenic cells expressing RhCMV immediate-early protein 1 (IE 1) in i. v. inoculated animals changed following inoculation. At 4 to 5 wpi, most IE 1 -positive cells were perifollicular, and at 25 wpi, the majority were located within the red pulp. All animals developed anti-RhCMV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies within 1 to 2 wpi and IgG antibodies within 2 to 4 wpi against {{a limited number of}} viral proteins. Host reactivity to RhCMV proteins increased in titer (total and neutralizing) and avidity with time. These results demonstrate that while antiviral immune responses were able to protect from disease, they were <b>insufficient</b> to eliminate <b>reservoirs</b> of persistent viral gene expression...|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigates the}} time-scales for {{hydrocarbon}} components in an isothermal oil reservoir column to reach thermodynamic equilibrium under the competing influences of molecular diffusion and gravitational segregation by gravity diffusion. The influence of non ideal behaviour on the equilibrium compositional profile, {{as well as}} on the equilibrium time for some examples of binary and ternary hydrocarbon mixtures is also investigated. When the variation of hydrocarbon composition within a field cannot be described by standard steady-state models of gravity-diffusion equilibrium, it is usually assumed to be caused by some degree of hindrance to the connectivity of the oil volume, a situation known as reservoir compartmentalization. However, order of magnitude estimates of the time taken for thermodynamic equilibrium to be established by diffusion are similar to the ages of many hydrocarbon reservoirs (between 1 million and 100 million years). Thus it is possible that compositional variations within a reservoir may be simply due to there having been <b>insufficient</b> time from <b>reservoir</b> filling for diffusion to equilibrate compositions. It is important to determine the time-scales for vertical compositional gradients to be established in order to assess whether compositional profiles that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium are indicative of barriers to flow within the reservoir or simply that the reservoir fluids have not yet had time to establish a steady-state distribution. A macroscopic, numerical model of the thermodynamic behaviour of the reservoir fluids has been used for this investigation. The model has been validated against simple transient analytic solutions for molecular diffusion, as well as steady-state solutions for molecular/gravity diffusion in binary mixtures. It was found that a uniform mixture of methane and undecane will segregate over a vertical distance of 300 m in a few hundred thousand years and that this timescale can be affected by non-ideal mixing and the relative proportions of the two components. Equilibrium time was found to be a function of the competing influences of molecular diffusion and gravitational segregation. We also use our model to investigate laboratory observations of compositional grading in ternary mixtures of methane, n-pentane and 1 -methylnapthalene reported by Ratulowski et al. (2003) and why their numerical simulation produced an unexpectedly smaller separation when methylnaphthalene was replaced by n-undecane, although methylnaphthalene and undecane have almost the same molar weight. Our study also provides insight into the relative importance of density, molecular diffusion, initial composition and realmixture modelling (as opposed to ideal mixture assumptions) on compositional grading in a fluid more representative of a real crude oil.
