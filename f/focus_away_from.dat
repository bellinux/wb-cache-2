Board and coaching instability during the 1980s and 1990s distracted the club and forced its <b>focus</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> becoming an on-field force.|$|E
25|$|Cambodia {{is one of}} 22 {{countries}} {{listed by}} WHO as having a high burden of tuberculosis. WHO estimates that 64% of all Cambodians carry the tuberculosis mycobacterium.

25|$|It {{is clear}} to just about {{everyone}} but the die-hard neoconservatives within this administration that shifting our <b>focus</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein was perhaps the biggest strategic blunder in our nation's history.

25|$|Winnicott's {{theoretical}} elusiveness {{has been}} linked to his efforts to modify Kleinian views. But whereas from a Kleinian standpoint, his repudiation of the concepts of envy and the death instinct were a resistant retreat from the harsh realities she had found in infant life, he has also been accused of being too close to Klein: of sharing in her regressive shift of <b>focus</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Oedipus complex to the pre-oedipal.|$|E
25|$|In Jankovits' iconostasis, {{the three}} {{different}} styles are harmoniously combined. The wooden carvings do not drive the <b>focus</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the icons, {{even though the}} ornaments are really characteristic and determining. Greek Catholic iconostases in the Carpathian Basin usually {{have two or three}} tiers. The icon screen in Hajdúdorog has five tiers in accordance with Orthodox traditions.

25|$|Dion's wife Janine Krieber {{also drew}} some {{controversy}} in the 2008 campaign. She complained {{that she was being}} muzzled by the Liberals, though party officials denied it. Reportedly, insiders had concerns that the outspoken Krieber would not stick to the party line and take the <b>focus</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Dion. Krieber also refused at last minute to introduce Dion at a women's event because she felt that the brief speech prepared for her by campaign headquarters was undignified.|$|E
50|$|However, Sunderland {{suffers from}} serious {{deprivation}} {{as well as}} average wages that are lower {{than the rest of}} the UK. Because of its history, the city displays a development pattern which does not focus on a single centre. With the A19 and A1 becoming the main arterial connections, more recent development has been <b>focused</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the urban centres. The resultant pattern of development is now dispersed. Sunderland needs to focus on its core as an important driver of the economy.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, {{the various}} civil defense {{agencies}} were {{replaced with the}} Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 1979. In 2002 this {{became part of the}} Department of Homeland Security. The focus was shifted from nuclear war to an [...] "all-hazards" [...] approach of Comprehensive Emergency Management.

25|$|Returning to Romania {{upon the}} close of World War II, Roller carried out {{communist}} assignments {{in the field of}} culture. Under Răutu, he helped draft the official history textbook, monopolizing the historical narrative for over a decade. Turning the <b>focus</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> nationality and on class struggle, Roller's work sought to reeducate the traditionalist public, and depicted Romania as strongly linked to Slavic Europe. In advancing such theses, Roller censored out historical events, and, in one instance, recounted events that never took place in real life.|$|E

The two Kuwaitis killed {{during the course of}} the hijacking were buried at a ceremony attended by over 2,000 people. On April 25, Time Magazine reported that many Middle East leaders had condemned the hijacking because it had shifted <b>focus</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Palestinian uprising against Israel that had commenced a few months earlier. It also frustrated already tense relations between Iran and the PLO. The Kuwait government believed the hijacking to be the work of Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian Shi'ite group based in Lebanon.|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the {{relationship}} between social science theory, methodology and design through a comparison of two increasingly popular paradigms. We investigate how social practice theory and phenomenological anthropology frame approaches to social research and co-design. Through the example of design research related to showering, we compare applications of sociological theory with a visual-sensory anthropological ethnography approach. We propose that <b>focusing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the practice of showering towards the elements of the everyday from which uses of showering are emergent and contingent offers a closer understanding of where to situate co-design interventions...|$|R
40|$|The {{cognitive}} processes {{at work in}} masked priming experiments are usually considered automatic and independent of attention. We provide evidence against this view. Three behavioral experiments demonstrate that the occurrence of unconscious priming in a numbercomparison task {{is determined by the}} allocation of temporal attention to the time window during which the prime-target pair is presented. Both response-congruity priming and physical repetition priming vanish when temporal attention is <b>focused</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> this time window. These findings are inconsistent with the concept of a purely automatic spreading of activation during masked priming...|$|R

25|$|In 1930, {{the firm}} ousted Catchings, and Sidney Weinberg assumed {{the role of}} senior partner and shifted Goldman's <b>focus</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> trading and toward {{investment}} banking. It was Weinberg's actions that helped to restore some of Goldman's tarnished reputation. On the back of Weinberg, Goldman was lead advisor on the Ford Motor Company's IPO in 1956, which at the time was a major coup on Wall Street. Under Weinberg's reign the firm also started an investment research division and a municipal bond department. It also was at this time that the firm became an early innovator in risk arbitrage.|$|E
25|$|When McKenzie Bay first {{acquired}} the mine, they estimated with their equipment improvements {{that they could}} recover 3.5 cpht from the ore. They also estimated {{that each of the}} two pipes being mined had about 340,000 carats worth of gems and could be profitably mined for about 10 years. The previous owners had a marketing agreement with local Denver diamond dealers to sell them Kelsey Lake diamonds for $115 per carat. If production had risen to the expected levels of 60,000 carats per year, McKenzie Bay expected to make $6.9 million annually. However with the rising prices of vanadium McKenzie Bay shifted their <b>focus</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Kelsey Lake and began mine reclamation procedures in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|Why weapon focus occurs {{has been}} {{described}} a couple different ways. The first is the [...] "automatic capture" [...] explanation. This suggests that the attention paid to a weapon is automatic and unintentional. Studies have been performed that show that even if a subject is asked to ignore specific stimuli {{they are unable to}} thus eliciting an automatic response. [...] However, other research shows that attention focus is not automatic and can be directed on command, especially if attention is already focused somewhere specific. If attention is already <b>focused</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a certain stimulus, then automatic capture is avoidable.|$|R

25|$|While the 2/7th Independent Company {{had been}} {{involved}} in the campaign in New Guinea, there had been a significant re-organisation {{of the way in which}} the Independent Companies were administered and organised. This was due to an army-wide reorganisation as the Australian Army shifted its strategic <b>focus</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Middle East and began to concentrate on the Pacific. As a result of this reorganisation, the 2/7th Independent Company was renamed the 2/7th Cavalry Commando Squadron (later just commando squadron) and was absorbed into the 2/6th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment, along with the newly formed 2/9th and 2/10th Commando Squadrons. Together, these units were attached to the 6th Division, to conduct long range patrol and reconnaissance operations.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, Paarl was for all {{practical}} purposes the heart of the South African wine industry. It was the home of the KWV as well as the annual Nederburg Wine Auction where the reputation of a vintage or an estate could be established. Gradually, the focus shifted southwards to Stellenbosch where Stellenbosch University gained a more prominent role in the South African wine industry with its viticulture and winemaking programmes. The transfer of power from the KWV to a private business further shifted the <b>focus</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Paarl. However, the terroir driven wines of its wards, the Franschhoek Valley and Wellington, have revitalised interest in the area in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad's {{migration}} to Medina shifted the <b>focus</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Mecca. This focus moved still more when Ali, the fourth caliph, took power choosing Kufa as his capital. The Umayyad Caliphate moved {{the capital to}} Damascus in Syria and the Abbasid Caliphate to Baghdad, in modern-day Iraq, which remained {{the center of the}} Islamic Empire for nearly 500 years. Mecca re-entered Islamic political history during the Second Islamic Civil War, when it was held by Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, an early Muslim who opposed the Umayyad caliphs. The city was twice besieged by the Umayyads, in 683 and 692. For some time thereafter the city figured little in politics, remaining a city of devotion and scholarship governed by the Hashemite Sharifs.|$|E
40|$|In this Response to the {{preceding}} article by Joe Sims and Cynthia Bauerly, A. Michael Froomkin defends his earlier critique of ICANN.

5000|$|Threats to the refuser's {{negative}} face vary {{along the}} ability and <b>focus</b> dimensions. <b>Focusing</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the requester allows the refuser to maintain their autonomy while maintaining the relationship; this leads to less face-threat if the refuser has high ability because they can choose whether to comply or not. [...] Focusing on the requester would threaten {{their relationship with the}} requester and their long-term autonomy (the requester may be unwilling to comply to future requests when the roles are reversed); however, if the refuser has low ability, focusing on the requester can actually decrease threats to negative face by showing they are unable to comply even if they wanted to.|$|R
