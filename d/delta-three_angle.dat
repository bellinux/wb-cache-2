40|$|This report {{surveys the}} {{analysis}} and tests performed at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, on a horizontal-axis, two-laded wind turbine with teeter hub. The introduction is a brief account of results obtained during the 5 -year period ending December 1985. The wind tunnel model and the test turbine (7. 6 m [25 ft. ] in diameter) at Washington University`s Tyson Research Center had a 67 {degree} <b>delta-three</b> <b>angle</b> of the teeter axis. The introduction explains why this configuration was selected and named the passive cycle pitch (PCP) wind turbine. Through the analysis {{was not limited to}} the PCP rotor, all tests, including those done from 1986 to 1994, wee conducted with the same teetered wind rotor. The blades are rather stiff and have only a small elastic coning angle and no precone...|$|E
40|$|In {{support of}} a program to advance wood {{composite}} wind turbine blade technology, a design was completed for a prototype, 90 -foot diameter, two-bladed, one-piece rotor, with all wood/epoxy composite structure. The rotor was sized for compatibility with a generator having a maximum power rating of 4000 kilowatts. Innovative features of the rotor include: a teetering hub to minimize the effects of gust loads, untwisted blades to promote rotor power control through stall, joining of blades to the hub structure via an adhesive bonded structural joint, and a blade structural design which was simplified relative to earlier efforts. The prototype rotor was designed to allow flexibility for configuring the rotor upwind or downwind of the tower, for evaluating various types of teeter dampers and/or elastomeric stops, and with variable <b>delta-three</b> <b>angle</b> settings of the teeter shaft axis. The prototype rotor was also designed with provisions for installing pressure tap and angle of attack instrumentation in one blade. A production version rotor cost analysis was conducted. Included in the program were efforts directed at developing advanced load take-off stud designs for subsequent evaluation testing by NASA, development of aerodynamic tip brake concepts, exploratory testing of a wood/epoxy/graphite concept, and compression testing of wood/epoxy laminate, with scarf-jointed plies...|$|E
40|$|Summary. A siinple {{method of}} calculating {{downwash}} interference is presented and comparison of theoretical and flight test trim curves {{indicates that the}} method is reasonably accurate. Since {{the stability of the}} tandem-rotor helicopter depends largely on small differences between the thrusts of the front and rear rotors it is necessary to calculate the rotor thrust derivatives far more accurately than for the single-rotor helicopter. More accurate expressions than those given in Ref. 8 have therefore been calculated. The downwash interference causes a reversal of stick position with speed for part of the speed range with an associated divergence in the dynamic stability. This may be eliminated by choosing a suitable value of swash-plate dihedral angle. If, in addition, a suitable differential <b>delta-three</b> hinge <b>angle</b> is applied the tandemrotor helicopter appears to be stable over the whole speed range except at hovering and very low speeds. If the swash-plate dihedral is too small the normal acceleration curve, following a step input of control, flattens out and then increases again. Thus the tandem-rotor helicopter may satisfy the N. A. C. A. manoeuvrability criterion yet possess unsatisfactory response characteristics. It is suggested that the N. A. C. A. criterion is Unnecessary if stability of the short and long period modes is ensured. Again, a proper choice of swash-plate dihedral and differential delta-three hinge enables satisfactory control response characteristics to be obtained. 1. Introduction. Th...|$|R
