40|$|Esta dissertação propôs {{investigar}} e elaborar instrumentos e estratégias para tornar as ações de Educação Ambiental (EA) mais efetivas nas escolas de 6 º ao 9 º anos da Rede Municipal de Ensino (RME), a partir das atividades oferecidas nos espaços municipais de EA da cidade de Curitiba. Entende-se a EA como parte integrante do processo educativo, a qual permite que alunos e professores partilhem saberes, conhecimentos, valores, os quais podem transformar-se em atitudes, habilidades e comportamentos necessários para a tomada de decisão responsável nas interações com o meio ambiente. Primeiramente, para o desenvolvimento do estudo proposto, foram selecionadas informações, nos documentos oficiais, sobre a estrutura e o funcionamento das secretarias municipais do Meio Ambiente e da Educação. De posse destes dados e com o apoio da revisão bibliográfica, foi possível traçar um panorama dos objetivos, das características, das regularidades, das localizações e das atividades educativas, interativas e culturais de EA. Em seguida, foram agendadas visitas técnicas com os responsáveis dos quatros espaços existentes no município: Museu Botânico (Jardim Botânico); Museu de História Natural Capão da <b>Imbuia</b> (Bairro do Capão da Imbuia); Zoológico (Parque Iguaçu); e Centro de Educação Ambiental da Secretaria Municipal de Meio Ambiente (CEA da SMMA). Além disso, estabeleceu-se contato com os funcionários que dirigem as atividades de EA nas secretarias municipais. Finalmente, foram aplicados questionários com os professores e pedagogos das onze escolas do 6 º ao 9 º anos da RME. Este instrumento de pesquisa foi elaborado para obter informações sobre as ações de EA neste segmento, a regularidade, a intensidade, as relações com as disciplinas, a freqüência em cursos, os espaços municipais de EA e as práticas ambientais nas escolas. Os resultados da pesquisa apontaram que, apesar da oferta de atividades, conforme registros oficiais, nenhuma escola do 6 º ao 9 º anos esteve nos espaços municipais de EA nos anos de 2010 e 2011. Porém, alguns professores deste segmento da RME, respondentes do questionário, afirmaram terem visitado os espaços municipais de EA sem relatar práticas referentes às atividades que ali acontecem. Concluiu-se que são poucos os instrumentos de diálogo entre secretarias, escolas e responsáveis pela EA. Quanto à formação dos professores nas áreas de educação e ambiente, há muitos cursos ofertados pela SME para as questões didático-pedagógicas que envolvem conteúdos de Língua Portuguesa e Matemática e poucos para os temas transversais, principalmente no que diz respeito ao meio ambiente. Diante disto, idealizou-se uma ficha de apoio que pudesse auxiliar os professores e estimular os alunos a conhecer as potencialidades educativas e interativas dos espaços municipais de EA. A ficha foi aplicada com professores da RME que afirmaram que a mesma coopera para elaboração de atividades e melhor compreensão dos espaços municipais de EA. This dissertation {{proposed to}} investigate and develop tools and strategies to make the actions of environmental education (EE) more effective in schools that works with children in the 6 th to 9 th grades (11 - 14 years old) of the Municipal Education Net (RME). The activities offered in the EE municipal spaces of Curitiba were the research goal. EE is understood {{as part of the}} educational process, which allows students and teachers to share knowledge, skills, values that can turn on into attitudes, skills and behaviors necessary for responsible decision-making interactions with the environment. The first step was to develop a proposed study to selected information in the official documents to trace a panorama of the structure and operation of municipal departments of Environment and Education. Second, with these data and supported by the literature review, it was possible to draw a picture of the goals, features, regularities, and locations of educational, cultural and interactive EE. Then, technical visits were scheduled with officials staff from the four spaces in the city: the Botanical Museum (Memorial); Natural History Museum of Capão da <b>Imbuia</b> (situated at Capão da <b>Imbuia</b> county area) Zoo (Iguaçu Park), and Environmental Education Center Municipal Secretary of Environment (CEA of SMMA). In addition, we established contact with employees who direct the activities of EA in the municipal bureau. Finally, enquiry was done with teachers from the eleven schools of 6 th to 9 th grades of RME. This survey instrument was designed to obtain information about EE's actions in those degrees, the frequency, intensity, relations with subjects, attendance at courses, municipal EE spaces and environmental practices in schools. The results indicated that, despite the offer of these type of activities, the official records registered no visits of the schools from 6 th to 9 th grades in the municipal areas of EE in the years 2010 and 2011. However, some teachers of the RME, the survey respondents, said that they had visited the municipal areas of EE even though without reporting practices related to the activities that take place there. The conclusion was that the instruments are still insufficient to establish a dialogue between schools and municipal EE spaces. In the side of SME, it was observed that there are few teachers‟s training courses in the areas of education and environment. Most of the short courses offered by the SME treats about the didactic and pedagogical issues (literacy, math education), and few of them works with the cross-cutting themes (ethics, environment and sexuality). In the side of the municipal EE spaces, it lacks contacts. Given this, it was idealized a form to support teachers and students {{to learn more about the}} public spaces of environmental educational and to stimulate interaction and dialog between these two important municipal institutions. The form was filled out with the RME teachers who said the same cooperation for development activities and better understanding of municipal spaces EA...|$|E
40|$|The Paraná State has {{suffered}} {{a high rate of}} deforestation in the last century, little remaining of the dense and mixed ombrophyllous forests, formerly widely distributed in the State (MAACK 1981). The two main forest remnants occur today in the extreme southwest (Iguaçu National Park) and east (Área de Especial Interesse Turístico do Marumbi – AEIT Marumbi, with 66, 700 ha, located near the comprehensive Environmen-tal Protection Area of Guaraqueçaba with 346, 000 ha; PARANÁ 1986) of the State, and are covered mainly by semideciduous seasonal and dense forests, respectively (IBGE 1992). However, little is still known about mammals occurring in these two large protected remnants. A one-year study conducted in the AEIT Marumbi aimed at researching the diet of didelphid mar-supials, but generated data on the occurrence of other mam-mals in the region. The study area is located at the east edge of the SANEPAR’s dam, at coordinates 25 º 28 ’S and 48 º 50 ’W and 1, 000 m a. s. l., in the Piraquara municipality, Paraná, commonly known as “Mananciais da Serra ” (Rio Iguaçu basin). This area is in the western slope of the Serra do Mar mountains. The area is cov-ered with submontane dense ombrophyllous forest (20 to 25 m of canopy height) but also comprising of mixed ombrophyllous forest species (V. A. O. DITTRICH, personal com-munication) due to the proximity of this biome at the western plateau (round 900 m a. s. l.). The study was carried out from October 1997 to Septem-ber 1998 in a 2. 2 ha-grid area for small mammals, where 40 traps (baited with banana and codfish liver oil) were set for four consecutive nights, once a month. Large and median mammal tracks, besides direct observations, were searched in the vicinities of the grid area during the overall study period. Species names follow FONSECA et al. (1996). Voucher small mammal specimens were deposited in the Museu de História Natural Capão da <b>Imbuia</b> at Curitiba (most specimens) and in the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro (Oryzomys ratticep...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The family Accipitridae (hawks, eagles and Old World vultures) {{represents}} a large radiation of predatory birds {{with an almost}} global distribution, although most species of this family occur in the Neotropics. Despite great morphological and ecological diversity, the evolutionary relationships in the family have been poorly explored at all taxonomic levels. Using sequences from four mitochondrial genes (12 S, ATP 8, ATP 6, and ND 6), we reconstructed the phylogeny of the Neotropical forest hawk genus Leucopternis {{and most of the}} allied genera of Neotropical buteonines. Our goals were to infer the evolutionary relationships among species of Leucopternis, estimate their relationships to other buteonine genera, evaluate the phylogenetic significance of the white and black plumage patterns common to most Leucopternis species, and assess general patterns of diversification of the group with respect to species' affiliations with Neotropical regions and habitats. Results Our molecular phylogeny for the genus Leucopternis and its allies disagrees sharply with traditional taxonomic arrangements for the group, and we present new hypotheses of relationships for a number of species. The mtDNA phylogenetic trees derived from analysis of the combined data posit a polyphyletic relationship among species of Leucopternis, Buteogallus and Buteo. Three highly supported clades containing Leucopternis species were recovered in our phylogenetic reconstructions. The first clade consisted of the sister pairs L. lacernulatus and Buteogallus meridionalis, and Buteogallus urubitinga and Harpyhaliaetus coronatus, in addition to L. schistaceus and L. plumbeus. The second clade included the sister pair Leucopternis albicollis and L. occidentalis as well as L. polionotus. The third lineage comprised the sister pair L. melanops and L. kuhli, in addition to L. semiplumbeus and Buteo buteo. According to our results, the white and black plumage patterns have evolved at least twice in the group. Furthermore, species found to the east and west of the Andes (cis-Andean and trans-Andean, respectively) are not reciprocally monophyletic, nor are forest and non-forest species. Conclusion The polyphyly of Leucopternis, Buteogallus and Buteo establishes a lack of concordance of current Accipitridae taxonomy with the mtDNA phylogeny for the group, and points to the need for further phylogenetic analysis at all taxonomic levels in the family as also suggested by other recent analyses. Habitat shifts, as well as cis- and trans-Andean disjunctions, took place more than once during buteonine diversification in the Neotropical region. Overemphasis of the black and white plumage patterns has led to questionable conclusions regarding the relationships of Leucopternis species, and suggests more generally that plumage characters should be used with considerable caution in the taxonomic evaluation of the Accipitridae.

No entanto, isto só é possível se não houver diferenças signifi cativas entre os teores de carbono destas espécies. Neste contexto, o presente trabalho visa analisar estatisticamente os teores de carbono de seis espécies nativas da Floresta Ombrófila Mista, na região sul do estado do Paraná.

(erva-mate) para verifi car se existe variação estatisticamente significativa entre espécies, entre as mesmas partes (casca, fuste, folhagem, galho vivo, galho morto e miscelânea) de diferentes espécies e entre diferentes partes da mesma espécie. Os resultados revelam que a folhagem de Styrax leprosus foi a única que se diferenciou das demais, pois possui um baixo teor de carbono. Em todas as outras partes não houve diferenças em função da espécie. A análise entre partes da mesma espécie, revelou que existem padrões diferentes para cada espécie, mas que a porção folhagem sempre concentra os maiores teores de carbono. Desconsiderando a separação em diferentes partes, não houve diferença estatística entre os teores de carbono quando comparados os valores médios de cada espécie. Abstract The {{carbon stock}} {{of a forest}} is {{generally}} estimated by the application of mathematical equations that use carbon contents for a specifi c group of species. However, this is only possible if there are not signifi cant differences among the carbon contents of these species. In view of this, the present work intends to evaluate statistically the carbon contents of the following six native species of Araucaria Forest, from Southern Paraná State, Brazil, Myrsine ferruginea (Ruiz & Pav.)

The results reveal that the foliage of Stryrax leprosus {{is the only one that}} differentiates from the others, as it presents low carbon content. As for all the other parts, there are no differences in terms of species. The analysis among the parts of the same species revealed that there are different patterns for each species; however the portion foliage always concentrates the highest carbon content. Disregarding the division between parts, there was no statistical difference among the carbon contents when compared to the medium values of each species...|$|E
