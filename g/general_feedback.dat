Conversely, it is shown that the existence of such stabilizers in turn implies the existence of smooth control Lyapunov functions.

5000|$|Dr. Middlebrook was {{a leading}} proponent of [...] "Design-Oriented Analysis" [...] (D-OA) of {{electrical}} circuits, which is a circuit analysis technique that seeks to develop circuit equations that are simple yet physically insightful. He developed many of the tools of D-OA including the Extra element theorem and the <b>General</b> <b>Feedback</b> Theorem. [...] His goal with D-OA was to fundamentally change the way electrical engineering is taught in order to focus on practical design rather than circuit analysis. Middlebrook advocated keeping circuit analysis and equations as simple as possible, only adding additional complexity when experiments show it to be necessary. Many engineers who have studied D-OA after a traditional electrical engineering education have asked why circuit analysis is not taught in school using Middlebrook's methods.

50|$|According to Maxl, four {{different}} kinds of methods are distinguished {{which can be used}} as required. These are listed in the following figure.Push studies without contexts (A) are conducted independently from time and location. This can be CATI- or CACI-studies as well as surveys by SMS or MMS. In cases of these research methods, the feedback impulse actively comes from the researcher.With contextual push studies (B) the researcher prompts the respondent to give appropriate feedback once it is recognized that he/she is located in a particular environment or is in a certain situation.Pull studies are characterized that participants call in the questionnaire themselves. In many cases short notes draw attention to a survey or an evaluation. Such communications may be placed in certain contexts (C) (e.g. on receipts, advertisements or product packaging) in order to encourage participation. Non-context-sensitive pull studies (D) are not relevant for marketing research since they provide only <b>general</b> <b>feedback,</b> which has no relation to a fixed object of research.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess a {{modified}} version of the trans-contextual model (Hagger, Chatzisarantis, Culverhouse, & Biddle, 2003) based on self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) and the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1985). The modified version included two additional components: use of learning strategies and positive <b>general</b> <b>feedback.</b> It was hypothesized that students' perceptions of how they use learning strategies taught by their physical education (PE) teachers and perceived positive <b>general</b> <b>feedback</b> would influence students' intrinsic motivation, intentions, and physical activity behaviour in a leisure-time context through intrinsic motivation in PE. A structural equation model supported the hypotheses and demonstrated that the use of learning strategies and perceived positive <b>general</b> <b>feedback</b> in PE indirectly influenced intrinsic motivation in leisure time through the effect of intrinsic motivation in PE.

The first result provided in the paper is a sufficient condition for finite-time state feedback disturbance rejection {{in the presence of}} constant disturbances. This condition requires the solution of an LMI. Then {{we consider the}} more <b>general</b> output <b>feedback</b> case, which is shown to be reducible to the solution of an optimization problem involving Bilinear Matrix Inequalities.

We build a class of time-varying feedback laws for which the solutions of the closed-loop systems with small initial data decay exponentially to 0. We present also results on the well-posedness of the closed-loop systems for <b>general</b> time-varying <b>feedback</b> laws. Comment: 34 page...|$|R
