50|$|The book {{is uniquely}} {{written in the}} style of a novel with <b>full</b> <b>character</b> {{development}} and dialogues. Simone is currently developing a similar project with reformed criminal and criminal authority Pavle Stanimirović.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the baudot and braille {{keyboards}} were standardized to some extent, {{but they}} are unable to replicate the <b>full</b> <b>character</b> set of a modern keyboard. Braille comes closest, as it has been extended to eight bits.|$|R
5000|$|Curious Pastimes classes {{itself as}} a [...] "family-friendly" [...] event, {{allowing}} parents to bring along children of any age. All children are entitled to <b>full</b> <b>characters,</b> though only those 16 or over are allowed {{to participate in the}} mass battles.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, the MICR fonts {{became a}} symbol of modernity or futurism, leading to the {{creation}} of lookalike [...] "computer" [...] typefaces that imitated the appearance of the MICR fonts, which unlike real MICR fonts, had a <b>full</b> <b>character</b> set.|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} 槑 (U+69D1), {{which sounds}} like the word for [...] "plum" [...] (梅 (U+FA44)), is used to represent double of 呆 (dull), or further magnitude of dullness. In Chinese, normally <b>full</b> <b>characters</b> (as opposed to the stylistic use of 槑) may be duplicated to express emphasis.|$|R
5000|$|The {{nickname}} stuck, and the gag {{was later}} extended into a now-defunct website, www.andypolley.com, which featured photos and comments about Pollin often related to current Kornheiser radio shows. Polley {{evolved into a}} <b>full</b> <b>character,</b> who drives a beat-up old Honda, with orange juice on the leather seats.|$|R
50|$|A <b>full</b> <b>character</b> {{set of the}} Motorway {{typeface}} {{was completed}} by the K-Type foundry in 2015, almost sixty years after its inception. The family includes the Bold (Temporary) weight, the SemiBold (Permanent) weight, and a previously unconsidered Regular (book) weight. There are also true italics for each weight.|$|R
50|$|In each episode, {{there are}} two rounds. The first {{requires}} the contestants {{to make a small}} test piece, and one is eliminated and one receives a bonus for the second round, where they create their <b>full</b> <b>characters,</b> and a contestant is selected as the winner of the episode.|$|R
50|$|In Austria, four provinces {{are allowed}} to label local apricot spirits as Barack Palinka (transliteration of Hungarian barackpálinka): Burgenland, Lower Austria, Styria, and Vienna. Unlike Hungarian pálinka, its Austrian {{counterpart}} may not be made with column stills, {{and in order to}} achieve a <b>full</b> <b>character,</b> careful slow distillation is required by law.|$|R
50|$|Acid malt, {{also known}} as acidulated malt, whose grains contain lactic acid, {{can be used as}} a {{continental}} analog to Burtonization. Acid malt lowers the mash pH and provides a rounder, <b>fuller</b> <b>character</b> to the beer, enhancing the flavor of Pilseners and other light lagers. Lowering the pH also helps prevent beer spoilage through oxidation.|$|R
25|$|Another popular {{teaching}} method is the Koch method, named after German psychologist Ludwig Koch, which uses the full target speed {{from the outset}} but begins with just two characters. Once strings containing those two characters can be copied with 90% accuracy, an additional character is added, and so on until the <b>full</b> <b>character</b> set is mastered.|$|R

40|$|Perfect {{phylogeny}} {{consisting of}} determining the compatibility {{of a set of}} characters is known to be NP-complete [5, 30].

50|$|It uses {{a tension}} gauge, which fills {{up when the}} {{character}} gets hit or takes damage. When it is <b>full,</b> <b>characters</b> become stronger, and can input certain commands to activate special-moves called Chaos Attacks. The game has a feature called Chaos Mode that is activated when a character's health is at the half-way point (yellow bar). A red aura will surround the character and he/she is able to perform unlimited Chaos Attacks.|$|R

Once we deliver a <b>fuller</b> <b>character</b> for Cindy, then the question of Holly would come into play". This indicated that there were no current plans to re-introduce Holly into the series.|$|R
5000|$|Technically, {{this mode}} {{is not a}} {{graphics}} mode, but a tweak of the 80&times;25 text mode. The character cell height register is changed to display only two lines per character cell instead of the normal eight lines. This quadruples the number of text rows displayed from 25 to 100. These [...] "tightly squeezed" [...] text <b>characters</b> are not <b>full</b> <b>characters.</b> The system only displays their top two lines of pixels (eight each) {{before moving on to}} the next row.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{character}} attempts {{to use the}} skill during play, the GM looks up the Base Chance, to which are added the <b>Character's</b> <b>rating</b> in the Skill's governing Characteristic plus the square of his Skill level.

The late Bob Bemer {{wrote that}} while working for IBM he lobbied unsuccessfully to expand the typing element to 64 {{characters}} from 44. The Selectric actually provided 44 characters per case, but the point remains that with 88 printable characters it could not quite produce the <b>full</b> printable ASCII <b>character</b> set.|$|R
