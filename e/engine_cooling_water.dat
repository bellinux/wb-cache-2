50|$|When {{considering}} {{engine efficiency}} one should consider {{whether this is}} based on the lower heating value (LCV) or higher heating value (HCV) of the gas. Engine manufacturers will typically quote efficiencies based on the lower heating value of the gas, i.e. the efficiency after energy has been taken to evaporate the intrinsic moisture within the gas itself. Gas distribution networks will typically charge based upon the higher heating value of the gas (i.e. total energy content). A quoted engine efficiency based on LCV might be say 44% whereas the same engine might have an HCV of 39.6% based on HCV on natural gas.It is also important to ensure that efficiency comparisons are on a like for like basis. for example some manufactures have mechanically driven pumps whereas other use electrically driven pumps to drive <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water,</b> and the electrical usage can sometimes be ignored giving a falsely high apparent efficiency compared to the direct drive engines.|$|E
50|$|Powered {{cars had}} two cabs that were {{originally}} {{open to the}} interior, driving trailers had only one. The folding doors could be closed remotely and had warning bells and lights. The six-cylinder engines of type 6 KVD 18 SIHRW, built by Elbewerk Roßlau and nearly identical to those used in the shunting locomotives of DR Class V 15, were mounted beneath the floor. The last, Görlitz-built series was equipped with the new version 6KVD 18/15-1 HRW of this engine, specially modified {{for use in the}} railcars. The power was transmitted over a hydraulic drive, followed by an electro-mechanical gearbox to one axle. A pneumatically operated axle-mounted reverse gearbox allowed directional control. The electrical systems of the powered car were supplied by a 24 V / 1.2 kW alternator, those of the trailers by generators which were driven from the axle by a belt. The latter proved insufficient so that the powered cars were later equipped with two alternators working in parallel. Thermostat-controlled heating was provided by oil-fired radiators, in the powered cars also by the <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

50|$|Most {{aviation}} {{piston engines}} are air-cooled. Air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> are lighter than their major alternative - <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>engines,</b> because the lower weight of air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> in aircraft design being {{a more important}} factor than the lower drag of <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>engines.</b> While <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> were widely used {{from the early days}} of flight, air <b>cooled</b> <b>engines</b> were the dominant choice in aircraft.

Thus today, piston engines are mostly used in slower general aviation aircraft where low weight is an advantage. Therefore, most aero engines produced today are of the air cooled variety.

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines (ICEs) {{are widely used}} as independent power producers due to their high electrical efficiency (up to 47 %), which can be further enhanced by operating them in combined cycle mode with a water/steam cycle as bottoming cycle. This study presents an integrated approach to optimize the combined cycle overall system efficiency. Therefore, not only the most favorable design of the waste heat recovery (WHR) cycle, but also the optimal configuration of the ICE cooling system have to be investigated, in order to integrate both available engine waste heat sources (exhaust gas, 300 - 400 °C, <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water,</b> 90 °C) into the waste heat recovery cycle. For {{the definition of the}} most favourable temperature level of the <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> three variants of engine cooling systems are examined, with respect to technical limitations given by the ICE. In order to determine the types of engines for which this optimization approach is suitable, three types of engines with different characteristics (fuel, exhaust gas parameters) combined with a water/steam cycle are simulated, by using the calculation tools Excel and Ebsilon Professional. An energetic, exergetic and economic analysis is conducted. These reveal the impacts of the temperature level to the WHR system and to the design of the engine cooling system. The calculations performed, showed that up to 19 % of the <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> heat can be efficiently recovered compared to a portion of 6 % in the standard system. The better recovery leads to a 5 %-decrease in the costs of electricity generation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Changing {{the blade}} outlet width is an {{important}} method to adjust the performance curves of centrifugal pumps. In this study, three impellers with different blade outlet widths in an <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> pump (ECWP) were numerically simulated based on ANSYS-CFX software.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} a kinematic Stirling engine, which is the core part of a micro-CHP system. A micro-CHP system is a small scale system for concurrently generating heat and electricity {{on the level of}} one household. Micro-CHP can be based on several technologies, one of which is a Stirling engine. In case of a Stirling engine, the <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> provides the heat required and the piston motions provide the energy to drive the generator, which generates electricity. Most Stirling engines found in literature consider free-piston Stirling engines, whereas in this work a kinematic engine is studied. Kinematic Stirling Engines have a crank arrangement to convert the reciprocal piston motion to a rotational output. Free piston Stirling Engines on the other hand do not have rotating parts. The Whispergen Stirling engine studied here uses a so-called wobble yoke to convert linear motion of the pistons to rotational motion. The presence of the wobble yoke strongly affects engine modeling. In this work two modeling approaches are discussed. The result is a useful model, which {{can be used as a}} starting point for control design. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the calculation results of {{efficiency of the}} subcritical low temperature ORC power station powered by waste heat resulting from the process of cooling a stationary compression ignition engine. The source of heat to supply the ORC power station is the heat in a form of water jet cooling the engine at a temperature of 92 °C, and the exhaust gas stream at a temperature of 420 °C.
