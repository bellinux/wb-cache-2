500|$|During {{his brief}} second term as mayor in 1912, Armstrong and council {{approved}} {{a plan to}} construct 110 miles of electric railway lines in the city, considered legislation permitting band concerts on Sundays, oversaw {{the opening of the}} Royal Alexandra Hospital, advocated for the availability of housing accommodations for all Edmontonians {{in the face of an}} influx of new settlers, and welcomed a visit from Governor General of Canada Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn to the city, planning a grand celebration. It was also in 1912 that the Hudson's Bay Company put its Edmonton land holdings on the market, the first bridge across the North Saskatchewan River in the city's east end opened, and that Armstrong commissioned a master plan for the newly amalgamated city, from an American firm based out of Minneapolis named Morell and Nichols. Among the suggestions in the report was the recommendation for a civic square to be built, which was opened 53 years later as Sir Winston Churchill Square. In his final week as mayor, the retiring Armstrong delivered the city's annual report at an annual meeting, thanked the people of Edmonton for entrusting him as mayor, and advised his successor to be fiscally responsible; stating, [...] "If a reckless administration gets <b>in</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> Edmonton will become a city like I was in recently, where they could not borrow enough money to clean their streets." [...] In the election held later that week, he would be succeeded by former mayor from 1901–04, William Short, whom he supported and campaigned for. Armstrong was later honoured with an informal gathering in the city council chamber where he was presented with a gift of silverware; with the city fire chief proclaiming that [...] "Mayor Armstrong is bound to become a historical character".|$|E
