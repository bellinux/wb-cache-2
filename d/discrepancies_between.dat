40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} the <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> mothers and children about their acknowledgments for the condition of family life and mutual expectation. This condition of family life, especially home education or discipline to a child {{is one of the}} most important factors for socializing a child. There are many papers about the personality formation of a child in connection with parents' attitudes to a child, and in those papers, parents' attitudes are generally emphasized. As a matter of course, personality formation of a child is not one way process from parents to a child but reciprocical one. As a child accepts parents' expectation and takes role expectation assigned to a child, so parents modify their attitudes to a child by one's reaction. Parents-child relation is a mutual process. If this judgment is admitted, the better parents-child relation is, the less the <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> parents and child becomes. In order to establish better parents-child relation, they must make an effort to lessen the <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> them. Our chief object is to find the degree and direction of the <b>Discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> mother and child. By means of this survey, we found the <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> them in many items, but in this part I, we chiefly deal with attributes of objects and the <b>discrepancy</b> <b>between</b> parents and child about their communication...|$|R

Although his account most probably is built around the facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled with the belief that the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E

Following a reorganisation of the force carried out in 2001, the regionally based units were amalgamated into four units—Zagreb, Split, Rijeka and Osijek. At the same time, the special police was reduced to 300 personnel.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between adapiform and lemuriform primates {{has not been}} clearly demonstrated, so the position of adapiforms as a paraphyletic stem group is questionable. Both molecular clock data and new fossil finds suggest that the lemuriform divergence from the other primates and the subsequent lemur-lorisoid split both predate the appearance of adapiforms in the early Eocene. New calibration methods may reconcile the <b>discrepancies</b> <b>between</b> the molecular clock and the fossil record, favoring more recent divergence dates. The fossil record suggests that the strepsirrhine adapiforms and the haplorhine omomyiforms had been evolving independently before the early Eocene, although their most basal members share enough dental similarities {{to suggest that they}} diverged during the Paleocene (66–55mya).|$|E

5|$|The {{observed}} {{relationship between}} the luminosity of the hydroxyl line and the far infrared suggests that hydroxyl megamasers are radiatively pumped. Initial VLBI measurements of nearby hydroxyl megamasers seemed to present {{a problem with this}} model for compact emission components of hydroxyl megamasers, as they required a very high fraction of infrared photons to be absorbed by hydroxyl and lead to a maser photon being emitted, making collisional excitation a more plausible pumping mechanism. However, a model of maser emission with a clumpy masing medium appear to be able to reproduce the observed properties of compact and diffuse hydroxyl emission. A recent detailed treatment finds that photons with a wavelength of 53 micrometres are the primary pump for main line maser emission, and applies to all hydroxyl masers. In order to provide enough photons at this wavelength, the interstellar dust that reprocesses stellar radiation to infrared wavelengths must have a temperature of at least 45 kelvins. Recent observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope confirm this basic picture, but there are still some <b>discrepancies</b> <b>between</b> details of the model and observations of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies such as the required dust opacity for megamaser emission.|$|E
