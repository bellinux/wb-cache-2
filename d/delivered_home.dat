To test if the same program can be transferred from a clinical setting to an internet <b>delivered</b> <b>home</b> based treatment the authors conducted a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Methods After a diagnostic interview 79 participants were randomized to one of two attention training programs using a probe detection task. In the active condition the participant was trained to direct attention away from threat, whereas in the placebo condition the probe appeared with equal frequency in the position of the threatening and neutral faces. Results Results were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, including all randomized participants. Immediate and 4 -month follow-up results revealed a significant time effect on all measured dimensions (social anxiety scales, general anxiety and depression levels, quality of life). However, there were no time x group interactions. The lack of differences in the two groups was also mirrored by the infinitesimal between group effect size both at post test and at 4 -month follow-up. Conclusion We conclude that computerized attention bias modification may need to be altered before dissemination for the Internet. Trial registration ISRCTN 01715124 </p...|$|E
40|$|Home {{extended}} hours hemodialysis improves some measurable {{biological and}} quality-of-life parameters over conventional renal replacement therapies {{in patients with}} end-stage renal disease. Published small studies evaluating costs have shown savings in terms of ongoing operating costs with this modality. However, all estimates need to include the total costs, including infrastructure, patient training, and maintenance; patient attrition by death, transplantation, technique failure; {{and the necessity of}} in-center dialysis. We describe a comprehensive funding model for a large centrally administered but locally <b>delivered</b> <b>home</b> hemodialysis program in British Columbia, Canada that covered 122 patients, of which 113 were still in the program at study end. The majority of patients performed home nocturnal hemodialysis in this 2 -year retrospective study. All training periods, both in-center and in-home dialysis, medications, hospitalizations, and deaths were captured using our provincial renal database and vital statistics. Comparative data from the provincial database and pricing models were used for costing purposes. The total comprehensive costs per patient—incorporating startup, home, and in-center dialysis; medications; home remodeling; and consumables—was $ 59, 179 for years 2004 – 2005 and $ 48, 648 for 2005 – 2006. The home dialysis patients required multiple in-center dialysis runs, significantly contributing to the overall costs.

40|$|Photic and non-photic {{environmental}} factors are suggested to modulate {{the development of}} circadian rhythms in infants. Our aim is to evaluate the development of biological rhythms (circadian or ultradian) in newborns in transition from Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) to home and along the first 6 months of life, to identify masking and entraining environment factors along development. Ten newborns were evaluated in their last week inside the NICU {{and in the first}} week after being delivered home; 6 babies were also followed until 6 months of corrected age. Activity, recorded with actimeters, wrist temperature and observed sleep and feeding behavior were recorded continuously along their last week inside the NICU and in the first week at home and also until 6 months of corrected age for the subjects who remained in the study. Sleep/wake and activity/rest cycle showed ultradian patterns and the sleep/wake was strongly influenced by the 3  h feeding schedule inside the NICU, while wrist temperature showed a circadian pattern that seemed no to be affected by environmental cycles. A circadian rhythm emerges for sleep/wake behavior in the first week at home, whereas the 3  h period vanishes. Both activity/rest and wrist temperature presented a sudden increase in the contribution of the circadian component immediately after babies were <b>delivered</b> <b>home,</b> also suggesting a masking effect of the NICU environment.

40|$|Drawing on {{end of life}} care as an illustrative case, {{this paper}} {{critically}} examines the provision of care in the home, identifying a number of inherent tensions. For 60 years the hospital has been the preferred site of care. However, the UK caring division of labour is currently undergoing a process of (re) domestication and the provision of home care is increasingly regarded as a ‘gold standard’ for the organisation of care, in institutional and domestic contexts. In this paper we argue that while ‘home care’ policies serve a range of professional and political agendas, they contain unacknowledged contradictions and strains, creating challenges for both family and professional carers. The realities of home care are examined through reconceptualising qualitative data generated from three research projects concerned with dying in the community. We argue that, whilst previous work has highlighted the burdens the redomestication of care places upon carers, home care philosophies and policies have led to over-romanticised notions of care which privilege the value of caring relationships without acknowledging the dynamic interaction of such social relationships with the actual work of caring. Moreover, such policy trends have created a nexus of social expectations and obligations for which modern society is unprepared. With reference to both {{end of life care}}, and home care more widely, we argue that health care planners and professionals need to think more critically about the way care is <b>delivered.</b> <b>Home</b> is not merely about a physical space, but the social and emotional relationships therein. Good ‘home care,’ characterised by attention to patient-centred needs and flexible in design and scope, {{does not have to be}} located within the private sphere; relationships may actually be maintained and nurtured by enabling people to have a realistic choice of care in an institutio...|$|E
40|$|B. A {{thesis on}} the {{readability}} of the Põlva newspaper „Koit” and its reader’s interests. The {{purpose of the}} study is to find answers to the following questions: g) How often do you read the paper? h) Which channels for obtaining the paper do you use? i) Which other papers do you read? j) Which columns are most interesting in this paper? k) Which are the weak sides of the paper? l) How could the paper be improved? In the given work I am making use of the study made by Ülle Harju in her B. A. thesis „The use of media in south-eastern Estonia in 1998 ”. That is to say that I am comparing my own enquiry performed among the readers of „Koit“ in 2007 with the results of an enquiry which „Koit“ organized for its readers in autumn of 1998 and which Ülle Harju used in her B. A. thesis. In order to find out {{about the importance of the}} newspaper „Koit“, for the purpose of this B. A. thesis, short interviews were made with the district governors of Põlva County, namely with Raul Kudre, the district governor of Värska, Aivar Luts, the district governor of Kanepi, and with Andrus Seeme, the district governor of Kõllaste. An interview was also given by Voldemar Salomon, the district secretary of Räpina. Regarding the future of the local paper discussed in this paper the following editors-in-chief of other papers of Põlva County expressed their opinion: Igor Taro, editor-in-chief of the paper „Setomaa“ („Seto County“ – written in the Võru County dialect), Ülle Harju, editor-in-chief of the paper „Uma Leht“ („One’s Own Paper“ – written in the Seto County dialect), Urmas Paidre, editor-in-chief of the paper „LõunaLeht“ („Southern Paper“) and Kalev Annom, editor-in-chief of the paper „Võrumaa Teataja“ („Messenger of Võru County“). In addition an interview was given by the Kauno Kõima, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper „Koit“ (meaning „Dawn“). The enquiry that was performed for the purpose of this B. A. thesis, which deals with the county paper „Koit“, characterises the fact that the sampling was incidental. The sampling was rather spontaneous, in other words the more active readers would respond to the enquiry. A total of 117 people responded, of which 81 were women; 60 of them were living in the country and 21 of them in the city. 34 women were in the age category of 15 - 44 years, 24 were aged 45 - 64 years and 23 women were more than 65 years old. There were 36 men among the respondents, of which 23 were living in the country and 13 in the city. 7 respondents were of the age of 15 - 44 years, there were 16 men who were 45 - 64 years old and 13 of them were more than 65 years old. Next, different groups of “Koit” readers were established: 1) Men and women 2) 15 - 44 years old, 45 - 64 years old, more than 65 years old 3) Those with less than secondary education, those with secondary education and graduates from an establishment for higher education 4) City versus country. The majority of the subscribers of „Koit“ were more than 65 years old (72 %). Among the groups of readers, instead of subscribing the paper, it was preferred to obtain it elsewhere according to the respondents’ gender, level of education and place of living, respectively. Consistent readers of the paper are of the age group of 65 + years (84 %), with less than secondary education and with secondary education (61 %) and with 56 % of them living out in the country. According to gender there were 51 % of men and 55 % of women among the consistent readers. The at random readers of the paper „Koit“ are of the age class of 15 - 44 years with 52 %. The readers aged 45 - 64 may rather be considered as readers at random, who do not regularly read each single number, but who have not lost their interest in the paper and adhere to it selectively. At the same time the number of readers at random in the country as well as in the city is quite high. The paper was considered to be generally interesting by all age groups. It was considered to be uninteresting by no woman and only by 6 % of the men. The paper that was mostly read in addition to „Koit“ was the national daily newspaper „Postimees“ („Postman“). The readers of another national paper „SL Õhtuleht“ („SL Evening Paper“) are mostly women, aged 15 - 44 years, living in the country and people with less than a secondary education or with a secondary education. The readers of the „Maaleht“ („Rural Paper“) are respondents who are more than 65 years old, who live in the city and have less than a secondary education or are with a secondary education. Among the regional papers „Uma Leht“ is one to be read most by all age groups. Little interest was stirred in the readers by the third national paper „Päevaleht“ („Daily Paper“) and the weekly paper „Lõuna Leht“. When comparing the feedback given by all groups of readers regarding the content of „Koit“, one must say that in one aspect all answers are coinciding – this is the interest in local news. Regarding a comparison of the B. A. thesis by Ülle Harju „The use of media in south-eastern Estonia in 1998 ” of 1998 with this thesis the following may be mentioned. First of all the number of respondents was somewhat higher in 1998 (144 people) than in 2007 (117 people). In both enquiries women were the more active respondents; in 2007 there were 69 % of female respondents and 31 % of male ones and in 1998 there were 74 % of women and 26 % of men. In both studies those with less than or with a secondary education were more active readers of „Koit“ than the readers with a higher education. Among the readers of „Koit“ in both cases the other paper, which was mostly read, was the national daily paper „Postimees“. Among the columns the most outstanding one in 1998 was advertisements, which were always read by the readers. In 2007 the mostly read column in all groups was local news. The „Võrumaa Teataja“, which also is published three times a week (on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays), is the largest paper of south-eastern Estonia. The size of the paper is 8 - 16 pages, „Koit“ comprises 8 pages. As compared to „Koit“, a black-and-white edition, „Võrumaa Teataja“ is a colour edition. According to the opinion of Kauno Kõima, the editor-in-chief of „Koit“, this newspaper will stay with a black-and-white printing; colour pages will be produced as many as needed and as few as possible – a traditional paper has to be black-and-white. However according to the data of the poll institute of Emor for the first quarter of 2006 there were only 23 % of constant readers and 77 % of at random readers for „Koit“ in contrast to 9 % of at random readers and 91 % of constant readers for the „Võrumaa Teataja“. Most of the readers of „Koit“ were aged 50 - 76 (60 %) and for „Võrumaa Teataja“ 30 - 49 years (43 %). The readership of „Koit“ is becoming older and little interest is directed towards younger readers; even the study of 1998 showed that there is little interest among the youngsters in the paper „Koit“. Nonetheless, according to the editor-inchief of „Koit“ the paper meets the readers’ expectations, otherwise the paper would have neither subscribers nor retail buyers. According to the data by Emor for the first quarter of 2006 „Koit“ is read more by men (52 %) than by women (48 %). The Emor data also shows that the majority of the readership of „Võrumaa Teataja“ consists of women (72 %) in contrast to only 28 % of men. Among the most preferred ways of obtaining the paper is a subscription with the paper being <b>delivered</b> <b>home</b> both for the readers of „Koit“ and of „Võrumaa Teataja“. According to Kalev Annom, the editor-in-chief of „Võrumaa Teataja“, the number of subscribers has increased. The print-run of the Saturday paper amounts to 6 000 copies with a little less during the week. The print-run of „Koit“ was 5 300 in 1998 with a decrease to 3 500 copies by April of 2008. One way of remaining in areas with a smaller readership would be to lesser publish the paper. A good example is the paper „Hiiu Leht“ („Paper of Hiiu County“), which is published twice a week. Obviously the best way, however, would be to get younger readers involved. Ülle Harju, the editor-in-chief of „Uma Leht“ said in the interview given for the purpose of this B. A. thesis that they are considering the sort of younger reader in the making of their paper. Namely, there is a particular section for children in the paper. There are quite a number of stories made up with youngsters or school kids. According to Harju the „Uma Leht“ is even used in schools for the teaching of the local dialect of Võru County. The paper has a separate page which contains short funny stories, which are also understandable to children. According to Igor Taro, the editor-in-chief of the regional paper „Setomaa“, their paper contains quite a lot of information which is specifically geared towards youngsters. Secondly the author of this B. A. thesis is of the opinion that the question is about the quality of the product and the need for an increase in readership, i. e. about sales activities. Oftentimes small enterprises with limited resources find a solution in the internet business; however, an internet website for the paper cannot be an aim by itself. About the price: The enquiry performed showed that different research groups have considered the price to be too high or rather that the ratio of price and quality is not in balance. If it is not possible to lower the price of the edition, then the paper could still have programs for the constant client, be it for older people or for longterm clients who would receive a considerable discount, e. g. on their annual subscription. The interviews with the district governors showed that „Koit“ as a news medium plays an important role in the districts as well as in the whole county; this refers to the communication of news as well as the introduction of the districts. The district governors were satisfied with the job that „Koit“ is doing in terms of the communication of news and events. At the same time the need for updating the paper was pointed out, in particular that „Koit“ could have a news archive on the web. Will the local paper have a future? Regarding this question all editors-in-chief who were interviewed for this B. A. thesis agreed that there will be a sure future for this local paper. A quotation by Juhan Peegel resonated from the interview with Kalev Annom, the editor-in-chief of „Võrumaa Teataja“ – for as long as a local paper is capable of producing decent local news the local paper will remain. Whether this statement is applicable to the paper „Koit“ with its decreasing print-run and a readership that keeps growing older? Time will show...|$|E
