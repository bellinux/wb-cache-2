To maximize returns, the higher a project's IRR, the more desirable it is to undertake the project.

By the end of 1872, the combined Cleveland plants had two puddling mills; two blast furnaces; two Bessemer converters; a boiler plate mill; two rail and rod mills; a wire mill; and a bolt, nut, and spike manufacturing shop. The Newburgh plants were producing so much pig iron, cast iron, and steel that Cleveland Rolling Mill became one of the principal metalworks in the state.|$|E
25|$|A {{second step}} was the {{privatization}} of the Tbilisi Water Supply Company. In 2006, a credit of 25 million USD had {{been approved by the}} European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to rehabilitate the water and sanitation infrastructure of Tbilisi. But the government refused the loan and instead opted for full privatization. In November 2007 it decided to sell the company to Multiplex Energy Limited, a newly created company whose ownership was not known to the public. The new company was obliged to keep tariffs unchanged {{for the next five years}} and to make substantial improvements, including the rehabilitation of the sewer infrastructure by 2012, 24-hour water supply within the entire service area by 2015 and the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant at Gardabani to replace the dilapidated <b>existing</b> <b>plant</b> by 2018. The private company took over its responsibilities in May 2008. A performance incentive system for employees and a new billing system were introduced, and connections were gradually retrofitted with meters reaching 23% of customers in 2013. According to an independent study, the overall results of water privatization in Tbilisi were positive. While staffing levels did gradually decrease from 1,962 full-time equivalents in 2006 to 1,606 in 2012, training and overall job satisfaction all increased. The average income of employees doubled between 2006 and 2013. This was more than the inflation rate during the same period, but increases were not as high as the average for water and power companies in Georgia. Furthermore, physical water losses and water theft (non-revenue water) decreased slightly (from 42% in 2006 to 38% in 2013) and water supply became continuous within the old administrative borders of Tbilisi in 2013.|$|E
500|$|In 1959, William Stones paid £100,000 (£ in [...] {{adjusted}} for inflation) for Ward & Sons of Swinton, a family-run local bottler {{of beer and}} mineral water. The Ward bottling plant was capable of filling and labelling 8,000 bottles an hour, which was more productive than Stones' <b>existing</b> <b>plant.</b> The acquisition allowed Stones to bottle national beers such as Bass and Guinness for itself, {{rather than relying on}} contractors. Also in that year a reciprocal deal was reached with Whitbread, whereby William Stones supplied draught bitter to the 33 houses of the former Scarsdale Brewing Company of Chesterfield, in return for stocking Whitbread's Mackeson Stout in their own tied estate. In 1960, the company was awarded the rights to bottle the Norwegian Ringnes lager brand for the region. All bottling had transferred to Swinton by 1961, allowing Stones to close its own bottling plant, giving it room to redevelop its Sheffield site. In 1962, a deal was reached with United Breweries to sell Carling Black Label lager in Stones tied houses in exchange for supplying Stones products to United's Sheffield area public houses. In 1965 the company was valued at £5 million, rising to £7.2 million by 1967 (£ in [...] {{adjusted for}} inflation) as takeover rumours mounted. In 1966, William Stones launched its first brewery conditioned beer, Stones Imperial.|$|E

500|$|Travel writer Cash Peters {{identifies}} six characteristics {{common to}} many of the museum's artworks. The first is that MOBA artists are unable to render hands or feet, and mask them by extending figures' arms off the canvas, hiding them with long sleeves, or placing shoes on feet in inappropriate scenarios. Second, Peters compared artists Rembrandt and J. M. W. Turner, masters of landscapes, who [...] "could probably paint with their eyes shut" [...] to MOBA artists who apparently did paint with their eyes shut, as skies are often painted in any color but blue, flora are created without reference to any <b>existing</b> <b>plant</b> organisms, and fauna appear so small in the background it is impossible to discern what kind of animals they are. Third, MOBA artists apply perspective inconsistently, either from one painting to the next, or within a single work. [...] Peters's fourth observation concerns the difficulty MOBA artists seem to have in successfully rendering noses: he writes that a nose will be attempted so many times that the work takes on a third dimension as paint is reapplied over and over. Fifth, bad artists favor [...] "mixed media": if in doubt, they glue feathers, glitter, or hair to their work. Lastly, Peters suggests that artists know their work is bad, but apparently feel the piece may be saved by including a monkey or a poodle in the composition.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{doubts about}} the {{technical}} and economic viability of retrofit to <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> can be identified {{there have also been}} suggestions that CO 2 capture retrofits at appropriate sites could be economically attractive. The potential to extend the life of <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> with paid-off capital could be beneficial and some project developers are exploring retrofit opportunities for CO 2 capture demonstration. This paper (and the accompanying study commissioned by IEAGHG) shows that there is a sound theoretical basis for CCS retrofits to <b>existing</b> power <b>plants</b> to be considered as a complement, and in some cases as an alternative, to new build power plants with CCS. A key recommendation resulting from the technical and economic analysis undertaken is that a general rejection of retrofitting on grounds such as the age or lower efficiency of <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> is not justified. Instead CCS retrofits need to be assessed on a site-specific basis, which is feasible since only {{a relatively small number of}} plants (order 100 ’s) need to be retrofitted in order to have a significant impact on global CO 2 emissions. Initial site-by-site retrofit potential studies using aerial photographs that have already been undertaken in several countries could be complemented by additional, more detailed, engineering studies and extended as ongoing national reference databases...|$|R
