25|$|In England {{from the}} 1630s, under the {{influence}} of literature and especially court masques, Anthony van Dyck and his followers created a fashion for having one's portrait painted in exotic, historical or pastoral dress, or in simplified contemporary fashion with various scarves, cloaks, mantles, and jewels added to evoke a classic or romantic mood, and also to prevent the portrait appearing dated within a few years. These paintings are the progenitors of the fashion of the later 17th century for having one's portrait painted in undress, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>reflect</b> clothing as it was actually worn.|$|E
25|$|These standings <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>reflect</b> a skater/couple's capabilities. Due to {{limits on}} entries to events (no {{more than three}} from each country), and varying numbers of {{high-level}} skaters in each country, skaters from some countries may find {{it more difficult to}} qualify to compete at major events. Thus, a skater with a lower SB but from a country with few high-level skaters may qualify to a major event while a skater with a much higher SB but from a country with more than three high-level skaters may not be sent. As a result, it is possible for a skater who regularly scores higher to end up with a much lower world standing.|$|E

During the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002), nearly half of all schools were reportedly looted and destroyed, leading to current problems with overcrowding.|$|E

25|$|A hyeong is a systematic, {{prearranged}} {{sequence of}} martial techniques that is performed either {{with or without}} the use of a weapon. In dojangs (taekwondo training gymnasiums) hyeong are used primarily as a form of interval training that is useful in developing mushin, proper kinetics and mental and physical fortitude. Hyeong may resemble combat, but are artistically non-combative and woven together so as to be an effective conditioning tool. One's aptitude for a particular hyeong may be evaluated in competition. In such competitions, hyeong are evaluated by a panel of judges who base the score on many factors including energy, precision, speed, and control. In Western competitions, there are two general classes of hyeong: creative and standard. Creative hyeong are created by the performer and are generally acrobatic in nature and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> <b>reflect</b> the kinetic principles intrinsic in any martial system.|$|E
25|$|Pyrrhus {{was married}} five times: {{his first wife}} Antigone bore him a {{daughter}} called Olympias and a son named Ptolemy in honour of her stepfather. She died in 295 BC, possibly in childbirth, since {{that was the same}} year her son was born. His second wife was Lanassa, daughter of King Agathocles of Syracuse (r. 317–289 BC), whom he married in about 295 BC; the couple had two sons, Alexander and Helenus; Lanassa left Pyrrhus. His third wife was the daughter of Audoleon, King of Paeonia; his fourth wife was the Illyrian princess Bircenna, who was the daughter of King Bardylis II (r. c. 295–290 BC); and his fifth wife was the daughter of Ptolemy Keraunos, whom he married in 281/280 BC.

[...] Moreover, she contends that charity has only negative consequences because, as Jones puts it, she [...] "sees it as sustaining an unequal society while giving the appearance of virtue to the rich".|$|E

500|$|During {{daylight}} hours, drier {{air from}} aloft drifts {{down to the}} surface, causing an apparent movement of the dryline eastward.

500|$|The highest {{price paid}} at auction for a Thoroughbred {{was set in}} 2006 at $16,000,000 for a two-year-old colt named The Green Monkey.

The best-known example of this was the 1986 Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand, exported to Japan to stand at stud, but was ultimately slaughtered in 2002, presumably for pet food.|$|E
