2500|$|Since late 2001 Karzai {{has been}} trying for peace in his country, going as far as pardoning militants that lay down weapons and join the {{rebuilding}} process. However, his offers were not accepted by the militant groups. In April 2007, Karzai acknowledged that he spoke to some militants about trying to bring peace in Afghanistan. He noted that the Afghan militants are always welcome in the country, although foreign insurgents are not. In September 2007, Karzai again offered talks with militant fighters after a security scare forced him to end a commemoration speech. Karzai left the event and was taken back to his palace, where he was due to meet visiting Latvian President Valdis Zatlers. After the meeting the pair held a joint news conference, at which Karzai called for talks with his Taliban foes. [...] "We don't have any formal negotiations with the Taliban. They don't have an address. Who do we talk to?" [...] Karzai told reporters. He further stated: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> place where to send somebody to talk to, an authority that publicly says it is the Taliban authority, I will do it." ...|$|E

But there's a good wench, Rusha, drive up the cows and sheep this way so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> eye on them, and shew Captain Venn's paper, if any of those fellows should take a fancy to them." ...|$|R

'While I would {{restrain}} {{her from}} all correspondence with your son, and sever their intercourse here, though it should cause her death,' said Mr Haredale, {{who had been}} pacing to and fro, 'I would do it kindly and tenderly if <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> trust to discharge, which my nature is not formed to understand, and, for this reason, the bare fact of there being any love between them comes upon me to-night, almost for the first time.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The B-side of {{the track}} is [...] "Girl", a light pop number that speaks of Prince's lust for a woman.

5000|$|The {{secret is}} God Control. The only sane {{people in an}} insane world are those {{controlled}} by God. God-controlled personalities make God-controlled nationalities.

40|$|This is criticizing {{not so much}} Western audiences but the {{situation}} this audience finds itself in, the state of culture in the West. For example, for Russians, even now, culture and works of art have always carried certain spiritual, mystic, or — if you prefer — prophetic significance. A similar understanding of culture <b>has</b> to <b>a</b> very large extent also developed in Poland. Here, in the West, culture has long ago become an object of consumption, a consumer property. What does culture mean for them? Culture is what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>have.</b> <b>As</b> a result of my being free. And {{what does it mean}} free? — I am free to have what everyone here has. Does culture exist in the West? It does. Thus <b>I</b> <b>can</b> and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the right to use it. And what does it mean: <b>I</b> <b>can?</b> Well, just — physically, pragmatically — <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> It won't even occur to him to pause and think: yes you can but are you able to digest it?

50|$|Of course an {{explanation}} isn't {{the same as}} an experience, but that's because the two are completely independent categories, like colors and triangles.
