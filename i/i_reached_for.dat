Next thing I knew, {{there was this}} chap in the long grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> my small pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because sometimes you were too far from a dressing station, sometimes you couldn't get them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the only thing to do was to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't. That hardens you: You get used {{to the fact that it}} can happen. And that it is the only sensible thing to do." ...|$|E

60|$|Up on the {{hillside}} the eager sounds had stopped for a moment, as if some strange sixth sense had warned the birds to be silent. The owl was puzzled; but I dared not move, because he was looking straight over me. Some faint sound, too faint for my ears, made him turn his head, and on the instant <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the tiny rifle lying before me in the canoe. Just as he spread his wings to investigate the new sound, the little rifle spoke, and he tumbled heavily to the shore.|$|E
60|$|The man responded, {{and behind}} him came two {{more of the}} same feather, and {{suddenly}} I found myself surrounded by an ill-smelling crowd of flashy men and tawdry women. They jostled me, and <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> my sword, to make the discovery that I had forgotten it. Regaining my full senses, I struck the man nearest me a blow that sent him sprawling in the dirt. A blade gleamed under the sickly light of the fish-oil lamp overhead, but a man crashed through from behind and caught the ruffian's sword-arm and flung him back in the kennel.|$|E

From there I could look aft and see three heads on top the cabin--the heads of three sailors I had given orders to for months. The niggers saw me standing, and started for me. <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> my revolver, and found they had taken it. I can't say that I was scared.

60|$|I {{stood still}} for some time. The {{sight of her}} had made me very happy. And then an unrest and a pain began to creep in on this happiness. I started to climb the tree after her, and she retreated slowly out the limb. Just as <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> her, she sprang {{through the air and}} landed in the {{branches}} of the next tree. From amid the rustling leaves she peeped out at me and made soft sounds. I leaped straight for her, and after an exciting chase the situation was duplicated, for there she was, making soft sounds and peeping out from the leaves of a third tree.|$|E

[...] "These words," [...] I said, [...] "you may keep. We make no claim on them at all. You are at liberty to make any use of them that you like." ...|$|E

5000|$|The famous line is {{frequently}} misattributed, sometimes to Hermann Göring and sometimes to Heinrich Himmler. In December 2007, historian David Starkey misattributed it to Joseph Goebbels in comments criticizing Queen Elizabeth II for being [...] "poorly educated and philistine". It {{has also been}} adapted by, for example Stephen Hawking as [...] "When I hear of Schrödinger's cat, <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> my pistol" [...] and by filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard in his 1963 film Le Mépris, when a producer says to Fritz Lang: [...] "Whenever I hear the word culture, I bring out my checkbook." [...] Lang evokes the original line when he answers [...] "Some years ago—some horrible years ago—the Nazis used {{to take out a}} pistol instead of a checkbook." [...] Songwriter Roger Miller of Mission of Burma titled a song he wrote in 1981 [...] "That's When <b>I</b> <b>Reach</b> <b>for</b> My Revolver".|$|R
60|$|But {{how true}} {{is the old}} Roman saying, 'Surgit amari aliquid'. Our pleasures are never perfect. There is always something. In the {{programme}} which I had hastily mapped out, the upsetting of Mr MacGinnis was but a small item, a mere preliminary. There {{were a number of}} things which I had wished to do to him, once upset. But it was not to be. Even as <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> his throat I perceived that the light of the window was undergoing an eclipse. A compact form had wriggled out on to the sill, as I had done, and I heard the grating of his shoes on the wall as he lowered himself for the drop.|$|E
60|$|There were a {{thousand}} pathetic protests, but I couldn't shorten up any, for I couldn't remember {{how long a}} total eclipse lasts. I was in a puzzled condition, anyway, and wanted to think. Something was wrong about that eclipse, and the fact was very unsettling. If this wasn't the one I was after, how was I to tell whether this was the sixth century, or nothing but a dream? Dear me, if I could only prove it was the latter! Here was a glad new hope. If the boy {{was right about the}} date, and this was surely the 20th, it wasn't the sixth century. <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the monk's sleeve, in considerable excitement, and asked him what day of the month it was.|$|E
60|$|He was a {{satisfactory}} long time dying. He {{had a wonderful}} vitality, an astonishing constitution. Yes, he was a pleasant long time at it. I got a chair and a newspaper, and sat down by him and read. Occasionally I {{took a sip of}} brandy. This was necessary, on account of the cold. But I did it partly because I saw, that along at first, whenever <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the bottle, he thought I was going to give him some. I read aloud: mainly imaginary accounts of people snatched from the grave's threshold and restored to life and vigor by a few spoonsful of liquor and a warm bath. Yes, he had a long, hard death of it--three hours and six minutes, from the time he rang his bell.|$|E
5000|$|Catherine Wheel {{recorded}} {{a version of}} [...] "That's When <b>I</b> <b>Reach</b> <b>for</b> My Revolver" [...] for their 1992 EP 30 Century Man. Notably, the song also features slightly altered lyrics from the original, such as the replacement of [...] "The spirit fights to find its way" [...] with [...] "That feeling passes by this way".|$|R
5000|$|... "Oochy Woochy" [...] {{is a song}} by Graham Coxon and was {{featured}} on his second solo album, The Golden D. In late 2000 the song was released as a promotional single from that album in the United Kingdom with another album track, [...] "That's When <b>I</b> <b>Reach</b> <b>for</b> My Revolver", serving as the B-side (see 2000 in British music).|$|R
5000|$|He is {{probably}} {{best known as a}} co-founder of Mission of Burma. He played bass guitar and occasional guitar, and wrote and sang some of the group's best-known songs, such as [...] "That's When <b>I</b> <b>Reach</b> <b>For</b> My Revolver" [...] and [...] "Academy Fight Song"—songs that often had an anthemic sing-along quality. Conley's bass work often featured double stops and chords.|$|R
6000|$|One morning I {{happened}} {{to turn over}} the salt-cellar at breakfast. <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off. She says, [...] "Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making!" [...] The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn't going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out.|$|E
60|$|So, thinks I, I'll go {{and search}} them rooms. Upstairs {{the hall was}} dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody else {{take care of that}} money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn't do nothing without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course. So I judged I'd got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop. About that time I hears their {{footsteps}} coming, and was going to skip under the bed; <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps at {{any other}} time I would have remarked that this request was rather unusual, {{considering}} {{the fact that she was}} very light and sure of action, extremely proud of it, and likely to be insulted by an offer of assistance. But my spirit was dead. <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> her hands, but they eluded mine, slipped up my arms as she came sliding out of the saddle, and then her face was very close to mine. [...] "Russ!" [...] she whispered. It was torment, wistfulness, uncertainty, and yet tenderness all in one little whisper. It caught me off guard or indifferent to consequences. So I kissed her, without passion, with all regret and sadness. She uttered a little cry that might have been mingled exultation and remorse for her victory and her broken faith. Certainly the instant I kissed her she remembered the latter. She trembled against me, and leaving unsaid something she had meant to say, she slipped out of my arms and ran. She assuredly was frightened, and I thought it just as well that she was.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} version of [...] "That's When <b>I</b> <b>Reach</b> <b>for</b> My Revolver" [...] had a substantially different lyric. Among which is [...] "Tonight {{the sky is}} empty/But that is nothing new/Its dead eyes look upon us/And they tell me we're nothing but slaves." [...] Moby changed the lyrics, and the change most noticeable is the third line ("Instead they look upon us").|$|R
