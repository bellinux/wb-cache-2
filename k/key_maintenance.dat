50|$|DNMT1 is {{the most}} {{abundant}} DNA methyltransferase in mammalian cells, and {{considered to be the}} <b>key</b> <b>maintenance</b> methyltransferase in mammals. It predominantly methylates hemimethylated CpG di-nucleotides in the mammalian genome. This enzyme is 7- to 100-fold more active on hemimethylated DNA as compared with unmethylated substrate in vitro, but it is still more active at de novo methylation than other DNMTs. The recognition motif for the human enzyme involves only three of the bases in the CpG dinucleotide pair: a C on one strand and CpG on the other. This relaxed substrate specificity requirement allows it to methylate unusual structures like DNA slippage intermediates at de novo rates that equal its maintenance rate. Like other DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferases the human enzyme recognizes flipped out cytosines in double stranded DNA and operates by the nucleophilic attack mechanism. In human cancer cells DNMT1 is responsible for both de novo and maintenance methylation of tumor suppressor genes. The enzyme is about 1,620 amino acids long. The first 1,100 amino acids constitute the regulatory domain of the enzyme, and the remaining residues constitute the catalytic domain. These are joined by Gly-Lys repeats. Both domains are required for the catalytic function of DNMT1.|$|E
40|$|Maintenance {{treatment}} in ulcerative colitis often fails to prevent flares {{and long term}} complications. The first <b>key</b> to <b>maintenance</b> is to use effective therapy, even when patients become asymptomatic. The second key is to communicate the importance of adherence to patients, {{and to help them}} achieve long term adherence. Simplified dosing schedules are of some benefit, but the bond between patient and doctor, and the patient's belief in the efficacy of the therapy are essential. Decreased co-pays (a fixed amount paid by patients seeking care that is not reimbursed my medical insurance) have been associated with increased adherence, and incentives for patients may be a cost-effective approach to improving adherence. While the most substantial data on the association between adherence and clinical outcomes is in 5 -ASAs, non-adherence can also limit the efficacy of thiopurines and biologics. The third <b>key</b> to <b>maintenance</b> treatment is monitoring and maintaining control of inflammation. Decreased histologic and endoscopic damage to the colon has been associated with decreased risk of colon cancer. The most cost-effective way to monitor smoldering inflammation is not known, but endoscopy, structured symptom indices, and biomarkers may be valuable approaches. The fourth <b>key</b> to <b>maintenance</b> treatment is optimizing immunomodulator therapy with thiopurines, and possibly methotrexate in the future. The fifth <b>key</b> to <b>maintenance</b> {{treatment in}} ulcerative colitis is maintaining biologic efficacy by avoiding low trough levels and being vigilant for subclinical inflammation and symptom recurrence at the end of dose intervals.

Multihop relay-based support was added, which not only help for improving coverage and throughput but also provides features such as lower backhaul deployment cost, easy setup, robustness and re-configurability, which make it one of the indispensable technologies in next generation wireless network. A WiMAX network usually operates in a highly dynamic and open environment therefore it is known to be more vulnerable to security holes. Security holes most of the time is trade off with authentication and key management overheads. In order to operate securely, communication must be scheduled either by a distributed, centralized or hybrid security control algorithms with less authentication and key management overheads. In this paper, we propose a new fully self-organized efficient authentication and key management scheme (SEAKS) for hop-by-hop distributed and localized security control for Multihop non-transparent relay based IEEE 802. 16 networks which not only helps in security counter measures but also reduce the authentication and <b>key</b> <b>maintenance</b> overheads. The proposed scheme provides hybrid security controls between distributed authentication and localized re-authentication and <b>key</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The proposed scheme uses distributed nontransparent decode and forward relays for distributed authentication when any non-transparent Relays (NRS) want to join the networks and uses localized authentication when NRSs want to re-authenticate and do <b>key</b> <b>maintenance.</b> We analyze the procedures of the proposed scheme in details and examine how it works significantly to reduce overall authentication overheads and counter measures for security vulnerabilities such as Denial of Service, Replay and interleaving attacks...|$|E

40|$|Security {{has become}} a primary concern in mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs). The characteristics of MANETs pose both challenges and opportunities in achieving security goals, such as confidentiality, authentication, integrity, availability, access control, and non-repudiation. Cryptographic techniques are widely used for secure communications in wired and wireless networks. Most cryptographic mechanisms, such as symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, often involve the use of cryptographic keys. However, all cryptographic techniques will be ineffective if the key management is weak. Key management is also a central component in MANET security. The purpose of key management is to provide secure procedures for handling cryptographic keying materials. The tasks of key management include key generation, key distribution, and <b>key</b> <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Key</b> <b>maintenance</b> includes the procedures for key storage, key update, key revocation, key archiving, etc. In MANETs, the computational load and complexity for key management are strongly subject to restriction by the node’s available resources and the dynamic nature of network topology.

As mobile cloud computing continues to grow, so does the need for effective security mechanisms because data offloaded and moved from mobile to unknown destination. Encryption algorithms play good roles in information security systems (ISS). Those algorithms consume {{a significant amount of}} computing resources such as CPU time, memory, and battery power. At present, various types of cryptographic algorithms provide high security to information on networks, but there are also has some drawbacks.

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringIn today's highly {{competitive}} business environment every company is heading {{to increase its}} overall production and profit by decreasing its consumed manufacturing cost. Reduction in manufacturing cost can be effectively achieved by means of reducing the non-value added costs and activities involved in the production process.

In this research work, a method is proposed for assessing the breakdown maintenance factors using a value stream maintenance map (VSMM) enabling the assessment of measurable maintenance factors. To attain the proposed method, initially, various breakdown maintenance factors are identified and grouped.
