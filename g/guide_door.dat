6000|$|Presently his scullery maid {{stopped at}} a door and tapped thereon. A fruity voice, like old tawny port made audible, said: [...] "Come in!" [...] Ashe's <b>guide</b> opened the <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|Next morning, in the chill, mist-laden dawn, you rise; and, after {{a breakfast}} {{of coffee and}} dried fish, {{shoulder}} your Remington, and step forth silently into the raw, damp air; the <b>guide</b> locking the <b>door</b> behind you, the key grating harshly in the rusty lock.|$|R
60|$|They climbed some broken steps. Their <b>guide</b> {{opened a}} <b>door</b> with a Yale key. The door swung to after {{them and they}} found {{themselves}} in darkness. There had been no light in the windows. There was no light, apparently, in the house. Their companion produced an electric torch from his pocket.|$|R

It manufactures Car door frame (skin parts), Glass separator channels, <b>Door</b> <b>guide</b> rails (stainless steel), Window channels, Side impact beams, Casing for starter motor (deep drawn part), HCV chassis and CRF sections for Railway wagons and coaches.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God we are out!" [...] Malcolm said fervently. [...] "I {{have been}} in a watch house more than once in my young days, but I can't say I like it better as I grow older." [...] They walked for some minutes, and then their <b>guides</b> opened a <b>door</b> and they entered a small house.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996 filmmaker Spike Lee {{personally}} {{requested a}} red New York Yankees cap from New Era, starting both a fashion trend {{as well as}} a long relationship with New Era. The ability to make caps in colors outside major leagues' style <b>guides</b> opened the <b>door</b> for the biggest era in New Era history and the entry into the lifestyle and fashion category.|$|R
60|$|As {{she lifted}} her head, the blue eyes and the black {{exchanged}} again the subtle glance of sympathy that made them friends before; only now the blue ones looked up full of gratitude, and the black ones looked down soft with pity. Neither spoke; but Letty stooped, and, gathering old Sally in her arms, kissed the friendly creature, then followed her <b>guide</b> to the <b>door.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{the user}} wishes {{to operate the}} device, they push the {{shopping}} cart through the device's safety <b>doors.</b> <b>Guides</b> in the floor then direct the shopping cart's wheels into the proper position. The device then senses {{the presence of the}} cart and pulls it up to the next store level. Devices generally feature some sort of a system, such as one-way hinges or a sensor, to stop people from entering the device.|$|R
60|$|That {{it was not}} {{the nearest}} and most direct route which they took to the trysting-place George became aware after he had {{followed}} his young <b>guide</b> through <b>doors</b> and up stairs and down stairs and had at last come to a halt in a room to which the sound of the music penetrated but faintly. He recognized the room. He had been in it before. It was the same room where he and Billie Dore had listened to Keggs telling the story of Lord Leonard and his leap. That window there, he remembered now, opened on to the very balcony from which the historic Leonard had done his spectacular dive. That it should be the scene of this other secret meeting struck George as appropriate. The coincidence appealed to him.|$|R
50|$|On 19 December the airship {{was moved}} {{outdoors}} again, with its engines running and propellers spinning {{as it was}} <b>guided</b> through the <b>doors.</b> Handlers positioned themselves and the unit for launching, but within five minutes the sun had again heated the internal gas. A staccato pop of rivets {{was followed by a}} metallic-sounding explosion and a vapor cloud as the gas escaped. The port side had failed; the side was distended, the duralumin ribs bulging and honeycombed with gaps.|$|R
60|$|Walthew {{felt more}} suspicious. They were now near a lamp {{that hung in}} the arch, and {{although}} his companion was dressed like a peon his voice suggested some education. The feeling that his arrival had been expected was stronger, {{but it was too}} late to turn back and he went on, surreptitiously making sure that his automatic pistol was loose. He was taken across the patio, up an outside staircase, and along a balcony, where his <b>guide</b> opened a <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was {{a family}} hotel in a quiet but {{handsome}} street near Hyde Park. As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its <b>door,</b> <b>guided</b> her to the spot, the clock struck eleven. She had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound determined her, and {{she stepped into the}} hall. The porter's seat was vacant. She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced towards the stairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got {{a friend}} in here," [...] said his <b>guide,</b> opening a <b>door</b> and {{disclosing}} an extremely dirty room of about ten feet square. A woman with her back towards the door was busy at a wash-tub. Ragged clothes were drying on a clothes-line. A shattered bed, on which lay a bundle of straw and a torn blanket, stood in one corner; a rickety table in another. Water and soapsuds blotched the broken floor, amongst which played two little boys, absolutely naked.|$|R

The part is manufactured from PE-HD, production quantity is 3 000 000 pcs annually. Based on calculations and review of specialized literature the design utilizes hot runners of MH system by Ewicon. The tool is assembled from normalized components by Hasco and an injection press BOY 22 D was suggested for parts production. Total costs for production of 1 part are 0, 26 CZK...|$|R
60|$|Presently the blear-eyed guide {{with the}} angry voice {{returned}} from within, released {{us from the}} importunities of certain forward and inquisitive youth, and motioned us to doff our slippers at a stone step, or rather line, about twelve feet distant from the palace-wall. We grumbled {{that we were not}} entering a mosque, but in vain. Then ensued a long dispute, in tongues mutually unintelligible, about giving up our weapons: by dint of obstinacy we retained our daggers and my revolver. The <b>guide</b> raised a <b>door</b> curtain, suggested a bow, and I stood {{in the presence of the}} dreaded chief.|$|R
40|$|Davit {{arms are}} usually {{employed}} to handle doors of large size autoclaves. These arms require a guiding mechanism to <b>guide</b> the <b>door</b> in a desired path and locate in the desired position. In this work, various options of door handling / steering mechanisms were examined {{and finally a}} four bar mechanism is chosen for detailed design. A Geometric model was developed to understand the path traced by the door for various link angles and lengths. Solid modeling of the door was carried out using Solidworks R and simulation of {{the path of the}} door for various angles and lengths of the links of the 4 bar mechanism was also done. The prototype model of the autoclave door was fabricated with a 4 bar mechanism mounted on the davit arm of the door. Number of trials were made by changing link lengths and angles to determine the path of the door, using the CAD geometric model. These results are in agreement with the experimental results obtained using fabricated model...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the door}} is hung at the top from two points, it also needs a bottom track/stay roller {{to prevent it from}} {{swinging}} sideways. The most common type is called 'clear threshold guiding', a floor-fixed plastic guide about 60mm wide which is fixed below the door at the midpoint of its run. A groove is cut {{into the bottom of the}} door which runs over this guide, preventing lateral movement of the door. With a glass door the panel runs through the guide as illustrated.Because {{the door is}} always engaged in the <b>guide,</b> when the <b>door</b> is open the floor is clear, hence 'clear threshold' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the centre}} of the grassy {{quadrangle}} about which the cloisters perambulate is a small, mean brick building, with a locked door. Our guide,--I forgot to say that we had been captured by a verger, in black, and with a white tie, but of a lusty and jolly aspect,--our <b>guide</b> unlocked this <b>door,</b> and disclosed a flight of steps. At the bottom appeared what I should have taken to be a large square of dim, worn, and faded oil-carpeting, which might originally have been painted of a rather gaudy pattern. This was a Roman tessellated pavement, made of small colored bricks, or pieces of burnt clay. It was accidentally discovered here, and has not been meddled with, further than by removing the superincumbent earth and rubbish.|$|R
50|$|The Castle {{comprises}} a {{total of}} about fifty rooms, although only about ten of them may visited with the <b>guided</b> tour. A <b>door</b> in the portico leads to the dining room, roofed by a vault and furnished with nineteenth-century furniture that Vittorio Avondo had {{made on the basis of}} Renaissance models. The dining room was joined to the kitchen by means of a service-hatch. The kitchen is divided into two parts by a wooden grate, creating two distinct spaces probably originally intended for the preparation of different types of food. The larger space, adjacent to the dining room, is provided with a large fireplace and an oven, while the smaller part includes a fireplace of smaller dimensions and a sink.|$|R
50|$|Homer and Bart spot Lisa {{sitting alone}} {{on the porch of}} an old cabin. While sobbing, Lisa {{explains}} to them what Moe has done, and Bart and Homer quickly run off to exact revenge for her. That night, at the dinner honoring Moe, Moe begins reading his poems. However, the crowd begins to murmur, as they realize that the new poems that Moe is reading are just the information from an elevator warning sign and a channel <b>guide.</b> The <b>door</b> opens {{in the back of the}} dining hall and Moe stops in mid-sentence as he sees a sad and bitter Lisa walk through. Moe suddenly comes to his senses and, in an original poem of his own, he credits Lisa for her influence and friendship. Lisa is touched by Moe's words and she forgives him. Just then, Homer calls out from a catwalk above Moe, telling him that he never should have made Lisa cry. Homer and Bart tip over a giant drum of maple syrup intended for Moe, but the extremely thick syrup flows so slowly out of the drum that Moe has plenty of time to get away before the syrup reaches him. The episode ends with Moe and Lisa walking out of the dining hall, hand in hand.|$|R
50|$|Scene 13The <b>guide</b> {{opens the}} <b>door</b> {{to the room}} he had passed up before the {{previous}} scene.A girl lying on a bed sits up and delivers a monologue about how she wishes to die quietly and peacefully. Afterward a man {{who appears to be}} an audience member walks up to her and covers her mouth killing her. Four men enter singing and put the girl into a sack. Shortly afterward her parents enter looking for her. The men say she was never there and carry off the corpse singing.The guide has the group follow the men out and after they enter a new room and audience member opens the door to follow and is hit by a club. The guide puts his body into a box like the one he opened in scene 11.|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} the angry shouts and entreaties of the <b>guide,</b> the <b>door</b> thrust open, and the party, armed with their axes and bows, at once rushed out into the night. The storm had for the moment abated {{and they had no}} {{difficulty}} in making their way along the track. In fifty yards they came to a bend of the path, and saw, a little distance before them, a black mass of animals, covering the road, and congregated round a figure who stood {{with his back to the}} rock. With a shout of encouragement they sprang forward, and in a few moments were in the midst of the savage animals, who turned their rage against them at once. They had fired two or three arrows apiece, as they approached, into them; and now, throwing down their bows, the archers betook themselves to their swords, while Cuthbert with his heavy battle-axe hewed and cut at the wolves as they sprang towards him. In a minute they had cleared their way to the figure, which was that of a knight in complete armour. He leant against the rock completely exhausted, and could only mutter a word of thanks through his closed visor. At a short distance off a number of the wolves were gathered, rending and tearing the horse of the knight; but the rest soon recovering from their surprise, attacked with fury the little party. The thick cloaks of the archers stood them in good stead against the animals' teeth, and standing in a group with their backs to the rock, they hewed and cut vigorously at their assailants. The numbers of these, however, appeared almost innumerable, and fresh stragglers continued to come along the road, and swell their body. As fast as those in front fell, their heads cleft with the axes of the party, fresh ones sprang forward; and Cuthbert saw that in {{spite of the}} valour and strength of his men, the situation was well nigh desperate. He himself had been saved from injury by his harness, for he still had on his greaves and leg pieces.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, librarians {{have used}} printed, and more recently, online library guides to provide {{assistance}} and guidance to students about resources relevant to a specific subject or discipline area. The creation involves {{a significant amount of}} duplication of effort and the ongoing maintenance is often labour intensive. The Central Queensland University (CQU) Library has now embarked upon improving the process and is using Learning Objects to duplicate the more common content found within online library instruction. However, the time still spent formatting and publishing web pages has led to an investigation for a solution to this problem. The increasing presence and popularity of Web 2. 0 technologies along with a move towards self directed learning has created a nexus which librarians can use to advantage. This situation allows for the creation of online instructional material which delivers synchronous as well as asynchronous media-rich library assistance. CQU Library has investigated various Web 2. 0 technologies, as well as the literature relating to their use in academic libraries. As a result of this investigation, we discovered Libguides. As a Web 2. 0 application, built specifically for libraries, Libguides enables librarians to incorporate learning objects, videos, RSS feeds, podcasts, polls and user comments into a library guide, without having HTML or Javascript expertise. This paper will outline CQU Library’s journey from the initial discovery of Libguides, through the investigation into the pedagogical implications of using this type of tool, along the testing and evaluation path and finally {{to the creation of the}} first library <b>guide.</b> As the <b>door</b> opens to a new world of social connectivity in education the CQU Library has recognised the need to respond quickly and energetically. This paper will conclude with a description of some of the initiatives now in place to take librarians, students and faculty into another dimension of library and information literacy instruction...|$|R
