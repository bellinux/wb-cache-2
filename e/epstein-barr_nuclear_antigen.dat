5000|$|<b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>antigen</b> 1 (EBNA1) is a multifunctional, dimeric {{viral protein}} {{associated}} with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). [...] It {{is the only}} EBV protein found in all EBV-related malignancies. It is important in establishing and maintaining the altered state that cells take when infected with EBV. EBNA1 has a glycine-alanine repeat sequence that separates the protein into amino- and carboxy-terminal domains. This sequence also seems to stabilize the protein, preventing proteasomal breakdown, as well as impairing antigen processing and MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation. This thereby inhibits the CD8-restricted cytotoxic T cell response against virus-infected cells. [...] The EBNA1 transcript area originates at the Qp promoter during latency phases I and II. It is the only viral protein expressed during the first latency phase.|$|E

In a population-based case-control study (Tasmania, Australia), we found that the combined effect of HLA-DR 15 positivity and low infant sibling exposure on multiple sclerosis (odds ratio, 7. 88; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 43 - 18. 11) was 3. 9 -fold greater than expected (test for interaction, p = 0. 019) This interaction was observed irrespective of <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>antigen</b> IgG levels.

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} shown that {{patients}} with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased frequency of precipitating antibody against a nuclear antigen, the RA nuclear antigen, detected in human B lymphoblastoid cell lines infected by Epstein-Barr virus. The present investigations demonstrate that patients with seropositive RA also have specifically elevated titers of antibodies to another, better-characterized Epstein-Barr virus-associated B cell antigen, the <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>antigen,</b> which is detected by anti-complement immunofluorescence. Titers of these two antibodies were not affected by absorption of rheumatoid factor from serum. Furthermore, patients with RA did not have elevated titers of antibodies against the Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen or to three other species of human herpesviruses: herpes simplex type 1, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus. In both normal individuals and RA patients there was a significant association between the presence of antibodies to RA nuclear antigen and the titers of antibody to <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>antigen.</b> Thus, normal subjects with antibody to RA nuclear antigen had titers of antibody to <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>antigen</b> equivalent to those of patients with RA and significantly higher than normal subjects lacking antibody to RA nuclear antigen. One interpretation of these results is that patients with seropositive RA derive from a larger population with enhanced immune responsiveness to B lymphocyte nuclear antigens determined by the Epstein-Barr virus...|$|E

A significant correlation was found between the titers obtained with our assay and titers obtained by anticomplement immunofluorescence on 110 serum samples.

The observation that the methanol extracts and their fractions from Ankistrodesmus convolutus, Synechococcus elongatus and Spirulina platensis exhibited inhibitory activity against EBV proteins in three Burkitt’s lymphoma cell lines at concentrations as low as 20 μg/ml suggests that microalgae could be a potential source of antiviral compounds against EBV...|$|E

40|$|Using {{the yeast}} two-hybrid system, <b>Epstein–Barr</b> virus <b>nuclear</b> <b>antigen</b> 6 A (EBNA 6 A) {{was found to}} {{interact}} with the RBP- 2 N isoform of RBP-Jj. The interaction of EBNA 6 A and EBNA 6 B with RBP- 2 N was compared and the results indicated that EBNA 6 B was less efficient at interacting with RBP- 2 N than was EBNA 6 A. Deletion mutation analysis of EBNA 6 A identified a region involved in the inter-action with RBP- 2 N, while analysis of RBP- 2 N identified a domain which interacts with EBNA 6 A. The region of RBP- 2 N to which EBNA 6 A binds has previously been shown to interact with EBNA 2. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is the aetiological agent of infectious mononucleosis and is associated with Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin’s disease and lymphoproliferative disease in immunocompromised indi-viduals (reviewed in Rickinson & Kieff, 1996). Transformation of B lymphocytes by EBV results in the expression of a family of latent antigens which includes six <b>Epstein–Barr</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>antigens</b> (EBNAs 1 – 6). EBV strains can be categorized into one of two types, A type or B type (also known as type I or II), which show sequence divergence in the EBNA 2,- 3 (3 A),- 4 (3 B) and- 6 (3 C) gene products. Differences in these proteins, expressed during EBV-induced transformation of B lympho-cytes, are thought to be reflected in biological differences between A type and B type EBV (Rickinson et al., 1987). Expression of the full array of latent gene products induces uncontrolled proliferation of B lymphocytes into lympho-blastoid cell lines (LCLs). Of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>antigens,</b> expression o...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the mechanism(s) by which Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induces the outcome of autoantibodies during infectious mononucleosis (IM), a human IgM (k) monoclonal antibody to cytoskeletal filaments of epithelial cells has been prepared by EBV transformation of peripheral blood B lymphocytes obtained from a patient with IM. The antibody was also found to react with smooth muscle of frozen sections of human stomach tissue by immunofluorescence, and with the <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>antigen</b> (EBNA) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Here we report that Drosophila cells containing stably integrated copies of EBNA- 1 encoding DNA synthesise a polypeptide of mol. wt. identical to that of authentic EBNA- 1, which is detectable with EBNA-positive but not EBNA-negative human serum.

Two complementary techniques are currently used in the diagnosis and characterization of Epstein-Barr virus-associated B cell lymphomas and diffuse B cell lymphoproliferation. Immunofluorescence allows specific detection of <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>antigens</b> in lymphomatous tissue.

40|$|Although {{cutaneous}} T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a neoplastic helper T-cell {{disorder of}} unknown etiology, prolonged antigenic stimulation has been postulated {{to contribute to}} the development of this disease. Because Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection has been associated with several different lymphomas, the sera of 21 CTCL patients were examined for antibodies to EBV antigens. By using complement immuno- fluorescence (CIF) techniques, 13 of 21 CTCL patients had detectable antibodies to <b>Epstein-Barr</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Antigens</b> (EBNA), whereas only five of 20 control psoriatic patients were CIF positive. When immunoblot analysis was employed, all 21 of the CTCL patients had antibodies to the EBV antigens, EBNA, whereas only 12 of the control patients had detectable antibodies to these antigens. In addition, three of 21 CTCL patients had antibodies to the EBV-associated <b>antigen,</b> rheumatoid arthritis <b>nuclear</b> <b>antigen</b> (RANA), as determined by double immunodiffusion, whereas none of the control sera contained anti-RANA antibodies. These results indicate that antibodies against EBV antigens are found with a higher frequency and concentration in patients with CTCL when compared to controls and suggest that EBV products might serve as a possible stimulus for the development of this malignant disease...|$|R
