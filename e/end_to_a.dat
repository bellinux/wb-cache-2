Joined by Anakin Skywalker—a young slave with unusually strong natural powers of the Force—they simultaneously contend with the mysterious return of the Sith.|$|E
5|$|Webber again looked {{strong at}} the final race {{of the season in}} Brazil. Webber {{qualified}} fifth in front of both BMW Saubers and behind only the Ferraris and McLarens. Webber looked strong in the race, running as high as fourth, before yet another mechanical failure brought an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> disappointing but promising season for the Australian.|$|E

5|$|Air is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of three characters. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Air follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, {{there would be an}} option to rewind the story to correct the mistake. However, if the player reaches a bad <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.|$|E
5|$|John of Palisna, Prior of Vrana, rose up in open {{rebellion}} against the rule of Mary and her mother {{in the spring of}} 1383. The queens made Stephen Lackfi Ban of Croatia. The royal army marched to Croatia and laid siege to Vrana, forcing John of Palisna to flee to Bosnia. The defenders of Vrana surrendered to Mary, who had been present during the siege along with her mother, on 4November. To strengthen Mary's position against Charles of Naples, Queen Elizabeth sent her envoys to France and opened negotiations on the marriage of Mary to the younger brother of CharlesVI of France, Louis, who had once been engaged to Mary's sister, Catherine. Mary and the queen mother only left Croatia and Slavonia early next year. Queen Elizabeth replaced Stephen Lackfi with Thomas Szentgyörgyi, who used draconian measures to put an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> conspiracy against the queens in Zadar in May 1384.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona's 33-year reign was {{characterized}} by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the Kingdom of Imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of Madagascar. These policies were enacted {{in a context of}} increasing European influence within her kingdom and competing French and English bids for domination over the island. Early in her reign, the queen took incremental steps to distance Madagascar from the purview of European powers, first putting an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> friendship treaty with Britain, then placing increasing restrictions on the activities of the missionaries of the London Missionary Society, who operated schools where basic education and trade skills were taught in addition to the Christian religion. In 1835 she forbade the practice of Christianity among the Malagasy population, and within a year nearly all foreigners had left her territory.|$|E

5|$|Texas' win, by a {{score of}} 25–22, was the lowest scoring game Texas would {{experience}} all season, {{both in terms of}} points scored by Texas and total points. Fourth-ranked OSU became the highest-ranked non-conference opponent the Longhorns had ever beaten at an opponent's home stadium. The previous high came in 1983 when third-ranked Texas pulled off a 20–7 upset versus fifth-ranked Auburn. Texas became the first non-conference opponent to beat the Buckeyes in Ohio Stadium since 1990, putting an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 36-game home victory string over non-conference opponents. The Longhorns also were the first team to beat the Buckeyes in a night game at The Horseshoe and it was UT's 10thstraight victory in a night-game road contest. ESPN and College Football Rivals each named the game one of the best football games of the season.|$|E
5|$|The HBC {{drastically}} reduced the price paid for furs, by 50% in many cases. By this time, however, the fur trade was in decline, {{both on the}} coast and the continent, due to a general depletion of fur-bearing animals, along with {{a reduction in the}} demand for beaver pelts. A financial panic in 1837 resulted in a general slump in the fur and China trade, bringing an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> half-century boom. During the 1840s, the HBC closed most of their coastal trading posts, leaving the coast trade to just Fort Simpson and the Beaver, with the new depot at Fort Victoria anchoring the southern coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight test}} {{programme}} started in 1985 with the maiden flight of a converted Tu-142M fitted with the advanced avionics; state acceptance trials began within two years. Test results proved excellent, as the aircraft successfully tracked nuclear-powered submarines of the Northern and Pacific Fleets. The aircraft became operational with Russian Naval Aviation (AV-MP) in 1993. The last Tu-142MZ {{rolled off the}} Taganrog production line the following year, bringing an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 26-year production run during which 100 Tu-142s were produced.|$|E

5|$|The southernmost {{territories of}} the duke, roughly {{encompassing}} northern Delaware, were desired by Charles Calvert, Baron Baltimore, {{who sought to}} extend the reach of his proprietary Province of Maryland into the area. At the same time Calvert was seeking an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> frontier war with the Iroquois to the north, having persuaded the intervening Susquehannocks {{to move to the}} Potomac River, well within Maryland territory. Furthermore, the Lenape, who dominated Delaware Bay, were unhappy with seizures of their lands by Virginia and Maryland settlers, and war between these groups had been imminent in 1673 when the Dutch retook New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} {{then moved}} to the penultimate round at the Swedish Grand Prix with Spencer holding a two-point lead over Roberts. Roberts led Spencer going into the last lap of the race. Heading down the back straight, Spencer placed his Honda right behind Roberts' Yamaha {{as they reached the}} second to the last corner, a ninety degree right-hander. As both riders applied their brakes, Spencer came out of Roberts' slipstream and managed to get inside of the Yamaha. As they exited the corner, both riders ran wide off the track and into the dirt. Spencer was able {{to get back on the}} track and back on the power first, crossing the finish line just ahead of Roberts for a crucial victory. Roberts considered Spencer's pass to be foolish and dangerous, and exchanged angry words with him on the podium. Roberts would have to win the final round at the San Marino Grand Prix with Spencer finishing no better than third place in order for Roberts to win his fourth world championship. In a fitting <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> great career, Roberts won his last-ever Grand Prix race, however Spencer was able to secure second place to claim the world championship. The two riders dominated the season with each claiming six victories in the 12 race series.|$|E
5|$|Warfare in Normandy at {{the time}} was shaped by the {{defensive}} potential of castles and the increasing costs of conducting campaigns. The Norman frontiers had limited natural defences but were heavily reinforced with castles, such as Château Gaillard, at strategic points, built and maintained at considerable expense. It was difficult for a commander to advance far into fresh territory without having secured his lines of communication by capturing these fortifications, which slowed the progress of any attack. Armies of the period could be formed from either feudal or mercenary forces. Feudal levies could only be raised for a fixed length of time before they returned home, forcing an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> campaign; mercenary forces, often called Brabançons after the Duchy of Brabant but actually recruited from across northern Europe, could operate all year long and provide a commander with more strategic options to pursue a campaign, but cost much more than equivalent feudal forces. As a result, commanders of the period were increasingly drawing on larger numbers of mercenaries.|$|E
