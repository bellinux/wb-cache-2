However, systolic blood pressures at the seventh and eighth stages over AT during exercise were significantly different and RPP was found to have a significant difference overall according to the <b>job</b> <b>demand</b> (p< 0. 05). These results meant that <b>job</b> <b>demand</b> affected systolic pressure in physical activities or at exercise intensity over AT and reduced energy efficiency of myocardium during physical activities.

In the JD-R model, the category of demands (workload) remains {{more or less the same}} as in the DCS model although the JD-R model more specifically includes physical demands. Resources, however, are defined as job-relevant features that help workers achieve work-related goals, lessen <b>job</b> <b>demands,</b> or stimulate personal growth. Control and support as per the DCS model are subsumed under resources. Resources can be external (provided by the organization) or internal (part of a worker's personal make-up). In addition to control and support, resources encompassed by the model can also include physical equipment, software, performance feedback from supervisors, the worker's own coping strategies, etc. There has not, however, been as much research on the JD-R model as there has been on the constituents of the DC or DCS model.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{investigate}} how learning experiences acquired through workplace coaching may affect stress. I identify two main learning experiences in the coaching process, insight and planning skills, and propose that these affect stress directly and also indirectly through mediators’ <b>job</b> <b>demand,</b> <b>job</b> control, and social support. A within-subject, longitudinal design is applied, with 56 persons receiving coaching from professional, external coaches. Data was collected at three points in time: baseline (before coaching), after a three-month period of coaching, and a follow-up nine months later. The results show that planning skills acquired through coaching reduce stress in the short term, and that the effect is mediated through a decrease in <b>job</b> <b>demand.</b> The decrease in <b>job</b> <b>demand</b> is further shown to reduce stress in the long term. Insight as a coaching outcome is not directly related to stress; however, insight affects social support, which in turn is associated with reduced stress in the long term...|$|R

50|$|The JD-R model {{assumes that}} whereas every {{occupation}} may {{have its own}} specific working characteristics, these characteristics can be classified in two general categories (i.e. <b>job</b> <b>demands</b> and job resources), thus constituting an overarching model that may be applied to various occupational settings, irrespective of the particular demands and resources involved. The central assumption of the JD-R model is that job strain develops - irrespective {{of the type of}} job or occupation - when (certain) <b>job</b> <b>demands</b> are high and when (certain) job resources are limited.

40|$|Objectives: Adverse work-related {{exposures}} {{have been}} linked with decreased physical and mental functioning in later life, however, whether childhood factors explain the associations between work exposures and functioning is unknown. Our aim was to investigate if <b>job</b> <b>demand</b> and control in mid-life were related to self-reported physical and mental functioning in early old age and whether childhood factors explained these associations. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: England, Scotland and Wales. Participants and outcome measures: Data come from the UK Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, a cohort with follow-up since birth in 1946. 1485 occupationally active study members had data available on <b>job</b> <b>demand</b> and control in mid-life and on physical and mental functioning assessed using the Short Form- 36 questionnaire at 60 – 64 years. Results: Those with higher job control in mid-life had better physical functioning than those who reported lower job control (β 0. 51, 95 % CI 0. 02 to 1. 01, p= 0. 04 adjusted for adult confounders). Those with higher <b>job</b> <b>demand</b> in mid-life had poorer mental functioning (β − 0. 82, 95 % CI − 1. 14 to − 0. 51, p< 0. 001). Associations between job control and mental functioning were similar but less pronounced. Adjustment for childhood factors (father’s and mother’s educational attainment, parents’ interest in school at age 7 and cognitive ability at age 8) partially explained the association between job control and physical functioning, but did not explain the association between <b>job</b> <b>demand</b> and mental functioning. Conclusions: <b>Job</b> <b>demand</b> and control in mid-life are differentially associated with mental and physical functioning in early old age {{and some of these}} associations may be partially explained by childhood factors...|$|R
30|$|According to Karasek (1979), {{the route}} from WIF to job {{satisfaction}} {{is recognized as}} a strain path, where the <b>job</b> <b>demand</b> (i.e., WIF) is a stressor that causes employees’ stress response, such as dissatisfaction with their job. Besides the strain path hypothesis, the job demand-control model also provides another core prediction, the buffering hypothesis (Karasek 1979; Johnson and Hall 1988; Van der Doef and Maes 1999). The buffering hypothesis denotes that employees’ control over work will buffer the adverse effect of <b>job</b> <b>demand</b> on <b>job</b> attitude. Consistent with the buffering hypothesis, decision authority, which is a component of job control in the Job Demand-Control Model, could be a buffer in the negative relationship between WIF and job satisfaction.|$|R

Methods This cross-sectional and secondary data analysis included 1, 001 male and 1, 018 female workers (age range: 32 – 69) from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) II study (2004 – 2006). Sedentary work and physical <b>job</b> <b>demand</b> were measured by questionnaire items. Total obesity (based on body mass index) and central obesity (based on waist circumference) were defined using WHO criteria. Results After controlling for covariates (socio-demographic, psychosocial working conditions, health status, and health behaviors), sedentary work, low physical <b>job</b> <b>demand,</b> or their combination increased the risk for total and central obesity in male workers, particularly when they worked longer than 40 hr per week.

This study aimed (1) to assess the individual relations of physical condition, psychological condition, and job-related psychosocial factors to prolonged fatigue among employees, and (2) to clarify the associations between job-related psychosocial factors and prolonged fatigue using hierarchical regression when demographic characteristics, physical condition, and psychological condition were controlled. A cross-sectional study was employed. A questionnaire was used to obtain information pertaining to demographic characteristics, physical condition (perceived physical health and exercise routine), psychological condition (perceived mental health and psychological distress), job-related psychosocial factors (<b>job</b> <b>demand,</b> <b>job</b> control, and workplace social support), and prolonged fatigue.

The questionnaire contained SOC, Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12). Complete answers were recovered from 466 workers (62. 8 %), consisting of 387 males and 79 females, with ages of 45. 1 ± 12. 0 yr, and used for the analysis. The logistic regression analysis revealed the followings: Both for males and females, high GHQ {{was significantly associated with}} scores on SOC and JCQ <b>job</b> <b>demand</b> subscale, i. e. the mental health status was adversely related to <b>job</b> <b>demand</b> whereas it was positively associated with SOC. Similarly, the mental health status was affected adversely by managerial work in males, whereas was positively by co-workers support in females. Thus, high SOC enables workers to cope with their <b>job</b> <b>demand,</b> which is a potent job stressor, indicating that SOC is an important factor determining their coping ability to job stress for both genders. Male managerial employees may cope with their strong job stress because of high SOC, protecting their mental health status.

The present study explores the prevalence of self-perceived depression, anxiety and stress; and their relationships with psychosocial job factors. A cross-sectional study involving 728 male automotive assembly workers was conducted in two major automotive assembly plants in Malaysia using the validated Malay versions of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ). Based on the DASS cut-off of ≥ 78 percentile scores, the prevalence of self-perceived depression, anxiety and stress was 35. 4 %, 47. 2 % and 31. 1 %, respectively. Four (0. 5 %), 29 (4. 0 %) and 2 (0. 3 %) workers, respectively, reported extremely severe self-perceived depression, anxiety and stress. Multiple linear regression analyses, controlling for age, education, salary, duration of work and marital status, revealed that psychological <b>job</b> <b>demand,</b> <b>job</b> insecurity and hazardous condition were positively associated with DASS-Depression, DASS-Anxiety and DASS-Stress; supervisor support was inversely associated with DASS-Depression and DASS-Stress.
