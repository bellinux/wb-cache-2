25|$|In January 2014, Geoff Johns {{announced}} that Lex Luthor and Captain Cold would be joining the Justice League. In {{the wake of}} the Crime Syndicate's invasion, public opinion of Lex Luthor was incredibly favorable, and he decided that he liked it. Another reason was he believed the entity that destroyed the Earth from the alternate universe which the Crime Syndicate came from was the larger threat and might eventually become a threat to their universe and wanted the Justice League to be prepared for that possibility beforehand. In an effort to continue being regarded as a hero, he tried to convince the Justice League to recruit him, but was initially unsuccessful. The Justice League eventually talked about how Luthor was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>on</b> his crusade with or without the help of the Justice League. They let Luthor join the Justice League knowing he could find out information that could put all of them in danger, but Batman figured at least they could keep a close watch on Luthor and LexCorp, and much to the chagrin of Superman, Luthor secured a place in the Justice League, even building a new Watchtower for them and recruiting Shazam onto the team.|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} {{controversial}} from its beginning {{and has made}} the news several times. In the early seasons, some parents and conservatives characterized Bart as a poor role model for children and several United States public schools even banned The Simpsons merchandise and t-shirts. In January 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush made a speech during his re-election campaign in which he said: [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>on</b> trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons."

500|$|The January 30, 1992 rerun of {{the episode}} {{featured}} a brief alternate opening, which was written {{in response to a}} comment made by the then President of the United States, George Bush, three days earlier. The show had previously had a [...] "feud" [...] with the President's wife Barbara Bush when, in the October 1, 1990 edition of People, she called The Simpsons [...] "the dumbest thing [...] had ever seen". The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter to Bush in which they posed as Marge Simpson. Bush immediately sent a reply in which she apologized.

500|$|On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush made {{a speech}} during his {{re-election}} campaign that reignited the feud between The Simpsons and the Bushes. At that point, family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, to which effect he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington, D.C.: [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>on</b> trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons". The next broadcast of The Simpsons was a rerun of [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] on January 30, 1992. It included a new opening, which {{was a response to}} Bush's speech. The scene begins in the Simpsons' living room. Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Patty and Selma all stare at the television and watch Bush's speech. After Bush's statement, Bart replies [...] "Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying {{for an end to the}} Depression too." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode makes {{references}} to several real-life persons. The piano-playing satirist who annoys Bart is {{a reference to}} Mark Russell and/or Tom Lehrer. Bob Arnold, the corrupt congressman, tells Lisa that {{there are quite a}} few women senators, but Lisa asserts that there are only two. At the time of airing there were indeed only two female senators: Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. Then-President George H. W. Bush is featured briefly in the episode. Shortly after it aired, Bush disparaged The Simpsons in a speech during his re-election campaign on January 27, 1992. At that point family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, so he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington: [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>on</b> trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons."

500|$|Bart's rebellious, bad boy nature, which {{underlies}} his misbehavior {{and rarely}} leads to any punishment, led some parents and conservatives to characterize {{him as a}} poor role model for children.

Along with declining viewership, Ed Sullivan attracted a higher median age for the average viewer (which most sponsors found undesirable) as the seasons went on. These two factors were the reason the show was canceled by CBS as part of a mass cancellation of advertiser-averse programming {{after the end of the}} 1970–1971 season. [...] Because there was no notice of cancellation, Sullivan's landmark program ended without a proper finale. Sullivan would produce one-off specials for CBS until his death in 1974.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the fourth}} Test of their five-Test {{series against the}} West Indies in 1966, England were 3–0 down and had lost the series. Needing someone {{to come in to}} {{revitalise}} the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, [...] "I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, and we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the pressure <b>on</b> and <b>keep</b> it <b>on</b> for five days." [...] What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch – or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England {{went on to win the}} game by an innings and 34 runs.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{extension}} of Edward's contract, producers decided to undergo a sexual assault storyline utilizing the character of Zac. They wished not only to develop his character and the story, but also portray an ethical and real issue in society. Edward explained, [...] "They had a six-month arc for him initially, so that basically took it to him being with Sarah and having the affair with Vasa and then Sarah finding out. Then it was around the six-month point where I got told they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> me <b>on.</b> I asked them what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen and they weren't too clear ... then about two months into it I got told." [...] Throughout 2012, the relationship between Zac and Sarah's ex-husband TK Samuels (Benjamin Mitchell) was portrayed as rocky, with the two men's contrasting feelings for Sarah playing a major part. In November a scene aired where TK's wife, Roimata (Shavaughn Ruakere) was sexually assaulted in an alleyway following her birthday party. Sexual assault storylines had previously occurred in Shortland Street (such as the rape of Minnie Crozier (Katrina Devine) in 1998), but Ruakere felt Roimata's was portrayed with [...] "the most depth needed". [...] "It is a big topic {{and you want to}} treat it with respect - not so much from my character's point of view, because he's the bad guy, but certainly Shav Ruakere (Roimata Samuels) and Ben Mitchell (TK Samuels) needed to treat the fallout with respect for people who have been through it." [...] —Edward on the sexual assault storyline. Behind the scenes, Zac was always intended to be the perpetrator but the assailant was depicted anonymously so as to create suspense. To further the illusion that it was not Zac, directors shot the assault scene with Chris Tempest (Josh Gallagher) actually physically carrying it out, whilst Sam Bunkall (Boyd Rolleston) added the voice over. The trick successfully fooled much of the audience, with many believing it was in fact Beulah Koale's (Jared Afeaki) voice. Edward found not actually playing the assault made his work a lot easier, [...] "I guess {{in a lot of ways}} that was good because the way I reasoned with Zac is the compartmentalize. He's got the amazing ability to put something in a box and put something else in another box and keep the two entirely separate. So having no memory of it and feeling totally innocent of the performance of it, kind of helped in lots of ways." [...] On screen Zac was interviewed by police when footprints matching his boots were identified at the scene of the crime. Though Zac denied any involvement and was even backed by ex lover, Vasa Levi (Teuila Blakely). However, on 12 December 2012, Zac was revealed to the audience as the attacker when he threatened Detective Lisa Stone (Caitlin Bossley) and later removed a balaclava to expose his face.|$|R
