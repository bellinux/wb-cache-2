When Bigwig is nearly killed in a snare, the group realize that the new warren is managed by a farmer who protects and feeds the rabbits, but also harvests a number of them for their meat and skins. The residents of the new warren are simply using Hazel and the others to increase their own odds of survival. Fiver {{and the rest of the}} <b>group</b> <b>work</b> together to rescue Bigwig from a snare, then continue on their journey, along with a rabbit from the new warren called Strawberry, who asks to join them after his doe is killed in a snare.|$|E

5|$|Mt. St. Peter Parish has {{a branch}} of the Saint Vincent De Paul Society. The goal of this branch of the society, like all other branches, is to help the poor, the sick, and the suffering. Members of this <b>group</b> <b>work</b> to help people locally by {{collecting}} food and delivering it to food banks in and around New Kensington. Within the church, it is seen as a great honor {{to be part of this}} society and the members believe that the best help lies in the people they are more than in the caring acts they perform. They all work together to help others and they continually strive to become better Catholics.|$|E
25|$|The 1950s would {{usher in}} even greater {{affiliation}} of <b>group</b> <b>work</b> with {{the profession of}} social work (Alissi, 1980; Andrews, 2001). The merger of the AAGW with six other organizations to form the National Association of Social Work (NASW) in 1955 solidified the identification and integration of social <b>group</b> <b>work</b> with {{the social work profession}} (Alissi, 1980; Andrews, 2001). The impact of the merger was reflected in efforts at definitional shifts regarding <b>group</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|Social <b>group</b> <b>work</b> {{and group}} {{psychotherapy}} have primarily developed along parallel paths. Where {{the roots of}} contemporary group psychotherapy are often traced to the group education classes of tuberculosis patients conducted by Joseph Pratt in 1906, the exact birth of social <b>group</b> <b>work</b> {{can not be easily}} identified (Kaiser, 1958; Schleidlinger, 2000; Wilson, 1976). Social <b>group</b> <b>work</b> approaches are rooted in the group activities of various social agencies that arose {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century. Social upheaval and new found demands as a result of post Civil War industrialization, migration and immigration created many individual and societal needs (Brown, 1991; Kaiser, 1958; Middleman, 1968; Reid, 1991; Schwartz, 1977; Wilson, 1976). Some of these needs were met through <b>group</b> <b>work</b> endeavors found in settlement houses as well as religious and charity organizations (Middleman, 1968; Wilson, 1976). Additionally <b>group</b> <b>work</b> could be found in the progressive education movement (Dewey, 1910), the play and recreation movement (Boyd, 1935), informal education, camping and youth service organizations invested in 'character building' (Alissi, 1980; Schwartz, 1977; Williamson, 1929; Wilson, 1976).|$|E

25|$|The {{period of}} time between the 1930s and the 1950s was one of growth and {{expansion}} for social <b>group</b> <b>work</b> (Alissi, 1980; Wilson, 1976). The economic despair of and varied psychosocial needs resultant of the Great Depression {{paved the way for}} greater affiliation between the social work profession and the field of <b>group</b> <b>work</b> (Alissi, 1980; Konopka, 1983; Wilson, 1976). The psychological needs of returning war veterans who served in World War II resulted in the more frequent application of social <b>group</b> <b>work</b> in psychiatric treatment (Konopka, 1983). During this {{period of time}} not only would the field of social <b>group</b> <b>work</b> debut at the National Conference for Social Work but additional advances would be made. Academic courses and research institutions were established; a professional organization was formed, The American Association of Social Work with Groups (AAGW); and a journal, The Group, was established. The first textbooks would appear as well, written by Harleigh Trecker (1948) and Gertrude Wilson and Gladys Ryland (1949).|$|E

25|$|The 1960s and the 1970s saw the {{expansion}} of the social welfare state; the Vietnam War; the emergence of the war on poverty; the Woman's Rights Movement; the Black Power Movement; and the Lesbian and Gay Rights Movement (Balgopal & Vassil, 1983; Somers, 1976). The above social, intellectual and cultural factors influenced the social work profession including social <b>group</b> <b>work</b> (Balgopal & Vassil, 1983; Somers, 1976). With such a wide range of social and therapeutic needs there seemed to be an even greater appreciation of <b>group</b> <b>work</b> (Balgopal & Vassil, 1983; Hartford, 1964; Somers, 1976). Having expanded into differing practice settings, the purposes and goals of <b>group</b> <b>work</b> had been more broadly described at this juncture than in previous decades.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary <b>group</b> <b>work</b> {{practice}} {{continues to}} be informed {{by the work of}} early pioneers and the vanguards of the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to the Mutual Aid Model of social work with groups, the Cognitive-Behavioral <b>Group</b> <b>Work</b> Model is recognized as influential on contemporary <b>group</b> <b>work</b> practice (Rose, 2004). The approach suggested by Rose (1989, 2004) integrates cognitive and behavioral interventions with small group strategies. While primacy is not placed on establishing the group as a mutual aid system in quite the same way as with the Mutual Aid Model, Rose (2004) suggests the worker promote group discussion and member interaction. Furthermore, drawing upon Yalom's Therapeutic Factor construct Rose (2004) points out the benefits of universality, altruism, and group cohesion as well as mutual reinforcement, factors which are conceptually resonant with mutual aid.|$|E

25|$|Willem Nyland (1890-1975) was a Dutch-American chemist {{who first}} met Gurdjieff early in 1924 during the latter's {{first visit to}} the US. He was a charter member of the NY branch of Gurdjieff's Institute, participated in Orage's {{meetings}} between 1924 and 1931 and was a charter member of the Gurdjieff Foundation from 1953 and through its formative years. In the early 1960s he established an independent group in Warwick NY, where he began making reel-to-reel audio recordings of his meetings which became archived in a private library of some 2600, 90 minute audio tapes.

25|$|As Clara Kaiser (1958) has {{indicated}} {{there have been}} numerous philosophical and theoretical influences on the development of social <b>group</b> <b>work.</b> Chief amongst these influences are the ethics of Judeo-Christian religions; the settlement house movement's charitable and humanitarian efforts; theories eminent in progressive education, especially those of John Dewey (1910); sociological theories {{about the nature of the}} relationship between man and society, i.e. Mead (1934); the democratic ethic articulated by early social philosophers; the psychoanalytic theories of Rank and Freud; the practice wisdom, theory building, educational and research efforts of early social group workers (Alissi, 1980; Kaiser, 1958; Wilson, 1976). Early theoretical, research and practice efforts of Grace Coyle (1930, 1935, 1937, 1947, 1948), Wilber Newstetter (1935), and Neva Boyd (1935) paved the way for the advancement and development of social <b>group</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

40|$|Cloud {{storage is}} a model of {{networked}} online storage to support asynchronous resource storing for various platforms such as desktops, smartphones and laptops.
