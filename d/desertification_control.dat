The occurrence of aeolian desertification has traditionally been attributed to increases in wind speed and temperature and decreases in rainfall. In this study, by integrating the aeolian desertification monitoring data and climate and vegetation indices, we found that although aeolian desertification is influenced by complex climate patterns and human activities, increases in rainfall and temperature and decreases in wind speed may not be the key factors of aeolian <b>desertification</b> <b>controls</b> in some regions of China.

Firstly, there is no guarantee of ecological compensation system in <b>desertification</b> <b>control.</b> On the basis of knowing land desertification connotation, the western region is taken as an example to analyze the serious consequence brought by land desertification, besides, the connotation and importance of ecological compensation are summarized, as well as the views related to resolve the benefit compensation of ecological environment in the world are introduced. The ecological compensation is mainly based on the compensation theory of public goods and the value theory of ecological environment, besides, it emphasizes using tax to realize internalization of resources external benefit. Secondly, lack of current ecological compensation system caused the low enthusiasm of people to take part in land <b>desertification</b> <b>control,</b> besides; the current relevant regulations of ecological benefit compensation in China are introduced. At present, the systematic and complete management method and relevant regulations related to ecological compensation of land <b>desertification</b> <b>control</b> have not been published yet, so the interest of governing subject is hard to be protected and the enthusiasm of controlling land desertification in forest and farm is seriously damaged. Based on this view, it is proposed that the <b>desertification</b> <b>control</b> should closely be combined with local economic development to construct the long-term mechanism for mutually promoting <b>desertification</b> <b>control</b> and economic development.

Karst rocky desertification is found in humid areas in southwest China, the region most seriously affected by rocky desertification in the world. In order to promote ecological restoration and help peasants out of poverty, the Chinese government carried out the first phase of a rocky <b>desertification</b> <b>control</b> project from 2006 to 2015, which initially contained the expansion of rocky desertification.

40|$|China {{is one of}} many {{countries}} that suffer from desertification. Given the large scale of the problem and insufficient national funding, combating desertification remains an arduous task. Even with a long-standing governmental commitment and numerous successful model projects, land desertification in China has become worse and turned into a major impediment to the economic development in desertified regions. In China, the most serious problem of desertification {{is to be found in}} the agro-pastoral transitional zone in northern China and in the oases along inland rivers or in the lower reaches of inland rivers in northwestern China’s arid zone. There are three root causes leading to desertification in China: vulnerable eco-environment, high population pressure, and backward techniques and extensive management. Based on the analysis of the causes of desertification, the author suggests that in China the close combination of prevention, rehabilitation, and exploitation are the basic principle for bringing <b>desertification</b> under effective <b>control</b> and realizing sustainable development of society, economy, and environment over all desertified regions...|$|R

40|$|Sandy {{desertification}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe ecological problems in the world. Essentially, it is land degradation caused by discordance in the Social-Ecological Systems (SES). The ability to coordinate SES is a principal characteristic of regional sustainable development and a key factor in <b>desertification</b> <b>control.</b> This paper directly and comprehensively evaluates the ability to coordinate SES in the desertification reversal process. Assessment indicators and standards for SES have been established using statistical data and materials from government agencies. We applied a coordinated development model based on Identical-Discrepancy-Contrary (IDC) situational ranking of a Set Pair Analysis (SPA) to analyze the change in Yanchi County’s coordination ability since it implemented the grazing prohibition policy. The results indicated that Yanchi County was basically in the secondary grade of the national sustainable development level, and the subsystems’ development trend was relatively stable. Coordinate ability increased from 0. 686 in 2003 to 0. 957 in 2014 and experienced “weak coordination to basic coordination to high coordination” development processes. We concluded that drought, the grazing prohibition dilemma and the ecological footprint were key factors impeding the coordination of SES development in this area.

40|$|Arid and {{semi-arid}} {{areas in}} North China {{are facing the}} challenge of a rising aeolian desertification risk (ADR) due to the intertwined effects of complex natural processes and intensified anthropogenic activities. An accurate quantitative assessment {{of the relationship between}} ADR and its determinants is beneficial for understanding the driving mechanisms of aeolian <b>desertification</b> and for <b>controlling</b> future <b>desertification.</b> Previous studies have failed to quantify the relative role of determinants driving ADR and have been limited in assessing their interactive impacts.

40|$|Background: Biological soil crusts {{are common}} {{components}} of desert ecosystem; they cover ground surface {{and interact with}} topsoil that contribute to <b>desertification</b> <b>control</b> and degraded land restoration in arid and semiarid regions. Methodology/Principal Findings: To distinguish the changes in topsoil affected by biological soil crusts, we compared topsoil properties across three types of successional biological soil crusts (algae, lichens, and mosses crust), {{as well as the}} referenced sandland in the Mu Us Desert, Northern China. Relationships between fractal dimensions of soil particle size distribution and selected soil properties were discussed as well. The results indicated that biological soil crusts had significant positive effects on soil physical structure (P, 0. 05); and soil organic carbon and nutrients showed an upward trend across the successional stages of biological soil crusts. Fractal dimensions ranged from 2. 1477 to 2. 3032, and significantly linear correlated with selected soil properties (R 2 = 0. 494, 0. 955, P, 0. 01). Conclusions/Significance: Biological soil crusts cause an important increase in soil fertility, and are beneficial to sand fixation, although the process is rather slow. Fractal dimension proves to be a sensitive and useful index for quantifying changes in soil properties that additionally implies desertification.

40|$|The {{focus of}} most {{national}} forestry development agencies is more on projects oriented towards direct {{improvement in the}} welfare of the rural poor instead of commercial and forestry industry development. Regarding the deterioration of the natural resources, the Government of Sudan authorities gave permission and licenses to a many NGOs projects to enhance tree planting and integrating it with the programs of rural development. The post project evaluation of these projects revealed that the level of participation of local communities is far lagging behind ambitions and expectations. Moreover, most of the activities adopted by the local people during projects intervention failed to sustain. Gezira East Locality is (Gezira State) was selected for this research. The broad objective of this research is to investigate the contribution of the NGOs projects to the sustainable livelihood of local communities and the conservation and rehabilitation of natural resources in the study area, particularly forests resources. In this study, two types of data were used to collect the necessary information, namely; primary and secondary data. The main findings of the this study are; the activities of all the NGOs worked in the study area focused on <b>desertification</b> encouragement <b>control</b> and afforestation programs coupled with rural development. The NGOs were able to recruit the local people in the projects' activities through addressing the agenda of incentives and subsidies. Accordingly, the vegetation cover during the NGOs interventions showed significant increase in the stocking density. Several factors contributed to the deterioration of the vegetation cover after the phase-out of the NGOs projects represented in the poverty level of the study area which hold the local people to rely intensively on forest products for source of income and different uses. Moreover, the lack of the extension units after the withdrawal of the projects restricted the genuine participation of the local people. In addition, climate change and variability contributed to the failure of the afforestation and reforestation programs. The main conclusions of this research are; the local people appreciate the role of NGOs in rehabilitation of the vegetation cover in collaboration with local communities through applying incentives. Extensionists become reluctant, after projects phase-out, to pursue their activities because the infrastructure introduced by the NGOs for the extension units were diverted to other departments. The study recommended that the FNC should strengthen the extension services after the phase-out of the NGOs project to guarantee the sustainability of the adopted activities. ‫...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} carbon {{management program}} to sequester excess CO{sub 2 } includes the maximization {{of the carbon}} sink potential of the terrestrial ecosystem. The establishment of sustainable vegetation on semi-arid or damaged land is necessary to increase the carbon inventory in the terrestrial ecosystem, as it is increasing {{the depth of the}} soil carbon sink. The availability of water for sustained growth at acceptable costs, when or where precipitation is too scarce or unpredictable, may, however, significantly affect the cost and sustainability of the revegetation efforts. We tested an innovative technology that enables the establishment of 'plantations' that are independent of erratic water supplies or irrigation by developing deep root systems that tap into deeper groundwater. Applied Natural Sciences (ANS) patented technologies (TreeMediation{reg_sign} and TreeWell{reg_sign} systems) overcome soil conditions unfavorable to deep rooting and 'engineer' the growth of phreatophytic tree roots into soil to reliably reach the groundwater. Carbon sinks can then be increased by increasing rooting depths and especially by enabling vegetative growth altogether. We collected soil cores from three phytoremediation sites where these technologies have been previously deployed. From these, we developed detailed information on root density and soil conditions at increasing depths to estimate C gains. The largest C gains were found when these technologies are used to <b>control</b> <b>desertification.</b> In these cases, significant gross C gains (at least between 4 and 6 tons/ha per year) can be envisioned.
