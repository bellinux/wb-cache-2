An increasing number of reports have shown that nano-hydroxyapatite shares characteristics with the natural building blocks of enamel having the potential, due to its particle size, to occlude exposed dentinal tubules helping to reduce hypersensitivity and enhancing teeth remineralization.For this reason, the number of toothpastes and mouthwashes that already incorporate nano-hydroxyapatite as a <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> is increasing.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{in vitro}} the {{efficacy}} of five resin-based <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> at reducing human dentin permeability and to compare their cytotoxicity. The tested hypothesis was that their different curing techniques cause variations in efficiency and cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dentin slices (0. 5 +/- 0. 05 mm thick) were prepared from human third molars (10 per group) and their hydraulic conductance was recorded before and after application {{of one of the}} <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> with a Flodec device. Six <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> were studied: one light curing agent (Seal and Protect); one self-curing agent (Pain Free); the resin-based agents without any polymerization initiator (Health-Dent, Gluma Desensitizer, Isodan); one oxalate-based agent served as a control (Protect). A MTT assay on L 929 fibroblasts was performed to measure the cytotoxicity of the six <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> applied onto additional dentin slices (10 per group). RESULTS: All the <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> resulted in a large decrease in dentin permeability. The best results were obtained with Gluma Desensitizer, Isodan, Pain Free and Protect. A statistically significant difference was found among the materials (P = 0. 001). All the materials were non-cytotoxic. Cell viability ranged from 88 % for Seal and Protect to 100 % for Isodan.

50|$|Capsaicin (fig. 2), a {{naturally}} occurring vanilloid, {{is the best}} known TRPV1 agonist. Resiniferatoxin (RTX) is another naturally occurring vanilloid that exhibits TRPV1 agonistic activity. It is more potent than capsaicin and is currently in development as a sensory neuron <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agent.</b> Initially, agonists were the major focus of the TRPV1 ligand development due to the analgesic effect resulting from desensitization of the receptor. However, because of an initial burning effect of all natural vanilloid receptor agonists, including capsaicin, therapy becomes complicated and perhaps ineffective. Attempts to make synthetic agonists with good separation between excitatory effects and the analgesic effects have not been successful. To avoid this persisting side effects of TRPV1 agonists, a focused consideration {{has been given to}} competitive antagonists as novel analgesic drugs.|$|E
5000|$|Early in its history, it was {{discovered}} that liquid nitroglycerin can be [...] "desensitized" [...] by cooling it to about 5 to 10 C.

It is possible to chemically [...] "desensitize" [...] nitroglycerin to a point where it can be considered approximately as [...] "safe" [...] as modern high explosives, such as by the addition of approximately 10% to 30% ethanol, acetone, or dinitrotoluene.

METHODS: One hundred bovine incisors were selected and randomly divided into five groups (n = 20) : Group 1, control group (without bleaching); Group 2, bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide; Group 3, bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide (three applications, 15 minutes each) and <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> applied for 10 minutes; Group 4, bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide for 40 minutes; Group 5, bleached with 35 % hydrogen peroxide for 40 minutes with <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> applied for 10 minutes. Brackets were bonded 7 days after bleaching and submitted to shear bond strength test after 24 hours at a compression rate of 1 mm/minute. After fracture, the adhesive remnant index (ARI) was assessed under stereoscopic at 40 x magnification. Shear strength data (MPa) were submitted to one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test with significance level set at 5 %. RESULTS: Group 5 (29. 33 MPa) showed significantly higher bond strength than Group 1 (19. 19 MPa), Group 2 (20. 59 MPa) and Group 4 (23. 25 MPa), but with no difference in comparison to Group 3.

40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} effects of {{application}} of an oxalic acid based <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> before restoration of noncarious cervical lesions (NCCLs) with either a silorane-based or a methacrylate-based composite resin on decreasing the absolute risk and intensity of dentin hypersensitivity {{over the course of}} a 1 -year follow-up. Methods: NCCLs in 31 patients (age range 24 - 66 years) were selected and randomly divided into four groups (n = 31 in all groups). In the Z 250 and P 90 groups, the restorations were performed with a methacrylate-based composite resin (Filtek Z 250) and a silorane-based composite resin (Silorane P 90), respectively. In the Z 250 + OA and P 90 + OA groups, the same composite resins were used, but an oxalic acid based <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> (Desenssiv, SSWhite) was first applied. All NCCLs were evaluated before restoration (BR) and at 30, 60, 90, 180, and 360 days after treatment. Teeth sensitivity to evaporative and tactile stimuli was measured by a visual analog scale (VAS). The results were analyzed with statistical tools including Wilcoxon and Friedman tests for within-group comparisons and ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests for between-group comparisons (P<. 05). Results: Reduction in dentin hypersensitivity was observed for all treatment groups; however, these reductions were more pronounced when oxalic acid was applied before restoring the NCCL (P<. 001). Complete elimination of pain was not achieved by any treatment modalities for the first 6 months; afterwards, in the groups that had received application of the oxalate-based <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agent,</b> the absolute risk of dentin hypersensitivity was significantly reduced (P <. 01). Conclusion: The restoration of sensitive NCCLs with composite resins reduces dentin hypersensitivity.

Material and Methods GLUMA Desensitizer PowerGel (GLU) contains glutaraldehyde (GA) and 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and Teethmate Desensitizer (TD) is a powder comprising tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) and dicalcium phosphate anhydrous (DCPA) that is mixed with water. Deionized water was used as a negative control (CTR). Thirty discs with a thickness of 1. 2 mm were cut from the coronal dentin of the third molars and cleaned with 0. 5 M EDTA (pH 7. 4). After being mounted in a split-chamber device, the discs were pressurized with water at 1 kPa and 3 kPa in order to measure flow rates with a highly sensitive micro-flow sensor and to calculate hydraulic conductance as a baseline value (BL). Following the application of GLU, TD, and CTR (n= 10), hydraulic conductance was remeasured with intermittent storage in water after 15 min, 1 d, 1 w, and 1 m. Reduction in permeability (PR%) was calculated from hydraulic conductance. Data were statistically analyzed using nonparametric methods (&# 945;< 0. 05). Representative discs were inspected by SEM. Results PR% for GLU and TD were 30 - 50 % 15 min and 1 m after their application. Post hoc tests indicated that PR% of CTR was significantly greater than those of GLU and TD at all time points tested. The PR% of GLU and TD were not significantly different. SEM examinations showed noncollapsed collagen meshes at the tubular entrances after GLU, and crystalline precipitates occluding the tubular orifices after TD, whereas CTR specimens showed typical patterns of etched dentin.

All specimens were subjected to thermocycling between 8 ° and 55 °C for 500 cycles in water baths, placed in a solution of 0. 5...|$|E
30|$|Gluma Comfort Bond also {{presents}} functional (adhesion promoter), hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers. They are 4 -META, HEMA and methacrylic-oligo-acrylic acid, respectively. This adhesive contains ethanol as the organic solvent and glutaraldehyde as a <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agent.</b> Glutaraldehyde {{is also a}} cross-linker agent, which is able to improve the mechanical properties of collagen fibrils and their resistance against degradation, increasing the longevity of bonding, as observed in this study [15, 16]. No bond strength reduction was observed for Gluma Comfort Bond. The hybrid layer was thin {{when compared to other}} products and no change was noted for interfacial micromorphology after 1  year in water.|$|E
40|$|Dentin {{hypersensitivity}} is {{a common}} patient complaint that is more prevalent than the profession realizes. It is important for dentists to diagnose dentin hypersensitivity by exclusion and provide appropriate treatment recommendations for patients. Various treatment methods have been proposed but no universally accepted <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> or treatment has been identified. When a patient has symptoms that {{can be attributed to}} dentin hypersensitivity, a thorough clinical examination should be carried out to rule out other likely causes prior to diagnosis and treatment. Depending on the identified cause, a combination of individualized instructions on proper oral health behaviors, use of at-home products, and professional treatment may be required to manage the problem. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Dentin {{hypersensitivity}} (DH) is {{a relatively}} common painful condition among dental problems. Although many studies have been performed regarding the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} DH, dental practitioners are still confused about the definite diagnosis and treatment. The use of lasers as a treatment for dentin hypersensitivity was first introduced in 1985. Laser treatment in dentin hypersensitivity is an interesting and controversial issue and many investigations have been done on its mechanism of action, advantages, and unclear points. The present literature review tries to go over the definition, diagnosis, etiology, predisposing factors, various laser types in the treatment of DH alone or in combination with topical <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agents.</b> Since a certain treatment has not yet introduced for dentin hypersensitivity, a combination of laser therapy and topical desensitizing factors, can increase the success of the treatment compared with either treatments alone. </p...|$|R
50|$|Cosmetic or {{functional}} intervention may {{be required}} if tooth surface loss is pathological or {{if there has been}} advanced loss of tooth structure. The first stage of treatment involves managing any associated conditions, such as fractured teeth or sharp cusps or incisal edges. These can be resolved by restoring and polishing sharp cusps. Then, <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> such as topical fluoride varnishes can be applied, and at home desensitising toothpastes recommended. Many restorative options have been proposed, such as direct composite restorations, bonded cast metal restorations, removable partial dentures, orthodontic treatment, crown lengthening procedures and protective splints. The decision to restore the dentition depends on the wants and needs of the patient, the severity of tooth surface loss and whether tooth surface loss is active. The use of adhesive materials to replace lost tooth structure can be performed as a conservative and cost-effective approach before a more permanent solution of crowns or veneers is considered.|$|R
40|$|Dentinal {{hypersensitivity}} (DH) is {{a common}} clinical condition usually associated with exposed dentinal surfaces. It can affect patients of any age group and most commonly affects the canines and premolars of both the arches. This article concisely reviews the patho-physiology, mechanism and clinical management of the DH. Treatment of DH should start with an accurate diagnosis. Differential diagnosis should be made and all other probable causes should be excluded. An often neglected phase of clinical management of DH is the identification and treatment of the causative factors of DH. By removing the etiological factors, the condition can be even prevented from occurring or recurring. There are various treatment modalities available {{which can be used}} at home or may be professionally applied. The "at home" <b>desensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> include toothpastes, mouthwashes or chewing gums and they act by either occluding the dentinal tubules or blocking the neural transmission. This article also discusses the recent treatment options like bioglass, Portland cement, lasers and casein phosphopeptide...|$|R
