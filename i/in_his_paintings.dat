5|$|The Italian painter Paolo Uccello (1397–1475) {{was fascinated}} by perspective, as shown <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> of The Battle of San Romano (c. 1435–1460): broken lances lie {{conveniently}} along perspective lines.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{used the}} Impressionist concept of broken color to give light to a work, innovatively drawing in color, giving the {{painting}} light and form, as {{he also did}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> of plowed fields, mountains, rocks, and heads and figures. The series is unified by a more refined approach, without the thick application of paint {{to which he was}} more accustomed.|$|E
5|$|Colt was {{the first}} American {{manufacturer}} to use art as a marketing tool when he hired Catlin to prominently display Colt firearms <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings.</b> He was awarded numerous government contracts after making gifts of his highly embellished and engraved revolvers with exotic grips such as ivory or pearl to government officials. On a trip to Constantinople he gave a custom-engraved and gold inlaid revolver to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdülmecid I, informing him that the Russians were buying his pistols, thus securing a Turkish order for 5,000 pistols; he neglected to tell the Sultan he had used the same tactic with the Russians to elicit an order.|$|E
50|$|While not {{employed}} <b>in</b> all <b>his</b> <b>paintings,</b> <b>his</b> trademarks {{were flying}} or floating fish, often on a leash.|$|R
50|$|Lisieweski died <b>in</b> Berlin. <b>His</b> <b>paintings</b> were {{appreciated}} by contemporary artists like Joachim Martin Falbe (1709-1782).|$|R
25|$|Warhol had {{assistance}} <b>in</b> producing <b>his</b> <b>paintings.</b> This is {{also true}} of his film-making and commercial enterprises.|$|R
5|$|In 1908, Jolin and Isaac Grünewald left Sweden for {{the vibrant}} life in Paris and its art community. The Swedish painter, graphic artist and {{forester}} Carl Palme knew Henri Matisse {{and helped the}} artist to find a suitable location for the new Matisse Academy. An abandoned nunnery in central Paris became the first home for the academy. Together with Grünewald and Leander Engström, Jolin joined the Matisse Academy, where their friends from Stockholm had already been accepted as pupils. At the Academy, Jolin would develop his sense for a stylish line in combination with bright and clean colours <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} bottom right corner, two Polish Jews are {{on the edge of}} the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> in negative roles.|$|E
5|$|In this work, Eakins took {{advantage}} of {{an exception to the}} generally prudish Victorian attitude to nudity: swimming naked was widely accepted, and for males was seen as normal, even in public spaces. Eakins was the first American artist to portray one of the few occasions in 19th-century life when nudity was on display. The Swimming Hole develops themes raised in his earlier work, in particular his treatment of buttocks and his ambiguous treatment of the human form; in some cases it is uncertain as to whether the forms portrayed are male or female. Such themes had earlier been examined in his The Gross Clinic (1875) and William Rush (1877), and would continue to be explored <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> of boxers (Taking the Count, Salutat, and Between Rounds) and wrestlers (Wrestlers).|$|E
50|$|Indermaur {{became a}} {{freelance}} artist <b>in</b> 1969. <b>His</b> <b>paintings</b> began to garner significant {{attention in the}} mid-1970s.|$|R

50|$|Thomas Bigelow Craig (1849-1924) was an American {{landscape}} painter from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He {{is known}} for <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> depicting cows (and occasionally sheep) in summer environments. Craig's landscapes often featured meadows and streams. The animals <b>in</b> <b>his</b> earlier <b>paintings</b> did not take up {{a large part of}} the canvas compared to the surrounding landscapes; <b>in</b> <b>his</b> later <b>paintings,</b> however, the animals were drawn larger and became more important than the landscapes around them.|$|R
5|$|Jarrell's career {{took him}} to Africa in 1977, where he found {{inspiration}} in the Senufo people of Ivory Coast, Mali and Burkina Faso. Upon return to the United States he moved to Georgia and taught at the University of Georgia. In Georgia, he began to use a bricklayer's trowel on his canvases, creating a textured appearance within his already visually active paintings. The figures often seen <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> are abstract and inspired by the masks and sculptures of Nigeria. These Nigerian arts have also inspired Jarrell's totem sculptures. Living and working in Cleveland, Jarrell continues to explore the contemporary African American experience through his paintings, sculptures, and prints. His work {{is found in the}} collections of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, High Museum of Art, The Studio Museum in Harlem and the University of Delaware.|$|E
5|$|Two so {{dissimilar}} {{painters and}} tempers as Einar Jolin and GAN were both called Expressionists. During {{most of the}} 1910s this term was used {{in a number of}} contexts in Sweden. In 1915, the Herwarth Walden gallery Der Sturm in Berlin, a venue for Expressionists, presented an exhibition, Schwedishe Expressionisten (Swedish Expressionism), with works by Swedish artists. Jolin participated with six paintings, three of these were vistas from Stockholm. The rest of the participants were Isaac Grunewald, Edward Hald, GAN and Sigrid Hjertén. In the autumn of 1915, Jolin and GAN held a joint exhibition in Lund University's art museum. Despite their differences, their friendship continued during GAN's years in Stockholm (1916–1919). Jolin was tired of Isaac Grünewalds increasingly dominant role among the young Swedish artists at that time, a sentiment shared by GAN. Expressionism never became a dominant style for Jolin, not in the way GAN {{and other members of the}} group embraced it. GAN always objected to Jolin's choice to include colors such as pearl gray and light purple or violet <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Van Meegeren {{felt that}} his genius had been misjudged, {{and he set}} out to prove to the art critics that he could not only copy the style of the Dutch masters <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings,</b> but produce a work of art so {{magnificent}} that it would rival the works of master painters. He moved with Jo to the South of France and began preparations for this ultimate forgery, which took him six years, from 1932 to 1937. In a series of early exercises, he forged works by Frans Hals, Pieter de Hooch, Gerard ter Borch, and Johannes Vermeer. Finally, he chose to forge a painting by Vermeer as his masterpiece. Vermeer had not been particularly well-known until {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century; his works were both extremely valuable and scarce — only about 35 had survived.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 2011, <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> {{became the}} center of a legal {{entanglement}} between his sole heir and a Massachusetts museum.|$|R
5000|$|Taverner never {{publicly}} exhibited {{his work}} {{and it is possible}} that, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lifetime, <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> circulated only amongst friends and fellow amateurs. His work was, however, highly regarded by George Vertue who described his [...] "wonderful genius".|$|R
50|$|Came to {{painting}} <b>in</b> 1953; <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> and drawings are exhibited {{on several occasions}} in Artignosc-sur-Verdon and Draguignan between 1955 and 1957.|$|R
25|$|American Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock {{underwent}} Jungian psychotherapy in 1939 with Joseph Henderson. His therapist {{made the}} decision to engage him through his art, and had Pollock make drawings, which led to the appearance of many Jungian concepts <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings.</b>|$|E
25|$|L'atelier Cézanne, {{the former}} studio of Paul Cézanne, now a museum, {{located in the}} {{northern}} outskirts of Aix. It has been preserved as {{it was at the}} time of the painter's death and contains many of his personal items and props used <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gecan's most {{important}} works were {{produced in the}} 1920s and 1930s. By 1921 the beginnings of expressionism were evident <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> and drawings. Miroslav Kraljević's legacy shows in the Klinik (Clinic) cycle, where cubism combined with realism and intense colour. His later work tended to be calmer, with less tension, more art deco stylization.|$|E
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> recent <b>paintings</b> he {{has used}} lighter colours, and the figures are less numerous.|$|R

25|$|My father {{leaves behind}} {{a legacy of}} great {{performances}} in movies and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> and assemblages.

He will be greatly missed.|$|E
25|$|Early {{works were}} {{composed}} using simple schema such as flags, maps, targets, letters and numbers. Johns' {{treatment of the}} surface is often lush and painterly; he is famous for incorporating such media as encaustic and plaster relief <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings.</b> Johns played with and presented opposites, contradictions, paradoxes, and ironies, much like Marcel Duchamp (who {{was associated with the}} Dada movement). Johns also produces intaglio prints, sculptures and lithographs with similar motifs.|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} tephra in the {{atmosphere}} led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period, a feature celebrated in the paintings of J. M. W. Turner. This may {{have given rise to}} the yellow tinge predominant <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> such as Chichester Canal circa 1828. Similar phenomena were observed after the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, and on the West Coast of the United States following the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{evolution}} of Henri Beau {{as an artist}} {{can be seen in}} a photobiographic form, by looking at <b>his</b> works <b>in</b> chronological order. Beau drew inspiration from Camille Corot, Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro, which is reflected <b>in</b> <b>his</b> earlier <b>paintings</b> named Landscapes. Beau would sign <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> as [...] "HBeau", usually with the year, and sometimes with the location, they were painted. Beau's wife, Marie, is portrayed <b>in</b> many of <b>his</b> <b>paintings.</b> He also drew inspiration for <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> from <b>his</b> travels around Europe.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 1868, <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> were {{accepted}} at the Salon, but the exhibition {{did not bring}} him financial or critical success; nor did subsequent exhibitions.|$|R
50|$|Veljko Stanojević (1892-1967) was a Serbian painter. Between 1920 and 1930 {{he lived}} <b>in</b> Paris. <b>His</b> <b>paintings</b> are {{representative}} of constructivist art in Serbia.|$|R
25|$|In addition, Caillebotte {{used his}} wealth {{to fund a}} variety of hobbies {{for which he was}} quite passionate, {{including}} stamp collecting, orchid growing, yacht building, and even textile design (the women <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings</b> Madame Boissière Knitting, 1877, and Portrait of Madame Caillebotte, 1877, may be working on patterns created by Caillebotte). After his death, he was inscribed in the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists, and the collection he formed with his brother Martial is now in the British Library.|$|E
25|$|From 1938 to 1942 Pollock {{worked for}} the WPA Federal Art Project. During this time Pollock was {{trying to deal with}} his {{established}} alcoholism, from 1938 through 1941 Pollock underwent Jungian psychotherapy with Dr. Joseph Henderson and later with Dr. Violet Staub de Laszlo in 1941–42. Henderson engaged him through his art, encouraging Pollock to make drawings. Jungian concepts and archetypes were expressed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings.</b> Some historians have hypothesized that Pollock might have had bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the older}} artists whose work stimulated Leonardo's {{scientific}} interest was Piero della Francesca, then {{a man in}} his 60s, {{who was one of the}} earliest artists to systematically employ linear perspective <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>paintings,</b> and who had a greater understanding of the science of light than any other artist of his date. While Leonardo's teacher, Verrocchio, largely ignored Piero's scientifically disciplined approach to painting, Leonardo and Domenico Ghirlandaio, who also worked at Verrocchio's workshop, did not. Two of Leonardo's earliest paintings, both scenes of the Annunciation show his competent understanding of the linear perspective.|$|E
50|$|Working {{frequently}} <b>in</b> architecture, <b>his</b> <b>paintings,</b> stained glass, mosaic and tapestry works can {{be found}} in architectural settings and private and public collections internationally.|$|R
