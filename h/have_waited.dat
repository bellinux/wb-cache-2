In September 2011, the UN stated that Israel used excessive force and boarded the flotilla when it was far away from the blockade zone.|$|E

25|$|Another {{account of}} this story was {{published}} in 1929. In this account the Marlborough was found adrift in January 1899 by the ship British Isles under Captain Hadrop. The British Isles was purportedly sailing from Lyttleton to England. She was a little north of Cape Horn by Staten Island when the Marlborough was sighted and boarded. This story was discounted {{because there were no}} reports of the British Isles visiting Lyttleton in the time period, and it was improbable that Hadrop would <b>have</b> <b>waited</b> so many years to report the sighting.|$|E

Approximately five hours later, at 13.30pm the Chief lighthouse keeper at Mizen Head on the south west coast of Cork Ireland saw the monoplane over the village of Crookhaven, on the great circle course for Newfoundland.

25|$|They {{reached the}} plate final of the 1994 ICC Trophy, {{but did not}} play the match as they had already booked a flight home, not expecting to qualify.

25|$|On 20 February 1996, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals {{rejected}} {{a plea for}} clemency submitted by Bonin's attorneys {{on the grounds of}} inadequate legal representation at both his trials. Scarcely one hour prior to his scheduled execution, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Bonin's final plea to overturn his death sentence, with the convened panel in almost unanimous agreement that Bonin's own attorneys had not failed to give their client adequate legal representation by not earlier discovering their submitted claims to have discovered evidence attesting to Bonin's innocence. Furthermore, these appellate judges ruled that Bonin's attorneys should not <b>have</b> <b>waited</b> until the last minute to submit arguments to overturn or postpone the impending death sentence of their client. These convened judges also rejected Bonin's final claim that he had a right to choose between the gas chamber or lethal injection as his actual method of execution.|$|E

25|$|Mexico's {{inability}} to obtain better results in locating children and taking parents is particularly troubling. Many Convention return applications forwarded by the U.S. Central Authority have languished for years; when children and taking {{parents are not}} located, Mexican courts will not rule on the application. As a result, and despite persistent efforts by the U.S. Central Authority to prompt Mexican authorities to address these cases, numerous parents <b>have</b> <b>waited</b> for years with no contact or information about the whereabouts of their children. Of the return applications submitted to the Mexican Central Authority that remained unresolved after eighteen months or longer, approximately half remain in limbo because Mexican authorities have not located the children. As a practical matter, the left-behind parent or someone working on his/her behalf must develop most leads pertaining to the possible location of abducted children {{without the help of}} Mexican authorities. In some cases, Mexican authorities profess an {{inability to}} find children even when the family or the U.S. Embassy has shared concrete information with the Mexican Central Authority on the child's whereabouts.|$|E
25|$|Most episcopal {{conferences}} set {{the first}} Sunday in Advent (27 November) 2011 as the date {{when the new}} translation would come into use. However, the Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference (Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland) put into effect {{the changes in the}} people's parts of the revised English translation of the Order of Mass from 28 November 2008, when the Missal as a whole was not yet available. Protests were voiced on grounds of content and because it meant that Southern Africa was thus out of line with other English-speaking areas. One bishop claimed that the English-speaking conferences should have withstood the Holy See's insistence on a more literal translation. However, when in February 2009 the Holy See declared that the change should <b>have</b> <b>waited</b> until the whole of the Missal had been translated, the bishops' conference appealed, with the result that those parishes that had adopted the new translation of the Order of Mass were directed to continue using it, while those that had not were told to await further instructions before doing so.|$|E
25|$|A {{report by}} the Institute for Public Policy Research {{attributes}} the low employment rate to the newness of the Somali community and {{to the fact that}} most immigrants came in search of asylum rather than through labor migration channels. Research suggests that refugees in general appear to have more difficulty accessing employment than other groups. Many Somalis have had difficulty getting the qualifications that they have gained in Somalia recognised in the UK. Other main employment barriers included lack of references and prior work experience in the UK, unfamiliarity with the UK job culture, discrimination, over-reliance on word-of-mouth for job openings rather than employment centres and classifieds, and lack of fluency in the English language. The IPPR suggests that the high proportion of Somali households that are headed by a single woman may mean that childcare is an additional barrier to Somali women entering employment. Additionally, asylum seekers are also not normally allowed to work for payment while their claims are being processed, although they can request permission to work if they <b>have</b> <b>waited</b> longer than 12 months for an initial decision on their asylum claim.|$|E

All throughout after Revolutions of 1989 musicians reserved their passport but after problems with visas {{it occurred to}} the group to eventually stop their efforts. Remain active only in Poland band received cult status with thirteen albums released, several of them noted on Polish Albums Chart. Other bands like Quo Vadis, and Alastor remain active in underground to incorporate in later years to their music groove, death or progressive metal. Egzekuthor splitup in 1992 after one album, reformed in 2002 to be disbanded in 2008 before second studio effort was released. While Hunter <b>have</b> <b>waited</b> till 1995 to release first album reached acclaim in Poland with 2000s albums. Although over the years moving away from strict thrash metal style Hunter received nomination to Fryderyk, an annual award in Polish music, within several records on Polish Albums Chart have been noted, with songs to receive regular airplay. In later years several thrash metal band heave been developed while {{not one of them}} received acclaim similar to those form the 1980s. Some of them include Geisha Goner (founded in 1990), Tuff Enuff (founded in 1992), Flapjack, Myopia (both founded in 1993), Horrorscope (founded in 1996), Virgin Snatch, Alkatraz (both founded in 2001).|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{above and}} {{beyond the call of duty}} in action with the enemy near Oschersleben, Germany, on 11 January 1944. On that day Col. Howard was the leader of a group of P-51 aircraft providing support for a heavy bomber formation on a long-range mission deep in enemy territory. As Col. Howard's group met the bombers in the target area the bomber force was attacked by numerous enemy fighters. Col. Howard, with his group, at once engaged the enemy and himself destroyed a German ME. 110. As a result of this attack Col. Howard lost contact with his group, and at once returned to the level of the bomber formation. He then saw that the bombers were being heavily attacked by enemy airplanes and that no other friendly fighters were at hand. While Col. Howard could <b>have</b> <b>waited</b> to attempt to assemble his group before engaging the enemy, he chose instead to attack single-handed a formation of more than 30 German airplanes. With utter disregard for his own safety he immediately pressed home determined attacks for some 30 minutes, during which time he destroyed 3 enemy airplanes and probably destroyed and damaged others. Toward the end of this engagement 3 of his guns went out of action and his fuel supply was becoming dangerously low. Despite these handicaps and the almost insuperable odds against him, Col. Howard continued his aggressive action in an attempt to protect the bombers from the numerous fighters. His skill, courage, and intrepidity on this occasion set an example of heroism which will be an inspiration to the U.S. Armed Forces.|$|E
