40|$|Background: General {{practitioners}} play {{a crucial}} role in understanding the specific health and social issues of refugees, as they are often the first contact that refugees have with the healthcare system. Providing equitable access to healthcare services presents considerable challenges, particularly in regional areas. Methods: A purposive sample of GP supervisors and general practice registrars was selected from a regional area of southern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. General practitioners were surveyed to assess their needs and attitudes in treating refugees, and the perceived impact of refugees in practice. Results: There were significant differences between GP groups, between <b>domestic</b> <b>and</b> <b>internationally</b> trained medical graduates, and between genders in their needs and attitudes relating to refugee health. Discussion: There is a strong sense that there are benefits in dealing with refugee health. More research is needed to identify the supports and education required to be able to effectively help refugees...|$|E
30|$|Under this backdrop, Test of Oral Proficiency in English (TOPE) is {{developed}} and administered by Renmin university of China {{to assess the}} oral communicative proficiency of college students who have undertaken compulsory English courses. The design of the test {{is driven by the}} communication needs of the college students and communicative competence defined in <b>domestic</b> <b>and</b> <b>internationally</b> recognized guidelines, namely, the College English Curriculum Requirements (Ministry of Education 2007) and the Common European Framework of References (CEFR for short, Council of Europe 2001). The theoretical correspondence between the TOPE and the CEFR is realized {{in the way that the}} Common Reference Levels are referred to in order to develop the level descriptors of the rating scale;qualitative aspects of spoken language use are drawn upon to provide guidance to the content of the test, including task setting parameters, e.g., response formats (monologic and dialogic), channels of communication (aural, written, graphic, visual) and discourse modes (description, argumentation, persuasion). In this regard, students are expected to use English to deal with real-world issues. The speaking construct is defined in the degree to which students can express their ideas in both monologic and interactive ways and collaborate in the creation and sustaining of interaction. The TOPE therefore adopts both one-to-one and the paired candidate formats based not only upon pedagogical considerations, but also upon the findings of various studies of spoken language discourse. And the test comprises a multi-task design, which allows the elicitation of different patterns of spoken interaction.|$|E
40|$|Increased {{attention}} has been paid recently to the issue of the regulation of professional boundaries. In this paper, we undertake an international comparison of the regulation of health professional boundaries across the OECD countries of Canada, the U. S., the U. K. and Australia. Our case studies focus on the inter-professional boundary negotiation between medicine and nursing and the intra-professional boundary negotiation between <b>domestic</b> <b>and</b> <b>internationally</b> trained physicians. Our analysis draws upon the complementary interdisciplinary theoretical perspectives of institutional economics and the concept of professional closure from the sociology of professions. In applying these lenses to the two case studies in these four country contexts, we reveal {{that there has been a}} shift in the context of professional regulation towards a more coordinated national approach to licensure. There has also been a broad scale move towards breaking down at least the regulatory barriers to inter-professional collaboration between physicians and nurses which has included the expansion of the scope of nursing practice to take up traditionally exclusive domains of medicine. The seemingly protectionist professional regulatory policies vis-a-vis international medical graduates also seem to be breaking down primarily through government measures. Overall, there has been an increased permeability of professional boundaries both inter-professionally and intra-professionally, and market-oriented systems seem to be in a better position to overcome medical dominance than state-led ones, even though they do not change the main rules of regulation at the macro-level...|$|E

40|$|In {{transition}} {{towards a}} {{sustainable energy system}} with deep reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduced consumption of fossil fuels, substitution of fossil energy carriers with biomass {{is considered one of}} the most important options. In the last decade, fossil energy and GHG mitigation policies and volatile fossil fuel prices have driven rapid growth of modern biomass. In contrast to local, traditional biomass uses for heating and cooking in developing countries, modern biomass uses are often geographically remote from the locations that have the larger economic biomass supply potentials. This has already resulted in rapid growth of trade of solid and liquid biomass sources, especially in the European Union (EU) and will likely continue to grow in the future. The prospective growth of bioenergy and geography of trade are still highly uncertain. This thesis aims to bridge some of the knowledge gaps on the deployment of bioenergy at the national and European level by means of system analysis. A key focus of this thesis are the high variabilities of cost and GHG balances of bioenergy systems, which can both be caused by methodological choices, the locations of feedstock production, logistics, the conversion system and rate of technological learning. Bottom-up spreadsheet tools have been developed to compare the variability in energy and GHG balance of different biofuel production systems with variations in key assumptions and methods to account for co-products (Chapter 2). In Chapter 3, a bottom-up accounting tool is used in combination with the computable general equilibrium model LEITAP to assess future scenarios of avoided fossil energy and GHG emissions next to direct and indirect economic effects of bioenergy deployment for the Netherlands to 2030. Spatially explicit approaches are developed to account for the geographic implications of feedstock supply, logistics and demand. For the Southeast of the U. S., a key exporting regions of wood pellets, the potential of alternative, low-value wood fiber sources has been assessed taking into account the dispersed supply of wood fiber resources and locations of pellet production plants (Chapter 4). For long distance international transport of biomass, this thesis describes the development of the BIT-UU model that can be used to calculate the cost and GHG emissions of international biomass transportation taking into account the available infrastructure (road, rail, inland waterways, sea). This model is linked to the European renewable energy model Green-X model in Chapter 5 to assess the future role of domestic use and trade of biomass in context of renewable energy policies in the EU. Furthermore, the BIT-UU model is linked to the U. S. based Biomass Logistic Model (BLM) to assess the cost and GHG emissions of intercontinental lignocellulosic feedstock supply chains between the U. S. and Europe in Chapter 6. The developed methods, tools and linkages to (established) modeling frameworks provide insights into the role of <b>domestic</b> <b>and</b> <b>internationally</b> traded biomass in fulfilling national and European renewable energy targets, economic effects, GHG mitigation and consequences of methodological choices and input assumptions to the life-cycle GHG performance and energy balance...|$|E

I draw together comparative welfare state analysis with law and society scholarship (previously largely developed in isolation from one another) – as well as using British political cartoons as a source – to develop a revisionist historical critique of this conventional wisdom. First, the British welfare state has always been comparatively parsimonious. Second, the idea of the welfare state seems to have its origins outside the United Kingdom and this terminology was adopted relatively late and with some ambivalence in public debate and scholarly analysis. Third, a large body of socio-legal scholarship shows that robust ‘welfare rights’ were never embedded in the British ‘welfare state’...|$|R
