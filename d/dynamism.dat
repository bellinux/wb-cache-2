5|$|Coexist {{features}} a minimalist musical style with spatial arrangements, loose song structure, little <b>dynamism,</b> and experimentation with tension. Its songs are characterised by sparse {{elements such as}} simple chord progression, keyboard ostinatos, and fading motifs, while Smith's production incorporates both programmed beats and live percussion instruments. Coexist touches on themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and intimacy. The lyrics, written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim, address a failing relationship and changes in a romance with inner monologues and simple metaphors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dynamism</b> of a Dog on a Leash (Italian: Dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio), {{sometimes}} called Dog on a Leash or Leash in Motion, is a 1912 painting by Italian Futurist painter Giacomo Balla.

It is considered one of his best-known works, {{and one of the most}} important works in Futurism, though it received mixed critical reviews. The painting has been in the collection of the Albright–Knox Art Gallery since 1984.|$|E

Infrared reflectography of the underdrawings for the Last Judgment panels show letters used to denote the final colour to be applied, for example g for gelb (yellow) or w for weiss (white), and there are few deviations in the finished work. He often rearranged drapery fold lines or to denote perspective, enlarged or diminished the size of figures. The underdrawings reveal a draughtsman of skill, <b>dynamism</b> and confidence; the figures appear fully formed with little evidence of reworking. Many are extremely detailed and precisely modelled, for example St Ursula's brooch in the Altarpiece of the City Patron Saints, which contains closely detailed garlands and diadems.|$|E
5|$|Socially, {{economic}} <b>dynamism</b> {{opened up}} one of the avenues of social mobility in the Roman Empire. Social advancement was thus not dependent solely on birth, patronage, good luck, or even extraordinary ability. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, a strong tendency towards plutocracy is indicated by the wealth requirements for census rank. Prestige could be obtained through investing one's wealth in ways that advertised it appropriately: grand country estates or townhouses, durable luxury items such as jewels and silverware, public entertainments, funerary monuments for family members or coworkers, and religious dedications such as altars. Guilds (collegia) and corporations (corpora) provided support for individuals to succeed through networking, sharing sound business practices, and a willingness to work.|$|E

To assess potential {{role of the}} ERM proteins in HIV- 1 lifecycle, we examined if suppression of ERM function in human cells expressing HIV- 1 infection receptors influences HIV- 1 envelope (Env) -mediated HIV- 1 -vector transduction and cell–cell fusion. Expression of an ezrin dominant negative mutant or knockdown of ezrin, radixin, or moesin with siRNA uniformly decreased transduction titers of HIV- 1 vectors having X 4 -tropic Env. In contrast, transduction titers of R 5 -tropic Env HIV- 1 vectors were decreased only by radixin knockdown: ezrin knockdown had no detectable effects and moesin knockdown rather increased transduction titer. Each of the ERM suppressions had no detectable effects on cell surface expression of CD 4, CCR 5, and CXCR 4 or VSV-Env-mediated HIV- 1 vector transductions. Finally, the individual knockdown of ERM mRNAs uniformly decreased efficiency of cell–cell fusion mediated by X 4 - or R 5 -tropic Env and HIV- 1 infection receptors. These results suggest that (i) the ERM proteins function as positive regulators of infection by X 4 -tropic HIV- 1, (ii) moesin additionally functions as a negative regulator of R 5 -tropic HIV- 1 virus infection at the early step(s) after the membrane fusion, and (iii) receptor protein <b>dynamisms</b> are regulated differently in R 5 - and X 4 -tropic HIV- 1 infections...|$|R

5|$|Victorian {{painting}} {{had gone}} through radical changes, and by the 1870s the realism of Etty and the Pre-Raphaelites {{had given way to}} the ideas of the Aesthetic Movement, abandoning the traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Although the aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting, these works were in a very different style to Etty's. The new generation of history painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton sought to depict passivity, rather than the <b>dynamism</b> seen in previous works depicting the classical world. By the end of the 19th century, the value of all of Etty's works had fallen below their original prices. As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential Modernist movement, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration from Paul Cézanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{encouraged}} local Christian {{settlement in}} Acre, {{in order to}} contribute to the city's commercial <b>dynamism</b> in trade and manufacturing. Christians grew to become the largest religious group in the city by the late 18th century. Zahir's territory became a haven for Melkite and Greek Orthodox Christians from other parts of Ottoman Syria who migrated there for better trade and employment opportunities. In Nazareth, the Christian community prospered and grew under Zahir's rule, and saw an influx from the Maronite and Greek Orthodox communities of Lebanon and Transjordan, respectively. The Melkite patriarch lived in Acre between 1765 and 1768. Along with the Jews, the Christians contributed to the economy of Zahir's sheikhdom in a number of ways, including the relative ease with which they were able to deal with European merchants, the networks of support many of them maintained in Damascus or Istanbul, and their role in service industries.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{function}} of receptive and processing neurons is distinguished from that of neuronal circuits. The former, which are inside the circuits, collect and elaborate sensorial information to build “objects ” which are spatially and temporally well-structured and vary in intensity. These objects are the modal components of sensory systems: hot/cold, smooth/rough, green, table, sound, etc. motionless or in motion. On the other hand, perceptual and motor neuronal circuits have {{the function}} of positioning the “objects ” {{in space and time}} in an orderly way. This process of positioning, being regularly repeated in space and/or time, determines groupings and fillings which give rise to “blocks”, that is, significant constructs of objects grouped in space and/or time and then stored. These blocks are divided into maps, stored in the posterior areas of the cerebral cortex, and <b>dynamisms,</b> stored in the anterior areas of the cerebral cortex. One of the functions of <b>dynamisms</b> is selection. Positioning is fulfilled through four distinct processes: anticipation, programming, execution and verification. Maps are divided into anticipation (or modal) maps and programming (or spatio-temporal) maps. Damage to modal maps generates impairments in the identification of stimuli, associative agnosia, ideational apraxia, Wernicke’s aphasia; damage to spatiotemporal maps generates impairments in the perception of stimuli, apperceptive agnosia, ideomotor apraxia and parietal disorders related to language. Anticipation consists of two functions: 1) the unconscious pre-activation of stored data generated by consciou...|$|R

5|$|Linen was Scotland's premier {{industry}} in the 18th century and {{formed the basis for}} the later cotton, jute, and woollen industries. Scottish industrial policy was made by the Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland, which sought to build an economy complementary, not competitive, with England. Since England had woollens, this meant linen. Encouraged and subsidised by the Board of Trustees so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market. The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish linen {{industry in}} the 18th century, exporting linen to England and America. As a joint-stock company, it had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity. Renamed the British Linen Bank in 1906, it was one of Scotland's premier banks until it was bought out by the Bank of Scotland in 1969. It joined the established Scottish banks such as the Bank of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1695) and the Royal Bank of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1727). Glasgow would soon follow and Scotland had a flourishing financial system {{by the end of the}} century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7000 people, double the level in England. The banks were more lightly regulated than those in England. Historians often emphasise that the flexibility and <b>dynamism</b> of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the 19th century.|$|E
