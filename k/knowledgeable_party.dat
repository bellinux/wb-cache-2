40|$|Desktop sharing {{technologies}} have existed {{since the late}} 80 s. It is often used in scenarios where collaborative computing is beneficial to participants in the shared environment by {{the control of the}} more <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>party.</b> But the steps required in establishing a session is often cumbersome to many. Selection of a sharing method, obtaining sharing target’s network address, sharing tool’s desired ports, and firewall issues are major hurdles for a typical non-IT user. In this project, I have constructed a web-portal that helps collaborators to easily locate each other and initialize sharing sessions. The portal that I developed enables collaborated sessions to start as easily as browsing to a URL of the sharing service provider, with no need to download or follow installation instructions on either party’s end. In addition, I have added video conferencing and audio streaming capability to bring better collaborative and multimedia experience...|$|E
40|$|Many {{synchronous}} computer-mediated communication (SCMC) {{studies have}} been conducted on the nature of online interaction across a range of pragmatic issues. However, the detailed analyses of resistance to advice have received less attention. Using the methodology of conversation analysis (CA), the present study focuses on L 2 peer review activities in a synchronous online context: that of giving and receiving advice based on participants’ writing drafts. In L 2 peer review activities, advice givers are momentarily positioned as the more <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>party</b> on the issue being discussed, while advice recipients can be viewed as having a subordinate status. I show that advice recipients invoke authority, provide a justification, or initiate inquiries to indicate resistance in a delicate manner. I argue that these resistance strategies cooperate to establish the recipients’ identities as competent, independent participants and to assert their primary rights over their manuscripts. The study reveals that L 2 SCMC peer response is not only a means for participants to develop rhetorical knowledge, but also to negotiate advice and manage interactional practices. ...|$|E

40|$|In many institutions, {{students}} are given the instruction to model their written work on existing published work. However, scholars typically write for other scholars, and {{this can lead to}} the so-called ‘curse of knowledge’, a cognitive bias wherein experts struggle to adopt {{the point of view of}} less <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>parties.</b> Students modelling their work on that of published academic works may be jeopardising their ability to communicate science clearly to laypersons, an emerging priority in academia. This article provides a wide-ranging discussion of this issue, informed by the findings from a pilot study which suggest that laypersons perceive the writing of students to be clearer, easier to understand and more detailed than the writing of established researchers. Regardless of intended career path, it is imperative that psychology graduates be able to articulate thoughts and ideas clearly and this article highlights the tangible implications of discouraging students from assimilating into a writing style typical of scholars which may prove outdated when open-access publications become mainstream...|$|R
40|$|In 1989 the California Legislature {{passed and}} the Governor signed SB 198, the most {{significant}} piece of Occupational Safety and Health legislation since {{the enactment of the}} OSHA Act. SB 198 shifts the focus of state policy in workplace safety and health to prevention. The changes weave the prevention approach into every aspect of CalOSHA: Standard enforcement sanctions; the use of data; and the providing of education information and technical assistance to employers. On July 1, 1991, regulations became effective implementing the part of this bill requiring employers to establish, implement and maintain worksite injury prevention programs. Based on preliminary data, it appears that most companies are devoting more attention to safety and health. However, not enough time has lapsed to properly assess the impact of SB 198 in terms of lower accident statistics or higher business costs. In order to carry out its oversight responsibilities, the Senate Committee on Industrial Relations desired to obtain additional information as to SB 1982 ̆ 7 s impact and effectiveness.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the increasing use of}} contracts of adhesion in which companies require consumers, employees, franchisees and other 2 ̆ 2 little guys 2 ̆ 2 to submit disputes with the company to binding arbitration. The article argues that the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s current preference for such agreements is not statutorily well-founded. Specifically, it contends that the Federal Arbitration Act was not intended to make such agreements binding on unknowing consumers or employees. Turning next to policy analysis, the article asserts that the Supreme Court has erred in expressing a preference for binding arbitration in cases where such arbitration was not knowingly and voluntarily accepted by both parties. In particular, it argues that binding arbitration is not necessarily better and cheaper for all parties than litigation. Rather, a company can use a binding arbitration clause to secure significant strategic advantages over less <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>parties.</b> The article further argues that by using preemption principles to preclude states from protecting their own citizens from unfair binding arbitration Congress and the Supreme Court have trammeled important federalism interests...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{argues that}} legal protections for {{minority}} investors in close corporations {{should be interpreted}} as default rules. Currently, such protections are mandatory and thus impose on investors a uniform norm of conduct that restricts their freedom to bargain. Courts and scholars advocating such protections have so far been unwilling to permit their waiver {{primarily because of the}} difficulty of distinguishing between a knowledgeable waiver and an ignorant omission. A price-based approach solves that puzzle, however, by using the consideration paid by investors to illuminate their intentions. By permitting waiver only where there is clear evidence that the minority received a discounted purchase price, such an approach avoids the risk inherent in a system that treats legal protections as mere default rules: that an ignorant minority will be taken advantage of as a result of accidental waiver. Whether or not the investor was truly ignorant, there can be no injustice if she was adequately compensated for the risk of opportunistic behavior by her fellow shareholders. A price-based approach therefore provides <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>parties</b> with the ability to bargain over their preferred allocation of control while retaining legal protections for unsophisticated investors who fail to do so...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Many federal programs and initiatives involve shared responsibilities [...] and benefits [...] for the federal, state, local and tribal governments, and the private sector.

40|$|Background: The WRF {{interfaces}} academically {{between science}} and politics and empirically between the developed and developing worlds. The question arises {{as to whether or}} not the WRF is an effective knowledge system conduit for science and technology to address sustainability challenges academically and also practically towards implementation to the extent that for practical purposes it is already a sustainability center as defined herein Important considerations include but are not limited to, the following: 1 Sustainability is regarded possible only if science and technology are mobilized to action at an increased pace. 2 Climate change has become an important consideration, the effects of which forces global environmental change, but as perceived at local level. Considerations used to assess the WRF were: 1. History and influence. 2. The current milieu of the WRF against the backdrop of the Southern African poor suffering a vulnerability crisis exacerbated by climate change. 3. The framework of Boundary Organizations and the effectiveness of the WRF as a boundary organization to influence sustainability positively. 4. Sustainability addresses multidisciplinary problems, demanding multidimensional answers and enhanced understanding and communication. Is the WRF an in-action, multi-dimensional sustainability center? 5. Implementation – Does the WRF enhance outcomes? Methods: This is a pilot study which investigated the WRF, a physical presence boundary organization in a poverty node, as a sustainability center. The qualitative method was followed. The WRF becomes a case-study inside this framework. Ten <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>parties</b> with first hand experience about WRF activities and relevance in the community were interviewed. Interviewees were asked a set of closed questions and then invited to participate in a discussion on their replies to paint an in-depth practical picture about the WRF. In this way an understanding of the relevance of the WRF in respect of sustainability was gained. Results: All participants agreed the WRF is salient, credible and produces legitimate information. The foundations for boundary organizations recognized by the literature imply the WRF, as a conduit for multi-dimensional sustainability enhancing programmes, is in practical terms a sustainability center. The WRF is a node for multi-level multi-national research, communication and problemsolving. Against the wider concepts of boundary organizations also as dealt with by the literature, the WRF can be regarded as in-action sustainability with a physical presence on the border, both academically {{between science and}} politics and practically between the developed and undeveloped worlds. This assessment shows the WRF is in practical terms a sustainability center. It enhances communication; unifies role-players and stimulates an inclusive problem-solving approach to research. It is visualized that a more formal classification as sustainability center with relevant personnel, for instance by the appointment of a sustainability manager, will enhance coordinated sustainability driven outcomes for the region. This could assist in mitigating the effects of climate change as well...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{accounting}} {{standards for the}} {{valuation of financial instruments}} have evolved to better reflect the economic reality facing publicly accountable companies.

In principle, this allows for financial statements that are more relevant and more easily comparable across entities.

40|$|Techno-optimists {{advocate}} {{the application of}} information technology to the rulemaking process {{as a means of}} advancing strong democracy [...] that is, direct, broad-based citizen involvement in regulatory policy making.

As such, a more realistic goal for the application of new technology to the regulatory process is to expand the information base available to regulatory decision makers through increased interest group pluralism. Instead of creating conditions of strong democracy, information technology can expand the involvement and access of informed, <b>knowledgeable,</b> and affected <b>parties</b> to the rulemaking process, a weaker form of democracy that nevertheless can provide better information for government officials...|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} frequency, {{courts are}} mentioning party sophistication as relevant to whether a contract has been formed, whether a contract is enforceable, how the contract should be interpreted, and even, in some instances, {{the determination of}} an appropriate remedy. Sophisticated parties are held to {{a different set of}} rules, grounded in freedom of contract. It is presumed that a sophisticated party was aware of what to bargain for and read (or should have read) and understood (or should have understood) the terms of a written agreement. But, just what do courts mean when they call a contracting party “sophisticated”? “Sophistication” is a slippery word. Courts and scholars have not established instructive criteria, and often presume that parties to a commercial transaction are sophisticated. Widely cited and highly regarded works in the area of contract law have stated that their theories only apply to sophisticated parties, without a serious attempt to explain who falls into that category. Likewise, all too often, courts label parties “sophisticated” without any analysis. Part I of this Article positions the discussion in theoretical context, and describes the significance of party sophistication as a compromise between formalist and realist concerns. Part II collects examples of contexts in which courts have used party sophistication as a tool to organize the world of contracting parties and, with that, the applicable legal principles. For sophisticated parties, in answering a wide array of contracts questions, courts employ a formalist approach. Part III begins descriptively and addresses the general lack of meaningful assessment of party sophistication. Drawing upon review of hundreds of cases, Part III details the attributes common among parties that courts have deemed sophisticated, and begins to draw the contours of a standard for sophistication. Finally, Part IV presents the central normative claim of the Article: courts should undertake a more exacting, fact-driven approach in addressing party sophistication. Drawing upon the extensive review of case law, Part IV provides a definition of sophistication that assesses information and resource asymmetries among the contracting parties. The proposed standard assesses whether a party, relative to the other parties to the contract, has sufficient experience and access to information and resources that that person or entity understands or should understand the intricacies, risks and consequences of the transaction. This standard takes into account the theoretical underpinnings of applying the sophistication label: for <b>knowledgeable</b> and experienced <b>parties</b> dealing in familiar industries, private autonomy should prevail over normative concerns. However, where a party lacks relative knowledge and experience, normative concerns may outbalance the literalism and private autonomy championed by formalism. As it stands now, however, {{in the absence of a}} meaningful definition of sophistication, courts are not actually addressing the context of the deal. Rather, they are simply reciting well-worn clichés about “sophisticated parties dealing at arms’ length. ...|$|R
