40|$|Carbides, nitrides, and borides {{ceramics}} are {{of interest}} for many applications because of their <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> temperatures and good mechanical properties. Wear-resistant coatings {{are among the most}} important applications for these materials. Materials with high wear resistance and <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> temperatures have the potential to produce coatings that resist degradation when subjected to high temperatures and high contact stresses. Among the carbides, Al 4 SiC 4 is a low density (3. 03 g/cm 3), <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> temperature (3 ̆e 2000 ˚C) compound, characterized by superior oxidation resistance, and high compressive strength. These desirable properties motivated this investigation to (1) obtain high-density Al 4 SiC 4 at lower sintering temperatures by hot pressing, and (2) to enhance its mechanical properties by adding WC and TiC to the Al 4 SiC 4. Also among the carbides, tantalum carbide and hafnium carbide have outstanding hardness; <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> points (3880 ˚C and 3890 ˚C respectively); good resistance to chemical attack, thermal shock, and oxidation; and excellent electronic conductivity. Tantalum hafnium carbide (Ta 4 HfC 5) is a 4 -to- 1 ratio of TaC to HfC with an extremely <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> point of 4215 K (3942 ˚C), which is the <b>highest</b> <b>melting</b> point of all currently known compounds. Due to the properties of these carbides, they are considered candidates for extremely high-temperature applications such as rocket nozzles and scramjet components, where the operating temperatures can exceed 3000 ˚C.

40|$|Using {{electronic}} structure calculations, we conduct an extensive {{investigation into the}} Hf-Ta-C system, which includes the compounds that have the <b>highest</b> <b>melting</b> points known to date.

5|$|Of all {{metals in}} pure form, {{tungsten}} has the <b>highest</b> <b>melting</b> point (3422°C, 6192°F), lowest vapor pressure (at temperatures above 1650°C, 3000°F), {{and the highest}} tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten, carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. Tungsten has the lowest {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|R
