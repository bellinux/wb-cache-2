25|$|Metals are {{typically}} isotropic, and an ordinary twist drill bit shears {{the edges of}} the hole cleanly. Wood drilled across the grain has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend {{to pull out of the}} wood hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the <b>hole</b> <b>edge.</b> The lip and spur drill bit has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetization}} reversal {{and magnetic}} anisotropy in Co network structures {{have been studied}} using magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE). An enhancement of the coercivity is observed in the network structures and is attributed to the pinning of domain walls by the <b>hole</b> <b>edges</b> {{in the vicinity of}} which the demagnetizing field spatially varies. We find that the magnetization reversal process is dominated by the intrinsic unaxial anisotropy (2 K(u) /M(s) approximate to 200 Oe) in spite of the shape anisotropy induced by the <b>hole</b> <b>edges.</b> The influence of the cross-junction on the competition between the intrinsic uniaxial anisotropy and the induced shape anisotropy is discussed using micromagnetic simulations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{addresses}} the distributions of interlaminar stresses of centrally notched quasi-isotropic APC- 2 /AS- 4 laminate ([0 / 45 / 90] 2 s) in tension by {{finite element method}} (FEM). Results include the concentration of interlaminar stresses {{in the vicinity of}} free boundaries (including <b>hole</b> <b>edge</b> and free sides); The concentration of interlaminar shear stress dominates at interfaces of 458 /þ 458 and þ 458 / 08, and the concentration of interlaminar normal stress, which occurs at the 908 / 458 and 08 / 908 interfaces. Further analysis demonstrates that the concentration of interlaminar shear stress is more severe as a whole and the highest interlaminar shear stress occurs near the <b>hole</b> <b>edge.</b> The results of digital speckle correlation measurement experiment validate the FEM result.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of a drilling tool largely affects {{the quality of}} the newly formed surface. When drilling through a composite panel, the <b>hole</b> <b>edge</b> quality on the outlet side is significantly worse than on the inlet side, so the choice of the appropriate tool geometry is crucial. Even if the tool geometry is correct, tool wear also has a strong influence on {{the quality of the}} newly formed surface of the holes. With the tool wear, the force in the direction of drilling and torque around the axis of drilling are increasing which can affect to the delamination of particle board on the outlet side. The proposed model for <b>hole</b> <b>edge</b> quality prediction on the outlet side was tested on an experimental model where the cutting forces and torque in the drilling direction were measured, and the quality of the newly formed surfaces was evaluated every 180 holes using a visual method...|$|E

40|$|In this {{experimental}} investigation {{the damage}} mechanisms {{and the damage}} evolution were observed during tensile quasi-static and cyclic loadings of open hole carbon balanced plain weave reinforced epoxy laminates. The initiation and propagation of the damage in open hole (diameter 5 mm) notched specimens were studied measuring the full field strain by the digital image correlation (DIC) and observing damage modes by X-ray micro-CT. The DIC maps of the strain components and the X-ray micro-CT observations highlighted similar damage concentrations and damage mechanisms for both loading conditions. In {{the beginning of the}} fatigue life (about 10 %) and for a static load of almost 70 % of the strength, the damage was localized between three different strained zones and limited in a very narrow area {{at the edge of the}} hole. A slow increase of delamination was observed from the <b>hole</b> <b>edge</b> up to 90 % of the fatigue life and for a static load approaching 90 % of the ultimate stress.

40|$|Determination of {{the local}} interlaminar stress {{distribution}} in a laminate with a bolt-filled hole is helpful for optimal bolted joint design, due to the three-dimensional (3 D) nature of the stress field near the bolt hole. A new interlaminar stress distribution phenomenon induced by the bolt-head and clamp-up load, which occurs in a filled-hole composite laminate, is investigated. In order to efficiently evaluate interlaminar stresses under the complex boundary condition, a calculation strategy that using zero-thickness cohesive interface element is presented and validated. The interface element {{is based on a}} linear elastic traction-separation description. It is found that the interlaminar stress concentrations occur at the <b>hole</b> <b>edge,</b> as well as the interior of the laminate near the periphery of the bolt head. In addition, the interlaminar stresses near the periphery of the bolt head increased with an increase in the clamp-up load, and the interlaminar normal and shear stresses are not at the same circular position. Therefore, the clamp-up load cannot improve the interlaminar stress distribution in the laminate near the periphery of the bolt head, although it can reduce the magnitude of the interlaminar shear stress at the <b>hole</b> <b>edge.</b> Thus, the interlaminar stress distribution phenomena may lead to delamination initiation in the laminate near the periphery of the bolt head, and should be considered in composite bolted joint design...|$|E
