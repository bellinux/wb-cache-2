To the last, it has to strive with contradictions: it is now getting <b>fast</b> <b>ready</b> with a Constitution, yet knows no peace. Sieyes, we say, is making the Constitution once more; has as good as made it. Warned by experience, the great Architect alters much, admits much. Distinction of Active and Passive Citizen, that is, Money-qualification for Electors: nay Two Chambers, 'Council of Ancients,' as well as 'Council of Five Hundred;' to that conclusion have we come! In a like spirit, eschewing that fatal self-denying ordinance of your Old Constituents, we enact not only that actual Convention Members are re-eligible, but that Two-thirds of them must be re-elected. The Active Citizen Electors shall for this time have free choice of only One-third of their National Assembly. Such enactment, of Two-thirds to be re-elected, we append to our Constitution; we submit our Constitution to the Townships of France, and say, Accept both, or reject both. Unsavoury as this appendix may be, the Townships, by overwhelming majority, accept and ratify. With Directory of Five; with Two good Chambers, double-majority of them nominated by ourselves, one hopes this Constitution may prove final. March it will; for the legs of it, the re-elected Two-thirds, are already there, able to march. Sieyes looks at his Paper Fabric with just pride.|$|E

40|$|In this Special Issue, {{entitled}} “Food {{choice and}} Nutrition: A Social Psychological Perspective”, three broad themes have been identified: (1) {{social and environmental}} influences on food choice; (2) psychological influences on eating behaviour; and (3) eating behaviour profiling. The studies that addressed the social and environmental influences indicated that further research {{would do well to}} promote positive food choices rather than reduce negative food choices; promote the reading and interpretation of food labels and find ways to effectively market healthy food choices through accessibility, availability and presentation. The studies on psychological influences found that intentions, perceived behavioural control, and confidence were predictors of healthy eating. Given the importance of psychological factors, such as perceived behavioural control and self-efficacy, healthy eating interventions should reduce barriers to healthy eating and foster perceptions of confidence to consume a healthy diet. The final theme focused on the clustering of individuals according to eating behaviour. Some “types” of individuals reported more frequent consumption of <b>fast</b> foods, <b>ready</b> meals or convenience meals or greater levels of disinhibition and less control over food cravings.

Friction and temperature measurements of a commercial tennis shoe outsole were measured during simulated sliding over hard court surfaces. Results indicated how the temperature changed during and after a slide. Additionally, it was found that the temperature of the shoe sole is significantly affected by the vertical load applied, and this varies depending on the shoe location tested. It was also found an inconsistent effect of surface roughness under a range of vertical loads tested. For multiple sliding tests during a rally, the shoe will increase temperature incrementally for each new slide, which could result in large changes in friction behaviour during a slide. The findings from this study could have important implications for the sport of tennis, both in terms of performance and injury-risk...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} factors {{have an impact on}} eating habits of individuals. The most {{examined}} ones are social, economic, ethical and cultural elements of society in addition to the level of education of an individual and the accessibility and price of food. The master's thesis explores the eating habits of teachers who convey knowledge about diet and related content and help their students develop a healthy attitude towards healthy eating. The teacher's knowledge can also influence the dietary behaviour of their pupils. The research sample comprised 168 primary school teachers who taught different subjects in the 2014 / 2015 school year. The eating habits of primary school teachers and their attitude towards healthy eating were analysed based on a survey questionnaire. The research results suggest that teachers bear in mind the guidelines for healthy eating only to a certain extent. They avoid less recommended food that is high in fat and sugar, <b>fast</b> food and <b>ready</b> meals. The majority of the teachers often eat fruit and vegetables and have the recommended number of meals per day. Moreover, their attitude towards healthy eating is positive and they find that the school environment encourages the development of healthy eating habits in pupils. It is vital that teachers have healthy eating habits and a positive attitude towards healthy eating because they set a good example to their pupils. Considering our findings, it is necessary to inform teachers about the significance of healthy eating habits and encourage them to adopt positive viewpoints and behaviours in order to promote healthy eating among primary school pupils. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTennis game is {{nowadays}} getting {{faster and}} players {{have to show}} strong defensive skills {{in order to win}} points. This implies returning more balls and repositioning very <b>fast</b> to get <b>ready</b> for the next stroke. In order to achieve this speed demand especially on hard court, a few players are able to slide like on clay court. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether sliding on hard court allows a faster repositioning during a tennis specific routine. A total of eighteen male, national level tennis players participated in this study. A new concept of shoe (NSh) was developed specifically to allow players to slide on hard court. The subjects were asked to play three series of ten balls sent by a ball machine, once with the new shoe and once with a regular shoe (RSh). They were instructed to move back quickly to the centre of the court between each stroke. The players’ displacements were videotaped (Casio Exilim FH 25, Casio, Tokyo, Japan) at 120 Hz from a rear-view in order to record the centre of gravity (CG) trajectories. The main results showed that time for repositioning – defined as the time separating ball contact and CG movement direction inversion - was reduced by up to 42 % when wearing NSh compared to RSh. This gain of time resulted in a 1. 10 m shorter distance covered by the players between the hit of the ball and the repositioning at the centre of the court. These results are suggesting that with Nsh, the players were able to better adjust their body position to play the strokes. Instead of doing multiple little adjustment steps, players did large lunges, slid, and hit the ball in an open stance position, then began the repositioning right after the stroke...|$|R
40|$|During a {{make ready}} {{in a web}} offset press it is {{important}} to produce as little waste as possible. Reducing the amount of waste yields savings of both time and money. One way to do <b>faster</b> make <b>ready</b> is to preset the ink keys of the press before it is started. This diploma work, carried out at Sörmlands Grafiska Quebecor AB in the city of Katrineholm, Sweden, examines how the ink key preset may be done using low- resolution digital images stored in the vendor independent data format CIP 3 PPF. The press that has been used has a control interface that is not accessible from the outside. This feature is shared with a lot of older presses. Therefore several methods of how to present and collect ink key settings using offline methods have been tested. To investigate the relationship between mean coverage over one ink zone and its corresponding ink key opening data from a 32 -page web offset press has been collected. The mean coverage was taken from the CIP 3 PPF files that were related to the collected print jobs. The relationship that was found between the coverage and the opening can be described with a transfer curve (one curve per printing unit and side). Using as few as three print jobs of high quality (density and dot gain within given tolerances) a first set of transfer curves may be created. These are close to the real ones and using print jobs where the ink key presettings have been calculated the transfer curves may be calibrated to perform better and better presetting calculations. To generate and calibrate the transfer curves and to extract the mean coverage values from the CIP 3 PPF files and recalculate these to presetting values a computer program called IKPS (Ink Key Presetting System) was made. IKPS was made using MATLAB from MathWorks INC. IKPS have been tested for ink key presetting during a number of print jobs. Even though the transfer curves were uncalibrated the system performed well. As comparison the results from a plate scanner was used. Even if online transfer of the presetting values is preferable the big advantage with the IKPS is that it is an offline system and therefore it is possible to implement it on any kind of offset press, old as well as new. In order to generate reliable transfer curves the print jobs used for calibration must be of high printing quality and representative for that particular press. How the ink key presettings are presented in the press control room depends on what kind of press it is. IKPS works with CIP 3 PPF files as well as low-resolution cmyk tiff files...|$|R
