She intervened, and made a state visit; before she returned to Hungary, she bribed Pope Clement to reverse himself and permit the coronation of Andrew. She also gave a ring to Andrew, {{which was supposed to}} protect him from death by blade or poison, and returned with {{a false sense of security}} to Hungary.|$|E

50|$|The {{demise of}} the Ganerbschaft began with the Sickingen Feud in 1523 and was {{accelerated}} by the Thirty Years' War. The place was destroyed in 1623 and 1627, a further destruction followed in 1645 during the Hesse War by Hesse-Darmstadt troops. Interest in owning the destroyed castle crumbled. In 1618 the Rosenbachs and Wallensteins pledged their portion to the lords of Schlitz named von Görtz. In 1630 there were only four <b>joint</b> <b>heirs</b> left. In 1648 the seat was purchased by the lords of Oeynhausen.|$|R

50|$|Tiberius died {{of natural}} causes. Suetonius {{describes}} widespread joy in Rome upon his death. There was a desire to have his body thrown down the Gemonian stairs and into the Tiber River, as this he had done many times previously to others. Tiberius had no living children when he died, although his (probable) natural grandson, Tiberius Julius Caesar Nero (Gemellus), and his adopted grandson, Gaius Caesar Caligula, both survived him. Tiberius designated both as his <b>joint</b> <b>heirs,</b> but seems to have favored Caligula over Gemellus, due to Gemellus' youth.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} timber-framed {{house was}} built in the late 16th or early 17th century for a member of the Warburton family of Warburton and Arley, Cheshire. Originally in three bays, it was extended by another two bays for Thomas Warburton, whose wife Anne was <b>joint</b> <b>heir</b> to the Penrhyn estate near Bangor in North Wales. A brick service wing was added {{to the north of the}} house in the early 18th century. Thomas' son, Hugh, had only one child, a daughter, Anne Susanna. In 1765 Anne Susanna married the other heir to the Penrhyn estate, Richard Pennant, who later became the 1st Baron Penrhyn. In 1775 Pennant commissioned Samuel Wyatt to design what became the larger stone extension to the house. In a possible attempt to harmonise the older part of the house with the stone extension, in the early 19th century the timber-framed wing was coated with roughcast and castellated. In 1809 the Winnington estate was sold to John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley. Stanley's home, Alderley Hall, had burnt down 30 years previously, and his family were living in temporary accommodation on the Alderley estate. However Stanley spent much of his time in London, and the condition of the building deteriorated. In 1817 the Stanley family moved back to Alderley where a new hall was being built. Stanley's son, Edward, moved into the house in 1842, but left for Alderley Hall in 1850 after succeeding to the barony.|$|E
