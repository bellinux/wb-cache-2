Shamshi-Adad I was forced to flee to Babylon while Naram-Suen of Eshnunna attacked Ekallatum c. 1761 BC. Shamshi-Adad I conquered Assur, took over the long-abandoned town of Shekhna in north-eastern Syria, converted it into {{the capital city of}} his Upper Mesopotamian Empire, renamed it to Shubat-Enlil, and emerged as the first Amorite king of Assyria c. 1754 BC. Shamshi-Adad <b>I</b> <b>placed</b> his sons in key geographical locations and gave them responsibility to look over those areas. While he remained in Šubat-Enlil, his eldest son, Ishme-Dagan I was put on the throne of Ekallatum.|$|E
25|$|On 13 November 1823, Pedro <b>I</b> <b>placed</b> {{the newly}} {{established}} Council of State in charge of writing {{a proposal for a}} new Constitution—which was finished in just fifteen days. The Council of State was formed by men from both the Luso-Brazilians and the Nativists. The Council used the partly completed project which had been crafted in the Constituent Assembly {{as a model for the}} new charter. After finishing it, a copy was sent to all Municipal Chambers for a decision as to whether or not to accept the new charter and present it to a new Constituent Assembly for endorsement. But some of the Municipal Chambers suggested that, instead, it should immediately be approved as the Brazil's Constitution. Once the idea had been aired, the vast majority of the Municipal Chambers, composed of councilmen elected by the Brazilian people as their local representatives, voted in favor of its instant adoption as the Constitution of the Empire. The first Brazilian Constitution was then promulgated and solemnly sworn in the Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro on 25 March 1824.|$|E

500|$|Years {{later as}} {{an elderly man}} {{near the end of}} his life, Marques de Sousa would fondly recall his advancement: [...] "Never in my life had I judged myself so great, nor {{experienced}} such ineffable rejoicing... as in the day <b>I</b> <b>placed</b> my fists into the cuffs of alferes. I walked through all the streets of the city, looking at myself, conceited, believing that everyone looking with admiration envied my luck, that all enamored ladies vied for my hand." [...] For the remainder of the conflict he was stationed in the defense of Montevideo. The conquest of the Banda Oriental was ended in July 1821, when Portugal declared it a province of Brazil with the name of Cisplatina.|$|E

[...] He was short of energy and {{required}} a car to transport him even the several hundred metres from his Ottawa residence to the Canadian House of Commons. [...] Because of this, he was given relatively undemanding portfolios: Minister of Customs and Inland Revenue, Minister of Public Works, and Secretary of State. [...] Hall has called him among the least visible of Borden's ministers. [...] Because of his health and his short tenure in each position, he made very little impact. [...] Despite this, Sifton was highly regarded by his colleagues. [...] Borden himself later stated [...] "there was no one in whose judgment <b>I</b> <b>placed</b> firmer reliance". [...] Sifton was appointed to the Imperial Privy Council in the 1920 New Year Honours, entitling him to the style [...] "The Right Honourable".|$|E
2500|$|The Shatapatha Brahmana {{contains}} ideas which Vaishnavism {{tradition of}} Hinduism has long mapped to a pantheistic vision of Vishnu as supreme, he as the essence in every being {{and everything in}} the empirically perceived universe.

The text equates Vishnu to all knowledge there is (Vedas), calling the essence of everything as imperishable, all Vedas and principles of universe as imperishable, and that this imperishable which is Vishnu is the all.|$|E

Public opinion became sharply divided among supporters of the Entente Powers and the [...] "Germanophiles"—who favored the Central Powers, particularly Germany. Grigore Cantacuzino oscillated between the two sides, but his two newspapers, Minerva and Seara, were closely associated with Germanophilia. In September 1914, they were bought from him by a German consortium, and became the mouthpieces of German propaganda.|$|E
2500|$|Pope Benedict XVI created Rosales Cardinal-Priest of Santissimo Nome di Maria in Via Latina in the consistory of March 24, 2006.

Pope Benedict told the new cardinals: “I want to sum up {{the meaning of this}} new call that you have {{received}} in the word which <b>I</b> <b>placed</b> at the heart of my first Encyclical: caritas. This matches well the color of your cardinal's robes. May the scarlet that you now wear always express the caritas Christi, inspiring you to a passionate love for Christ, for his Church and for all humanity.” A little later, he added: “I am counting on you, dear Brother Cardinals, to ensure that the principle of love will spread far and wide, and will give new life to the Church at every level of her hierarchy, in every group of the faithful, in every religious institute, in every spiritual, apostolic or humanitarian initiative.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the bishops}} of Beth Aramaye were admonished in the acts of these synods, they persisted in their intransigence, and in 420 Yahballaha <b>I</b> <b>placed</b> them under his direct supervision. [...] This ad hoc {{arrangement}} was later formalised by {{the creation of a}} 'province of the patriarch'. [...] As foreshadowed in the synod of Isaac in 410, Kashkar was the highest ranking diocese in this province, and the bishop of Kaskar became the 'guardian of the throne' (natar kursya) during the interregnum between one patriarch's death and the election of his successor. [...] The diocese of Dasqarta d'Malka is not mentioned again after 424, but bishops of the other dioceses were present at most of the 5th- and 6th-century synods. [...] Three more dioceses in Beth Aramaye are mentioned in the acts of the later synods: [...] Piroz Shabur (first mentioned in 486); Tirhan (first mentioned in 544); and Shenna d'Beth Ramman or Qardaliabad (first mentioned in 576). [...] All three dioceses were to have a long history.|$|E

He {{is said to have}} been unaware it was Chinese New Year and to have [...] "kicked the rear of a child who was dressed in the traditional costume of a dragon". Tebbit later said: [...] "I don't think my reaction was extreme at all. <b>I</b> <b>placed</b> my hand on the drum so I could diminish the noise and asked the drummer what was going on and got a rap on the knuckles for my pain. I was then barged by the dragon. I barged it back and might have done something like kick it. I wasn't sure how to deal with it. I've never been barged by a dragon before". A local Conservative town councillor, Mr Chung, visited Tebbit the day after the incident and received an apology. Chung said: [...] "I said his actions were upsetting. He apologised. He only then understood what he had done".|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not normal}} {{for the head}} of an eastern church to {{administer}} an ecclesiastical province in addition to his many other duties, but circumstances made it necessary for the patriarch Yahballaha I to assume responsibility for a number of dioceses in Beth Aramaye. [...] The dioceses of Kashkar, Zabe, Hirta, Beth Daraye and Dasqarta d’Malka (the Sassanian winter capital Dastagird), doubtless because of their antiquity or their proximity to the capital Seleucia-Ctesiphon, were reluctant to be placed under the jurisdiction of a metropolitan, and it was felt necessary to treat them tactfully. [...] A special relationship between the diocese of Kashkar and the diocese of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was defined in Canon XXI of the synod of 410: [...] 'The first and chief seat is that of Seleucia and Ctesiphon; the bishop who occupies it is the grand metropolitan and chief of all the bishops. [...] The bishop of Kashkar is placed under the jurisdiction of this metropolitan; he is his right arm and minister, and he governs the diocese after his death.' [...] Although their bishops were admonished in the acts of these synods, they persisted in their intransigence, and in 420 Yahballaha <b>I</b> <b>placed</b> them under his direct supervision.|$|E
2500|$|I am Mesha, son of Chemosh-gad, king of Moab, the Dibonite. My father reigned over Moab thirty years, and I have reigned {{after my}} father. And I have built this {{sanctuary}} for Chemosh in Karchah, a sanctuary of salvation, for he saved me from all aggressors, {{and made me}} look upon all mine enemies with contempt. Omri was king of Israel, and oppressed Moab during many days, and Chemosh was angry with his aggressions. His son succeeded him, and he also said, I will oppress Moab. In my days he said, Let us go, and I will see my desire upon him and his house, and Israel said, I shall destroy it for ever. Now Omri took the land of Madeba, and occupied it in his day, and {{in the days of}} his son, forty years. And Chemosh had mercy on it in my time. And I built Baal-meon and made therein the ditch, and I built Kiriathaim. And the men of Gad dwelled in the country of Ataroth from ancient times, and the king of Israel fortified Ataroth. I assaulted the wall and captured it, and killed all the warriors of the city for the well-pleasing of Chemosh and Moab, and I removed from it all the spoil, and offered it before Chemosh in Kirjath; and <b>I</b> <b>placed</b> therein the men of Siran, and the men of Mochrath. And Chemosh said to me, Go take Nebo against Israel, and I went in the night and I fought against it from the break of day till noon, and I took it: and I killed in all seven thousand men, but I did not kill the women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-Chemosh; and I took from it the vessels of Jehovah, and offered them before Chemosh. And the king of Israel fortified Jahaz, and occupied it, when he made war against me, and Chemosh drove him out before me, and I took from Moab two hundred men in all, and placed them in Jahaz, and took it to annex it to Dibon. I built Karchah the wall of the forest, and the wall of the Hill. I have built its gates and I have built its towers. I have built the palace of the king, and I made the prisons for the criminals within the wall. And there were no wells in the interior of the wall in Karchah. And I said to all the people, ‘Make you every man a well in his house.’ And I dug the ditch for Karchah with the chosen men of Israel. I built Aroer, and I made the road across the Arnon. I took Beth-Bamoth for it was destroyed. I built Bezer for it was cut down by the armed men of Daybon, for all Daybon was now loyal; and I reigned from Bikran, which I added to my land. And I built Beth-Gamul, and Beth-Diblathaim, and Beth Baal-Meon, and <b>I</b> <b>placed</b> there the poor people of the land. And as to Horonaim, the men of Edom dwelt therein, on the descent from old. And Chemosh said to me, Go down, make war against Horonaim, and take it.
