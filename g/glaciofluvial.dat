50|$|Characteristic of this moraine is the {{transition}} of deposition layers from <b>glaciofluvial</b> to glaciolacustrine. Sedimentary <b>glaciofluvial</b> areas form {{the core of the}} Oak Ridges Moraine, though restricted to subglacial cavity fills of confined subaqueous fans. Overlaying this core is a glaciolacustrine sedimentary layer that is younger and topographically lower, principally in the delta and basin areas of the moraine.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Middle and Early Pleistocene Missoula flood {{deposits}} {{have been}} documented to comprise parts of the <b>glaciofluvial</b> deposits, informally known as the Hanford formation that are found {{in parts of the}} Othello Channels, Columbia River Gorge, Channeled Scabland, Quincy Basin, Pasco Basin, and the Walla Walla Valley. The age of these deposits is demonstrated by the presence of multiple interglacial calcretes interbedded in these <b>glaciofluvial</b> deposits, sequences of sediments with normal, reverse, and normal magnetostratigraphy, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and unconformity truncated clastic dikes. Based upon these criteria, Quaternary geologists estimated that the oldest of the Pleistocene Missoula floods happened before 1.5 million years ago. The older Pleistocene <b>glaciofluvial</b> deposits within the Hanford formation are fragmentary in nature because they have been repeatedly eroded and largely removed by subsequent Missoula floods. Because of the fragmentary nature of older <b>glaciofluvial</b> deposits,the exact number of older Missoula floods, which are known as Ancient Cataclysmic Floods, that occurred during the Pleistocene cannot be estimated with any confidence. Although Lake Missoula likely was the source of many of the Ancient Cataclysmic Floods, the fragmentary nature of the older deposits within the Hanford formation makes precise determination of the precise origin of the floods that deposited them very difficult.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, the ice sheet's {{constant}} retreat created fractures {{where it}} met and scoured the bedrock. These fractures allowed {{the development of}} sub-glacial rivers (adj. <b>glaciofluvial)</b> and lakes (adj. glaciolacustrine).|$|E

50|$|In {{geography}} and geology, fluvial processes {{are associated with}} rivers and streams and the deposits and landforms created by them. When the stream or rivers are associated with glaciers, ice sheets, or ice caps, the term <b>glaciofluvial</b> or fluvioglacial is used.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Natural Resource Conservation Service, Sussex County {{soils are}} derived from parent {{materials}} that are largely till and <b>glaciofluvial</b> deposits, alluvium, and organic matter deposits. Till is the rock of soil material transported or deposited by glacial ice. In this case, the most recent glaciation (i.e. the last ice age), the Wisconsinian continental glacier, deposited a till plain composed of ground and recessional moraines. This glaciation reached its maximum extent roughly 22,000 years ago (20,000 B.C.E.). <b>Glaciofluvial</b> deposits (or [...] "outwash") are rock and soil materials that melting glaciers deposit as the glacier recedes. Alluvium is materials that are deposited by floodwaters from engorged bodies of waterâ€”chiefly streams and rivers. Organic deposits are largely the result of decomposing plant material.|$|E

5000|$|Models of drumlin {{formation}} {{fall into}} two camps: constructional, in which they form as sediment is manipulated into shape, for example via subglacial deformation; and Remnant/erosional, which proposes that drumlins form by erosion of material from an unconsolidated bed.

[...] This theory includes deposition of <b>glaciofluvial</b> sediment in cavities scoured into the glacier bed by subglacial meltwater, and remnant ridges left behind by erosion of soft sediment or hard rock by subglacial meltwater.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of Middle and Early Pleistocene Missoula flood deposits {{have been documented}} within the Channeled Scabland as {{other parts of the}} Columbia Basin, e.g. the Othello Channels, Columbia River Gorge, Quincy Basin, Pasco Basin, and the Walla Walla Valley. Based on the {{presence of}} multiple interglacial calcretes interbedded with <b>glaciofluvial</b> flood deposits, magnetostratigraphy, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and unconformity truncated clastic dikes, {{it has been estimated that}} the oldest of these megafloods flowed through the Channel Scablands sometime before 1.5 million years ago. Because of the fragmentary nature of older <b>glaciofluvial</b> deposits, which have been largely removed by subsequent Missoula floods, the exact number of older Missoula floods, which are known as Ancient Cataclysmic Floods, that occurred during the Pleistocene cannot be estimated with any confidence. As many as 100 separate, cataclysmic Ice Age floods may have occurred during the last glaciation. There have been at least 17 complete interglacial-glacial cycles since about 1.77 million years ago, and perhaps as many as 44 interglacial-glacial cycles since the beginning of the Pleistocene about 2.58 million years ago. Presuming a dozen (or more) floods were associated with each glaciation, the total number of cataclysmic Ice Age Missoula floods that flowed through the Channeled Scablands for the entire Pleistocene Epoch could possibly number in the hundreds, perhaps exceeding a thousand Ancient Cataclysmic Floods.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a variety}} of drift {{deposits}} in Port Talbot. Sandfields area of Port Talbot is built upon blown sand and tidal flat deposits. These were deposited by alluvial processes (wind) and fluvial processes (water). Velindre area of Port Talbot is built upon an alluvial fan deposit. This deposit formed during the last glacial period 14,000 years ago. Baglan Road in Port Talbot is built upon glacial till from the Devensian period. Till, also known as boulder clay, {{is a mix of}} unconsolidated sediment with a range of grain sizes (clay-boulder). This forms as the fronts of glaciers rapidly deposit material due to melting. Cwmafan in Port Talbot is built upon alluvial and <b>glaciofluvial</b> deposits, formed from glacial melt water. Baglan Moors, Fairfield and Port Talbot town centre are built upon tidal flat deposits (tides were higher 12,000 years ago allowing sandy deposits to accumulate).|$|E

The mining camp of Petersville, Alaska served as the area Post Office for several years in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Two areas have been set aside for recreational gold mining, the North and South units of the Petersville State Recreation Mining Areas. Many smaller one-man and family placer mining operations continue today.|$|E
50|$|Lake Tahoe is {{an example}} of a lake that is in danger of having a tsunami due to {{faulting}} processes. Lake Tahoe in California and Nevada USA lies within an intermountain basin bounded by faults, with most of these faults at the lake bottom or hidden in <b>glaciofluvial</b> deposits. Lake Tahoe has had many prehistoric eruptions and in studies of the lake bottom sediments, a 10m high scarp has displaced the lake bottom sediments, indicating that the water was displaced by the same magnitude, as well as generating a tsunami. A tsunami and seiche in Lake Tahoe can be treated as shallow-water long waves as the maximum water depth is much smaller than the wavelength. This demonstrates the interesting impact that lakes have on the tsunami wave characteristics, as it is very different from ocean tsunami wave characteristics due to the ocean being deeper, and lakes being relatively shallow in comparison. With ocean tsunami waves amplitudes only increase when the tsunami gets close to shore, in lake tsunami waves are generated and stay in a shallow environment.|$|E
5000|$|A tunnel {{valley is}} a large, long, U-shaped valley {{originally}} cut under the glacial ice near {{the margin of}} continental ice sheets such as that now covering Antarctica and formerly covering portions of all continents during past glacial ages. [...] They range in size (up to 100 km in length and up to 4 km in width). Tunnel valleys exhibit classical overdeepening with maximum depths that may vary between 50 and 400 m; they vary in depth along the long axis. Their cross-sections exhibit steep sided flanks (similar to fjord walls) and flat bottoms typical of subglacial glacial erosion. Tunnel valleys were formed by subglacial erosion by water and served as subglacial drainage pathways carrying large volumes of melt water. They presently appear as dry valleys, lakes, seabed depressions, and as areas filled with sediment. If they are filled with sediment their lower layers are filled primarily with glacial, <b>glaciofluvial</b> or glaciolacustrine sediment, supplemented by upper layers of temperate infill.
