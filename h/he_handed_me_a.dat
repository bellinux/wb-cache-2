60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> letter {{addressed}} {{to me in}} Oscar's handwriting.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> small sketch-book, and, while I {{turned over}} the leaves, busied himself in filling a short meerschaum.|$|E
60|$|When I {{returned}} to the pilot house to report the good news to my companion <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> paper.|$|E
60|$|I accepted, for I was thirsty, {{and half}} emptied at a draught the tumbler which <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> I {{put down the}} glass I caught a grim smile on de Cartienne's sallow face. But what it meant I could not tell, {{although}} it made me strangely uneasy.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> old French newspaper. The {{substance}} of what I read {{there is still}} so firmly impressed on my memory that I am certain {{of being able to}} repeat correctly at this distance of time all the facts which it is necessary for me to communicate to the reader.|$|R
5000|$|In 1966, Robbins played Josh Cutler in NBC's Daniel Boone with Fess Parker. Robbins holds Parker, later a large Los Angeles developer, in high esteem because Parker {{paid him}} in advance: [...] "He knew I was hard up. When I {{showed up on}} Monday morning, <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> {{envelope}} with my first episode’s pay in advance," [...] recalls Robbins.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{talked a}} bit about old acquaintances and other things, and then, having finished, <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{sovereign}} and rose to go.|$|E
60|$|He {{had picked}} from a drawer a little {{tarnished}} cylinder, and, undoing the tape, <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> short note scrawled upon a half-sheet of slate-gray paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are five}} more to starboard. 'Ere's the original!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> paint-dappled copper stencil-plate, two feet square, bearing in the centre the six-inch initials, [...] "G.M." ...|$|E
6000|$|Worst of all, {{she listened}} {{to what he said}} in the night. Corp had a habit of talking in his sleep. He was usually taking tickets at such times, and it had been her custom to stop him violently; but now she changed her tactics: she {{encouraged}} him. [...] "I would be lying in my bed," [...] he said to Tommy, [...] "dreaming that a man had fallen into the Slugs, and instead o' trying to save him I cried out, 'Tickets there, all tickets ready,' and first <b>he</b> <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> glove and neist <b>he</b> <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> boot and havers o' that kind sich as onybody dreams. But in the middle o' my dream it comes ower me that I had better waken up to see what Gavinia's doing, and I open my een, and there she is, sitting up, hearkening avidly to my every word, and putting sly questions to me about the glove." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song has a {{distinctive}} drum beat. [...] "You couldn't play rock 'n' roll to it. Basically it's a Bossa Nova." [...] said Topper Headon. Joe Strummer has said [...] "Just before the take, Topper {{said to me}} [...] "I want you to play this" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> R Whites lemonade bottle in a towel. He said [...] "I want you to beat the bass drum with it." ...|$|R
60|$|Thereupon {{the officer}} bade me sit down, {{and began to}} help me, and join in the meal. ‘I fill your ladyship’s glass,’ said <b>he,</b> and <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> tumbler of neat rum.|$|R
60|$|The next morning, Mr. Bruff {{surprised}} {{me at the}} breakfast-table. <b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> large key, and announced that he felt ashamed of himself {{for the first time}} in his life.|$|E
6000|$|We lads saluted in as sailorly {{a fashion}} as was possible, for {{we were not}} well up on such manners, and the {{commodore}} said abruptly as <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> folded paper: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> telegram.--'Have {{not heard}} from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious. Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is. Do not delay.--Holmwood.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> the letter. <b>As</b> soon as I had {{recovered}} myself, I looked at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Chawls," [...] says <b>he,</b> <b>handing</b> <b>me</b> over <b>a</b> tenpun-note, [...] "here's your wagis, {{and thank}} you for getting me out of the scrape with the bailiffs: when you are married, you shall be my valet out of liv'ry, and I'll treble your salary." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was very}} obliging, and as <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> into <b>a</b> fly after superintending {{the removal of}} my boxes, I asked him {{whether there was a}} great fire anywhere? For the streets were so full of dense brown smoke that {{scarcely}} anything was to be seen.|$|R
60|$|He {{stayed with}} me for a while, {{speaking}} welcome words of comfort; then, gathering his robes about him, he stood up, prepared to leave. But first <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> small packet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear {{it is too}} late, Mr. Quatermain," [...] he answered. [...] "The Usutu are in sight. Look for yourself." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> {{telescope}} {{which he}} had with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{done with}} your {{troubles}} yet, Dr. Therne, I fear," [...] he said cheerfully; [...] "out {{of the criminal}} wood into the civil swamp," [...] and he laughed as <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, yes; but I don't see {{any chance}} of that being found out. A gent comes to <b>me</b> at <b>a</b> spot we have settled on, say on the road halfway between Pitsea and Stanford; <b>he</b> <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> box, {{sometimes}} two; I puts them {{on one of the}} horses, and rides over here with them; then I stows them away in that secret place off the store, where there aint a shadow of a chance of the sharpest-eyed coastguardsman ever finding them. They would be too delighted to light on the spirits and bacca to think of digging up the floor underneath. There they lie, till I take them down to the Marden. They put them into the eel tank, and next morning off she sails." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a brave man, sir," [...] said he. [...] "I have {{a present}} {{to make to}} you," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>handing</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> very tiny glass tube. [...] "It has been {{specially}} prepared by Dr. Fardet. At the supreme moment you have but to put it to your lips {{and you will be}} dead in an instant." ...|$|R
60|$|I nodded, and <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> to <b>me</b> <b>a</b> felt-covered flask of the non-conducting kind, {{filled with}} boiling water, a tin of {{preserved}} milk, {{and a little}} bottle of meat extract of a most concentrated sort. Then, having lit two of the hurricane lamps and seen that they were full of oil, we started back up the cave.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> packet {{as thick}} as my arm, and about three feet long, done up in many folds of canvas. I made bold to ask what it was. He {{answered}} {{that it was an}} artist's sketching umbrella, packed for traveling.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Vengeance is mine," [...] saith the Lord; [...] "I will repay." [...] Yet it may be, son, {{that the}} Lord will choose {{you as the}} {{instrument}} of his wrath. An opportunity shall be given you to speak with her. Now put on this dress'--and <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> white Dominican hood and robe--'and follow me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|At the sand-hillocks we {{were met}} by the under-groom, running {{to us from the}} house. The lad is a good lad, and has an honest respect for me. <b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> little note, with a decent sorrow in his face. [...] "Penelope sent me with this, Mr. Betteredge," [...] he said. [...] "She found it in Rosanna's room." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{that moment}} the bell rang, {{and one of the}} house-servants--all puzzled by this {{conflict}} of interests--came in with <b>a</b> telegram, which <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> on <b>a</b> salver. I broke it open, without glancing at the envelope. Its contents baffled me: 'My address is Hotel Bristol, Paris; name as usual. Send <b>me</b> <b>a</b> thousand pounds on account at once. I can't afford to wait. No shillyshallying.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... <b>'AND</b> <b>HE</b> SHOWED <b>ME</b> <b>A</b> PURE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE, CLEAR AS CRYSTAL, PROCEEDING OUT OF THE THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB.' Revelation 22:1 ...|$|R
60|$|He settled {{himself on}} the deep dove-colour {{pneumatic}} cushions, and his smile was like the turning on of all the electrics. His teeth were whiter than the ivory fittings. He smelt of rare soap and cigarettes--such cigarettes as <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> from <b>a</b> golden box with an automatic lighter. On {{my side of the}} car was a gold-mounted mirror, card and toilette case. I looked at him inquiringly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Man heap dry--this muck-a-muck heap good," [...] {{said the}} young fellow, as <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> long strip to taste. It {{was cool and}} sweet to the tongue, and {{on a hot day}} would {{undoubtedly}} quench thirst. The boy took it from the tree by means of a chisel-shaped iron after the heavy outer bark has been hewed away by the axe.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> book of pasted {{newspaper}} paragraphs, interspersed {{here and}} there in red ink with little manuscript notes and comments. I began to read it with profound interest. It was so strange for me thus to learn {{for the first time the}} history of my own life; for I was quite ignorant as yet of almost everything about my First State, and my father and mother.|$|E
60|$|It {{was eleven}} o'clock on the {{following}} morning. I had been reading in the garden for some time, and was just thinking of starting for a walk, when a dogcart from the Castle stopped at the gate, and Mr. Ravenor's servant--the man who had conducted me from the lodge to the Castle--was shown into the house. I went to him at once and <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> note.|$|E
5000|$|The Hold Steady {{reference}} it {{in their}} 2010 song [...] "Barely Breathing": [...] "After the show I spoke with the singer. And <b>he</b> tried to <b>hand</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> packet about Hare Krishna. I said you've got to be kidding." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That stuff," [...] he said. <b>He</b> put his <b>hand</b> to his forehead. [...] "I {{ought not}} to have given it to you. It will make your head split to-morrow. Wait a minute. Here." [...] <b>He</b> <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> out <b>a</b> little flat thing like a seidlitz-powder. [...] "Take that in water as {{you are going to}} bed. The other thing was a drug. Not till you're ready to go to bed, mind. It will clear your head. That's all. One more shake--Futurus!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I took, with {{a strange}} curiosity, the letter which <b>he</b> <b>handed</b> to <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> a {{barrister}} I had had, of course, odd experiences now and then, including sudden demands upon my time; but never anything like this. I {{stepped back into the}} hall, closing the door to, but leaving it ajar; then I switched on the electric light. The letter was directed in a strange hand, a woman's. It began at once without [...] "dear sir" [...] or any such address: ...|$|R
