Israeli Patrol who were <b>guarding</b> <b>electrical</b> work at the time saw him and let him pass. By the time the camera on the watch tower has called the patrols attention to Mengistu it was too late. A soldier on the scene stated that he though Avera was a Sudanese refugee who had {{decided to move to}} Gaza. http://news.walla.co.il/item/2871432 Israel contacted the Red Cross and officials in the Gaza Strip and demanded that Mengistu be returned to Israel.|$|R
40|$|The Pentek {{metal coating}} removal system {{consists}} of the ROTO-PEEN Scaler, CORNER-CUTTER(R), and VAC-PAC(R). The system is designed to remove coatings from steel, concrete, brick, and wood. The Scaler uses 3 M ROTO-PEEN tungsten carbide cutters, while the CORNER-CUTTER(R) uses solid needles for descaling activities. These are used with the VAC-PAC(R) vacuum system to capture dust and debris as removal of the coating takes place. The safety and health evaluation during the testing demonstration focused on two main areas of exposure: dust and noise. Dust exposure was minimal, but noise exposure was significant. Further testing for each exposure is recommended, since the outdoor environment where the testing demonstration took place may skew the results. It is feasible that dust and noise levels will be higher in an enclosed operating environment. Other areas of concern found were arm-hand vibration, whole-body vibration, ergonomics, heat stress, tripping hazards, <b>electrical</b> hazards, machine <b>guarding,</b> and lockout/tagout...|$|R
50|$|On 13 March 2016, Sri Lanka {{experienced}} another 7 hour island wide blackout due to {{a damaged}} transformer in the 220kV Substation at Biyagama. It {{is considered to be}} the worst nationwide power outage in 20 years. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe appointed a five-member committee to investigate the blackout. Due to initial suspicions of sabotage, President Maithripala Sirisena deployed troops to <b>guard</b> <b>electrical</b> installations until the investigation was completed. The CEB also reported that the outage caused Lakvijaya Coal Power Plant to fail, resulting in a loss of 900 Mega Watts to the National Grid. On March 23, 2016, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya notified parliament that the reason for the power outage was a lack of regular maintenance of power installations. The engineer in charge of the Biyagama Substation had previously reported that a key transformer needed maintenance; however, no repairs were made.|$|R
40|$|The LTC coating removal {{technology}} was tested {{and is being}} evaluated at Florida International University (FIU) as a baseline technology. In conjunction with evaluation of efficiency and cost, this report covers the evaluation conducted for safety and health issues. It is a commercially available technology and {{has been used for}} various projects at locations throughout the country. The LTC coating removal system consisted of several hand tools, a Roto Peen scaler, and a needlegun. They are designed to remove coatings from steel, concrete, brick, and wood. These hand tools are used with the LTC PTC- 6 vacuum system to capture dust and debris as removal of the coating takes place. The safety and health evaluation during the testing demonstration focused on two main areas of exposure: dust and noise. The dust exposure was minimal but noise exposure was significant. Further testing for each exposure is recommended because of the environment where the testing demonstration took place. It is feasible that the dust and noise levels will be higher in an enclosed operating environment of different construction. In addition, other areas of concern found were arm-hand vibration, whole-body vibration, ergonomics, heat stress, tripping hazards, <b>electrical</b> hazards, machine <b>guarding,</b> and lockout/tagout...|$|R
40|$|Application of patch clamp {{techniques}} to higher-plant cells has {{been subject to}} the limitation that the requisite contact of the patch electrode with the cell membrane necessitates prior enzymatic removal of the plant cell wall. Because the wall is an integral component of plant cells, and because cell-wall-degrading enzymes can disrupt membrane properties, such enzymatic treatments may alter ion channel behavior. We compared ion channel activity in enzymatically isolated protoplasts of Vicia faba guard cells with that found in membranes exposed by a laser microsurgical technique in which only a tiny portion of the cell wall is removed {{while the rest of}} the cell remains intact within its tissue environment. "Laser-assisted" patch clamping reveals a new category of high-conductance (130 to 361 pS) ion channels not previously reported in patch clamp studies on plant plasma membranes. These data indicate that ion channels are present in plant membranes that are not detected by conventional patch clamp techniques involving the production of individual plant protoplasts isolated from their tissue environment by enzymatic digestion of the cell wall. Given the large conductances of the channels revealed by laser-assisted patch clamping, we hypothesize that these channels play a significant role in the regulation of ion content and <b>electrical</b> signalling in <b>guard</b> cells...|$|R

40|$|The Pentek {{scabbling}} {{technology was}} tested at Florida International University (FIU) {{and is being}} evaluated as a baseline technology. This report evaluates it for safety and health issues. It is a commercially available technology and {{has been used for}} various projects at locations throughout the country. The Pentek concrete scabbling system consisted of the MOOSE, SQUIRREL-I, and SQUIRREL-III scabblers. The scabblers are designed to scarify concrete floors and slabs using cross-section, tungsten carbide tipped bits. The bits are designed to remove concrete in 318 inch increments. The bits are either 9 -tooth or demolition type. The scabblers are used with a vacuum system designed to collect and filter the concrete dust and contamination that is removed from the surface. The safety and health evaluation conducted during the testing demonstration focused on two main areas of exposure: dust and noise. Dust exposure was minimal, but noise exposure was significant. Further testing for each of these exposures is recommended. Because of the outdoor environment where the testing demonstration took place, results may be inaccurate. It is feasible that the dust and noise levels will be higher in an enclosed operating environment.

50|$|Ion uptake into guard cells causes stomatal opening: The {{opening of}} gas {{exchange}} pores requires the uptake of potassium ions into guard cells. Potassium channels and pumps {{have been identified}} and shown to function in the uptake of ions and opening of stomatal apertures. Ion release from guard cells causes stomatal pore closing: Other ion channels have been identified that mediate release of ions from guard cells, which results in osmotic water efflux from guard cells due to osmosis, shrinking of the guard cells, and closing of stomatal pores (Figures 1 and 2). Specialized potassium efflux channels participate in mediating release of potassium from guard cells. Anion channels were identified as important controllers of stomatal closing. Anion channels have several major functions in controlling stomatal closing: (a) They allow release of anions, such as chloride and malate from guard cells, which is needed for stomatal closing. (b) Anion channels are activated by signals that cause stomatal closing, for example by intracellular calcium and ABA. The resulting release of negatively charged anions from guard cells results in an electrical shift of the membrane to more positive voltages (depolarization) at the intracellular surface of the guard cell plasma membrane. This <b>electrical</b> depolarization of <b>guard</b> cells leads to activation of the outward potassium channels {{and the release of}} potassium through these channels. At least two major types of anion channels have been characterized in the plasma membrane: S-type anion channels and R-type anion channels.|$|R
40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2012. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 60). As entitled in the report, major concentration {{of the study is}} based on the functional aspects and practices of the Security & Protocol department of The City Bank Ltd. Thus all the contents discussed throughout the report are to highlight on the learning‟s that was gathered during the internship period in there. When it comes about financial organizations, the foremost subjects we think regarding business earnings, profit and loss statement figures. The sole purpose of any Banking organization is to do business and increase profitability but we don‟t consider the back office support of any such organization. Security & Protocol department is one such type of support unit belonging from the back office. Banking is all about doing and bringing business and to tighten up the bonding between the Bank & customer, security department play the vital role of ensuring the safety and security of customer‟s trust and assets. Security & protocol department‟s major areas of concentration are to ensure and implement all sorts of safety measures and take preventive measures for any type of urgency. As a financial organization, risk factor comes always at first and apart from the business risk calculation it is the duty of security department to deal with other types of internal and external risk factors. Ensuring physical <b>guarding,</b> <b>electrical</b> security appliances, fire safety measures, cash carrying and nonetheless protocol support during events like AGM, EGM, Board meeting and other sorts of business events are the most common operations performed by the Security & Protocol department of The City Bank Ltd. As a member of that department I have tried to describe all my observations and learning in this report that I have experienced there. Khairul Alam. B. Business Administratio...|$|R
