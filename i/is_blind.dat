5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species <b>is</b> <b>blind.</b> Microbats have mesopic vision, meaning that they can only detect light in low levels, whereas other mammals have {{photopic}} vision, which allows colour vision. Microbats may use their vision for orientation and while they are travelling between their roosting grounds and their feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances. Some species can detect ultraviolet (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, {{they may be able}} to discriminate colours.|$|E

She and Kiat Kun follow the girl home, but after {{realising}} her father <b>is</b> <b>blind</b> {{and that her}} family was in a more dire situation than theirs, they decide not to reclaim the shoes. However, a few days later, Seow Fang notices that her classmate is wearing a new pair; upon confronting her, she discovers that the girl has discarded the old pair at the kampung rubbish dump. The Chew siblings frantically search the rubbish dump for her shoes, but only discover them as they are destroyed during a trade unionist riot against a policeman (Wakin Chau).|$|E

He later brings the brooch to Helen, who he realizes {{for the first time}} <b>is</b> <b>blind.</b> Hal learns she needs $3,000 for surgery that would restore her eyesight. When Helen tries to touch his face, Hal angrily storms out. He then goes to the Scott residence and demands money from Clifford and Virginia, whom he blames for his disfigurement. Clifford draws a gun and shoots Hal twice in the stomach, but the weakened Hal manages to strangle Clifford to death before escaping with Virginia's jewels. He brings them to Helen, who is concerned about Hal's injuries, but he flees before she can learn he is shot.|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the teachers’ opinions about inclusion {{of children who are}} blind; the factors which may influence their opinions and what they think can be done to include children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in primary schools. It was a qualitative study which purposely involved five teachers from two primary schools. Data was collected through interviews. The centre of interest in the study was on the acceptance of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> by the teachers; participation of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in classroom and outdoor activities, benefits of placing children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in mainstream primary schools, the challenges of including children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in the mainstream and what teachers think ca be done to overcome such challenges. The study findings revealed that the nature of attitudes the teachers had towards children who <b>are</b> <b>blind,</b> additional disability and class size determined the teachers’ acceptance of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind.</b> The teachers also believed that children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> can <b>be</b> helped to participate in school activities through classroom and physical environmental modifications; curriculum modifications and provision of specialised equipment. Teachers felt that placement of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> in the mainstream can make them achieve social benefits; academic benefits and acquire special skills. The study findings also revealed that for successful inclusion of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind,</b> teachers needed support in the provision of special specialised equipment; collaboration with other professionals; construction and equipping the resource rooms where remedial support for children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> can <b>be</b> exercised. The following challenges were expressed by the teachers: Lack of skills and competence, large class sizes and lack of specialised equipment. In order to overcome these challenges, teachers used various methods of teaching for example peer teaching, cooperative learning and team teaching. It is suggested that training and re-training of teachers in the filed of Special Needs Education, provision of specialised equipment, recruitment of more teachers and awareness seminars may help in the inclusion of children who <b>are</b> <b>blind...</b>|$|R

5|$|Vincent begins {{creating}} {{the painting of}} the church and soon spots the beast inside. The Doctor demands that Amy stay back as he enters the church alone, but she and Vincent both agree they should help the Doctor. Vincent is able to save the Doctor and Amy, describing the beast's actions as they hide in the confessionals. The Doctor soon realises from Vincent's description that the beast <b>is</b> <b>blind,</b> the likely reason it was abandoned on Earth, and is frightened of its surroundings. The beast is impaled on Vincent's easel when it tries to lunge at the artist. The Doctor attempts to soothe the dying creature while Vincent empathises with its pain. After the creature dies, the three return outside the church and Vincent describes the night sky as he envisions it.|$|E

While Lisa and her husband argue about Billy, he goes into his brother’s room with a knife. The next morning, Lisa finds a bloody knife in his brother's bed, although the boy is unscathed. Billy stands in the room staring at Josh. Forensic analysis shows the blood to be Billy's, {{although there are no}} injuries on him. The knife bears a symbol that Billy drew while being interrogated by Doggett, which was also drawn by a psychic investigator ten years earlier. Meanwhile, Cal Jeppy shows up at Purnell's trailer and hassles him. Purnell goes into the woods and digs up a skull. Later, Jeppy blackmails Purnell into silence over something related to Billy.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{character}} <b>is</b> <b>blind,</b> his remaining four senses function with superhuman accuracy and sensitivity, giving him abilities {{far beyond the}} limits of a sighted person. Few characters know that the hero cannot see. Daredevil developed a radar sense, which is similar to echolocation. Writer/co-creator Stan Lee said that he was worried that blind people would be offended at how far he exaggerated the way a blind person's remaining senses are enhanced, but that his fears were assuaged by letters from organizations such as The Lighthouse for the Blind which said that blind people greatly enjoyed having Daredevil comics read to them.|$|E

The Allegory of the Cave (begins Republic 7.514a) is a paradoxical analogy wherein Socrates argues that the invisible world is the most intelligible ("noeton") and that the visible world ("(h)oraton") is the least knowable, and the most obscure.|$|E
40|$|Studies of how {{children}} who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> acquire and use language have focused less on cognitive compensations {{and more on}} delays in development. Vision {{is important in the}} establishment of early communicative patterns, and sighted children regularly use contextual visual information, such as a speaker's gestures and eye gaze, to make sense of speech that is directed at them (Mills, 1988). Some researchers have argued that, in the absence of vision, children may be expected to have more difficulty understanding concepts and the relationships between them and in acquiring generalizations about language and the way it works (Andersen, Dunlea, & Kekelis, 1993). In contrast, {{it has been argued that}} linguistic experience may be more important for children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> than for sighted children and that children who <b>are</b> <b>blind</b> may pay more attention to language (Chomsky, 1990; Perez-Pereira & Castro, 1997).

Outraged, Tiresias tells the king that Oedipus himself is the murderer ("You yourself are the criminal you seek"). Oedipus cannot see how this could be, and concludes that the prophet must have been paid off by Creon {{in an attempt to}} undermine him. The two argue vehemently, as Oedipus mocks Tiresias' lack of sight, and Tiresias in turn tells Oedipus that he himself <b>is</b> <b>blind.</b> Eventually Tiresias leaves, muttering darkly that when the murderer is discovered he shall be a native citizen of Thebes, brother and father to his own children, and son and husband to his own mother.|$|E
