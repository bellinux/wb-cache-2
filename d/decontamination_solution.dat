50|$|The {{two main}} {{benefits}} of decontamination foam over liquid decontaminants (chlorine, <b>decontamination</b> <b>solutions,</b> etc.) are its effectiveness on non horizontal surfaces and its high air to liquid ratio. Other decontaminants {{are difficult to}} apply to walls and ceilings due to poor adhesion, however decon foam is much better at adhering to surfaces, which increases {{the amount of time}} for the decontamination reaction to take place. Additionally, the high air to liquid ratio allows the foam to be used without over-applying the decontaminant. This high ratio also allows a small amount of liquid to cover a relatively large area {{in the event of a}} major contamination.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vesicant}} {{property of}} mustard agent can be neutralized by oxidation or chlorination, using household bleach (sodium hypochlorite), or by nucleophilic attack using e.g. <b>decontamination</b> <b>solution</b> [...] "DS2" [...] (2% NaOH, 70% diethylenetriamine, 28% ethylene glycol monomethyl ether). After initial decontamination of the victim's wounds is complete, medical treatment {{is similar to}} that required by any conventional burn. The amount of pain and discomfort suffered by the victim is comparable as well. Mustard agent burns heal slowly, and, as with other types of burn, present a risk of sepsis caused by pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mechanisms behind sulfur mustard’s effect on endothelial cells are still being studied, but recent studies have shown that high levels of exposure can induce high rates of both necrosis and apoptosis. In vitro tests have shown that at low concentrations of sulfur mustard, where apoptosis is the predominant result of exposure, pretreatment with 50 mM N-acetyl-L-cystein (NAC) was able to decrease the rate of apoptosis. NAC protects actin filaments from reorganization by sulfur mustard, demonstrating that actin filaments play a large role in the severe burns observed in victims.|$|E
5000|$|Since its {{foundation}} in 1965 in Le Havre, France, Sidel {{has been developing}} packaging technologies for the beverage industry. In 1961 the company developed the first plastic bottle made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a container for edible oil and, later on, wine, milk and water. In 1973 Sidel released the first plastic HDPE (high-density polyethylene) bottle for milk, sterilised by ultra-heat treatment (UHT). In 1980 Sidel delivered its first PET blow moulding machine to the family-owned soft-drink company Barraclough in Great Britain. Sidel’s first international subsidiary opened in 1984 in Atlanta, USA. In the same year, Sidel also sold the first high-speed PET blow moulding machine. In the 1990s Sidel acquired the French companies Hema (1995), Cermex (1996) [...] and Gebo (1997). In 1997 Sidel introduced a system which combines blow moulding, filling and capping. In same year, the first Sidel dry preforms decontamination by H2O2 spray was launched with the Combi Disis. The development of an internal carbon-based coating in 1999 strengthened the barrier properties of PET packages to gases (O2 and CO2) and made PET-bottles usable for beer. In 2003 Sidel joined Tetra Laval and merged with the Italian company Simonazzi in 2005. Simonazzi was founded in 1850 and had its headquarters in Parma, Italy. In 2006, Sidel launched Predis™, its dry <b>decontamination</b> <b>solution</b> technology for preforms. In April 2013, Sidel announced the launch of a new company {{as part of the}} Sidel Group, Gebo Cermex. [...] Gebo Cermex focuses on engineering, line integration and end-of-line packaging. A partnership with Kortec was communicated in October 2013. The target of the co-operation is to develop new light-blocking PET milk bottles. In March 2014, the divestment of Swedish subsidiary, Tectubes, was announced.|$|E

40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) is now {{faced with}} the task of meeting {{decontamination}} and decommissioning obligations at numerous facilities by the year 2019. Due to the tremendous volume of material involved, innovative decontamination technologies are being sought that can reduce the volumes of contaminated waste materials and secondary wastes requiring disposal. With sufficient decontamination, some of the material from DOE facilities could be released as scrap into the commercial sector for recycle, thereby reducing the volume of radioactive waste requiring disposal. Although recycling may initially prove to be more costly than current disposal practices, rapidly increasing disposal costs are expected to make recycling more and more cost effective. Additionally, recycling is now perceived as the ethical choice in a world where the consequences of replacing resources and throwing away reusable materials are impacting the well-being of the environment. Current approaches to the decontamination of metals most often involve one of four basic process types: (1) chemical, (2) manual and mechanical, (3) electrochemical, and (4) ultrasonic. {open_quotes}Hard{close_quotes} chemical <b>decontamination</b> <b>solutions,</b> capable of achieving decontamination factors (Df`s) of 50 to 100, generally involve reagent concentrations in excess of 5 %, tend to physically degrade the surface treated, and generate relatively large volumes of secondary waste. {open_quotes}Soft{close_quotes} chemical <b>decontamination</b> <b>solutions,</b> capable of achieving Df`s of 5 to 10, normally consist of reagents at concentrations of 0. 1 to 1 %, generally leave treated surfaces in a usable condition, and generate relatively low secondary waste volumes.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the method of}} regeneration of spent electrochemical <b>decontamination</b> <b>solution.</b> The proposed method allows separation of radionuclides and stable metals from spent <b>decontamination</b> <b>solution</b> in a form suitable for final disposal and repeated use of the remaining solution for electrochemical decontamination. Development of this method {{was based on the}} results of the speciation studies which showed that Fe(III) can be precipitated in the presence of organic complexing agents, in a form of iron hydroxide, and Ag- 110 m, Co- 60, Mn- 54 radionuclides can be coprecipitated on it. In order to verify the conclusions made as a result of the speciation studies, the experiments with electrochemically prepared simulant solution and real solution were carried out. The test results proved that the proposed method can be applied in practice. Treatment of the ultimately spent decontamination solutions can be also made applying iron precipitation, which allows for removal of the bulk amount of contaminants, as the first step. Then, if necessary the remaining radionuclides can be removed by sorption. A series of novel absorbers has been tested for their potential for the sorption removal of the remaining radionuclides from the supernate. The test results showed that most of them were more effective in neutral or alkaline range of pH, however, the high efficiency of the sorption removal can be achieved only after the removal of the oxalic and citric acids from solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{release of}} {{hazardous}} chemicals {{poses a threat}} to individuals in the area of a release and to responders who attempt to limit the damage of the release. For a liquid phase spill, the most common decontamination technology is a sodium hypochlorite and water solution. Although this solution has been proven effective against a variety of contaminants, it also has a host of drawbacks. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} an industrial <b>decontamination</b> <b>solution</b> that is noncorrosive, nontoxic, nonflammable, and environmentally safe. The military has developed a solution using hydrogen peroxide as well as a quaternary ammonium complex that is currently used to decontaminate chemical and biological warfare agents, which may be adapted to fit the needs in industry. Additionally, turning this liquid solution into foam may prove even more effective while reducing the cost. In order to test foam application, a foam generator was built in house. This foam generator was newly designed and built with features allowing for the study of foam production. A protected derivative of cysteine was chosen as the surrogate for a hazardous industrial contaminant. This derivative allowed for the study of non-polar decontamination due to the attachment of non-polar functional groups to the cysteine molecule. Liquid phase decontamination was conducted using both decontamination foam solution and <b>decontamination</b> <b>solution</b> without surfactant. All reaction analysis was carried out using GC-MS to determine the extent of reaction. The decontamination effect was conducted using the foam generator and a test apparatus, which were able to show the successful decontamination of the contaminant in as little as 20 minutes...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{approach}} for water-based strippable coatings for surface decontamination is reported.

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this thesis to explore the {{feasibility}} of using coated-wire electrodes to measure chelating agent concentration. Chelating agents are often found in radioactive <b>decontamination</b> <b>solutions</b> because they aid in the removal of radionuclides from contaminated surfaces by increasing their solubility. However, this characteristic will also enhance the mobility of the radionuclide and thus its transport out of a waste disposal site. Coated-wire ion selective electrodes, based on a polyvinylchloride membrane using dioctylphthalate as a plasticizer and dinonylnaphthalene-sulfonic acid as a counterion, were constructed for five commonly utilized chelating agents (ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), citric acid, oxalic acid and tartaric acid).

DNA ZAPTM outperformed the conventionally used sodium hypochlorite decontamination procedure. Stringent preventive measures and decontamination of equipment and laboratory surfaces is important to avoid secondary transfer of this contaminating DNA to evidence samples...|$|E
40|$|Process {{waste streams}} from the Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant (HWVP) may require {{treatment}} for cesium, strontium, and transuranic (TRU) element removal {{in order to}} meet criteria for incorporation in grout. The approach planned for cesium and strontium removal is ion exchange using a zeolite exchanger followed by filtration. Filtration using a pneumatic hydropulse filter is planned to remove TRU elements which are associated with process solids and to also remove zeolite bearing the cesium and strontium. The solids removed during filtration are recycled to the melter feed system to be incorporated into the HWVP glass product. Fluor Daniel, Inc., the architect-engineering firm for HWVP, recommended a Pneumatic Hydropulse (PHP) filter manufactured by Mott Metallurgical Corporation for use in the HWVP.

40|$|This {{document}} is {{a review of}} reactive coatings to protect military personnel from chemical and biological warfare (CW/BW) agents. Decontamination of surfaces exposed to chemical or biological agents presents a major challenge to U. S. forces. Present decontaminants may have problems with toxicity or corrosion; all <b>decontamination</b> <b>solutions</b> present the logistical challenge of supplying them when {{and where they are}} needed. Reactive coatings would be available at any time, enhancing protection while simplifying logistics. Ideally, a reactive coating would not add significantly to the cost or weight of the coating system and would not compromise other properties of the coating. The purpose of this review is to identify available technologies and ongoing research in reactive coatings for military equipment. We define a reactive coating as a surface coating that neutralizes chemical or biological threats by a chemical reaction. We first considered requirements for reactive coatings. Key elements are the rate of decontamination, effectiveness against the full range of threats that U. S. forces are exposed to, ability to maintain performance under all conditions, safety and environmental friendliness, and the ability to preserve critical coating properties such as camouflage and corrosion protection.

40|$|For {{over half}} a century, psychologists have been struck by how poor people are at expressing their {{internal}} sensations, impressions, and evaluations via rating scales. When individuals make judgments, they are incapable of using an absolute rating scale, and instead rely on reference points from recent experience. This relativity of judgment limits the usefulness of responses provided by individuals to surveys, questionnaires, and evaluation forms. Fortunately, the cognitive processes that transform internal states to responses are not simply noisy, but rather are influenced by recent experience in a lawful manner. We explore techniques to remove sequential dependencies, and thereby decontaminate a series of ratings to obtain more meaningful human judgments. In our formulation, decontamination is fundamentally a problem of inferring latent states (internal sensations) which, because of the relativity of judgment, have temporal dependencies. We propose a <b>decontamination</b> <b>solution</b> using a conditional random field with constraints motivated by psychological theories of relative judgment. Our exploration of decontamination models is supported by two experiments we conducted to obtain ground-truth rating data on a simple length estimation task.

Water utilities often must make timely, critical decisions without evaluating all facets of the incident. The data needed to enact informed decisions are inevitably dispersant and disparate, originating from policy, science, and heuristic contributors. Water Expert is a functioning hybrid decision support system (DSS) and expert system framework that emphasizes the meshing of parallel data structures in order to expedite and optimize the decision pathway. Delivered as a thin-client application through the user's web browser, Water Expert 's extensive knowledgebase is a product of inter-university collaboration that methodically pieced together system decontamination procedures.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a new assay: Biofilm Ring Test ® to evaluate the efficacy of <b>decontamination</b> <b>solutions</b> to inhibit biofilm formation. This method is based on the immobilization of magnetic microbeads by bacterial cells forming biofilm in a modified polystyrene microtiter plate. Proteinase K (PK) was used as biofilm inhibitor in two models of biofilm formation in anaerobic conditions; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 mono specie and P. gingivalis/Streptococcus gordonii DL 1 bi-species biofilms. Methods: Two hundred µl from P. gingivalis or P. gingivalis/S. gordonii culture were loaded in each well in triplicate. The PK solution was applied directly at a final concentration of 0. 2 %. After incubation at 37 °C in an anaerobic incubator, plates were scanned prior and after magnetization and a BioFilm Index (BFI) was measured with the Biofilm Control®Software. A BFI ≤ 2 means a full immobilization of beads by a completely formed biofilm whereas a BFI ≥ 12 indicates no biofilm formation. Results: The capacity of different bacterial strains to form biofilm was validated using BioFilm Ring Test®. The BFI reached a value of 1. 5 after 7 h for P. gingivalis alone and 3 h for the mixture of strains. Under the same conditions, the BFI increased when the 0. 2 % PK solution was added and reached a value of 4. 70 ± 0. 2 and 9. 40 ± 0. 1 respectively. The increased BFI compared to those observed in the absence of biofilm inhibitor showed the capacity of this new device to evaluate bacterial biofilm formation. Conclusion: In comparison with laborious methods, the Biofilm Ring Test ® may be used as a rapid, reproducible and easy-handling device to determine the effectiveness of anti-biofilm molecules. Considering these properties, this assay can be implemented for screening of biofilm formation by high numbers of bacterial strains with various molecules in the same assay...|$|R
40|$|The {{sorption}} of Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd from aqueous multiple-species solutions by synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAP) was investigated. HAP was {{reacted with}} solutions containing different heavy metals concentrations (10, 100 and 500 mg/L) for four times (2, 4, 24 and 48 h). The {{results showed that}} HAP was very effective in removal heavy metals from aqueous solutions. Approximately 95 - 99 % of the Pb applied was removed from solutions, with the best sorption capacity of 497 mg of Pb/g of HAP, while 92 - 99 % of Zn, 93 - 99 % of Cu and 88 - 99 % of Cd added were attenuated, with best removal capacity of 498, 485 and 477 mg/g, respectively. Sorption mechanisms other than dissolution/precipitation of crystalline phases could be involved in attenuating heavy metals concentrations such as ion exchange, coprecipitation, surface complexation and formation of amorphous phases. The study results confirm HAP provides a cost effective method for the <b>decontamination</b> of <b>solutions</b> polluted by heavy metals...|$|R
40|$|Large {{deposits}} of impure kaolins exist in Jordan and {{many parts of}} the world; geoplymers can re-duce environmental impacts and have multi-application in many fields, such as water purification, waste treatment, fire proof construction, etc. The aim of this research is to investigate the use of alkali activated zeolitic tuff and low purity metakaolin as precursors for the production of func-tional geoplymers exhibiting proper mechanical properties and high potential for water storage and <b>decontamination</b> of polluted <b>solutions.</b> The results confirmed that this type of geopolymers showed superior mechanical characteristics and higher adsorption capacity towards heavy metals such as Cu(II) ions, which was similar to natural zeolite. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that phillipsite, a major zeolite mineral, disappeared upon geopolymerization, while scanning electro...|$|R
40|$|Polyethylene {{microencapsulation}} physically homogenizes and incorporates mixed waste particles {{within a}} molten polymer matrix, forming a solidified final waste form upon cooling. Each individual particle of waste is embedded within the polymer block and {{is surrounded by}} a durable, leach-resistant coating. The process has been successfully applied for the treatment of a broad range of mixed wastes, including evaporator concentrate salts, soil, sludges, incinerator ash, off-gas blowdown <b>solutions,</b> <b>decontamination</b> <b>solutions,</b> molten salt oxidation process residuals, ion exchange resins, granular activated carbon, shredded dry active waste, spill clean-up residuals, depleted uranium powders, and failed grout waste forms. For waste streams containing high concentrations of soluble toxic metal contaminants, additives can be used to further reduce leachability, thus improving waste loadings while meeting or exceeding regulatory disposal criteria. In this configuration, contaminants are both chemically stabilized and physically solidified, making the process a true stabilization/solidification (S/S) technology. Unlike conventional hydraulic cement grouts or thermosetting polymers, thermoplastic polymers such as polyethylene require no chemical. reaction for solidification. Thus, a stable, solid, final waste form product is assured on cooling. Variations in waste chemistry over time do not affect processing parameters and do not require reformulation of the recipe. Incorporation of waste particles within the polymer matrix serves as an aggregate and improves the mechanical strength and integrity of the waste form. The compressive strength of polyethylene microencapsulated waste forms varies based on the type and quantity of waste encapsulated, but is typically between 7 and 17. 2 MPa (1000 and 2500 psi), well above the minimum strength of 0. 4 MPa (160 psi) recommended by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for low-level radioactive waste forms in support of 10 CFR 61 (NRC, 1991; 1983) Because polyethylene is a relatively new material, it is difficult to predict its long-term durability. However, prior to scale-up of the microencapsulation process, a study was conducted to evaluate potential degradation mechanisms. The study examined potential effects on mechanical integrity from exposure to chemicals and solvents, thermal cycling, saturated environments, microbial attack, and high gamma-radiation fields (Kalb et al., 1991). At ambient temperatures, polyethylene is relatively inert to most chemicals, including organic solvents, acids, and alkaline solutions. Exposure to changes in temperature or saturated soil conditions have been shown to degrade the mechanical integrity of some waste forms, but had little or no measurable impact on polyethylene waste forms. Low-density polyethylene is not susceptible to growth of microbial organisms, a fact that is evidenced by the lack of plastics decomposition in municipal waste landfills. When exposed to gamma-radiation at total doses of up to lo 8 rad, additional cross-linking of the polymer occurs, resulting in increased strength and lower leachability...|$|R
