25|$|Smullyan (1991, 2001) {{has argued}} forcefully that Tarski's undefinability theorem deserves {{much of the}} {{attention}} garnered by Gödel's incompleteness theorems. That the latter theorems <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about all of mathematics and more controversially, about a range of philosophical issues (e.g., Lucas 1961) is less than evident. Tarski's theorem, on the other hand, is not directly about mathematics but about the inherent limitations of any formal language sufficiently expressive to be of real interest. Such languages are necessarily capable of enough self-reference for the diagonal lemma to apply to them. The broader philosophical import of Tarski's theorem is more strikingly evident.|$|E
500|$|Philosophers in the {{continental}} philosophical tradition are not traditionally categorized as philosophers of science. However, they <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about science, some of which has anticipated themes in the analytical tradition. For example, Friedrich Nietzsche advanced the thesis in his [...] "The Genealogy of Morals" [...] that the motive for search of truth in sciences {{is a kind of}} ascetic ideal.|$|E
500|$|When {{accessing}} the very deep emotions {{called for by}} her character, Mulligan stated, [...] "I really took my cue from the book". She noted that her role did not require her to <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> because Kathy {{was more of an}} observer throughout most of the film. She recalled that [...] "every time I was in a scene where I wasn’t quite sure where I was going with it, I would go to the book and read through the lines because she's unreliable, in that much of the time she's not being truly honest with herself or the audience." [...] The young actress said that her friendship with Knightley made their scenes together easier because they would both regard each other's comments helpful and would not feel [...] "insulted or hurt" [...] in discussion.|$|E

500|$|Television critics {{reacted with}} mixed {{reaction}} toward the episode, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "pretty dull." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of American Dad!, The Simpsons and Bob's Burgers that preceded the show, and the episode of The Cleveland Show that followed it, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I don't <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about tonight's Family Guy. Last week, we had some comments about how Family Guy seems {{to be willing to}} play with its format this season. That didn't happen this week at all." [...] Kaiser went on to criticize the flashback involving Lois and Joyce in high school, stating, [...] "Having a previously unknown flashback as the big reveal feels like cheating, if you're inclined to view Family Guy as consistent." [...] He concluded his review by praising [...] "the burning bush" [...] joke, and ultimately gave the episode a C- rating, the worst rating of the night. It was beaten by the American Dad! episode [...] "Fart-Break Hotel", The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Roberta?", The Simpsons episode [...] "Flaming Moe", and the Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Crawl Space". In a slightly more positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode for some of its [...] "silly side jokes," [...] but felt disappointed by the ending to the show, commenting, [...] "it didn't follow any real logic [...] It was an easy way out, as if they'd written themselves into a corner." [...] Hughes also criticized the episode for its dependence on cutaway gags, writing, [...] "at least there were some funnier moments in this one. Unfortunately, a lot of those came in the cutaways. And I thought we were starting to move away from a dependence on them." [...] Hughes went on to comment that he felt confused by Stewie possibly being fathered by a porn star, adding that [...] "it would be far more likely that Chris or Meg was fathered by the porn star." ...|$|E
2500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film an [...] "old-fashioned monster movie {{dressed up in}} trendy new threads", praising the special effects, [...] "nihilistic attitude" [...] and [...] "post-9/11 anxiety overlay", but said, [...] "In the end, [...] not much {{different}} from all the marauding creature features that have come before it". Scott Foundas of LA Weekly was critical of the film's use of scenes reminiscent of the September 11 attacks in New York City and called it [...] "cheap and opportunistic". He suggested that the film was engaging in [...] "stealth" [...] attempts at social commentary and compared this unfavorably to the films of Don Siegel, George A. Romero and Steven Spielberg, saying, [...] "Where those filmmakers all had something meaningful to say {{about the state of the}} world and [...] human nature, Abrams doesn't <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about anything". Manohla Dargis in the New York Times called the allusions [...] "tacky", saying, [...] " [...] may make you think of the attack, and you may curse the filmmakers for their vulgarity, insensitivity or lack of imagination", but that [...] "the film is too dumb to offend anything except your intelligence". She concludes that the film [...] "works as a showcase for impressively realistic-looking special effects, a realism that fails to extend to the scurrying humans whose fates are meant to invoke pity and fear but instead inspire yawns and contempt." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com calls the film [...] "badly constructed, humorless and emotionally sadistic", and sums up by saying that the film [...] "takes the trauma of 9/11 and turns it into just another random spectacle at which to point and shoot". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune warned that the viewer may feel [...] "queasy" [...] at the references to September 11, but that [...] "other sequences [...] carry a real jolt" [...] and that such tactics were [...] "crude, but undeniably gripping". He called the film [...] "dumb", but [...] "quick and dirty and effectively brusque", concluding that despite it being [...] "a harsher, more demographically calculating brand of fun", he enjoyed the film. Bruce Paterson of Cinephilia described the film as [...] "a successful experiment in style but not necessarily a successful story for those who want dramatic closure". [...] Some critics also pointed out the similarity to the Half-Life video game series, in particular the [...] "Ant-lion" [...] monsters from Half-Life 2, and the constant first-person perspective.|$|E
