5|$|Goya {{worked on}} The Disasters of War {{during a period}} when he was {{producing}} images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience. His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which {{can be seen as}} a return to the imagery of the Caprichos. In this, he <b>is</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than anything that could be recognised from real events or settings.|$|E
5|$|Setting {{up her own}} {{publishing}} house Marsden House, Karen <b>is</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> useless Ramona as personal assistant. Adam is determined to take things one step further with Tina so they can move in with one another, though she doesn't want to rush things and especially not with David now living with Adam and Matthew following his divorce from Robyn. Pete has landed on his feet as a chauffeur, and Jenny is finding herself seeing a lot less of her husband. Matthew's relationship with Olivia is taken to the next level, to the shock of Karen and Adam.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country <b>is</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E

In 2007, the Texas A University system had close to 700 million dollars of construction projects planned or already underway in the Bryan College Station area.

25|$|The Cunningham Defense (3.Nf3 Be7) threatens a {{check on}} h4 that can {{permanently}} prevent White from castling; furthermore, if White does not develop his King's Bishop immediately, he {{would be forced to}} play Ke2, which hems the Bishop in. A sample line is 4. Nc3 Bh4+ 5. Ke2 d5 6. Nxd5 Nf6 7. Nxf6+ Qxf6 8. d4 Bg4 9. Qd2 (diagram). White has strong central control with pawns on d4 and e4, while Black <b>is</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> the white king's discomfort to compensate.|$|E

5000|$|In 1936, Rabbi Henkin {{declared}} that Rabbi Yehoshua Seigel's 1905 Manhattan eruv {{could no longer}} <b>be</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> because he had only acquired permission for ten years. However, Rabbi Henkin's main argument why the eruv could no longer <b>be</b> <b>relied</b> <b>on</b> <b>was</b> because {{of the construction of}} bridges that crossed Manhattan’s waterfront (Luach HaYovel Shel Ezras Torah, p. 62). This letter was later reprinted in Edus L’Yisroel, 1949 (p. 151).|$|R
25|$|False negatives {{and false}} positives are {{significant}} issues in medical testing. False negatives {{may provide a}} falsely reassuring message to patients and physicians that disease is absent, when it is actually present. This sometimes leads to inappropriate or inadequate treatment of both the patient and their disease. A common example <b>is</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> cardiac stress tests to detect coronary atherosclerosis, even though cardiac stress tests are known to only detect limitations of coronary artery blood flow due to advanced stenosis.|$|E
25|$|Ian is pessimistic when Lucy {{decides to}} set up her own {{property}} business and later becomes concerned about her when he discovers she is sleeping with Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) and is taking cocaine. He confronts her and admits she is the child he is most proud of, but this is overheard by Peter, resulting in Lucy storming out. Ian tries to contact her when she does not return home that night, but is later informed by DC Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) and DS Cameron Bryant (Glen Wallace) that Lucy has been found dead. He identifies her body and then shares his devastating news with Jane, Denise, Cindy, Bobby and finally Peter. Struggling with their grief, Ian and Jane share a passionate encounter, giving Ian hope that they might reunite. When Jane dashes his hopes, Ian takes his anger out on Bobby and Jane decides {{it would be best}} if she take Bobby away for a while. Cindy also leaves the Square to return to Devon with her aunt, Gina Williams. Increasingly alone, Ian leans on Phil for support and questions how he can move on from his daughter's death. With Peter's help, he stages an opening for the new and improved restaurant, but during opening night Summerhayes reveals that Lucy's body has been released for burial. Ian leaves early with Peter to see her, but is unable due to his grief. He wants to organise the funeral for as soon as possible but discovers that Max and Lucy were together; Ian angrily attacks Max as he carries Lucy's coffin down the aisle of the church and it is clear that Ian is not coping. Worried, Sharon believes that he <b>is</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> pills to numb the pain of his grief and she and Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) comfort him.|$|E
500|$|Florette's son (Depardieu), Jean, {{arrives with}} his wife Aimée and young {{daughter}} Manon, and the Soubeyrans' hopes of an easy takeover are soon shattered. Florette's son is called Jean Cadoret, but Ugolin, in the local custom, calls him Jean de Florette. Jean {{makes it clear that}} {{he has no intention of}} selling, but plans to take up residence and live off the land. He has a grand scheme for making the farm profitable within two years, involving breeding rabbits and feeding them off cucurbit. Jean does not know about the blocked spring, only of a more distant one, and <b>is</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> rainfall to fill a cistern with water for supplying livestock and irrigating crops. The distant spring, where an old Italian couple lives, is [...] away and also part of the property. Jean believes the needs of the farm can be met from here. Ugolin is discouraged, but Papet tells him to befriend Jean and gain his confidence. They also keep secret from him the fact that—while average rainfall for the surrounding region is sustainable—the area where Florette's farm lies rarely gets any of this rain. Meanwhile, the two work to turn the local community against the newcomer, who is described merely as a hunchbacked former tax collector, since the deceased Pique-Bouffigue had cousins in the village who know about the blocked spring and would tell Jean about it should they come to trust him.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Renard's view, Karmarkar states the Ajativada of Gaudapada has {{nothing in common}} with the Śūnyatā concept in Buddhism. While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, states Comans, their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada <b>is</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> the premise of [...] "Brahman, Atman or Turiya" [...] exist and are the nature of absolute reality.|$|E
2500|$|The poem, {{like others}} in Songs of Experience, {{reflects}} a uniquely Christian sense of alienation. As such, [...] "A Poison Tree" [...] appears to play off the Christian idea of self-denial, {{and it is}} possible that Blake <b>is</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> Emanuel Swedenborg's theme of piety concealing malice, which ultimately alienates the individual from their true identity and evil no longer appears to be evil. Blake's poem differs from Swedenborg's theory by containing an uncontrollable progression through actions that lead to the conclusion. The final murder is beyond the control of the narrator, and the poem reflects this by switching from past to the present tense. The poem's theme of duplicity and the inevitable conclusion is similar to the anonymous poem [...] "There was a man of double deed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The warlords who rule various {{regions of}} the country exert local control. The {{transitional}} government is attempting to integrate local governing authorities with the central government, but it lacks the loyalty from the warlords necessary to its governing authority. More traditional elements of political authority—such as Sufi networks, royal lineage, clan strength, age-based wisdom, and the like—still exist and play a role in Afghan society. Karzai <b>is</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> these traditional sources of authority in his challenge to the warlords and older Islamist leaders. The deep ethnic, linguistic, sectarian, tribal, racial, and regional cleavages present in the country create what is called [...] "Qawm" [...] identity, emphasizing the local over higher-order formations. Qawm refers to the group to which the individual considers himself to belong, whether a subtribe, village, valley, or neighborhood. Local governing authority relies upon these forms of identity and loyalty.|$|E

2500|$|Iran {{said that}} the IR-40 heavy water-moderated {{research}} reactor at Arak was expected begin {{to operate in the}} first quarter of 2014. [...] During on-site inspections of the IR-40 design, IAEA inspectors observed that the previously reported installation of cooling and moderator circuit piping was almost complete. The IAEA reports that Iran will use the TRR to test fuel for the IR-40 reactor, a reactor that the UN Security Council has demanded that Iran stop building because it could be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. The IAEA report states that [...] "on 26 November 2012, the Agency verified a prototype IR-40 natural uranium fuel assembly before its transfer to TRR for irradiation testing." [...] Since its last visit on 17 August 2011, the Agency has not been provided with further access to the plant so <b>is</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> satellite imagery to monitor the status of the plant.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Berghuis v. Thompkins that a {{criminal}} suspect must now invoke {{the right to}} remain silent unambiguously. Unless and until the suspect actually states that he <b>is</b> <b>relying</b> <b>on</b> that right, police may continue to interact with (or question) him, and any voluntary statement he makes can be used in court. The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked those rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply, even after lengthy silence, can be construed as implying a waiver. The new rule will defer to police in cases where the suspect fails to [...] assert {{the right to remain}} silent. This standard was extended in [...] in 2013 to cases where individuals not in custody who volunteer to answer officers' questions and who are not told their Miranda rights. The Court stated that there was no [...] "ritualistic formula" [...] necessary to assert this privilege, but that a person could not do so [...] "by simply standing mute." ...|$|E
