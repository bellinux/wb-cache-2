40|$|The Environmental Sciences Program is an {{interdisciplinary}} undergraduate {{program at the}} University of Iowa. It includes faculty from the Departments of Anthropology, Geography, Biology, Geoscience, Chemistry, and Civil and Environmental Engineering. Students pursuing a BS in Environmental Sciences can pursue one of four tracks: Biosciences, Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, or <b>Hydrosciences.</b> The four tracks are very different, however there is some overlap with elective courses {{and there is a}} set of required foundations courses that all students must take. The interdisciplinary nature of any environmental science topic requires a student to have access to resources across many disciplines. This potential overlap in information needs lead to the decision to create one LibGuide for the Environmental Sciences Program. This guide will serve as a general guide to environmental resources for all {{of the students in the}} program. Future guides may be created that focus on resources for each of the four specific tracks in the Environmental Sciences Program...|$|R
40|$|Abstract –The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} two fold: i) to gauge the current state of instruction of stochastic theory for water resources in US universities and thereby identify the potential for curriculum improvement and ii) to demonstrate a proof of concept of a computer-assisted Graphical User Interface (GUI) to improve the current state of learning in the classroom of stochastic theory for <b>hydrosciences.</b> Our study indicates that 84 % of the total 241 relevant courses surveyed are available only at the graduate level, while 4. 5 % and 11. 5 % were either dual-listed or undergraduate-level courses, respectively. It is worthwhile for the CE educators to consider creating more undergraduate variants of such courses and offer them to students early in their education experience. To further popularize stochastic theory education in context of water resources, more computer-assisted graphics-based schemes should also be used in the undergraduate classroom. The illustration provided herein is a GUI that connects a comprehensive space-time stochastic model for generating rainfall fields that exhibit complex natural variability. Our main finding, based on on-going educational software development, is that effective instructional software building requires evolution from the simplest configuration if its continual upgrade is to continue in liaison with student software developers that are usually available from a computer science department of the university...|$|R
40|$|Monthly {{rainfall}} data in Burkina-Faso, West Africa, over {{a period}} of 77 years are extracted from three different gridded data sets, available either on the web: CRU (Climatic Research Unit, Norwich, UK), SIEREM (<b>HydroSciences</b> Montpellier, France), or from the National Meteorological Center of Burkina-Faso. With a view to model the runoff-rainfall relationship at the monthly time step, these data are used at the 0. 5 ↓ 0. 5 ↓ scale. The three grids have very similar means, standard deviation and interannual variability for the period 1922 to 1998, but some differences are observed which lead to significantly different runoff-rainfall simulations. These differences are linked to the absolute values: the more important the rainfalls are, the less the differences are; and to the density of the rainfall station network which also has a strong influence on the areal rainfall estimation, that can be worked out between 2 to 12 %, according to the data sets used. The conclusion is that it is recommended to use as many stations as possible to better assess areal rainfall. These biases have a strong influence on the results of the runoff-rainfall modelling (using the GR 2 M conceptual model) : the Nash criteria show differences of about 20 % and calculated flow of 30 % to 40 %. This study illustrates the levels of uncertainty when using available rainfall gridded data sets, for rainfall-runoff studies in West African developing countries, which is important in the context of predicting water resources for the future from the GCM outputs for the XXIst century...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{performed a}} sustainability assessment of supply chains of the anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) in Peru. The corresponding fisheries lands 6. 5 million t per year, of which < 2 % is rendered into products for {{direct human consumption}} (DHC) and 98 % reduced into feed ingredients (fishmeal and fish oil, FMFO), for export. Several industries compete for the anchoveta resources, generating local and global impacts. The need for understanding these dynamics, towards sustainability-improving management and policy recommendations, determined {{the development of a}} sustainability assessment framework: 1) characterisation and modelling of the systems under study (with Life Cycle Assessment and other tools) including local aquaculture, 2) calculation of sustainability indicators (i. e. energy efficiency, nutritional value, socio-economic performances), and 3) sustainability comparison of supply chains; definition and comparison of alternative exploitation scenarios. Future exploitation scenarios were defined by combining an ecosystem and a material flow models: continuation of the status quo (Scenario 1), shift towards increased proportion of DHC production (Scenario 2), and radical reduction of the anchoveta harvest in order for other fish stocks to recover and be exploited for DHC (Scenario 3). Scenario 2 was identified as the most sustainable. Management and policy recommendations include improving of: controls for compliance with management measures, sanitary conditions for DHC, landing infrastructure for small- and medium-scale (SMS) fisheries; the development of a national refrigerated distribution chain; and the assignation of flexible tolerances for discards from different DHC processes.

This work forms part of the dissertation research of MR. 0 SPIE-SOC PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS BELLINGHAM J APPL REMOTE SENSSatellite radar altimeter measurements of lake and reservoir water levels complement in situ observations by providing stage information for ungauged basins and by filling data gaps in existing gauge records. Such additional measurements assist both research and operational programs. However, for a particular lake or reservoir, altimetric products offered to end-users may differ due to choice of employed instrument, processing technique, and applied geophysical corrections. To explore these differences, particularly with their potential impact on climate-based research, an intercomparison of three web-based water-level products (produced by Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et Oceanographie Spatiale, National Aeronautics and Space Administration/United States Department of Agriculture, and European Space Agency/De Montfort University) has been undertaken based on 18 lakes and reservoirs. The products are well correlated with each other (r = 0. 87 to 0. 99) and where in situ data are available are quite well correlated with the gauge measurements (r = 0. 73 to 0. 99). Despite variations in data processing, the poorest root-mean-square differences between any altimeter product and gauge data (similar to 0. 20 to 1. 41 m) occur for the narrow reservoirs and smaller lakes. The largest discrepancies between the altimeter products occur for the lakes that freeze (Lake Athabasca and Woods). The current altimeter products provide acceptable accuracy, long-term trends and seasonality for climate applications. We discuss the merits of each product system, but recommend further validations and the provision of ice-detection flags. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

As {{a test of the}} veracity of MFE and to examine if this theory of self-adjusting channel morphodynamics can be practically applied to large river systems, this study examines the degree of correspondence between theoretically determined equilibrium channel geometries and actual measurements along the middle and lower Yangtze River.

40|$|One can use {{unlicensed}} {{and often}} very inexpensive radios for unconventional communication (underwater- and underground) links. However, one can go further, and use these radios as sensors rather than communication links. Such communication links and sensors can have important application in <b>hydroscience.</b> While the attenuation of RF signals {{is high in}} these mediums, by using the wireless sensor network (WSN) paradigm of multi-hop and retransmission, reliable networks can be formed underwater and underground. One no longer needs to think of RF modules as only a source of data transmission. This revelation lends itself to thinking of these modules as inexpensive RF wave generators at prescribed unlicensed frequencies. Analyzing the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of a link over time, one can infer changes in the medium from the changes in RSSI. In this thesis, I develop a simple mathematical model to relate changes in RSSI {{to changes in the}} medium. Additionally, five experimentally validated examples demonstrate the possibility of non-traditional uses for RF modules. Demonstrated sensor possibilities include soil moisture estimation, leaf wetness measurement, and vegetation water content estimation.

This group {{put in place a}} plan to fund and construct 154 farm ponds in an effort to provide water for agriculture practices as well as provide flood protection for the residents inside the Soap Creek watershed. Through collaborative efforts and funding from federal, state, and local sources, to date 132 ponds have been constructed. Currently there is no stream monitoring in place in the watershed to observe stream conditions. This leads to no stored data on the benefits of the projects in the basin and the reduced flood impacts. With funding from the Iowa Watershed Projects (IWP) through the IIHR - <b>Hydroscience</b> 2 ̆ 6 Engineering lab, a lumped parameter surface water model was created to show the benefits of the constructed projects. Using detailed LiDAR data, a Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model was created. This model used arcHydro and ARC-GeoHMS, tools in ARCgis. Detailed LiDAR, SURGGO soil data, and land cover data was used to create the model parameters.

40|$|This is the {{accepted}} manuscript version. The final version {{is available from}} Elsevier at [URL] paper presents a new volume-of-fluid scheme (M-CICSAM), capable of capturing abrupt interfaces on meshes of arbitrary topology, which is a modification to the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes (CICSAM) proposed in the recent literature. Without resort to any explicit interface reconstruction, M-CICSAM is able to precisely model the complex free surface deformation, such as interface rupture and coalescence. By theoretical analysis, it is shown that the modified CICSAM overcomes three inherent drawbacks of the original CICSAM, concerning the basic differencing schemes, the switching strategy between the compressive downwind and diffusive high-resolution schemes, and the far-upwind reconstruction technique on arbitrary unstructured meshes. To evaluate {{the performance of the}} newly proposed scheme, several classic interface capturing methods developed in the past decades are compared with M-CICSAM in four test problems. The numerical results clearly demonstrate that M-CICSAM produces more accurate predictions on arbitrary meshes, especially at high Courant numbers, by reducing the numerical diffusion and preserving the interface shape.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the controls and functions of the software hydrological modeling CCHED - MECH simulation of flow and sediment transport in rivers. CCHE is an integrated software package developed at the National Center for Computational <b>Hydroscience</b> and Engineering, the University of Mississippi. It is a general model for 2 and 3 -dimensional simulation and analysis of river flows, dam break flows, non-uniform sediment transport, morphologic processes, coastal processes, pollutant transport and water quality. These processes are solved with the depth integrated Reynolds equations, mass transport equations, sediment sorting equation, bed load and bed deformation equations. This model is based on Efficient Element Method, a collocation approach of the Weighted Residual Method. Internal hydraulic structures, such as dams, gates and weirs, can be formulated and simulated synchronously with the flow. Dry and wet capability enables one to simulate flows with complex topography with ease. Three turbulence closure schemes, depth-averaged parabolic, mixing length eddy viscosity models and k- e model, and available. The numerical scheme can handle subcritical, supercritical flows and their transition. For these aspects, its use seems to fit the needs of simulation for semi-arid regions, where rainfall is sporadic and torrential difficult modeling. Pages: 244 - 25...|$|E

Environmental Protection Agency {{sponsored}} a "National Workshop on the Verification of Water Quality Models" {{to evaluate the}} state-of-the-art of water quality modeling and make specific recommendations for the direction of future modeling efforts. Participants represented a broad cross-section of practitioners of water quality modeling in sections of government, academia, industry and private practice. The issues discussed during this workshop, which was held in West Point, N. Y., on 7 - 9 March 1979, were models in decision making, model data bases, modeling framework and software validation, model parameter estimation, model verification and models as projection tools. These issues were discussed by workshop participants who were organized into small groups, each of which discussed {{the state of the}} art of a specific branch of water quality modeling. Groups were divided into areas of wasteload generation, transport, salinity-TDS, dissolved oxygen-temperature, bacteria-virus, eutrophication and hazardous substances. Workshop findings were summarized by committee reporters and are presented in state-of-the-art reports.

The finite element (FE) reliability method combines FE analysis with state-of-the-art methods in reliability analysis and has been employed increasingly to estimate the probability of occurrence of failure events corresponding to various hazard levels (e. g., earthquakes with various intensity). In this paper, crucial components for FE reliability analysis are reviewed and summarized. Furthermore, recent advances in both time invariant and time variant reliability analysis methods for realistic nonlinear SSI systems are presented and applied to a two-dimensional two story building on layered soil. Various time invariant reliability analysis methods are applied, including the first-order reliability method (FORM), importance sampling method, and orthogonal plane sampling (OPS) method. For time variant reliability analysis, an upper bound of the failure probability is obtained from numerical integration of the mean outcrossing rate (MOCR). The MOCR is computed by using FORM analysis and OPS analysis. Results by different FE reliability methods are compared in terms of accuracy and computational cost. This paper provides valuable insights for reliability based probabilistic performance and risk assessment of SSI systems...|$|E

The adopted BRB model, shown in an earlier study to give accurate predictions of the experimental behaviour of BRBs, is differentiated with respect to its material constitutive parameters using the direct differentiation method (DDM) and the obtained response sensitivities are validated by comparisons with the finite difference method (FDM). Results for a case study consisting of a steel frame with BRBs subjected to seismic input are reported to illustrate the influence on global and local structural response quantities of the BRB constitutive parameters. In addition, the derived response sensitivities are used in a simulated finite element model updating problem to show the efficiency of DDM over FDM. This work opens the way to many applications and potentialities such as sensitivity analysis of complex BRB design solutions, performance-based selection of optimal BRB properties, development and use of optimization-based design procedures.

The {{suppression}} of wildfires {{has created the}} opportunities for catastrophic wildfires, which can increase suspended-sediment, stream temperature, stream flows, erosion and sedimentation in surrounding waterways. Burn Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) has utilized {{a number of different}} treatments to minimize these effects following a wildfire. Induced meandering is a new concept that utilizes rock structures to promote the stabilization of incised degrading channels, by simulating river riffles, elevating channel bottoms, establishing channel slope, to encourage channel meander and the formation of an active floodplain. This project evaluates the effectiveness of rock baffles, one-rock dams, and aerial seeding in stabilizing an incised discontinuous gully channel post wildfire. The methods used to evaluate the effects of treatment include photo documentation, vegetation percent cover, cross-sectional measurements, streambed geology, and a riparian habitat assessment. Results of the photo documentation of the channel illustrate that meandering is clearly happening, while cross-sectional data suggests the channel has stabilized. Vegetation percent cover and streambed geology support these findings. Photo documentation and vegetation percent ground cover suggest that aerial seeding on the upland slopes was successful. The riparian habitat assessment confirms that gullies are not suitable riparian habitat. Continued monitoring, research and understanding of induced meandering and other rehabilitation treatments are needed to provide the best possible treatment of post wildfires...|$|E

The deterministic responses of representative sluice piers are computed through static pushover and dynamic analyses. The probabilistic uncertainty analysis, including time invariant and time variant reliability analyses, is based on finite element (FE) reliability theory. For time invariant case, the material and loading parameters are considered as random variables, including elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, mass density and pushover forces. For time variant case, the earthquake history is simulated by using random process, and the first-order reliability method (FORM) approximation combined with Koo's analytical solution is used to compute the mean upcrossing rate for given performance functions, through which the failure probabilities are calculated. Based on the analysis results using these two methods, the safety and reliability of the dam is assessed. Furthermore, the performance assessments of the dam in its current state are compared {{with those in the}} original state (i. e. when the dam was built) to quantify its performance degradation. Finally, the assessment results of using the deterministic and probabilistic methods are compared, and the discrepancies between them are quanti fied and explained.

Water resources issues of a local or regional nature are in the news almost every day. As competition for limited water resources intensifies, major economic decisions, both locally and regionally, will be controlled by the availability of usable quantities of ground and surface water. The urbanization of the Albuquerque area has changed the natural workings of its surrounding watersheds. Water quality, vegetation and erosion patterns have been altered by the vast amount of impervious surfaces present within the city. With this altered state of the physical surface, there are also changes in the runoff characteristics within Albuquerque watersheds. The 1995 report by Kyle Harwood titled "The Urban Stormwater Contribution of Dissolved Trace Metals from the North Diversion Floodway Channel, Albuquerque, NM to the Rio Grande", examines the metal contribution of the North Diversion Channel into the Rio Grande. The metals that Harwood examined are dissolved copper, dissolved aluminum and dissolved zinc. This project will analyze contaminant loading to the Rio Grande from the North Diversion Channel watershed and focus on the Embudo sub watershed, as it relates to this loading. Embudo was selected because it originates in the relatively undeveloped Cibola National Forest and is prone to flooding and erosion...|$|E

Many of {{the lakes}} and reservoirs {{in the world}} are adversely affected by eutrophication. In order to counter this trend, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEP A) had developed numeric nutrient criteria for use by the States and Tribes. The USEP A has based their criteria on Level III ecoregions and their aggregated ecoregions. This pr~ject seeks to determine the validity of using these USEP A recommendations in the State of New Mexico to replace the State's current narrative nutrient criteria. This project will also offer nutrient criteria recommendations for four criteria variables: total nitrogen, total phosphorus, Secchi depth, and chlorophyll-a, based on three other lake classification schemes, the first one based on surface area, the second on elevation, and the third on surface area to drainage area ratio. The water bodies of interest in this study are the mainstem reservoirs of New Mexico with surface areas greater than 1, 000 acres. Using the Carlson trophic state index as a guide, this study finds that the Level III ecoregion approach to lake classification has the most potential to preserve, and possibly improve, the current trophic states of the reservoirs in New Mexico. This result and the recommendations for future work will be used by the State of New Mexico {{as a starting point for}} the development of numeric nutrient criteria...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} aim of {{my previous}} paper ’Stochastic models in hydrology’ (Beaumont, 1979) was to introduce physical geographers {{to the large}} number of stochastic streamflow models. That experience gained over the past 15 years in analysing univariate geophysical time series may be utilized in other spheres of physical geography. It is recognized that hydrology is the ’statistical earth science par excellence ’ (Lloyd, 1974). This ’follow-up ’ reviews current research in this area, highlighting the recent extensions and improvements of models described earlier (Beaumont, 1979) to preserve historical flow statistics, and discusses an important new technique in synthetic streamflow generation and the first steps towards a theoretical foundation to simulation studies. While the earlier paper was concerned with an exposition of the popular hydrological models which maintained the ’desirable ’ characteristics of flow by considering only the streamflow series, it was suggested that future model development should be founded on basic conceptual notions of the hydrological system. It is pertinent therefore to describe briefly a number of techniques which have been adopted in rainfall-runoff models, particularly emphasizing the use of state space models. This is seen only as a first step in developing overall catchment stochastic models but is important since such models may often be extended to multivariable situations. Finally, the extended papers of Chow and Klemes outlining recent advances in <b>hydroscience</b> are discussed, for it is hoped that they may prove seminal in the development of stochastic hydrology in the 1980 s. This work is not only crucial to the future of hydrology but has important implications for the analysis of environmental systems, currently popular amongs...|$|E

Lotic {{ecosystems}} of {{the southwestern}} U. S. can be severely affected by wildfires causing alterations in water chemistry, sedimentation from runoff events, {{and changes in}} macro invertebrate community structure. In these same systems, the use of prescribed burns as forest and/or grassland management tools also may cause changes. The severity of these changes in comparison to wildfires is of primary importance {{to the effectiveness of}} these management tools, as any degradation of aquatic habitats is of serious concern in a semi-arid region. This study evaluates the effects of a recent prescribed burn in the Valle Toledo section of the Valles Caldera National Preserve, November 2005. Factors affecting the outcome of the burn, including a marked lack of winter precipitation, are discussed and data are presented on changes in water chemistry, sedimentation, and macro invertebrate assemblages, or the lack thereof, from pre-burn to post-burn and post-snowmelt conditions. Results of the study show no major overall degradation of the aquatic habitats in this area, although some localized changes did occur. Elevation of stream nitrate/nitrite concentrations were observed in the burn stream immediately post-burn, which did not decline until late spring. Carbon/nitrogen analysis of stream sediments revealed a localized effect of C:N ratio increase at snowmelt at two of the burn sampling sites. Macroinvertebrate assemblages were mostly unaltered immediately after the burn, though some decline in taxa richness and Jaccard's similarity within the burn stream were observed at snowmelt. Continued monitoring will be needed to determine if these effects are mitigated and how quickly...|$|E
