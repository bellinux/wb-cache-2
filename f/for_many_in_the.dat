5|$|Returning to Salisbury in January 1980, Mugabe {{was greeted}} by a {{supportive}} crowd. He settled into a house in Mount Pleasant, a wealthy white-dominated suburb. Machel had cautioned Mugabe not to alienate Rhodesia's white minority, warning him that any white flight after the election would cause economic damage {{as it had in}} Mozambique. Accordingly, during his electoral campaign Mugabe avoided the use of Marxist and revolutionary rhetoric. Mugabe insisted that in the election, ZANU would stand as a separate party to ZAPU, and refused Nkomo's request for a meeting. He formed ZANU into a political party, known as Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). Predictions were made that ZANU-PF would win the election {{on the basis of the}} country's ethnic divisions; Mugabe was Shona, a community that made up around 70% of the country's population, while Nkomo was Ndebele, a tribal group who made up only around 20%. <b>For</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> white community and in the British government, this outcome was a terrifying prospect due to Mugabe's avowed Marxist beliefs and the inflammatory comments that he had made about whites during the guerrilla war.|$|E

25|$|When the {{population}} settled down the society greatly changed, first coexisting {{with the older}} societies, later absorbing them. Trade became much more important, a political institution elected by the people came into existence, the very same institution whose successor is the current County Council. Jämtland got its name and a somewhat hierarchical social structure emerged, though, as already pointed out, Jämtland never had an upper class. Strong families such as Skanke and Blix did exist though and on the countryside in Jämtland people still live in networks of relatives, families. Where they provide a second social security <b>for</b> <b>many,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of Sweden and in e.g. Östersund this has completely or almost entirely been replaced by public welfare.|$|E

25|$|Although {{ritualism}} had {{an aesthetic}} and ideological appeal <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cultural elite, {{and had a}} cognate relationship with the Gothic Revival, {{the idea that it}} was inextricably linked with an inclination towards political despotism was a misapprehension. Ritualism had an appeal for many who were politically conservative and had supporters highly placed in the establishment (e.g. Viscount Halifax and the 4th Marquess of Bath). However, the outlook of many of the ritualist clergy themselves, many of whom inevitably operated {{in some of the most}} deprived communities in England, resulted in their becoming politically radicalised by the experience – some became ardent Christian Socialists.|$|E
25|$|Nureyev's {{production}} of La Bayadère was presented {{for the first}} time at the Palais Garnier (or the Paris Opéra) on October 8, 1992 with Isabelle Guérin as Nikiya, Laurent Hilaire as Solor, and Élisabeth Platel as Gamzatti (and was later filmed in 1994 and released onto DVD/video with the same cast). The theatre was filled with many of the most prominent people of the ballet world, along with throngs of newspaper and television reporters from around the world. The production was a resounding success, with Nureyev being honored with the prestigious Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Minister of Culture. The premiere of Nureyev's production was a special occasion <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world of ballet, as only three months later he died.|$|E
25|$|The major {{sticking}} point <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> question of human evolution was whether human mental faculties could have possibly been evolved. The gap {{between humans and}} even the smartest ape seemed too large, {{even for those who}} were sympathetic to Darwin's basic theory. Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection, believed that the human mind was too complex to have evolved gradually, and began over time to subscribe to a theory of evolution that took more from spiritualism than it did the natural world. Darwin was deeply distressed by Wallace's change of heart, and much of the Descent of Man is in response to opinions put forth by Wallace. Darwin focuses less {{on the question of whether}} humans evolved than he does on showing that each of the human faculties considered to be so far beyond those of beasts—such as moral reasoning, sympathy for others, beauty, and music—can be seen in kind (if not degree) in other animal species (usually apes and dogs).|$|E

25|$|Passive {{crossovers}} {{are commonly}} installed inside speaker boxes and {{are by far}} the most usual type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances, and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hi-fi world. When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active crossovers, usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, dynamic range compression and limiting) control.|$|E
500|$|Beyond the {{scientific}} community, Pluto still holds cultural significance <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general public {{due to its}} historical classification as a planet from 1930 to 2006.

500|$|Retaining winds {{in excess}} of 120km/h (75mph), Cyclone Alby brought {{damaging}} winds {{to much of the}} region in and around Cape Leeuwin. The highest winds reached 150km/h (90mph) in Albany. In Perth, a peak gust of 130km/h (80mph) was measured, the third-highest in the city's history. The intense winds, considered unprecedented <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, were attributed to the fast movement of the storm and its location in relation to land. Moving at speeds up to , winds along the northeastern edge of the storm were increased by that amount due to Alby's clockwise rotation. It also allowed for winds to cover a large area northeast of the centre, impacting many areas far from the storm. In general, rainfall was limited and generally less than this was due to the fast movement, as well as the asymmetrical structure with most of the thunderstorms south of the center.|$|E

500|$|The Iraqi {{capture of}} Khafji {{was a major}} {{propaganda}} victory for Iraq: on 30 January Iraqi radio claimed that they had [...] "expelled Americans from the Arab territory". <b>For</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arab world, the battle of Khafji {{was seen as an}} Iraqi victory, and Hussein made every possible effort to turn the battle into a political victory. On the other side, confidence within the United States Armed Forces in the abilities of the Saudi and Kuwaiti armies increased as the battle progressed. After Khafji, the Coalition's leadership began to sense that the Iraqi Army was a [...] "hollow force" [...] and it provided them with an impression of the degree of resistance they would face during the Coalition's ground offensive that would begin later that month. The battle was also a major propaganda victory for Saudi Arabia, which had successfully defended its territory.|$|E

2500|$|Racial {{desegregation}} {{became a}} tough issue <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rowan County Schools system.

2500|$|Other legal {{factors that}} have been {{implemented}} to end and reduce child labour includes the global response that came into force in 1979 by the declaration of the International Year of the Child. Along with the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations, these two declarations worked on many levels to eliminate child labour. Although many actions {{have been taken to}} end this epidemic, child labour in Africa is still an issue today due to the unclear definition of adolescence and how much time is needed for children to engage in activities that are crucial for their development. [...] Another issue that often comes into play is the link between what constitutes as child labour within the household due to the cultural acceptance of children helping run the family business. [...] In the end, there is a consistent challenge for the national government to strengthen its grip politically on child labour, and to increase education and awareness on the issue of children working below the legal age limit. With children playing {{an important role in the}} African economy, child labour still plays an important role <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|There was progress, too in {{encouraging}} {{political and social}} involvement of women. Positions of responsibility such as [...] "assistant class leader", [...] "class leader", and above, were open to all who had the necessary reading and writing skills; men and women. One of the Baptist's cherished principles was of church self-government in which everyone was entitled to vote in elections and petitioning, which provided the first opportunity <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community to have their voice heard. This {{was one of the}} earliest routes through which the labouring poor began to have political influence. Progress was sometimes painfully slow, however, particularly for those who sought immediate self-government. At Samuel Oughton's chapel, Eleanor Vickars, an African assistant class-leader whose father {{is believed to have been}} a deacon, successfully stood for election as class-leader but did not meet the literacy requirement necessary for confirmation of her appointment. Samuel Oughton had to decide between the Baptist's cherished principles of self-government or upholding the literacy entry requirements arising from the hope that education would be [...] "the great leveller". In the event, he avoided setting a precedent and called for both beliefs to be upheld equally, a route that did successfully lead to self-determination by African congregations.|$|E
6000|$|Instances, also, {{of later}} times might be given of a call {{extraordinary}} to suffer for righteousness. <b>For</b> <b>many,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first three hundred years' persecution, when {{nobody knew what}} they were, would boldly {{come up to the}} face of their enemies and tell what they were, and suffer for what they professed, the death. I remember, also, the woman who, when her friends were gone before to suffer, how she came running and panting after, for fear she should not come thither time enough to suffer for Jesus Christ. But I will give you an instance of later times, even in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign, of an Hertfordshire man that went as far as Rome to bear his testimony for God against the wickedness of that place. This man, when he was arrived there, and had told them wherefore he was come, they took and condemned him to death, to wit, to be burned for an heretic. Now he was to ride from the prison to the place of execution upon an ass, with his face to the beast's tail, and was to be stripped from the shoulders to the waist, that he might be tormented all the way he went with burning torches continually thrust to his sides; but he, nothing at all afraid, spake in his exhortation to the people to fly from their sin and idolatry; he would also catch hold of the torches and put them to his sides, to show how little he esteemed the worst that they could do. Also, when he was come to the place of execution, he suffered there such cruelty, with so unconcerned a mind, and with such burning zeal for God's truth, testified against them while he could speak; that, all amazed, his enemies cried, he could not have suffered as he did but by the help of the devil. His name I have now forgot, but you will find it, with the story at large, in the third volume of Acts and Monuments, at the 1022 page. 34 But we will pass this, and come to our second particular, namely, ...|$|E
