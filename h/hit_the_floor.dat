Saunders scored 17points with 19 rebounds, his first of a long streak of double-doubles. This game was also the second and final game of B.J.

5|$|At Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Rock {{entered the}} Royal Rumble match {{and was one}} of the final two remaining, along with Big Show; Show {{seemingly}} intended to throw The Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, but Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before re-entering the ring as the winner. However, The Rock's feet <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> first, although those watching the event on TV did not see that, until Big Show proved this with additional video footage, and claimed to be the rightful winner. Despite this proof, the original decision could not be reversed, so a number one contender's match for the WWF Championship was held at No Way Out, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered and hit The Rock in the head with a steel chair as he attempted to execute a People's Elbow. The Rock defeated Big Show on March 13 episode of Raw Is War to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley. Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife, Stephanie, Foley had Linda, The Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane. Triple H retained the title after Vince betrayed The Rock by hitting him with a chair.|$|E

After Steiner performed a belly to belly suplex, Steve Williams rang the bell, confusing Steiner and the referee. Sullivan {{was released from the}} cage, and climbed on the apron. Steiner sent Rotunda into Sullivan, and pinned Rotunda to win the match and the title.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} match {{of the night}} female wrestler Estrellita tried to perform a Moonsault to the floor, a move which she leaps off the top rope and flips over, {{unfortunately}} she {{was not able to}} actually get enough distance on the leap to hit her target and instead <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> face first without anyone being able to try to protect her during the move. Shortly after the accident the match ended with La Amapola, Princesa Blanca and Princesa Sujei winning the match in two straight falls, allowing Estrellita to be helped to the back shortly after hitting the floor.|$|E
25|$|A {{practice}} alert {{had been}} carried out {{earlier in the day}} within the town, and when the aircraft were finally spotted and an alert sounded, many people ignored the warning believing it to be another practice drill. 46 bombs were dropped over Gillingham and Chatham causing much damage. The Drill Hall suffered a direct hit. The bomb shattered the glass roof, sending dangerous shards of glass flying through the drill hall before exploding when they <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> The clock upon the drill hall tower stopped at 11.12, giving the exact time the bomb exploded. The men asleep or resting inside had little chance of survival, those that were not injured from the explosion were cut to pieces by the falling pieces of glass from the roof.|$|E

25|$|Mayweather {{controlled}} the fight from the beginning, knocking Hatton {{out in the}} 10th round to retain the welterweight championship. Hatton suffered a cut over his right eye in round three; from that point, his pace and movement began to slow. In round six, Hatton lost a point for punching the back of Mayweather's head as he was draped over the ropes. During the tenth round, Hatton was caught by a checked left hook thrown from Mayweather's hip; after falling headfirst into the turnbuckle, he <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Hatton made it to his feet, but was dazed. Two more lefts in quick succession knocked Hatton down again, and referee Cortez stopped the fight at 1:35 of round ten. Official scorecards read 88–82, 89–81, and 89–81 {{at the time of}} stoppage, all in favor of Mayweather.|$|E
25|$|After the serve, {{the players}} take turns {{hitting the ball}} against the front wall, above the tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or back walls at any time, {{as long as it}} hits below the out line. It must not <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> after hitting the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line {{along the top of the}} tin is {{considered}} to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (and any number of times against the side or back walls) before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot.|$|E

5|$|Lost Luggage is {{an action}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} skycap porters who are attempting to collect falling luggage from a wildly unpredictable baggage carousel.

If all of the player's suitcases are lost, the game ends.|$|R
50|$|Catch It If You Can: The player stands {{facing away}} from a ball held in a clamp at a certain height above <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Higher target numbers reduce this height.

50|$|The {{original}} US video {{release from}} Artisan Entertainment was heavily edited for content.

500|$|Music {{critics have}} {{described}} True Colours upon its release {{as a single}} as [...] "the most brutal thing Gallows has done." [...] Andrew Ford of <b>Hit</b> <b>The</b> <b>Floor</b> Magazine considered it a [...] "36 second middle finger {{to all those who}} have suggested {{this is the end of}} the road for the Watford lads." [...] Something which both critics and Wade MacNeil himself have acknowledged is his distinct tone of voice from Frank Carter even to the point in which their fan base could be divided over the decision to have Wade in the band. Wade wanted the EP and the future lyrics of Gallows records to have a much more global view. Believing that the band's second studio album Grey Britain had too much of a British perspective.|$|E
500|$|The game's visuals {{were highly}} praised by reviewers.

500|$|The {{trend in}} {{improved}} graphics continued {{well into the}} next release, Age of Empires III, much to the delight of reviewers. IGN stated, [...] "After seeing the screenshots, our jaws <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> at the amount of detail." [...] 1UP.com described Age of Empires III as [...] "one of the most beautiful games you will put on your computer for the foreseeable future." [...] GameSpy agreed, stating, [...] "Age IIIs graphics are unmatched in the strategy genre." [...] Age of Empires III builds on and introduces new features to the prior release, Age of Mythology, such as the inclusion of the award-winning Havok physics simulation middleware game engine for the Windows version and PhysX for the Mac OS X. The innovative result is that pre-created animations are avoided; instead events are calculated according to the physics engine. Consequently, views of events like building destruction and tree felling are not pre-recorded. GameSpot also admired the graphics in the fourth release but complained about [...] "the awkward unit behavior." [...] Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.|$|E

50|$|Another feud {{heading into}} No Way Out was between The Rock and Big Show over who {{should get the}} chance to face for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania 2000. The feud began at the Royal Rumble in the Royal Rumble match, The Rock and Big Show were the last two {{competitors}} in the match both trying to throw each other over the rope. Both wrestlers fell out of <b>the</b> ring <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> with <b>The</b> Rock <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> first, but <b>the</b> officials thought Big Show <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground first, making The Rock the winner of the Royal Rumble. The next night on Raw Is War, Big Show complained that it was no fair that nobody saw what happened so he got evidence and sent it to Triple H, who would later make a match between The Rock and Big Show at No Way Out where the winner would get a WWF Championship title shot at WrestleMania.|$|R
5000|$|If the served ball {{lands in}} front of the short line, it is called a [...] "short," [...] while a serve which reaches the back wall without {{bouncing}} is called [...] "long," [...] and a serve which hits both side walls before <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> is called a [...] "3-wall." [...] These are all types of errors known as service faults. After one service fault the server will serve again. If <b>the</b> server <b>hits</b> two faults in a row, he or she is out and becomes the receiver. However, if any serve <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> ceiling, <b>floor,</b> or a side wall before <b>hitting</b> <b>the</b> front wall, the server is out (no second serve allowed).|$|R
500|$|For the game's cover, Acclaim hired Italian male model Fabio Lanzoni to pose as Kuros; Fabio was {{presented}} {{on the cover}} bare-chested and without armor. When Zippo Games saw {{the image of the}} cover a week prior to its release, they were perplexed. According to Ste Pickford, [...] "Our jaws <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> when we first saw this image (which was, being merely the developers, probably about a week before the game's release). Why on earth did they choose a photograph of a bare-chested barbarian to promote a game starring a knight in shining armour?". Pickford added that [...] "We used it {{as an example of the}} lack of imagination of Americans", while suggesting that having an actual suit or armor would be too costly to use for a photo shoot. Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was released by Acclaim for the NES in North America in December1989 and in Europe and Australia in 1991. It managed to sell about 500,000 copies in North America and about 50,000 copies in Europe. Following the game's release, Zippo Games would proceed to develop its next game for Rare, they would eventually also release the third installment in the Wizards & Warriors series, [...]|$|E

2500|$|SuperLuchas Magazine writer Israel Velazquez {{noted that}} the fifth match of the night was the best match of the night, which {{included}} both great team work and spectacular flying moves.
