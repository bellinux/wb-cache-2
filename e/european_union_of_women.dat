50|$|According to data by UNICEF, 52% of the Greek {{population}} {{is made up}} <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> According to World Bank, {{the proportion of the}} labor force that is female increased from 36.1% in 1990 to 42.8% in 2014. In 2001, Greece had the second largest gender employment gap <b>of</b> the <b>European</b> <b>Union.</b> <b>Of</b> the <b>women</b> that have jobs within the formal sector, most of them live in large urban cities. Within the rural areas <b>of</b> Greece, <b>women</b> have found it particularly difficult to receive jobs in any area other than farm work. The low number <b>of</b> <b>women</b> that have jobs in rural communities could partially be due to the high levels of sexual harassment that they face on the job site. Another explanation for low involvement in the workforce is that adequate laws protecting women from sexual violence were not enacted until 1984.|$|R
