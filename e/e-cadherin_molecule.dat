Nanomolar concentrations of AZA- 1 reduced MCF- 7 cell proliferation and impaired cell-cell adhesion. AZA- 1 altered the cellular pool of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin by inducing a dose- and time-dependent accumulation of an E-cadherin fragment (E-cadherin– related antigen [ECRA 100]), with a concentration inducing the half-maximal effect (EC 50) of 0. 47 nM. The immunological char-acterization of ECRA 100 revealed that it consists of an <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecule</b> lacking the intracellular domain, and these data showed that the effect induced by AZA- 1 in MCF- 7 cells is undistinguish-able from that induced by yessotoxin (YTX) in the same experi-mental system.

5000|$|All {{epithelial}} cells express the transmembrane adhesion <b>molecule</b> <b>E-cadherin,</b> a cadherin which localises most prominently to the junction between the apical and lateral membranes. The extra-cellular domains of <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecules</b> from neighbouring cells bind {{to one another}} via a homotypic interaction. The intra-cellular domains of <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecules</b> bind to the actin cytoskeleton via the adaptor proteins alpha-catenin and beta-catenin. [...] Thus, E-cadherin forms adherens junctions that connect the actin cytoskeletons of neighbouring cells. Adherens junctions are the primary force-bearing junctions between {{epithelial cells}} and are fundamentally important for maintaining epithelial cell shape and for dynamic changes in shape during tissue development. How E-cadherin localizes to the boundary between apical and lateral membranes is not known, but polarized membranes are essential for maintaining E-cadherin at adherens junctions.|$|R
40|$|Cadherins are {{a family}} of transmembrane glycoproteins {{responsible}} for Ca 2 +-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Their amino acid sequences are highly conserved in the cytoplasmic domain. To study {{the role of the}} cytoplasmic domain in the function of cadherins, we constructed expression vectors with cDNAs encoding the deletion mutants of E-cadherin polypeptides, in which the carboxy terminus was truncated at various lengths. These vectors were introduced into L cells by transfection, and cell lines expressing the mutant <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecules</b> were isolated. In all transfectants obtained, the extracellular domain of the mutant E-cadherins was exposed on the cell surface, and had normal Ca 2 +-sensitivity and molecular size. However, these cells did not show any Ca 2 +-dependent aggregation, indicating that the mutant molecules cannot mediate cell-cell binding. The mutant <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecules</b> could be released from cells by nonionic detergents, whereas a fraction of normal <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecules</b> could not be extracted with the detergent and appeared to be anchored to the cytoskeleton at cell-cell junctions. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain regulates the cell-cell binding function of the extracellular domain of E-cadherin, possibly through interaction with some cytoskeletal components...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamic control}} of E-cadherin is {{critical}} for establishing and maintaining cell-cell junctions in epithelial cells.

40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} {{expression}} of E-cadherin in solid pseudopapillary tumours (SPT) of the pancreas using two monoclonal antibodies recognizing two different domains of the <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecule.</b> METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty cases of SPT were collected and a tissue microarray (TMA) constructed. The TMA was stained with commercially available antibodies to E-cadherin and beta-catenin. All 20 cases displayed nuclear beta-catenin as well as aberrant E-cadherin expression. With the antibody that stains the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin (clone 36, BD Transduction Laboratories), all 20 cases demonstrated nuclear E-cadherin reactivity, whereas with use of the antibody that recognizes the extracellular domain (clone 36 B 5, Vector Laboratories), no reactivity was observed {{in any of the}} cases. CONCLUSION: This study shows that aberrant beta-catenin and E-cadherin protein expression occurs in 100 % of SPT, is probably linked mechanistically to beta-catenin nuclear localization, and two distinct patterns of E-cadherin immunoreactivity are seen in SPT: nuclear (with the antibody against the cytoplasmic domain), or immunonegativity (complete loss) when stained with the antibody for the E-cadherin extracellular fragment...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} intercadherin {{interactions in}} epithelial A- 431 cells producing endogenous E-cadherin and recombinant forms of E-cadherin tagged either by myc or by flag epitopes. Three distinct E-cadherin complexes were found. The {{first is a}} conventional E-cadherin–catenin complex consisting of one <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecule</b> linked either to β-catenin/α-catenin or to plakoglobin/α-catenin dimers. The second is a lateral E-cadherin complex incorporating two E-cadherin– catenin conventional complexes combined in parallel fashion via dimerization of the NH 2 -terminal extracellular domain of E-cadherin. The third complex is likely to contain two E-cadherin–catenin conventional complexes derived from two opposing cells and arranged in an antiparallel fashion. Formation of the antiparallel but not lateral complex strictly depends on extracellular calcium and E-cadherin binding to catenins. Double amino acid substitution Trp 156 Ala/Val 157 Gly within the extracellular NH 2 -terminal E-cadherin domain completely abolished both lateral and antiparallel inter–E-cadherin association. These data support an idea that the antiparallel complex has the adhesion function.

The primary carcinoma samples from only three of these four patients showed reduced E-cadherin expression. In addition only two out of the three liver metastases examined showed reduced expression.

We report here that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin interacts with C 3 G, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap 1. In epithelial cell cultures, ligation of the extracellular domain of E-cadherin enhances Rap 1 activity, which in turn is necessary for the proper targeting of <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecules</b> to maturing cell-cell contacts.

40|$|Epidermal {{growth factor}} (EGF) mediates many pleiotrophic {{biological}} effects, {{one of which}} is alteration of cellular morphology. In the present study, we examine the possibility that this alteration in cell morphology is caused in part by the dysfunction of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion using the human oesophageal cancer cell line TE- 2 R, which expresses E-cadherin and EGF receptor. In the presence of EGF, TE- 2 R changed its shape from round to fibroblastic and its colony formation from compact to sparse. Vanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, further potentiated the EGF response, whereas herbimycin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, interfered with it. Moreover, EGF enabled the cells to invade in organotypic raft culture. These phenomena were accompanied not by decreased expression of the <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecule</b> but by a change in its localisation from the lateral adhesion site to the whole cell surface. Both alpha- and beta-catenin, cadherin-binding proteins, were also expressed at the same level throughout these morphological changes. Finally, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin and alpha- and beta-catenin, and observed tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin induced by EGF. These results suggest that EGF counteracts E-cadherin-mediated junctional assembly through phosphorylation of beta-catenin and modulates tumour cell behaviour to a more aggressive phenotype...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTHuman {{listeriosis}} {{is caused}} by the Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. In humans, this pathogen has the ability to cross the intestinal, placental and blood–brain barriers, leading to gastroenteritis, maternofetal infections and meningoencephalitis, respectively. The entry of L. monocytogenes into cultured human epithelial cells is mediated by the interaction of an L. monocytogenes surface protein, internalin, with its human receptor, E-cadherin. The internalin–E-cadherin interaction is species-specific, and relies on the nature of a single amino-acid in the <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecule,</b> which is proline in permissive species such as humans, and glutamic acid in non-permissive species such as the mouse. In a transgenic mouse model that expresses human E-cadherin in enterocytes, internalin allows L. monocytogenes to cross the intestinal barrier. Epidemiological evidence also supports a role for internalin in human listeriosis, not only for crossing the intestinal barrier, but also for targeting and crossing the placental and blood–brain barriers. Consistent with these epidemiological data, infection with L. monocytogenes of trophoblastic cell lines, primary trophoblast cultures and human placental villous explants demonstrates that bacterial invasion of the syncytiotrophoblast barrier is mediated by the internalin–E-cadherin interaction, leading to histopathological lesions that mimic those seen in the placentas of women with listeriosis. Thus, the internalin–E-cadherin interaction that {{plays a key role in}} the crossing of the intestinal barrier in humans is also exploited by L. monocytogenes to target and cross the placental barrier. Further investigations are currently focusing on the molecular mechanisms by which L. monocytogenes targets and crosses the blood–brain barrier...|$|E

The density of E-cadherin clusters was wide ranged, and notably, we could detect densities consistent with the crystal lattice structure at the core of adhesive clusters, which were dependent on extracellular domain interactions.

40|$|International audienceE-Cadherin-based Adherens Junctions (AJs) are a {{defining}} feature of all epithelial sheets.

In this review we focus on the recent advances highlighting the critical role of the apico-basal polarity machinery, and in particular of the Par 3 /Bazooka scaffold, in the regulation and remodeling of AJs.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that germline mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH 1) gene are linked to hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Despite the known molecular genetic causes, most gastric cancers are sporadic and poorly investigated for susceptibility genes. We report the finding of a novel germline missense mutation in exon 6, c. 820 G > A (p. G 274 S) in one sporadic gastric cancer patient. This new variant does not affect cryptic splicing of CDH 1 as demonstrated by molecular assay. Immunohistochemical analysis shows a mixed pattern of E-cadherin staining (membranous and cytoplasmic) in the intestinal component, while in the diffuse counterpart, the membranous staining was prevalent and a reduced membranous expression of ß-catenin was observed. In vitro assays suggest that the mutant G 274 S {{does not affect the}} E-cadherin protein function, its expression pattern or subcellular localization. This new variant is present in EC 2 extracellular domain of the protein (p. G 120 S in mature protein). The molecular modelling shows that this point mutation is not dramatic for local structure. However, p. S 120 is located {{on the surface of the}} protein close to the functional calcium sites and in the region of interaction with EC 1 domain of another <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecule</b> involved in the formation of the intercellular junction. Moreover, p. S 120 residue could be involved in posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation or glycosylation, with possible effects on stability and integrity of adhesive properties of E-cadherin.

Nanomolar concentrations of AZA- 1 reduced MCF- 7 cell proliferation and impaired cell-cell adhesion. AZA- 1 altered the cellular pool of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin by inducing a dose- and time-dependent accumulation of an E-cadherin fragment (E-cadherin–related antigen [ECRA 100]), with a concentration inducing the half-maximal effect (EC 50) of 0. 47 nM. The immunological characterization of ECRA 100 revealed that it consists of an <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecule</b> lacking the intracellular domain, and these data showed that the effect induced by AZA- 1 in MCF- 7 cells is undistinguishable from that induced by yessotoxin (YTX) in the same experimental system. A comparison of toxin effects in MCF- 7 and Caco 2 cells confirmed that the effects induced by AZA- 1 and YTX are undistinguishable in these cells. Treatment of fibroblasts with AZA- 1 {{did not affect the}} cellular pool of N-cadherin showing that the toxin effect is cadherin-specific. A comparison of the effects induced by AZA- 1, YTX, and okadaic acid on F-actin and E-cadherin in MCF- 7 and Caco 2 cells showed that 1 nM AZA- 1 did not cause significant changes in F-actin and that accumulation of ECRA 100 did not correlate with decreased levels of F-actin under our experimental conditions. Matching our results with those available in literature, we notice that, when molecular effects induced by AZA- 1 and YTX have been studied in the same in vitro systems, experimental data show that they are undistinguishable in terms of sensitive cellular parameters, effective doses, and kinetics of responses in several cell lines.

Recently, we have obtained evidence suggesting that this effect may involve the interaction of Cd 2 + with E-cadherin, a Ca 2 +-dependent cell adhesion molecule that is localized at the adhering junctions of epithelial cells. To begin {{to determine whether or}} not Cd 2 + might interact directly with the <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecule,</b> we studied the binding of Cd 2 + to peptide B, a synthetic, 13 -residue polypeptide that corresponds to one of the extracellular Ca 2 + binding regions of mouse E-cadherin (also known as uvomorulin). The binding of Cd 2 + to peptide B was evaluated by using an equilibrium microdialysis technique and the radioactive isotope 109 Cd 2 +. The effects of the binding on the conformation of the peptide were evaluated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The results showed that Cd 2 + bound to peptide B, with a maximum of one Cd 2 + binding site per molecule and an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 640 μM. The binding of Cd 2 + was reduced in the presence of excess Ca 2 +, an effect that was overcome by raising the concentration of Cd 2 +. Both Cd 2 + and Ca 2 + caused a shift in the CD spectrum of the peptide. However, the shift produced by Cd 2 + was about 3 times the magnitude of that produced by Ca 2 +. These results indicate that Cd 2 + can interact with the Ca 2 + binding site on the peptide B molecule and distort the secondary structure of the peptide. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that E-cadherin may be a direct molecular target for Cd 2 + toxicity...|$|E
40|$|SummaryE-cadherin {{is a major}} homophilic cell-cell {{adhesion}} molecule that inhibits motility of individual cells on matrix.

Using the Drosophila ovary as a model, we found that adhesion between border cells and their substrate, the nurse cells, functions in a positive feedback loop with Rac and actin assembly to stabilize forward-directed protrusion and directionally persistent movement. Adhesion between individual border cells communicates direction from the lead cell to the followers.

In several mouse epidermal cell lines, we found a good correlation between the level of GJIC and that of immunohistochemical staining of E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule, at cell-cell contact areas. The variant cell line P 3 / 22 showed both low GJIC and E-cadherin protein expression in low- and high-Ca 2 + media. P 3 / 22 cells showed very low E-cadherin mRNA expression. To test directly whether E-cadherin is involved in the Ca(2 +) -dependent regulation of GJIC, we transfected the E-cadherin expression vector into P 3 / 22 cells and obtained several stable clones which expressed high levels of E-cadherin mRNA. All transfectants expressed <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecules</b> at cell-cell contact areas in a calcium- dependent manner. GJIC was also observed in these transfectants and was calcium dependent.

Alterations in the expression pattern of the <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecule,</b> including focal loss at cell-cell contacts and heterogeneous distribution in the differentiated layers, were found in about 79 % of the p 53 null papillomas. In contrast, all of the wild-type and over 85 % of the heterolygous p 53 papillomas exhibited an expression pattern of E-cadherin indistinguishable from that of normal epidermis. Alterations in P-cadherin expression were also detected in the p 53 null papillomas: aberrant suprabasal localization and heterogeneous distribution were observed more frequently than in heterozygous and wild-type p 53 papillomas. The α 6 β 4 integrin showed suprabasal expression in more than 70 % of the papillomas derived from either wild-type, heterozygous or homozygous p 53 null mice. Surprisingly, {{the extent of the}} suprabasal localization of α 6 β 4 decreased in the p 53 null papillomas. Aberrant keratin K 13 expression was also detected in the majority of cases of all p 53 genotypes, but again there was a clear decrease in expression levels in the p 53 null papillomas. These alterations were also associated with keratinocytic atypia, which increased significantly in the p 53 null papillomas. Changes in these parameters were particularly evident during malignant conversion in invasive regions of one progressing p 53 null papilloma.

MethodsWe analyzed E-cadherin/γ-catenin interaction and distribution during epithelial dedifferentiation in vitro using a model of polarized MDCK cell monolayers treated with HGF. ResultsSurface immunoprecipitation experiments showed that HGF increased the amount of cell surface E-cadherin associated with γ-catenin. Biochemical and morphological examination of the TX- 100 solubility of junctional E-cadherin and γ-catenin in control and HGF treated cells showed an increase in solubility of only E-cadherin during loss of cell polarity.

50|$|During {{embryonic}} development, {{cells are}} restricted to different layers due to differential affinities. One of the ways this can occur is when cells share the same cell-to-cell adhesion molecules. For instance, homotypic cell adhesion can maintain boundaries between groups of cells that have different adhesion molecules. Furthermore, cells can sort based upon differences in adhesion between the cells, so even two populations of cells with different levels of the same adhesion molecule can sort out. In cell culture cells that have the strongest adhesion move {{to the center of}} a mixed aggregates of cells. Moreover, cell-cell adhesion is often modulated by cell contractility, which can exert forces on the cell-cell contacts so that two cell populations with equal levels of the same adhesion molecule can sort out. The molecules responsible for adhesion are called cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). Several types of cell adhesion molecules are known and one major class of these molecules are cadherins. There are dozens of different cadherins that are expressed on different cell types. Cadherins bind to other cadherins in a like-to-like manner: E-cadherin (found on many epithelial cells) binds preferentially to other <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecules.</b> Mesenchymal cells usually express other cadherin types such as N-cadherin.|$|R

E-cadherin's function in cell adhesion is also critically dependent {{on its ability to}} interact through its cytoplasmic domain with catenin proteins. A diverse collection of defects alter cadherin–catenin function in cancer cells, including loss-of-function mutations and defects in the expression of E-cadherin and certain catenins, such as Α-catenin. Although there is much evidence that Β-catenin is deregulated in cancer as a result of inactivating mutations in the APC and AXIN tumor-suppressor proteins and gain-of-function mutations in Β-catenin itself, the principal consequences of Β-catenin deregulation in cancer appear to be largely distinct from the effects attributable to inactivation of E-cadherin or Α-catenin. In this review, we highlight some of the specific genetic and epigenetic defects responsible for altered cadherin and catenin function in cancer, as well as potential contributions of cadherin–catenin alterations to the cancer process. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|In simple {{polarized}} epithelial cells, the Rho GTPase commonly localizes to E-cadherin-based cell-cell junctions, {{such as the}} zonula adherens (ZA), {{where it}} regulates the actomyosin cytoskeleton to support junctional integrity and tension. An important question is how E-cadherin contributes to Rho signaling, notably whether junctional Rho may depend on cadherin adhesion. We sought to investigate this by assessing Rho localization and activity in epithelial monolayers depleted of E-cadherin by RNAi. We report that E-cadherin depletion reduced both Rho and Rho-GTP at the ZA, an effect that was rescued by expressing a RNAi-resistant full-length E-cadherin transgene. This impact on Rho signaling was accompanied by reduced junctional localization of the Rho GEF ECT 2 and the centralspindlin complex that recruits ECT 2. Further, the Rho signaling pathway contributes to the selective stabilization of <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecules</b> in the apical zone of the cells compared with E-cadherin at the lateral surface, thereby creating a more defined and restricted pool of E-cadherin that forms the ZA. Thus, E-cadherin and Rho signaling cooperate to ensure proper ZA architecture and function. (c) 2013 International Society of Differentiation. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

To investigate the alterations in E-cadherin associated with cytoplasmic molecules including α-catenin, β-catenin, γ-catenin, p 120 CAS, and IQGAP 1 in various endometrial cancers with different degree of differentiation, we examined the localization and expression of <b>E-cadherin</b> and cytoplasmic <b>molecules</b> in 30 cases of both well and poorly differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinomas, using immunofluorescence and immunoblotting techniques. <b>E-cadherin</b> and cytoplasmic <b>molecules</b> demonstrated linear staining at the cell boundaries in normal endometrium. In all 20 cases with well differentiated adenocarcinomas, α-catenin and IQGAP 1 disappeared from the cell adhesive sites, but other cytoplasmic molecules were co-localized with E-cadherin along the cell boundaries. In all 10 cases with poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, <b>E-cadherin</b> and cytoplasmic <b>molecules</b> accumulated as large aggregates along cell adhesive sites, and the localization of IQGAP 1 differed from those of other cytoplasmic molecules. The expression of these molecules in all 20 cases with well differentiated adenocarcinomas decreased or was lost in Triton-insoluble fraction, in comparison with the findings for all cases with normal endometrium or poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. These results suggested that each alteration in E-cadherin associated with cytoplasmic molecules may play a different role in E-cadherin dysfunction between well and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{process of}} {{metastasis}} involves {{a series of}} steps and interactions between the tumor embolus and the microenvironment. Key alterations in adhesion molecules are known to dictate progression from the invasive to malignant phenotype followed by colonization at a distant site. The invasive phenotype results from the loss of expression of the <b>E-cadherin</b> adhesion <b>molecule,</b> whereas the malignant phenotype is associated with an increased expression of the carbohydrate ligand-binding epitopes, (e. g. Sialyl Lewis (x/a)) that bind endothelial E-selectin of the lymphatics and vasculature. METHODOLOGY: Our study analyzed the expression of two adhesion <b>molecules,</b> <b>E-cadherin</b> and Sialyl Lewis x (sLe(x)), in both a canine mammary carcinoma and human inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) model, using double labelled immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that canine mammary carcinoma and human IBC exhibit an inversely correlated cellular expression of E-cadherin and sLe(x) within the same tumor embolus. CONCLUSIONS: Our results in these two comparative models (canine and human) suggest the existence of a biologically coordinated mechanism of E-cadherin and sLe(x) expression (i. e. molecular plasticity) essential for tumor establishment and metastatic progression...|$|R
40|$|The {{progression}} of several human cancers correlates {{with the loss}} of cytoplasmic protein α-catenin from E-cadherin-rich intercellular junctions and loss of adhesion. However, the potential role of α-catenin in directly modulating the adhesive function of individual <b>E-cadherin</b> <b>molecules</b> in human cancer is unknown. Here we use single-molecule force spectroscopy to probe the tensile strength, unstressed bond lifetime, and interaction energy between E-cadherins expressed on the surface of live human parental breast cancer cells lacking α-catenin and these cells where α-catenin is re-expressed. We find that the tensile strength and the lifetime of single E-cadherin/E-cadherin bonds between parental cells are significantly lower over a wide range of loading rates. Statistical analysis of the force displacement spectra reveals that single cadherin bonds between cancer cells feature an exceedingly low energy barrier against tensile forces and low molecular stiffness. Disassembly of filamentous actin using latrunculin B has no significant effect on the strength of single intercellular E-cadherin bonds. The absence of α-catenin causes a dominant negative effect on both global cell-cell adhesion and single E-cadherin bond strength. These results suggest that the loss of α-catenin alone drastically reduces the adhesive force between individual cadherin pairs on adjoining cells, explain the global loss of cell adhesion in human breast cancer cells, and show that the forced expression of α-catenin in cancer cells can restore both higher intercellular avidity and intercellular E-cadherin bond strength...|$|R
