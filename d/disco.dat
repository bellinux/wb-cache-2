5|$|The {{second game}} was {{initially}} postponed, but was forfeited by the White Sox {{the next day}} by order of American League president Lee MacPhail. <b>Disco</b> Demolition Night preceded, and may have helped precipitate, the decline of <b>disco</b> in late 1979; some scholars and <b>disco</b> artists have described the event as expressive of racism and homophobia while others have denied this connection. <b>Disco</b> Demolition Night remains well {{known as one of}} the most extreme promotions in major league history.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, dance-oriented <b>disco</b> music was {{very popular in}} the United States, {{particularly}} after being featured in hit films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977). Despite its popularity, <b>disco</b> sparked a backlash from rock music fans. This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago shock jock and anti-disco campaigner Steve Dahl for the promotion at the July12 doubleheader, the Thursday preceding the All-Star break. Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 WLUP-FM, so attendees would pay 98 cents and bring a <b>disco</b> record; between games, Dahl would destroy the collected vinyl in an explosion.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1970s, <b>disco,</b> a form {{of dance}} music, was {{becoming}} popular, evolving from underground dance clubs to mainstream America. <b>Disco</b> reached its zenith following the release of Saturday Night Fever and the phenomenon surrounding the movie and the soundtrack by The Bee Gees. Disco's time was short, however, and by 1980 was soon replaced {{with a number of}} genres that evolved out of the punk rock scene, like new wave. Bruce Springsteen became a major star, first in the mid to late 1970s and then throughout the 1980s, with dense, inscrutable lyrics and anthemic songs that resonated with the middle and lower classes.|$|E

The works were largely demolished, {{but some of the}} ironworks' buildings and chimneys still stood unused, and the power station was built amongst them. <b>DisCo</b> opened Lemington Power Station in 1903.|$|E

5|$|The climactic {{underwater}} {{battle was}} shot at Clifton Pier and was choreographed by Hollywood expert Ricou Browning, who had worked on Creature From the Black Lagoon in 1954 and other films. He {{was responsible for the}} staging of the cave sequence and the battle scenes beneath the <b>Disco</b> Volante and called in his specialist team of divers who posed as those engaged in the onslaught. Voit provided much of the underwater gear in exchange for product placement and film tie-in merchandise. Lamar Boren, an underwater photographer, was hired to shoot all of the sequences. United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Charles Russhon, who had already established Eon productions' rapports with the local authorities in Turkey for From Russia with Love (1963) and at Fort Knox for Goldfinger (1964), supplied the experimental rocket fuel used to destroy the <b>Disco</b> Volante. Russhon, using his position, was also able {{to gain access to the}} United States Navy's Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, used to lift Bond and Domino from the water at the end of the film. Filming ceased in May 1965, and the final scene shot was the physical fight on the bridge of the <b>Disco</b> Volante.|$|E
5|$|When {{the rest}} of the office is told of Phyllis' injury, they take this as {{confirmation}} that the Cafe <b>Disco</b> is a bad idea and reprimand Michael for what happened to Phyllis. Disappointed and angry, Michael instructs Erin (Ellie Kemper) to close up the Cafe <b>Disco.</b> Kelly (Mindy Kaling) comes down with her and the two start dancing after Erin turns on the stereo. This catches the eye of two male employees from Vance Refrigeration, and soon Cafe <b>Disco</b> is full of both Dunder Mifflin employees and non-employees, much to Michael's delight. Oscar (Oscar Nunez) is mildly baffled that Erin actually invited one of her friends to come, as opposed to being ashamed of the office. Kelly and Andy (Ed Helms) get into a competitive dance-off with each other, and Kevin (Brian Baumgartner) makes out in the corner with his girlfriend Lynne (Lisa K. Wyatt).|$|E

40|$|I {{challenge}} quiet regulations {{within my}} own community, the Claremont University Consortium, by hosting two Silent <b>Discos</b> in culturally and explicitly quiet locations: the Honnold Mudd Library and the James Turrell Skyspace at Pomona College. Attempting to demonstrate Silent <b>Disco’s</b> ability to sonically adapt to quietly marked areas I recorded the sounds generated by these events and later amplified them in these culturally quiet locations. These Silent <b>Discos</b> embrace the given environment and sound limitations, while simultaneously accepting the popular modes of musical listening. By performing Silent <b>Discos</b> in the James Turrell Skyspace at Pomona College and the Honnold Mudd Library, I give {{the power to}} each individual to reduce noise pollution, while collectively listening to the same music as a group...|$|R
