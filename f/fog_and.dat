5|$|An {{automatic}} {{traffic monitoring}} and guidance {{system is in}} place along the motorway.

The system consists of variable traffic signs used to communicate changing driving conditions, possible restrictions and other information to motorway users.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while {{a thick layer of}} fog rolled onto the highway. Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed into each other shortly after 8a.m., one following another in the dense <b>fog,</b> <b>and</b> the accumulating wreckage caught traffic travelling in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Rogue Squadron {{received}} generally positive reviews. Critics {{praised the}} game's technical achievements and flight controls, but {{its use of}} distance <b>fog</b> <b>and</b> {{the lack of a}} multiplayer mode drew criticism. The game's sales exceeded expectations; by August 1999, more than one million copies had sold worldwide. It spawned two sequels developed and released for the GameCube and as well as , a spiritual successor released for Windows and Nintendo 64.|$|E

The A2 motorway mainly runs through the plains and rolling hills of Hrvatsko Zagorje region, although the northernmost sections of the route traverse rugged terrain, requiring a number of viaducts and long tunnels along the route.|$|E

5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. The court found the cause of the accident to be the thick <b>fog</b> <b>and</b> the ignorance of the pilots. The court required the pilots to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player {{controls}} Alex through a nightmare concerning his younger brother, Josh, before Alex wakes up in the cab of a truck driven by Travis Grady, the protagonist from , who gives him a ride to his hometown of Shepherd's Glen. The town, named for a distant ancestor who helped found it, is covered in <b>fog</b> <b>and</b> deserted. At home, he finds his mother in a catatonic state, murmuring about his father leaving to find Josh; promising to find Josh, Alex leaves.|$|E
5|$|Further north, the {{hurricane}} threatened to strike or move {{very close to}} the Outer Banks. Hurricane warnings were posted from Cape Hatteras to Manteo, and ships were advised to remain at port. Hurricane How produced 50mph (80km/h) winds and high tides along the Outer Banks and southeastern Virginia. Some minor damage was reported, and two ships were washed ashore. In New England, the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Block Island, Rhode Island to Portland, Maine, with rains, <b>fog,</b> <b>and</b> heavy surf reported. Several roads were closed in Massachusetts due to the tides.|$|E
5|$|In November 1945, with league {{competition}} still suspended, Arsenal {{were one}} of the teams that played a Dynamo Moscow side touring the UK. With many players still serving abroad in the armed forces, Arsenal were severely depleted and used six guest players, including Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen, which led Dynamo to declare they were playing an England XI, although three of the side were actually Welsh. In any case, Dynamo themselves had Vsevolod Bobrov on loan from CDKA Moscow. The match, at White Hart Lane, kicked off in thick <b>fog</b> <b>and</b> the slick and technically proficient Dynamo won 4–3, after Arsenal had led 3–1 at half-time.|$|E

5|$|On 25 October 1960, {{in thick}} <b>fog</b> <b>and</b> a strong tide, two barges (named the Arkendale H and Wastdale H) which had {{overshot}} Sharpness Dock, collided {{with one of}} the columns of the bridge after being carried upstream. Two bridge spans collapsed into the river. As they fell, parts of the structure hit the barges causing the fuel oil and petroleum they were carrying to catch fire. Five people died in the incident.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2010, Disney {{announced}} that the film would be released in the United States and Canada on May 20, 2011, following Columbia Pictures' announcement of a delay in the Spider-Man reboot and Paramount Pictures slating Thor for May 6, 2011. The film was released in IMAX 3D, as well as traditional 2D and IMAX format, with Dolby 7.1 surround sound.

5|$|Rivoli {{departed}} Venice on 21 February 1812 {{under the}} command of Commodore Jean-Baptiste Barré, accompanied by five smaller escort ships, the 16-gun brigs Mercure and Iéna, the 8-gun brig Mamelouck and two small gunboats, strung out in an improvised line of battle. Barré hoped to make use of a heavy sea fog that had descended, to break out from Venice and elude pursuit. Victorious had held off from the land during the <b>fog</b> <b>and</b> by the time Talbot was able to observe Venice harbour at 14:30, his opponent had escaped. Searching for Barré, who was sailing to Pula, Talbot spotted one of the French brigs at 15:00 and gave chase.|$|E
