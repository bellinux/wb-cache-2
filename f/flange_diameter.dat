40|$|The {{two main}} types of {{foundations}} used so far for {{offshore wind energy}} applications are the conventional solution, the so-called mono-piles and the less conventional suction caissons. In {{the case of the}} monopiles cyclic loading is identified as the main issue to be considered, and for suction caissons, a quite large number of design issues are present, but prevalent on the others, is the tension capacity. The idea to extend screw piles to offshore applications is becoming nowadays actual. This type of foundation has a quite large onshore application but not offshore so far. They have excellent promise for the wind turbines in deep water because of the very good combination of compression and tension capacity. The attention in this work is focussed on the tension capacity, this is done through a parametric analysis where the parameters are the pile and <b>flanges</b> <b>diameter,</b> the number of piles, the spacing between piles and the pitch of the helix. The commercial finite element analysis software Abaqus CAE combined with the Python scripting is used for the solution of tension capacity of this problem...|$|R

40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{preliminary}} design work being performed for the Orion vehicle, the Orion to Spacecraft Adaptor (SA) separation mechanism mechanism was analyzed and sized, with findings presented here. Sizing is based on worst case abort condition {{as a result of an}} anomaly driving the launch vehicle engine thrust vector control hard-over causing a severe vehicle pitch over. This worst case scenario occurs just before Upper Stage Main Engine Cut-Off (MECO) when the vehicle is the lightest and the damping effect due to propellant slosh has been reduced to a minimum. To address this scenario and others, two modeling approaches were invoked. The first approach was a detailed Simulink model to quickly assess the Service Module Engine nozzle to SA clearance for a given separation mechanism. The second approach involved the generation of an Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems (ADAMS) model to assess secondary effects due to mass centers of gravity that were slightly off the vehicle centerline. It also captured any interference between the Solar Arrays and the Spacecraft Adapter. A comparison of modeling results and accuracy are discussed. Most notably, incorporating a larger SA <b>flange</b> <b>diameter</b> allowed for a natural separation of the Orion and its engine nozzle even at relatively large pitch rates minimizing the kickoff force. Advantages and disadvantages of the Simulink model vs. a full geometric ADAMS model are discussed as well...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the gasket stress distributions, hub stress and a {{variation}} in axial bolt force in bolted gasketed pipe flange connections under internal pressure are analyzed using elasto-plastic FEM {{taking into account}} the nonlinearity of gasket behavior. Non-asbestos spiral wound gaskets were employed. The effect of nominal <b>flange</b> <b>diameter</b> is examined on the gasket contact stress distributions, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force (the load factor) is examined. Using the obtained gasket contact stress distribution and the fundamental data of the relationship between gasket compressive stress and gasket leak rate according to JIS B 2490, a method for predicting the leak rate is demonstrated. Experiments to measure the amount of leakage, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force when the joint is under internal pressure were carried out. The numerical results of the leak rate, hub stress and the load factor are in a fairly good agreement with the measured results. Then, a method is demonstrated for determining the bolt preload under given conditions, that is, taking into account assembly efficiency, leak rate and internal pressure In addition, bolt preload is determined using the actual gasket contact stress which can be estimated using the value of the load factor. As a design example, the procedure for determining the bolt preload in 3 ” and 20 “ nominal diameter pipe flange connections is shown for the allowable leak rate of 1. 0 - 3 Pa ･m 3 /s. The results are validated by the experiments...|$|E

40|$|In slowly flaring horns {{the wave}} fronts can be {{considered}} approximately plane and the input impedance can be calculated with the transmission line method (short cones in series). In a rapidly flaring horn the kinetic energy of transverse flow adds to the local inertance, resulting in an effective increase in length when it {{is located in a}} pressure node. For low frequencies corrections are available. These fail at higher frequencies when cross-dimensions become comparable to the wavelength, causing resonances in the cross-direction. To investigate this, the pipe radiating in outer space is modelled with a finite difference method. The outer boundaries must be fully absorbing as the walls of an anechoic chamber. To achieve this, Berenger’s perfectly matched layer technique is applied. Results are presented for conical horns, they are compared with earlier published investigations on flanges. The input impedance changes when the largest cross-dimension (outer <b>diameter</b> of <b>flange</b> or <b>diameter</b> of the horn end) becomes comparable to half a wavelength. This effect shifts the position of higher modes in the pipe, influencing the conditions for mode locking, important for ease of playing, dynamic range and sound quality...|$|R
40|$|Waterjets {{are common}} place in vessels needing to achieve speeds of 30 + kts where {{conventional}} propeller solutions {{are unable to}} overcome the associated issues of cavitation, which in turn can lead to thrust breakdown and material failure. Any vessel designed for high speed requires a low resistance and corresponding slender hull. Of course this is not enough, the propulsor needs to also be capable of accepting {{a high level of}} power and hence for a given diameter a high power density. Wärtsilä identified the need for a more compact, performant waterjet installation simply because the design of the vessel dictates the maximum size of the waterjet transom <b>flange</b> <b>diameter.</b> Due to this constraint the operational envelope of a waterjet can be limited at speeds well below the designed top speed. For fast patrol boats and fast attack craft flexibility and good acceleration at patrolling speeds {{is one of the key}} performance indicators, however. The task for Wärtsilä was clear but by no means easy as the mechanism by which the jet delivers enough thrust at top speeds (small inlet diameter and high power) is opposite to that for low patrolling speeds (large inlet and low power). By changing the pump geometry, Wärtsilä discovered a break through. The new pump is characterized by its axial geometry, whilst keeping the typical top efficiency of the commonly applied mixed-flow pumps. Thanks to Wärtsiläs ’ long experience in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in waterjet applications, the performance could be determined through analysis of both the pump geometry and the inlet duct design. This paper discusses the merits of the axial-flow pump geometry over that of mixed-flow and how it enabled Wärtsilä to deliver outstanding performance both in terms of the size of the installation and increased cavitation margins at patrolling speeds. ...|$|E
5000|$|Several vacuum flange {{standards}} exist, and {{the same}} flange types are called by different names by different manufacturers and standards organizations.CF (ConFlat) flanges use a copper gasket and knife-edge flange to achieve an ultrahigh vacuum seal. The term [...] "ConFlat" [...] is a registered trademark of Varian, Inc., so [...] "CF" [...] is commonly used by other flange manufacturers. Each face of the two mating CF flanges has a knife edge, which cuts into the softer metal gasket, providing an extremely leak-tight, metal-to-metal seal. Deformation of the metal gasket fills small defects in the flange, allowing Conflat flanges operate down to 10−13 Torr (10−11 Pa) pressure. The knife edge is recessed in a groove in each flange. In addition to protecting the knife edge, the groove helps hold the gasket in place, which aligns the two flanges and also reduces gasket expansion during bake-out. For stainless-steel conflat flanges, baking temperatures of 450 °C can be achieved; the temperature {{is limited by the}} choice of gasket material. CF flanges are sexless and interchangeable. In North America, flange sizes are given by <b>flange</b> outer <b>diameter</b> in inches, while in Europe and Asia, sizes are given by tube inner diameter in millimeters. Despite the different naming conventions, the actual flanges are the same.|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} a need for large <b>diameter</b> <b>flanges</b> for the supply of water in South Africa. These large <b>diameter</b> pipe <b>flanges</b> are required to accommodate pipes with nominal bores of up to 4 m and should successfully withstand internal pressures of up to 8 MPa. No current relevant standard / code contains prescribed design values for flanges which either operate at such high pressures or have such large diameters. Due to this an alternative method of design, by means of non-linear finite element modelling, is proposed. Three types of integral flange designs are considered, namely: flat face, raised face, and a modified raised face with an O-ring groove. The effects of creep-relaxation, flange rotation, and the bolting sequence are considered. For each of these designs a finite element model was created and compared to a small scale experiment which included strain and contact pressure measurements. The proposed non-linear finite element models were capable of accurately predicting the strains in the flanges {{as well as the}} contact pressures between the faces of the flange and the surfaces of the packing material. Finally, a comparison between the ASME design method and the proposed non-linear finite element modelling design method was done for the large <b>diameter</b> <b>flanges.</b> It was found that the ASME design code did not have the ability to accurately predict the stresses in the flanges. It was also found that by using the maximum equivalent Von Mises stress as failure criteria for the flanges and fasteners, and contact pressure for the sealing ability, circular bolted flange connections which are lighter, safer, and leak tight could be designed by means of the proposed non-linear finite element models.

30|$|The bellow, {{the most}} {{important}} part of the actuator, was fabricated using Inconel 600 super alloy—an austenite Nickel–Chromium based alloy. The target temperature, 300.0  °C, is the temperature used for low temperature annealing of stainless steel. This heat treatment process causes stainless steel to lose its corrosion resistance and its mechanical properties to change. By contrast, Inconel alloy has better corrosion and heat resistance than stainless steel as a result of its stable passivating oxide layer. Hence, we chose Inconel super alloy for the actuator.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new metal forming process for producing two-step external flanges on hollow parts. With this method, the flange is extruded by a movable sleeve, which {{moves in the}} opposite direction to the punch. This reduces the phenomenon of buckling of the tube wall, which allows extruding flanges with relatively large volumes. The new method was applied to produce a two-step flange {{on the end of a}} tubular billet made of 6060 aluminum alloy. This cold metal forming process was designed based on numerical simulations and experimental tests.

40|$|The {{deflection}} of the crankshaft which transfers {{the power}} of motor to the pump of the compressor directly affects the vibration, noises and wear problems in the rotary compressor, therefore, with the requirement of higher reliability, {{it is important to}} obtain it exactly in compressor design. Various forces that the crankshaft suffers were calculated by theoretical analysis in the operation process of the compressor. And based on the finite element method (FEM), the deflection of the crankshaft was obtained by simulation in the rotary compressor. And then the measurements were performed concerning the orbit of the top dead centre of the crankshaft with non-contacting displacement sensors in the compressor. In comparison with the tests, the validity of the calculation method was verified. It was found that the results of calculation were good agreement with the tests’. In addition, several factors which affect the deflection of the crankshaft were analyzed with the FEM, and the influences of <b>flange</b> height, shaft <b>diameter,</b> mechanical air gap in the motor, rotor weight on the deflection were found distinctly, which as a primary theoretical basis is provided for the compressor design...|$|R
40|$|Flanged joints {{on large}} <b>diameter</b> <b>flanges</b> can prove {{problematic}} to seal successfully with many {{factors contributing to}} ensuring a successful operation. One such factor is stud bolt loading contributing to stress and deflection of the flanged joint. This investigation {{involves the use of}} finite element analysis (F. E. A) to predict levels of stress and deflection of a particular flanged joint when the stud bolts are tightened and flange pressurised. The level of stud bolt force selected must ensure the joint is sufficiently tight to avoid leakage. However, the force must not be excessive causing damage. The flanged joint is located on the channel head of a shell and tube heat exchanger. For the purposes of this project, the educational version of ANSYS 5. 5 was used thus a number of critical assumptions were made to operate within the restrictions of the software. As a comparative check of the F. E. A method, a conventional method termed the target load bolt-up method was employed. The analysis results using both methods, when interpreted, indicated the flange was not excessively stressed. Field monitoring by observation of the flanged joint for signs of leakage and other detrimental effects indicates the stud bolt load selected is acceptable...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of some die {{geometry}} parameters such as: relative gap height, die corner radius and friction coefficient on the forming load and material flow were studied by simulation work. The numerical analysis of the injection forging process was performed in two cases: case I, forcing a cylindrical billet against a flat die and case II, forcing the same billet by moving both the upper and the lower dies in opposite directions. The work piece material was AISI 1006 steel and the simulation work was performed by the rigid-plastic finite element method. The validity of the simulation results obtained {{in this study was}} verified by using the experimental data reported in the literature. When comparing the forming load obtained from simulation study and experimental data, the effect of die geometry parameters such as relative gap height, die corner radius, friction coefficient on forming load and material flow were presented.

40|$|The two-axis joint is a {{mechanical}} device that provides two-degrees-of-freedom motion between connected components. A compact, moment-resistant, two-axis joint {{is used to}} connect an electromechanical actuator to its driven structural members. Due {{to the requirements of}} the overall mechanism, the joint has a low profile to fit within the allowable space, low friction, and high moment-reacting capability. The mechanical arrangement of this joint can withstand high moments when loads are applied. These features allow the joint to be used in tight spaces where a high load capability is required, as well as in applications where penetrating the mounting surface is not an option or where surface mounting is required. The joint consists of one base, one clevis, one cap, two needle bearings, and a circular shim. The base of the joint is the housing (the base and the cap together), and is connected to the grounding structure via fasteners and a bolt pattern. Captive within the housing, between the base and the cap, are the rotating clevis and the needle bearings. The clevis is attached to the mechanical system (linear actuator) via a pin. This pin, and the rotational movement of the clevis with respect to the housing, provides two rotational degrees of freedom. The larger <b>diameter</b> <b>flange</b> of the clevis is sandwiched between a pair of needle bearings, one {{on each side of the}} flange. During the assembly of the two-axis joint, the circular shims are used to adjust the amount of preload that is applied to the needle bearings. The above arrangement enables the joint to handle high moments with minimal friction. To achieve the high-moment capability within a low-profile joint, the use of depth of engagement (like that of a conventional rotating shaft) to react moment is replaced with planar engagement parallel to the mounting surface. The needle bearings with the clevis flange provide the surface area to react the clevis loads/moments into the joint housing while providing minimal friction during rotation. The <b>diameter</b> of the <b>flange</b> and the bearings can be increased to react higher loads and still maintain a compact surface mounting capability. This type of joint can be used in a wide variety of mechanisms and mechanical systems. It is especially effective where precise, smooth, continuous motion is required. For example, the joint can be used at the end of a linear actuator that is required to extend and rotate simultaneously. The current design application is for use in a spacecraft docking-system capture mechanism. Other applications might include industrial robotic or assembly line apparatuses, positioning systems, or in the motion-based simulator industry that employs complex, multi-axis manipulators for various types of motions...|$|R
