40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} {{increasing}} interest in numerical simulations of fragmentation of expanding warheads in 3 D. Accordingly there is a pressure on developers of leading commercial codes, such as LS-DYNA, AUTODYN and IMPETUS Afea, to implement the reliable fracture models and the efficient solution techniques. The applicability of the Johnson–Cook strength and fracture model is evaluated by comparing the fracture behaviour of an <b>expanding</b> <b>steel</b> casing of a warhead with experiments. The numerical codes and different numerical solution techniques, such as Eulerian, Lagrangian, Smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and the corpuscular models recently implemented in IMPETUS Afea are compared. For the same solution techniques and material models {{we find that the}} codes give similar results. The SPH technique and the corpuscular technique are superior to the Eulerian technique and the Lagrangian technique (with erosion) when it is applied to materials that have fluid like behaviour such as the explosive and the tracer. The Eulerian technique gives much larger calculation time and both the Lagrangian and Eulerian techniques seem to give less agreement with our measurements. To more correctly simulate the fracture behaviours of the <b>expanding</b> <b>steel</b> casing, we applied that ductility decreases with strain rate. The phenomena may be explained by the realization of adiabatic shear bands. An implemented node splitting algorithm in IMPETUS Afea seems very promising...|$|R

30|$|The beams {{reinforced}} with welded wire mesh achieved better cracking performance than those {{reinforced with}} X 8 <b>expanded</b> <b>steel</b> mesh {{regardless of the}} number of reinforcing steel layers and the type of core material. From the results in Tables  2 and 3, the ratio of the first cracking load of the welded wire mesh beams to that of the X 8 <b>expanded</b> <b>steel</b> mesh beams was 1.12, 1.33, 1.4, 1.2, 1.19 for (WSC/ESC), (WDC/EDC), (WSB/ESB), (WSS/ESS), and (WSR/ESR) respectively. The better performance of the beams reinforced with welded wire mesh could be attributed to the material properties of the two types of steel meshes which resulted in higher tensile strength of the mortar-mesh composite for the case of welded wire mesh in comparison to that of the X 8 <b>expanded</b> <b>steel</b> mesh as explained in Eqs.

Comparing the results of specimens (WSC) with (ESC), (WSS) with (ESS), and (WSR) with (ESR) shows that the ultimate load was higher by 18, 12, and 19  % respectively. This could be attributed to the higher ultimate strength of the welded wire mesh in comparison to that of the X 8 <b>expanded</b> <b>steel</b> mesh as mentioned in Sect. 2.1. The slight variation in the percentage of increase in the ultimate load could be attributed to the slight difference in the ultimate strength of the concrete and mortar of the different beams. For the case of double reinforcing layers, the ultimate load of specimen (WDC) was higher than that of (EDC) by about 35  %. The ultimate load of specimen (WSB) was higher than that of (ESB) by about 88  %. This large percentage of increase in the ultimate load for this type of core material {{is due to the fact}} that specimen (ESB) failed due shear as X 8 <b>expanded</b> <b>steel</b> mesh was insufficient for providing the shear strength together with the weak lightweight brick while specimen (WSB) reached its ultimate flexural strength.|$|E

30|$|Within {{the range}} of test parameter, the U-shaped steel mesh in the {{permanent}} reinforced mortar forms provided sufficient shear reinforcement for the beams under investigation except for the beams with lightweight brick core and <b>expanded</b> <b>steel</b> mesh reinforcement.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a continuation of}} the investigation reported by Tawab et al. (2012).

Two types of connections between the precast permanent form and the core material are investigated namely; adhesive bonding layer between the two surfaces, and mechanical shear connectors. Because the volume fraction and specific surface area of the used reinforcing meshes in the present investigation are less than that specified by ACI (2006) and IFS (2001), the U-shaped forms were defined as reinforced mortar rather than Ferrocement forms to be consistent with the ACI and IFS definition. However, for practical application the minimum volume faction and specific area of the meshes should be observed and the U-shaped forms could be defined as ferrocement forms.|$|E

Seventeen plates were damaged under impact load [1], which having the dimensions of 500  ×  500 and 25  mm thick.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation aimed at developing reinforced concrete beams consisting of precast permanent U-shaped reinforced mortar forms filled with different types of core materials {{to be used as a}} viable alternative to the conventional reinforced concrete beam. To accomplish this objective, an experimental program was conducted and theoretical model was adopted. The experimental program comprised casting and testing of thirty beams of total dimensions 300  ×  150  ×  2, 000  mm consisting of permanent precast U-shaped reinforced mortar forms of thickness 25  mm filled with the core material. Three additional typical reinforced concrete beams of the same total dimensions were also cast to serve as control specimens. Two types of single-layer and double-layers steel meshes were used to reinforce the permanent U-shaped forms; namely welded wire mesh and X 8 <b>expanded</b> <b>steel</b> mesh. Three types of core materials were investigated: conventional concrete, autoclaved aerated lightweight concrete brick, and recycled concrete. Two types of shear connections between the precast permanent reinforced mortar form and the core material were investigated namely; adhesive bonding layer between the two surfaces, and mechanical shear connectors. The test specimens were tested as simple beams under three-point loadings on a span of 1, 800  mm. The behavior of the beams incorporating the permanent forms was compared to that of the control beams. The experimental results showed that better crack resistance, high serviceability and ultimate loads, and good energy absorption could be achieved by using the proposed beams which verifies the validity of using the proposed system. The theoretical results compared well with the experimental ones.|$|E

30|$|The test beams {{were divided}} into eleven groups and each group {{contained}} three identical specimens. Group number 1 is the control group in which the beams were cast using ordinary formwork. The beams in this group were reinforced with 2 ϕ 12  mm {{high tensile strength steel}} bars at the tension side and 2 ϕ 12  mm high tensile strength steel bars at the compression side as well as shear reinforcement (stirrups) of Ø 8  mm at 200  mm spacing. The beams incorporating reinforced mortar forms were grouped according to the mesh type, number of steel mesh layers, type of core material, and shear connection method. For all the beams incorporating precast reinforced mortar forms, the core of material was reinforced with two high tensile strength steel bars of 12  mm diameter in the tension side only. Neither reinforcing bars at the compression side nor stirrups were used in these groups. Two types of steel mesh were used to reinforce the U-shaped forms namely; welded wire mesh and X 8 <b>expanded</b> <b>steel</b> mesh. Single or double layers of the steel mesh were used as shown in Table  1. In the design of the test specimen it was assured that the total percentage of steel reinforcement (reinforcing bars and steel mesh) did not exceed the maximum percentage allowed by the design code. This is an important issue that should be observed by the designers at the practical application stage. Shear connection between the reinforced mortar form and the core for groups 5 and 10 was provided by fixing bolts through the sides and bottom of the forms while {{for the rest of the}} groups bonding agent was applied on the inner surface of the forms before casting the core.|$|E
