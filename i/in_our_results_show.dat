40|$|Abstract The {{introduction}} of an iodine atom on the vanillyl moiety of nonivamide causes a switch in the vanilloid activity (TRPV 1 antagonism versus TRPV 1 desensitization) and nullifies the aversive properties of capsaicinoids. In {{the present study}} we investigated the effect of iodination in the vanillyl moiety on the antioxidant activity of capsaicinoids. To this aim, we have compared the protective effects of nonivamide and three iododerivatives, 2 -iodononivamide (2 IN), 5 -iodononivamide (5 IN), and 6 -iodononivamide (6 IN) {{in a series of}} in vitro models of lipid oxidation, namely the autoxidation and the FeCl(3) -mediated oxidation of linoleic acid at 37 degrees C and the thermal (140 degrees C), solvent-free oxidation of cholesterol. All tested compounds could protect linoleic acid and cholesterol against oxidative degradation, the order of potency being: nonivamide> 5 IN> 6 IN approximately 2 <b>IN.</b> <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> <b>show</b> that, in general, the {{introduction of}} an iodine atom on the vanillyl moiety of nonivamide causes a decrease in the antioxidant activity, and this effect is sensitive to the position of iodine on the aromatic ring, with 5 IN substantially retaining the efficacy of nonivamide to protect linoleic and cholesterol against free radical attack. Moreover, the pre-treatment with 5 IN, at noncytotoxic concentrations, significantly preserved LDL from Cu(2 +) -induced oxidative damage at 37 degrees C for 2 h, inhibiting the reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol and the increase of their oxidative products. The results of the present work suggest that 5 IN exerts useful antioxidant properties in different in vitro systems of lipid peroxidation. This, coupled to its lacks of pungency and TRPV 1 inhibiting properties, qualifies this phenolic compound as an attractive candidate for further investigations in vivo. ...|$|E
