5|$|On March 28 North Vietnamese forces {{closed in}} on Da Nang, and they {{subjected}} Da Nang Air Base to heavy artillery bombardment. Under adverse conditions, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was able to fly about 130 aircraft out of the city, {{but they had to}} abandon 180 aircraft, including 33 A-37 Dragonflys, due to chaos, confusion, poor discipline and the breakdown of airfield security. On March 29, the North Vietnamese captured Da Nang, followed by Quy Nhon on April 1 and Tuy Hòa and Nha Trang on April 2. At Phan Rang Air Base, remnants of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force continued to battle North Vietnamese troops for two days after ground units of the ARVN had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> fight. Elements of the ARVN Airborne Division were also committed into the fight, but they were overwhelmed by the North Vietnamese and Phan Rang was captured on April 16.|$|E

5|$|Later {{that same}} year, on May 14, 1998, the {{government}} {{signed an agreement}} with Astaldi, regulating construction of the ZagrebGoričan motorway by 2000. On December 11, 1997, pursuant to the agreement, the government established the Autocesta RijekaZagreb company {{to take the place of}} the Autocesta RijekaZagrebGoričan company, and awarded it the 28-year concession to develop, maintain and operate the ZagrebRijeka motorway, effectively excluding the ZagrebGoričan motorway from the original concession. At the same time, the Transeuropska autocesta d.o.o. (TEA) company was established by the government and awarded concession for development, operation and maintenance of the ZagrebGoričan motorway. Astaldi owned 51% of TEA, with the remainder owned by the Republic of Croatia. TEA was to secure financing of the project in 1998. Construction began as scheduled; however, financial and legal problems ensued, and by 1999, the press speculated that Astaldi had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> project, but Astaldi repeatedly denied these claims. Ultimately, the government cancelled the contract and ceded the motorway to Croatian Roads Administration (ancestor of Hrvatske autoceste and Hrvatske ceste), leading Astaldi to turn to the commercial arbitration court in Vienna, which ruled in its favour. The Republic of Croatia was subsequently required to pay Astaldi 44.3million euro in damages.|$|E
5|$|White ran unsuccessfully as a Nationalist for the House of Representatives seat of Maribyrnong in the 1925 elections. In 1927, {{he failed}} to win the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Prahran. Denied {{pre-selection}} as a Nationalist for the Senate the following year, he won the seat of Balaclava at a by-election held on 3August 1929. He succeeded retiring member William Watt. The United Australia Party (UAP) {{came to power in}} the 1931 elections and in March 1933 he was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs in the first Lyons Ministry, replacing Henry Gullett, who had stood down due to ill-health. White had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> directorship of C.J. White & Sons the previous year. His portfolio was responsible for reducing tariffs and attempting to increase trade with Britain as opposed to the United States and Japan, and also with book and film censorship; for the latter he established an advisory board, chaired by Robert Garran, to make recommendations to him. In 1934, White became Australian chairman of the Royal Life Saving Society, serving until 1951; he was also an active supporter of such organisations as Legacy and the Royal Flying Doctor Service.|$|E

Also, the Jazz had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rights to Moses Malone in order to regain one of the three first-round picks used for the Goodrich trade; the combination of Johnson and Malone blossoming into Hall of Famers and Goodrich's ineffective, injury-ruined few years in New Orleans made this transaction one of the most lopsided in NBA history.|$|E
25|$|By 1924, Laurel had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{stage for}} {{full-time}} film work, under contract with Joe Rock for 12 two-reel comedies. The contract had one unusual stipulation: that Dahlberg {{was not to}} appear {{in any of the}} films. Rock thought that her temperament was hindering Laurel's career. In 1925, she started interfering with Laurel's work, so Rock offered her a cash settlement and a one-way ticket back to her native Australia, which she accepted. The 12 two-reel comedies were Mandarin Mix-Up (1924), Detained (1924), Monsieur Don't Care (1924), West of Hot Dog (1924), Somewhere in Wrong (1925), Twins (1925), Pie-Eyed (1925), The Snow Hawk (1925), Navy Blue Days (1925), The Sleuth (1925), Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde (1925), Half a Man (1925).|$|E
25|$|His {{appointment}} was opposed by one Robert Crichton. Crichton was {{the nephew of}} George Crichton, Bishop of Dunkeld, and had been appointed coadjutor and successor to his uncle {{the year before the}} latter's death - without the consent of the Scottish government. The government thus ignored the appointment, placing Hamilton in charge. Robert litigated - unsuccessfully - against Hamilton in the Papal see. When Hamilton was translated, Crichton was still litigating. The dispute continued into 1553. When Mary of Guise took over the government from Châtellerault in 1554, she acknowledged Crichton's position and Campbell appears to have <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bishopric. In this year, perhaps in compensation, he was made Keeper of the Privy Seal, a position he held until his death in 1562.|$|E

25|$|Crawford {{maintained}} consistent batting form {{across his}} eight seasons with Leicestershire, although as the county usually played fewer matches than Surrey had done, he passed 1,000 {{runs in a}} season only in 1908 and 1909, after he had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> secretaryship. His best year was 1908, when he made 1416 runs {{at an average of}} 32.93 and increased his highest score to 170 in an innings that took just 160 minutes and included 24 fours and four sixes against Hampshire. In 1909, he improved on that again with an innings of 172 not out against Surrey in which he made his runs out of 226 put on while he was at the wicket in just over three hours. He was less successful in 1910 and left first-class cricket {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

By 1776 he had moved to Bath, where he entered into a part-ownership of a book-shop in Milsom Street with a partner of the name of Clinch. As with his previous professions, he soon decided that he was not suited to the life of a book-seller and returned to London within a few years. However he made many friends in Bath and became part of the fashionable Bath society, making the acquaintance of the famous actress Mrs Siddons, for whom he would later write leading character parts in his plays. He later fell out with Mrs Siddons after borrowing £500 from her husband and becoming offended when she asked him to repay it.|$|E
