This involves maximizing a function representing the compromise between the heating load and the entropy-production rate. The optimal relation between the <b>ecological</b> <b>criterion</b> and the COP (coefficient of performance), the maximum <b>ecological</b> <b>criterion</b> and the corresponding COP, heating load and entropy production rate, {{as well as the}} <b>ecological</b> <b>criterion</b> and entropy-production rate at the maximum heating load are derived using finite-time thermodynamics. Moreover, compared with the heating-load criterion, the effects of the cycle parameters on the ecological performance are studied by numerical examples.
