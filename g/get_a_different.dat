5|$|Veronica waits with Keith at an {{election}} party, where tensions are high {{due to the}} election being extremely close. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) is nosing ahead before a man walks up to Lamb and says that he made the anonymous call from the bridge where Felix Toombs was stabbed. Keith loses the election {{by a margin of}} 51% to 49%. After we learn that Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) has been elected mayor, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) hits on Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Officers come in and arrest Logan for the murder of Felix Toombs before Veronica goes home and finds Abel Koontz, who is in the latter stages of stomach cancer. He asks her to help him find his daughter, Amelia, who has disappeared, and Veronica agrees. Veronica talks to Amelia's old boyfriend, who has not seen her for a while; Amelia ditched the boyfriend in Europe. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) is appointed to be Logan's lawyer before Veronica asks Cliff to call the numbers on the phone cards that Amelia stole under an alias. Cliff tells Logan that he should <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> lawyer. Veronica finds out that Amelia called from Neptune (Veronica's town) the previous week. Logan is placed in a cell with his father, Aaron (Harry Hamlin), who is temporarily being held there before his trial for the murder of Lilly Kane. Logan receives bail, but Weevil and his friends are angry about this fact. Veronica breaks into Clarence Wiedman's (Christopher B. Duncan) office, but he denies any knowledge of the situation.|$|E

As a result, if a connection is faulty or noisy and the customer hangs up and redials, they will <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> set of connections and subswitches. A last-in-first-out (stack) allocation of connections might cause a continuing string of very frustrating failures.|$|E

If we reverse a given sequence of rotations, we <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> outcome. This also implies that we cannot compose two rotations by adding their corresponding angles. Thus Euler angles are not vectors, despite a similarity in appearance as a triplet of numbers.|$|E

500|$|A University of Houston professor, Peter Nguyen, remarked in 2005, [...] "You almost <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> {{sense of}} feeling once you cross over to Bellaire." [...] Bellaire is an {{incorporated}} city consisting of single-family houses and {{a reputation for}} safety. Nguyen said that he believed the city should increase efforts to reduce crime in Gulfton. He added {{that it would be}} difficult to engage Gulfton's population of [...] "working people", living [...] "day to day", to participate in anti-crime activities like crime watches. Bruce Williams, a Houston Police Department Captain, states that it is difficult to fight crime with the reductions in manpower. Williams said that U.S. federal government agents began working with the Houston Police Department to arrest serious gang criminals in Gulfton, including Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) members who were operating in the neighborhood. In 2007, Tammy Rodriguez, head of the Gulfton Super Neighborhood department for the City of Houston, and the Fondren Patrol Division announced that the division would expand its Police Apartments Clergy Team (PACT) into three Gulfton complexes. PACT places married couples who are active in churches into the apartment complexes so they can work with tenants. The PACT program initially focused on the Napoleon Square and Chateaux Carmel complexes. In August 2009 a gang war erupted between the Southwest Cholos and other area gangs causing violence to increase in Gulfton and surrounding areas.|$|E
50|$|Nirvachanashastra is a heremeneutic {{device that}} is used for word-analysis and derivation. The proper {{understanding}} of the relation in nirvachana analysis between a noun and some activity, expressed by a finite verb or by mention of a verbal root {{came to the fore}} through the study of Yāska's Nirukta done in the light of a model of substitution according to which model adesha ('substitution') takes the sthana ('place') of the original sthanin ('place-holder') under the given circumstances. Sthana refers to artha ('meaning'), thus nirvachanas are merely place-holders in semantic space; one <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> thought if one <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> sentence to represent the same truth.|$|R

500|$|The Kinks' next single, [...] "Waterloo Sunset", was {{released}} in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to {{have been inspired by}} the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, [...] "It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world {{and they were going to}} emigrate and go to another country." [...] Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for [...] "Waterloo Sunset" [...] lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: [...] "We spent a lot of time trying to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while." [...] The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Makers chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it [...] "the most beautiful song in the English language", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as [...] "possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era".|$|E
500|$|During an interview, Tempah {{commented on}} his second album: [...] "I always {{like to work with}} {{different}} people on each project I do, just so you <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> sound and angle. I will be working with some of the same people I did for the first album, {{you know what they say}} ‘if it ain't broke then don’t try and fix it’." [...] Tempah hoped to collaborate with other artists: [...] "I really want to collaborate with Toronto's very own Drake. I think he's amazing at what he does. I'd also like to collaborate with Adele, Sleigh Bells, Lykke Li, The Script, Dev, James Blake ― those are the few that I'd really like to work with." [...] Tempah asked a number of artists to appear on the album, including Gary Barlow, Chris Martin, Dizzee Rascal, and The Script. At the 2012 BRIT Awards, Tempah announced his second album would be called Demonstration. On 24 June 2012, Tempah performed on the main stage at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, performing two of his newest songs: [...] "Mosh Pit" [...] and [...] "Drinking from the Bottle", the latter of which he features on with Calvin Harris as the lead artist, and features on Harris' 2012 album 18 Months. In interviews, other artists announced that they were working on his album such as Labrinth, Dizzee Rascal, Big Sean and Emeli Sandé. Previous collaborators Naughty Boy and Labrinth have produced multiple tracks for the album, following their appearances on Disc-Overy. Chase & Status were on additional production duties for [...] "Mosh Pit". They had previously worked with Tinie on their album No More Idols for the single [...] "Hitz". Tempah's vocals from the song are also sampled on the hidden track [...] "5 Minutes".|$|E

2500|$|Some {{factors that}} contributed to Biddle’s artwork are the many art {{movements}} {{that he was involved}} in. [...] Biddle was involved in “French Impressionism; the American Ashcan School; the School of Paris and Cubism during those early and exciting days when it first exploded on the world; Regionalism, the Mexican Mural Movement, and the New Deal Subsidy of Art”. He also was involved in the “post war currents of contemporary art”. Many of his works of art were contemporary. [...] Another factor {{that contributed to}} Biddle’s artwork were his friendships with many great “painters, sculptors, and critics of the past generation and his life-long activity in behalf of fellow artists”. [...] He borrowed many of the other artists' styles and turned them into his own by using different techniques and images to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> effect. [...] Biddle believed that everyone’s life should be influenced by every “fact with which one comes in contact, until one ceases to grow or is, actually dead”. [...] This is the reason why Biddle became such a successful American artist; he had his own style, and expressed real actual events.|$|E
