40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the identification and}} analysis of a 2 -component regulator of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that is a potential aminoglycoside antibiotic combination therapy target. The regulator, AmgRS, was identified in a screen of a comprehensive, defined transposon mutant library for functions whose inactivation increased tobramycin sensitivity. AmgRS mutations <b>enhanced</b> <b>aminoglycoside</b> action against bacteria grown planktonically and in antibiotic tolerant biofilms, against genetically resistant clinical isolates, and in lethal infections of mice. Drugs targeting AmgRS would thus be expected to enhance the clinical efficacy of aminoglycosides. Unexpectedly, the loss of AmgRS reduced virulence {{in the absence of}} antibiotics, indicating that its inactivation could protect against infection directly as well as by <b>enhancing</b> <b>aminoglycoside</b> action. Transcription profiling and phenotypic analysis suggested that AmgRS controls an adaptive response to membrane stress, which can be caused by aminoglycoside-induced translational misreading. These results help validate AmgRS as a potential antibiotic combination target for P. aeruginosa and indicate that fundamental stress responses may be a valuable general source of such targets...|$|R
40|$|KJ 09 C, a multidrug-resistant mutant of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia KJ, was {{generated}} by in vitro selection with chloramphenicol. The multidrug-resistant phenotype of KJ 09 C {{was attributed to}} overexpression of a resistance nodulation division (RND) -type efflux system encoded by an operon consisting of five genes: smeU 1, smeV, smeW, smeU 2, and smeX. Proteins encoded by smeV, smeW, and smeX were similar to the membrane fusion protein, RND transporter, and outer membrane protein, respectively, of known RND-type systems. The proteins encoded by smeU 1 and smeU 2 were found {{to belong to the}} family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases. Mutant KJ 09 C exhibited increased resistance to chloramphenicol, quinolones, and tetracyclines and susceptibility to aminoglycosides; susceptibility to beta-lactams and erythromycin was not affected. The expression of the smeU 1 -V-W-U 2 -X operon was regulated by the divergently transcribed LysR-type regulator gene smeRv. Overexpression of the SmeVWX pump contributed to the acquired resistance to chloramphenicol, quinolones, and tetracyclines. Inactivation of smeV and smeW completely abolished the activity of the SmeVWX pump, whereas inactivation of smeX alone decreased the activity of the SmeVWX pump. The <b>enhanced</b> <b>aminoglycoside</b> susceptibility observed in KJ 09 C resulted from SmeX overexpression...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} (ROS) (e. g., peroxide) was shown to induce expression of the PA 5471 gene, which was previously shown to be required for antimicrobial induction of the MexXY components of the MexXY-OprM multidrug efflux system and aminoglycoside resistance determinant in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. mexXY was also induced by peroxide exposure, and this too was PA 5471 dependent. The prospect of ROS promoting mexXY expression and aminoglycoside resistance recalls P. aeruginosa infection of the chronically inflamed lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where the organism is exposed to ROS and where MexXY-OprM predominates as the mechanism of aminoglycoside resistance. While ROS did not <b>enhance</b> <b>aminoglycoside</b> resistance in vitro, long-term (8 -day) exposure of P. aeruginosa to peroxide (mimicking chronic in vivo ROS exposure) increased aminoglycoside resistance frequency, dependent upon PA 5471 and mexXY. This enhanced resistance frequency was also seen in a mutant strain overexpressing PA 5471, {{in the absence of}} peroxide, suggesting that induction of PA 5471 by peroxide was key to peroxide enhancement of aminoglycoside resistance frequency. Resistant mutants selected following peroxide exposure were typically pan-aminoglycoside-resistant, with mexXY generally required for this resistance. Moreover, PA 5471 was required for mexXY expression and aminoglycoside resistance in these as well as several CF isolates examined...|$|R
40|$|Screening of a {{transposon}} insertion mutant {{library of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa for increased susceptibility to paromomycin identified {{a number of}} genes whose disruption enhanced susceptibility of this organism tomultiple aminoglycosides, including tobramycin, amikacin, and gentamicin. These included genes associated with lipid biosynthesis or metabolism (lptA, faoA), phosphate uptake (pstB), and two-component regulators (amgRS, PA 2797 -PA 2798) and a gene of unknown function (PA 0392). Deletion mutants lacking these showed enhanced panaminoglycoside susceptibility that was reversed by the cloned genes, con-firming their contribution to intrinsic panaminoglycoside resistance. None of these mutants showed increased aminoglycoside permeation of the cell envelope, indicating that increased susceptibility was not related to <b>enhanced</b> <b>aminoglycoside</b> uptake ow-ing to a reduced envelope barrier function. Several mutants (pstB, faoA, PA 0392, amgR) did, however, show increased cytoplas-mic membrane depolarization relative to wild type following gentamicin exposure, consistent with the membranes of these mu-tants being more prone to perturbation, likely by gentamicin-generated mistranslated polypeptides. Mutants lacking any two of these resistance genes in various combinations invariably showed increased aminoglycoside susceptibility relative to single-dele-tion mutants, confirming their independent contribution to resistance and highlighting the complexity of the intrinsic amin-oglycoside resistome in P. aeruginosa. Deletion of these genes also compromised the high-level panaminoglycoside resistance of clinical isolates, emphasizing their important contribution to acquired resistance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common nosocomial pathogen(36, 86) that causes a variety of infections, with one of themos...|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectrostatic {{interactions}} often {{play key}} {{roles in the}} recognition of small molecules by nucleic acids. An example is aminoglycoside antibiotics, which by binding to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) affect bacterial protein synthesis. These antibiotics remain {{one of the few}} valid treatments against hospital-acquired infections by Gram-negative bacteria. It is necessary to understand the amplitude of electrostatic interactions between aminoglycosides and their rRNA targets to introduce aminoglycoside modifications that would enhance their binding or to design new scaffolds. Here, we calculated the electrostatic energy of interactions and its per-ring contributions between aminoglycosides and their primary rRNA binding site. We applied either the methodology based on the exact potential multipole moment (EPMM) or classical molecular mechanics force field single-point partial charges with Coulomb formula. For EPMM, we first reconstructed the aspherical electron density of 12 aminoglycoside-RNA complexes from the atomic parameters deposited in the University at Buffalo Databank. The University at Buffalo Databank concept assumes transferability of electron density between atoms in chemically equivalent vicinities and allows reconstruction of the electron densities from experimental structural data. From the electron density, we then calculated the electrostatic energy of interaction using EPMM. Finally, we compared the two approaches. The calculated electrostatic interaction energies between various aminoglycosides and their binding sites correlate with experimentally obtained binding free energies. Based on the calculated energetic contributions of water molecules mediating the interactions between the antibiotic and rRNA, we suggest possible modifications that could <b>enhance</b> <b>aminoglycoside</b> binding affinity...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether hyperoxia <b>enhances</b> <b>aminoglycoside</b> activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The existence of tobramycin-oxygen synergy was determined by using the in vitro postantibiotic effect (PAE). P. aeruginosa strains were incubated for 1 h in medium containing tobramycin at four times the MIC in the following gas mixtures: normoxia (21 % O 2), hyperoxia (100 % O 2, 101. 3 kPa), or hyperbaric oxygen (100 % O 2, 274. 5 kPa). Tobramycin was removed after 1 h and bacteria were incubated under normoxic conditions; growth rates were measured for 5 h. Exposure of three P. aeruginosa strains to hyperoxia prolonged the PAE of tobramycin approximately twofold compared with the PAE after exposure to normoxia (P less than 0. 05). Exposure of P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 to tobramycin and hyperbaric oxygen prolonged the time required for bacteria to increase 1 log 10 CFU/ml compared with the time after exposure for this increase to occur in tobramycin-treated, normoxic or hyperoxic groups (P less than 0. 02). Pulse-chase labeling of bacteria with L-[35 S]methionine, immediately after removal of tobramycin, showed that protein synthesis rates were decreased compared with those in controls (P = 0. 0001). Moreover, in tobramycin-treated groups, hyperoxia and hyperbaric oxygen induced 2 - and 16 -fold decreases, respectively, in protein synthesis rates compared with normoxia; these results did not achieve statistical significance. In the absence of tobramycin, hyperoxia increased bacterial growth (134 %; P less than 0. 01) and protein synthesis (24 %; not significant) compared with normoxia. Hyperbaric oxygen, however, delayed the growth recovery of bacteria (P less than 0. 05). We conclude that hyperoxia enhances the bacteriostatic effects of tobramycin in a synergistic manner. ...|$|R
40|$|Captopril <b>enhances</b> <b>aminoglycoside</b> {{nephrotoxicity}} in potassium-depleted rats. We {{demonstrated that}} potassium depletion significantly increased gentamicin nephrotoxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats (100 mg·kg− 1 ·day− 1). To determine whether this enhanced toxicity was mediated by renin secretion, we evaluated {{the effect of}} a converting enzyme inhibitor in this model. When we administered the combination of captopril (100 mg·kg− 1 ·day− 1) and gentamicin in potassium-depleted rats, we observed a surprising and significant adverse effect of this combination on the clearances of inulin (CIn) and PAH (CPAH) and renal blood flow (RBF). Pretreatment with indomethacin significantly improved CIn and CPAH, and potassium repletion abolished this effect entirely. In potassium-depleted animals that received both gentamicin and captopril, the intra-arterial administration of imidazole, a thromboxane synthétase inhibitor, significantly reduced urinary TXB 2 excretion and significantly improved RBF and CIn in vivo. In the same group of animals, administration of the kallikrein antagonist aprotinin also significantly increased both RBF and CIn. To measure total renal thromboxane B 2 production (TXB 2), we perfused kidneys ex vivo with cell-free perfusate. Three groups of animals were studied: potassium-repleted control animals, potassium-depleted control animals, and potassium-depleted animals treated with gentamicin alone, captopril alone, or the combination of gentamicin and captopril. We measured TXB 2 in renal venous effluent by radioimmunoassay. Ex vivo perfused kidneys from potassium-depleted control animals produced significantly more TXB 2 than potassium-repleted controls. Kidneys from potassium-depleted animals that received both gentamicin and captopril produced significantly greater amounts of TXB 2 than did kidneys from potassium-depleted animals treated with captopril alone, gentamicin alone, or control potassium-depleted kidneys. The administration of imidazole ex vivo at a rate equivalent to in vivo administration (10 µM/min) reduced TXB 2 production by potassium-depleted kidneys that received the combination of gentamicin and captopril to that of potassium-repleted control kidneys. These results suggest that the deleterious effect of captopril in potassium-depleted rats that received gentamicin is due at least in part to kinin-stimulated renal TXB 2 production...|$|R

As a result of this a large number of researches have been conducted emphasizing the antimicrobial properties of plant products. In this study, the ethanol extract and hexane fraction of Dalbergia ecastophyllum (L.) Taub. (Leguminosae) have been used to evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal activity and for modulating the resistance of antimicrobials against bacterial strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans and fungal strains of Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis. The antibacterial and modulatory activity was determined by microdilution. Inhibition of the growth of bacteria and fungi tested extract was ⩾ 1024.

40|$|Several mutants of Escherichia coli {{affecting}} aerobic {{energy generation}} and energization of the bacterial membrane {{have been examined}} for their effect on streptomycin and gentamicin accumulation and susceptibility. A heme-deficient mutant (K 207) and two mutants (CJ- 8 [colicin K insensitive] and NR- 70) associated with defective aerobic active transport were associated with decreased transport of streptomycin and gentamicin and increased resistance to those antibiotics. These mutants also exhibited increased resistance to several other aminoglycoside antibiotics, but not the aminocyclitol spectinomycin. The same observations were made with a ubiquinone-deficient mutant, but a strA derivative of this mutant was shown additionally to be saturable for streptomycin accumulation at a concentration four or more times lower than that required for saturation of the parent. A mutant uncoupled for adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate synthesis from electron transport and membrane Mg-adenosine 5 ′-triphosphatase deficient was hypersensitive to those aminoglycosides tested and spectinomycin, and showed enhanced transport of streptomycin and gentamicin. A variety of compounds structurally related to streptomycin were examined at high concentrations for inhibition of streptomycin uptake in a strA mutant of E. coli K- 12 SA 1306, but no evidence for competition was detected, suggesting {{the absence of a}} common transport carrier. Four different divalent cations were shown to inhibit streptomycin and gentamicin accumulation in E. coli K- 12 SA 1306. Divalent cations were shown to inhibit uptake of these two drugs in two bacterial species with distinct cell wall structures, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and to inhibit streptomycin uptake in spheroplasts of streptomycin-susceptible and -resistant E. coli. However, calcium had almost no inhibitory effect on streptomycin uptake by the ubiquinone-deficient mutant E. coli AN 66. These and previous findings have been used to formulate a model for aminoglycoside entry into bacteria using a low-affinity membranous complex involved in membrane energization that includes respiratory quinones, which probably act to bind and transport aminoglycosides across the cell membrane. This phase of transport is associated with the lowest accumulation rate (termed energy-dependent phase I) that is rate limiting for susceptibility. It is further proposed that subsequent association of the membrane-bound aminoglycoside with higher-affinity binding sites on membrane-associated ribosomes carrying out a normal ribosomal cycle and protein synthesis results in a more rapid transport rate (termed energy-dependent phase II). The increased rate could result from a state of membrane energization analogous to that causing <b>enhanced</b> <b>aminoglycoside</b> transport rates seen in the uncoupled mutant, AN 120. How this model explains the mechanism by which enzymatically modified aminoglycosides render cells resistant to unmodified aminoglycosides is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Exposure {{to intense}} sound or {{high doses of}} {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotics can increase hearing thresholds, induce cochlear dysfunction, disrupt hair cell morphology and promote hair cell death, leading to permanent hearing loss. When the two insults are combined, synergistic ototoxicity occurs, exacerbating cochlear vulnerability to sound exposure. The underlying mechanism of this synergism remains unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that sound exposure enhances the intra-cochlear trafficking of aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin, leading to increased hair cell uptake of aminoglycosides and subsequent ototoxicity. Juvenile C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were exposed to moderate or intense sound levels, while fluorescently-conjugated or native gentamicin was administered concurrently or following sound exposure. Drug uptake was then examined in cochlear tissues by confocal microscopy. Prolonged sound exposure that induced temporary threshold shifts increased gentamicin uptake by cochlear hair cells, and increased gentamicin permeation across the strial blood-labyrinth barrier. Enhanced intra-cochlear trafficking and hair cell uptake of gentamicin also occurred when prolonged sound, and subsequent aminoglycoside exposure were temporally separated, confirming previous observations. Acute, concurrent sound exposure did not increase cochlear uptake of aminoglycosides. Prolonged, moderate sound exposures <b>enhanced</b> intra-cochlear <b>aminoglycoside</b> trafficking into the stria vascularis and hair cells. Changes in strial and/or hair cell physiology and integrity due to acoustic overstimulation could increase hair cell uptake of gentamicin, and may represent one mechanism of synergistic ototoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{extracellular}} polysaccharides {{are a key}} constituent of the extracellular matrix material of biofilms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a model organism for biofilm studies and produces three {{extracellular polysaccharides}} that have been implicated in biofilm development, alginate, Psl and Pel. Significant work has been conducted on the roles of alginate and Psl in biofilm development, however we know little regarding Pel. In this study, we demonstrate that Pel can serve two functions in biofilms. Using a novel assay involving optical tweezers, we demonstrate that Pel is crucial for maintaining cell-to-cell interactions in a PA 14 biofilm, serving as a primary structural scaffold for the community. Deletion of pelB resulted in a severe biofilm deficiency. Interestingly, this effect is strain-specific. Loss of Pel production in the laboratory strain PAO 1 resulted in no difference in attachment or biofilm development; instead Psl {{proved to be the}} primary structural polysaccharide for biofilm maturity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Pel plays a second role by <b>enhancing</b> resistance to <b>aminoglycoside</b> antibiotics. This protection occurs only in biofilm populations. We show that expression of the pel gene cluster and PelF protein levels are enhanced during biofilm growth compared to liquid cultures. Thus, we propose that Pel i...|$|R
40|$|Loud sound {{exposure}} exacerbates aminoglycoside ototoxicity, increasing {{the risk of}} permanent hearing loss and degrading {{the quality of life}} in affected individuals. We previously reported that loud {{sound exposure}} induces temporary threshold shifts (TTS) and <b>enhances</b> uptake of <b>aminoglycosides,</b> like gentamicin, by cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs). Here, we explore mechanisms by which loud sound exposure and TTS could increase aminoglycoside uptake by OHCs that may underlie this form of ototoxic synergy. Mice were exposed to loud sound levels to induce TTS, and received fluorescently-tagged gentamicin (GTTR) for 30 minutes prior to fixation. The degree of TTS was assessed by comparing auditory brainstem responses before and after loud sound exposure. The number of tip links, which gate the GTTR-permeant mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) channels, was determined in OHC bundles, with or without exposure to loud sound, using scanning electron microscopy. We found wide-band noise (WBN) levels that induce TTS also enhance OHC uptake of GTTR compared to OHCs in control cochleae. In cochlear regions with TTS, the increase in OHC uptake of GTTR was significantly greater than in adjacent pillar cells. In control mice, we identified stereociliary tip links at ~ 50 % of potential positions in OHC bundles. However, the number of OHC tip links was significantly reduced in mice that received WBN at levels capable of inducing TTS. These data suggest that GTTR uptake by OHCs during TTS occurs by increased permeation of surviving, mechanically-gated MET channels, and/or non-MET aminoglycoside-permeant channels activated following loud sound exposure. Loss of tip links would hyperpolarize hair cells and potentially increase drug uptake via aminoglycoside-permeant channels expressed by hair cells. The effect of TTS on aminoglycoside-permeant channel kinetics will shed new light on the mechanisms of loud sound-enhanced aminoglycoside uptake, and consequently on ototoxic synergy...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Biofilms are a {{prominent}} mode of bacterial {{growth in the}} environment and in disease. Biofilm development involves specific stages including surface adherence, proliferation, cell-cell cohesion and dispersion. Each of these stages is dependent on either the reinforcement or modulation of the extracellular matrix. A key component of the biofilm matrix is extracellular polysaccharides. Many organisms that are adept biofilm producers including Escherichia coli, Vibrio spp, Salmonella spp, Burkholderia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa maintain the genetic material necessary to synthesize multiple types of polysaccharides. In many cases, the different polysaccharides are niche-specific and allow the organism to thrive {{in a variety of}} environments. P. aeruginosa is a model organism for biofilm studies and produces three extracellular polysaccharides that have been implicated in biofilm development, alginate, Psl and Pel. Significant work has been conducted on the roles of alginate and Psl in biofilm development, however we know little regarding Pel. In this study, I demonstrated that Pel can serve two functions in biofilms. The first is that Pel provides cell-cell adhesion during biofilm growth and can act as the primary structural scaffold. The second is that Pel <b>enhances</b> tolerance to <b>aminoglycoside</b> antibiotics in biofilm populations, a property unique to Pel. Additionally, this work has laid the foundation for Pel purification and carbohydrate structural analysis and contributed to the biochemical analysis of two proteins involved in Pel synthesis, PelD and PelF. Furthermore, I demonstrated that Pel and Psl polysaccharides provide structural redundancy in the biofilm matrix and the structural contribution of each polysaccharide was highly variable between clinical and environmental isolates. This led us to propose four classes of strains based upon their Pel and Psl functional and expression profiles. From this work, we have gained important insight on the unique and redundant roles of two distinct polysaccharides that are important factors in the adaptation of P. aeruginosa for successful chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients and biofilm growth...|$|R
