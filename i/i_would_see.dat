500|$|The song [...] "Aagadu" [...] {{was filmed}} on Mahesh and few dancers at the Jindal Steel Factory, Bellary in October 2013. This {{became the first}} Telugu film to be shot there and also made the factory a notable {{location}} for the song shoots of Kannada films such as Rana Vikrama (2015), Ranna (2015), and Mr. Airavata (2015). Both the song and fight sequences were filmed in 23 days. Mahesh {{and the members of}} the film's unit had fallen sick and continued work using antibiotics. Mahesh called it the [...] "most strenuous schedule I went through in my life", and added, [...] "For every shot, they had to get the dust up to get the right visual. Room kocchi snanam chesthe (...) <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> only mud. It’s very dangerous".|$|E
500|$|Shelley's biographies {{begin by}} {{describing}} the author, offering examples of their writings {{in the original}} language and in translation, and end by summarising their [...] "beauties and defects". She also discusses the problems of writing biography itself, engaging in a written dialogue with the theories of her now-dead father. In [...] "Of History and Romance" [...] Godwin had written that for the genius, [...] "I am not contented to observe such a man upon the public stage, I would follow him into his closet. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> the friend {{and the father of}} a family, as well as the patriot". Shelley and Godwin had seen the negative effects of this approach when Godwin published Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798), his biography of Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft. Its frank description of Wollstonecraft's affairs and suicide attempts shocked the public and sullied her reputation. Shelley criticises this technique in her biographies, concerned that such works perpetuate [...] "follies". She is even more concerned that often an absence of information regarding a particular writer is interpreted as evidence that the writer was insignificant.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E

500|$|Basu {{wanted to}} cast a new girl from Kolkata for the autistic character. Basu's wife, Tani {{suggested}} Chopra's name for the role. However, Basu feared that audience would see [...] "the Priyanka Chopra" [...] and not the character due to Chopra's stardom. Basu explained [...] "I had the fear that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> Priyanka Chopra in the character and Jhilmil wouldn’t work. This has happened in many films where known faces have harmed the character." [...] Priyanka Chopra was cast to play the part but, the development was not announced as Basu wanted to workshop first {{and see how it}} goes. After three days of workshop, Basu was convinced that Chopra could play the autistic part and reflected that he was glad that he chose Chopra for the role. Later, Basu revealed that he did not approach any actress other than Chopra for the autistic part. After Chopra was cast in the film, Kaif left the project for unknown reasons. Media reported that she may have opted out of the film because Chopra had been given a stronger role. Later, media reported that Asin was approached {{to play the role of}} the narrator, replacing Kaif. However, Asin was never signed to the project. Media reported that no other actress wanted to sign for the film because according to them, the autistic part was stronger. In July 2010, Mumbai Mirror reported that Chopra was ready to play the role of narrator and leave the autistic role, so that another actress could be cast in the film; Chopra did not want the film to stall. Basu confirmed this development and said, [...] "It’s true we’ve been unable to cast the other part." [...] After facing several casting problems, Basu chose {{to cast a}} completely new fresh face to play the second female role. In early December 2010, Ileana D'Cruz from south Indian films, was finalised for the second female lead, featuring as narrator and Kapoor's first love interest in the film.|$|E

2500|$|Though adored by many opera enthusiasts, Callas was a {{controversial}} artist. While Callas {{was the great}} singer often dismissed simply as an actress she considered herself foremost a musician, that is, the first instrument of the orchestra." [...] Grace Bumbry states, [...] "If I followed the musical score when she was singing, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> every tempo marking, every dynamic marking, everything being adhered to, {{and at the same}} time, it was not antiseptic; it was something that was very beautiful and moving." [...] Victor de Sabata confided to Walter Legge, [...] "If the public could understand, as we do, how deeply and utterly musical Callas is, they would be stunned", and Tullio Serafin assessed Callas's musicality as [...] "extraordinary, almost frightening." [...] Callas possessed an innate architectural sense of line-proportion and an uncanny feel for timing and for what one of her colleagues described as [...] "a sense of the rhythm within the rhythm".|$|E
2500|$|Once, Saint Anthony tried {{hiding in}} a cave to escape the demons that plagued him. There were so many little demons in the cave though that Saint Anthony's servant had to carry him out because they had beaten him to death. When the hermits were {{gathered}} to Saint Anthony's corpse to mourn his death, Saint Anthony was revived. He demanded that his servants take him back to that cave where the demons had beaten him. When he got there he called out to the demons, and they came back as wild beasts to rip him to shreds. All of a sudden a bright light flashed, and the demons ran away. Saint Anthony knew that the light must have come from God, and he asked God where was he before when the demons attacked him. God replied, [...] "I was here but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> and abide to see thy battle, and because thou hast mainly fought and well maintained thy battle, I shall make thy name to be spread through all the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} claimed that one Sunday Liddell {{refereed}} a hockey match {{to stop fighting}} amongst the players, as he was trusted not to take sides. One of his fellow internees, Norman Cliff, later {{wrote a book about}} his experiences in the camp called [...] "The Courtyard of the Happy Way" [...] (Chinese 樂道院, also translated as [...] "The Campus of Loving Truth"), which detailed the remarkable characters in the camp. Cliff described Liddell as [...] "the finest Christian gentleman it has been my pleasure to meet. In {{all the time in the}} camp, I never heard him say a bad word about anybody". Langdon Gilkey, who also survived the camp and became a prominent theologian in his native America, said of Liddell: [...] "Often in an evening <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> him bent over a chessboard or a model boat, or directing some sort of square dance– absorbed, weary and interested, pouring all of himself into this effort to capture the imagination of these penned-up youths. He was overflowing with good humour and love for life, and with enthusiasm and charm. It is rare indeed that a person has the good fortune to meet a saint, but he came as close to it as anyone I have ever known." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>see,</b> over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
