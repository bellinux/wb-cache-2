An analysis has begun by taking a detailed picture of the territory covering at least the following items: orography and slopes, road networks, land cover and use, human settlements, and tourist sites. The use of remote sensing and <b>geographic</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> techniques is of essential value for the park's management and constitutes the basis for further evaluations and impact analysis.|$|E

A gazetteer group was created to focus on districts and upazilas. The fact that around 400 local intellectuals were charged with writing about their respective zillas and upazilas was described as a unique approach to information gathering. In addition, 250 people worked in research management for seven years. A total of 2,000 scholars and technicians were involved. There were 270 full-time personnel on the project in all, with 35 to 40 people employed at any given time.|$|E

This study uses two research methods: The first one comprises interviews with the experts of GIS in Turkey. The second one comprises questionnaires conducted with <b>Geographic</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> - related departments of Istanbul municipalities. Data collected online have been analyzed by using descriptive statistics, reliability tests, Anova and regression to test the hypotheses. One of the findings is that almost half of the municipalities implement <b>Geographic</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> without a vision or a plan for the future. Another finding is that <b>Geographic</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> is mainly used to perform registration and maintenance functions instead of supporting the decision-making process.

25|$|To fix the {{infrastructure}} problems, the U.S. Army quadrupled its budget for Arlington National Cemetery to $174 million. While the cemetery's $46 million burial operations account remained stable, it added $103 million in construction and $25 million in maintenance funds {{for fiscal year}} 2013 (which began July 1, 2012). This included the first installment of an estimated $35 million to locate and remove abandoned utilities, maintain and upgrade existing ones, and build a <b>geographic</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> database. Some of this work began in late 2011, when ANC staff began mapping all underground utilities and storm drain structures.

25|$|In its Corps of Engineers Civil Works mission, CRREL {{researchers}} developed {{innovative ways}} to avoid ice jams and databases to address the widespread occurrence of such problems. A substantial ice engineering facility was built to support modeling of these problems. A remote-sensing and GIS (<b>geographic</b> <b>information</b> <b>system)</b> facility and organization were established to better employ the resources of satellite imagery and mapping of information to address problems worldwide. Another major facility, the Frost Effects Research Facility, was built to study problems associated with airfields and roadways, subject to freeze-thaw. An automated loading machine was acquired to simulate the passage of vehicle and aircraft tires on pavements. In building technology, researchers helped develop statistical means to identify snow and icing loads throughout the United States and standards for measuring heat loss, roof moisture detection, and frost-protected shallow foundations.|$|E
