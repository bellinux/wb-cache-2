50|$|A {{variation}} of the omega wrap, such as that used by Echo Science Corporation of Mountain View, California in its instrumentation and high resolution video recorders in the late 1970s and 1980s, wraps the 1-inch tape about 190 degrees around the two-headed drum, so there is signal overlap between the two heads. <b>Head</b> <b>switching</b> in video recorders occurs instantaneously in the video models, during an horizontal sync interval. With a standard NTSC video signal a head can cover one sixth of a field each time it passed across the tape. Switching in instrumentation models is gradual, so the signals from both heads overlaps briefly, producing a transient-free output signal where the original signal does not contain convenient dead intervals during which a switching transient can be hidden.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the path}} {{followed}} by the video and Hi-Fi audio heads being striped and discontinuous—unlike that of the linear audio track—head-switching is required to provide a continuous audio signal. While the video signal can easily hide the head-switching point in the invisible vertical retrace section of the signal, so that the exact switching point is not very important, the same is obviously not possible with a continuous audio signal that has no inaudible sections. Hi-Fi audio is thus dependent on a much more exact alignment of the <b>head</b> <b>switching</b> point than is required for non-HiFi VHS machines. Misalignments may lead to imperfect joining of the signal, resulting in low-pitched buzzing. The problem is known as [...] "head chatter", and tends to increase as the audio heads wear down.|$|E

The corresponding expressive lexicon formalism allows for a lexically driven, co-descriptive transfer architecture where the items of the lexicon are assigned transfer equivalents which carry the correct constraints about their incorporation into the target structure. This keeps the built-in transfer modules lean and easy to maintain, as they can be restricted to global transfer (and generation) routines which are independent of lexical pecularities (as presented by the treated structural mismatches).

The module takes block device configuration parameters as inputs (device driver) such as drive capacity, block device type (HDD or SSD), etc. For HDDs, drive parameters include geometry, no. of disk heads, no. of tracks (cylinders), sectors/track, rotations per minute (RPM), command processing time, settle time, average seek time, rotational latency, cylinder switch time, track-to-adjacent <b>switch</b> time, and <b>head</b> <b>switch</b> time. For SCMs (SSDs), the drive parameters include the no. of pages per block, size of each page, seek time (read, writes, erase) etc. The Storage Simulator is CHS compliant for 48 -bit LBA. The Storage simulator calculates the I/O access time (per I/O request) by HDDs considering the current location of the disk arm and time needed to reach the desired new location and access data size. The access time also takes into account minute details such as command processing time, settle time, rotational latency, cylinder (track) <b>switch</b> time, <b>head</b> <b>switch</b> time and average seek time [17, 40, 41]. For SSDs, the access time depends on the SSD properties provided by the manufacturer.

40|$|A free-to-roll (FTR) test {{technique}} and test rig {{make it possible}} to evaluate both the transonic performance and the wingdrop/ rock behavior of a high-strength airplane model in a single wind-tunnel entry. The free-to-roll {{test technique}} is a single degree-of-motion method in which the model is free to roll about the longitudinal axis. The rolling motion is observed, recorded, and analyzed to gain insight into wing-drop/rock behavior. Wing-drop/rock is one of several phenomena symptomatic of abrupt wing stall. FTR testing was developed as part of the NASA/Navy Abrupt Wing Stall Program, which was established for the purposes of understanding and preventing significant unexpected and uncommanded (thus, highly undesirable) lateral-directional motions associated with wing-drop/rock, which have been observed mostly in fighter airplanes under high-subsonic and transonic maneuvering conditions. Before FTR testing became available, wingrock/ drop behavior of high-performance airplanes undergoing development was not recognized until flight testing. FTR testing is a reliable means of detecting, and evaluating design modifications for reducing or preventing, very complex abrupt wing stall phenomena in a ground facility prior to flight testing. The FTR test rig was designed to replace an older sting attachment butt, such that a model with its force balance and support sting could freely rotate about the longitudinal axis. The rig (see figure) includes a rotary head supported in a stationary head with a forward spherical roller bearing and an aft needle bearing. Rotation is amplified by a set of gears and measured by a shaft-angle resolver; the roll angle can be resolved to within 0. 067 degrees at a rotational speed up to 1, 000 degrees/s. An assembly of electrically actuated brakes between the rotary and stationary heads can be used to hold the model against a rolling torque at a commanded roll angle. When static testing is required, a locking bar is used to fix the rotating head rigidly to the stationary <b>head.</b> <b>Switching</b> between the static and FTR test modes takes only about 30 minutes. The FTR test rig was originally mounted in a 16 -ft (approximately 4. 0 -m) transonic wind tunnel, but could just as well be adapted to use in any large wind tunnel. In one series of tests on the FTR rig, static and dynamic characteristics of models of four different fighter airplanes were measured. Two of the models exhibited uncommanded lateral motions; the other two did not. A figure of merit was developed to discern the severity of lateral motions. Using this figure of merit, it was shown that the FTR test technique enabled identification of conditions under which the uncommanded lateral motions occurred. The wind-tunnel conditions thus identified were found to be correlated with flight conditions under which the corresponding full-size airplanes exhibited uncommanded lateral motions...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the last}} decade the problem of surface {{inspection}} has been receiving great attention from the scientific community, the quality control {{and the maintenance of}} products are key points in several industrial applications. The railway associations spent much money to check the railway infrastructure. The railway infrastructure is a particular field in which the periodical surface inspection can help the operator to prevent critical situations. The maintenance and monitoring of this infrastructure is an important aspect for railway association. That is why the surface inspection of railway also makes importance to the railroad authority to investigate track components, identify problems and finding out the way that how to solve these problems. In railway industry, usually the problems find in railway sleepers, overhead, fastener, rail <b>head,</b> <b>switching</b> and crossing and in ballast section as well. In this thesis work, I have reviewed some research papers based on AI techniques together with NDT techniques which are able to collect data from the test object without making any damage. The research works which I have reviewed and demonstrated that by adopting the AI based system, it is almost possible to solve all the problems and this system is very much reliable and efficient for diagnose problems of this transportation domain. I have reviewed solutions provided by different companies based on AI techniques, their products and reviewed some white papers provided by some of those companies. AI based techniques likemachine vision, stereo vision, laser based techniques and neural network are used in most cases to solve the problems which are performed by the railway engineers. The problems in railway handled by the AI based techniques performed by NDT approach which is a very broad, interdisciplinary field that plays a critical role in assuring that structural components and systems perform their function in a reliable and cost effective fashion. The NDT approach ensures the uniformity, quality and serviceability of materials without causing any damage of that materials is being tested. This testing methods use some way to test product like, Visual and Optical testing, Radiography, Magnetic particle testing, Ultrasonic testing, Penetrate testing, electro mechanic testing and acoustic emission testing etc. The inspection procedure has done periodically because of better maintenance. This inspection procedure done by the railway engineers manually with the aid of AI based techniques. The main idea of thesis work is to demonstrate how the problems can be reduced of thistransportation area based on the works done by different researchers and companies. And I have also provided some ideas and comments according to those works and trying to provide some proposal to use better inspection method where it is needed. The scope of this thesis work is automatic interpretation of data from NDT, with the goal of detecting flaws accurately and efficiently. AI techniques such as neural networks, machine vision, knowledge-based systems and fuzzy logic were applied to a wide spectrum of problems in this area. Another scope is to provide an insight into possible research methods concerning railway sleeper, fastener, ballast and overhead inspection by automatic interpretation of data. In this thesis work, I have discussed about problems which are arise in railway sleepers,fastener, and overhead and ballasted track. For this reason I have reviewed some research papers related with these areas and demonstrated how their systems works and the results of those systems.

This paper aims to examine whether {{it has the potential}} to be used as an input for assistive technology (AT) devices. Two experiments were conducted. In the first, 12 non-impaired subjects used the neuroheadset to control a computer with their facial expressions. They also used a simple system of two <b>head</b> <b>switches</b> for comparison. In the second experiment, three non-impaired subjects were trained to use the neuroheadset to control a computer with their thoughts. In the first experiment, the neuroheadset was slower and less accurate than the <b>head</b> <b>switches</b> (p< 0. 05), and was also harder to use. It is unlikely to be preferred to existing methods of accessing AT for those that retain a small amount of head movement. In the second experiment, by the end of the week, all three subjects achieved accuracy rates greater than chance. All subjects were non-impaired, and the sample size in the second experiment was small. Further research should concentrate on the second experiment, using larger sample sizes and impaired subjects. The EPOC neuroheadset is substantially cheaper than similar specialist devices, and has the potential to allow those with no voluntary muscle control to access AT with their thoughts. The results of these two experiments show that the Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset can be used as an interface for non-impaired users to transfer information to a computer, which could in turn be used to control AT...|$|R

40|$|Smooth muscle myosin has two heads, each {{capable of}} {{interacting}} with actin to generate force and/or motion as it hydrolyzes ATP.

To explain published 1 P single ATP turnover and steady-state ATPase activities, we propose a kinetic model in which 1 P myosin exists in an equilibrium between being fully active (2 P) and inhibited (0 P). Based on the single ATP turnover data, we also propose that each 2 P head adopts a hydrolytic role distinct from its partner at any point in time, i. e., one head strongly binds actin and hydrolyzes ATP at its actin-activated rate while the other weakly binds actin. Surprisingly, the <b>heads</b> <b>switch</b> roles slowly (< 0. 1 s− 1), suggesting that their activities are not independent.
