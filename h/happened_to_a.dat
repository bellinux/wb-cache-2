5|$|The unit {{emerged from}} these {{repeated}} reorganizations in very poor state; training was inadequate, with the unit repeatedly failing battalion competence tests, and {{some areas of}} combat training—notably indirect fire—were avoided altogether. Discipline and order within the unit was equally low—in September 1944, the battalion held two courts-martials for murder. The situation was so dire that the battalion's commander felt it was likely that he would oversee the disbanding of the battalion or its conversion into a non-combat service unit (the latter of which had already <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of other segregated tank destroyer battalions).|$|E

25|$|After the Civil War, Texas' growing cattle {{industry}} managed to regain {{much of its}} economy. Beef became a particular commodity after the war, and supplies from Texas were shipped to other states for a great price. Texas Longhorns were the ones sought after, and the state's open range became their new habitat and breeding ground. Hundreds of ranchers and farms sprang out {{by the end of}} the war, and veterans and former slaves were hired as cowboys to protect cattle. However, exporting the cattle was a dangerous task for the new ranches. The best routes to drive the cattle run straight through the Comanche territory. Relationships between them were mutual; cowboys are permitted to go across as long as they pay the toll. However, in times of conflicts or when food are scarce, Indians would attack cowboys and their cattle if ever seen in their land. One dire case <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> black cowboy named Britton Johnson in 1864. His ranch was raided upon by a band of Comanches, who killed his son and kidnapped his wife and daughter. Although Johnson managed to negotiate with them for his family, the Comanches never left him alone. A band of 25 warriors attacked Johnson again with two of his cowboys during a routine cattle drive. Although they put up a fight, all of them perished during their last stand.|$|E
25|$|Andrea Doria was {{designed}} with her hull divided into 11 watertight compartments, separated by steel bulkheads which {{ran across the}} width of her hull, rising {{from the bottom of}} the ship's hull up to A Deck. The only openings in the bulkheads were on the bottom deck, where watertight doors were installed for use by the engine crew and could be easily closed in an emergency. Her design specified that if any two adjacent compartments out of any of her 11 watertight compartments were breached, she could remain afloat. In addition, following the rules and guidelines set by the International Conference for Safety of Life at Sea of 1948, Andrea Doria was also designed to take a list, even under the worst imaginable circumstances, no more than 15°. However, the combination of the five flooded tanks on one side and the five empty tanks on the other left Andrea Doria with a list which within a few minutes of the collision exceeded 20°. While the collision itself penetrated only one of Andrea Dorias watertight compartments, the severe list would gradually pull the tops of the bulkheads along the starboard side below the level of the water, allowing seawater to flow down corridors, down stairwells, and any other way it could find into the next compartment in line. In addition, the collision had also torn into an access tunnel which ran from the generator room, which was located in the compartment directly aft of where the collision had <b>happened,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small room at the forward end of the tank compartment which contained the controls for the pumps for the tanks. It was here that there was a fatal flaw in Andrea Dorias design, as at the point where the tunnel went through the bulkhead separating the two compartments, no watertight door was present. This allowed the generator room to flood rapidly, contributing to not only an increase in flooding, but also to a loss of electricity to the stricken liner.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his initial}} success, Duncan {{was unable to}} retain control {{in the face of}} a more {{widespread}} revolt on 15 May among the ships based at the Nore, which became known as the Nore Mutiny. Led by a sailor named Richard Parker, the Nore mutineers quickly organised and became a significant threat to water traffic in the Thames Estuary. Duncan was informed that his fleet at Yarmouth might be ordered to attack the mutineers and, although reluctant, responded, [...] "I do not shrink from the business if it cannot otherwise be got the better of". When rumours of the plan reached the fleet at Yarmouth, the crew of Venerable also expressed their distaste with the plan, but reaffirmed their promise of loyalty to their admiral whatever the circumstances. News then arrived that the Dutch fleet under De Winter was preparing to sail, and Duncan's fleet was ordered by Lord Spencer to blockade the Dutch coast. Duncan issued orders for the fleet to weigh anchor, but the men disobeyed and ship after ship overthrew their officers and joined the mutineers at the Nore. Eventually Duncan was left with only his own Venerable and Hotham's Adamant to contain the entire Dutch fleet. Duncan later wrote that, [...] "To be deserted by my own fleet in the face of the enemy is a disgrace which I believe never before <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> British admiral, nor could I have supposed it possible." ...|$|E

500|$|In the late-1980s, 1990s and 2000s ideological, postcolonial and Marxist {{criticism}} dominated Austen studies. Generating heated debate, Edward Said {{devoted a}} chapter of his book Culture and Imperialism (1993) to Mansfield Park, arguing that the peripheral position of [...] "Antigua" [...] {{and the issue of}} slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early 19th century. The question of whether Mansfield Park justifies or condemns slavery has become heated in Austen scholarship, and Said's claims have proved to be highly controversial. The debate about Mansfield Park and slavery is the one issue that in Austen scholarship that has transcended the limits of academia to attract widespread public attention. Many of Austen's critics come from the field of post-colonial studies, and taken up Said's thesis about Mansfield Park reflecting the [...] "spatial" [...] understanding of the world that he argued was used to justify the British empire. Writing in a post-colonial vein, Carl Plasa in his 2001 essay [...] "'What Was Done There Is Not To Be Told' Mansfield Parks Colonial Unconscious" [...] argued that the [...] "barbarism" [...] of Maria Bertram's sexuality, which leads her into adultery, is a metaphor for the [...] "barbarism" [...] of the Haitian revolution, which attracted much media attention in Britain at the time, which was often presented as due to the [...] "barbarism" [...] and uncontrolled sexuality of the Haitian slaves. Plasa argued that British society in Austen's time was based upon set of expectations about everyone being in their [...] "place", which created order. The Haitian revolution was seen as a symbol of what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> society without order, and Plasa argued that it was not accident that when Sir Thomas Bertram leaves Mansfield Park for his plantation in Antigua that his family falls apart, showing the importance of the family and individuals staying in their proper [...] "place". Likewise, Maaja Stewart in her 1993 book Domestic Realities and Imperial Fictions argued that the plantations in the Caribbean were the source of much worry about female sexuality in Austen's time with the main concerns being the need of slave owners to depend upon the fertility of slave women to create more slaves when the slave trade was abolished in 1807, and about the general collapse of traditional English morality in the West Indies as the slave masters routinely kept harems of slave women or alternatively raped female slaves. Stewart linked these concerns to Mansfield Park, writing that Sir Thomas Bertram's failure to manage his own family is put down to his failure to manage the emerging sexuality of his teenage daughters, which is precisely the same charge that was applied to the owners of the plantations in the West Indies at the same time.|$|E
