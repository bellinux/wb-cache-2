5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played in <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has {{to decide how to}} divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E

5|$|Each race {{relies on}} two {{resources}} {{to sustain their}} game economies and to build their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and acquire it by constructing a gas extraction building {{on top of a}} geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it. In addition, players need to regulate the supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct the number of units they need. Although the nature of the supply differs between the races—Terrans use physical supplies held in depots, Protoss use psionic energy channeled from their homeworld via pylons, and Zerg are regulated by the number of controlling overlord units present—the supply mechanic essentially works in <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> for each race (just with differing impacts on gameplay), allowing players to create new units when there are sufficient resources to sustain them.|$|E
5|$|For 2006, Pescarolo {{were the}} only team to run the C60 in the newly-renamed Le Mans Series (LMS). Collard and Boullion started the season in <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> they had {{finished}} the previous one, by winning the 1000km of Istanbul in the Pescarolo C60 Hybrid. The 1000km of Spa saw Collard and Boullion win again, despite starting the race from the pitlane after a crash in free practice. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Pescarolo entered two C60s, as usual; one driven by Hélary, Loeb and Franck Montagny, whilst the other was driven by Collard, Minassian and Comas. The Montagny/Hélary/Loeb car took second overall, beating one of the brand-new Audi R10 TDIs, whilst the other car finished fifth overall, and fourth in the LMP1 category. Having returned to the LMS, Collard and Boullion were joined by Hélary for the 1000km of Nürburgring, and the trio took another win for Pescarolo. Didier André replaced Hélary {{in the final two}} rounds, which were the 1000 km of Donington and 1000 km of Jarama, and Pescarolo won both races to complete a clean sweep. As a result, Pescarolo retained the LMP1 team's championship with the maximum score possible. The C60 was made obsolete by the new LMP1 regulations for 2007, and thus was retired, and replaced by the Pescarolo 01.|$|E

25|$|The {{butterfly}} effect {{can also be}} demonstrated by very simple systems. For example, the randomness of the outcomes of throwing dice depends on this characteristic to amplify small differences in initial conditions—the precise direction, thrust, and orientation of the throw—into significantly different dice paths and outcomes, which makes it virtually impossible to throw a dice <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> twice.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{difference between}} atoms and lists was that atoms were immutable and unique.

25|$|This {{expression}} is derived by partitioning all rook arrangements in classes; in class s are those arrangements in which s pairs of rooks do not {{stand on the}} diagonal.

25|$|Since {{the rockets}} are {{constructed}} <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> and {{starting at the}} same moment in S with the same acceleration, they must have the same velocity all of the time in S. Thus they are traveling the same distances in S, so their mutual distance cannot change in this frame. Otherwise, if the distance were to contract in S, then this would imply different velocities of the rockets in this frame as well, which contradicts the initial assumption of equal construction and acceleration.|$|E

25|$|Japan's {{approach}} to ruling Taiwan could be roughly {{divided into two}} views.

Thus, Japan would have to follow the British approach, and Taiwan would never be governed <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as the Home Islands but would be governed under {{a whole new set}} of laws. The opposing viewpoint was held by future Prime Minister Hara Takashi, who believed that the Taiwanese and Koreans were similar enough to the Japanese to be fully absorbed into Japanese society, and was thus in favor of using the same legal and governmental approaches on the colonies as those used in the Home Islands.|$|E

Each respective variant of the first character has either 入 (U+5165) or 人 (U+4EBA). Each respective variant of the second character has either 入 (U+5165) or 人 (U+4EBA). Both variants of the first character got their own unique codepoints. However, the two variants of the second character had to share the same codepoint.|$|E

Of the three reports (positiones) above mentioned, and which were now also required, the first was prepared in the usual way; the second consisted of an exposition of the heroic virtues of the servant of God, an information, and a reply to later observations of the Promotor of the Faith; the last consisted only of an answer to his final observations.|$|E
