5|$|The Iowa {{class were}} the only battleships with the speed {{required}} for post-war operations based around fast aircraft carrier task forces. There {{were a number of}} proposals in the early Cold War to convert the class to take into account changes <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> <b>and</b> doctrine. These included plans to equip the class with nuclear missiles, add aircraft capability and—in the case of Illinois and Kentucky—a proposal to rebuild both as aircraft carriers instead of battleships.|$|E
5|$|Cyberpunk is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock vocalist Billy Idol. A concept album, it was {{released}} in 1993 by Chrysalis Records. Inspired by his personal interest <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> <b>and</b> his first attempts to use computers {{in the creation of}} his music, Idol based the album on the cyberdelic subculture of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Heavily experimental in its style, the album was an attempt by Idol {{to take control of the}} creative process in the production of his albums, while simultaneously introducing Idol's fans and other musicians to the opportunities presented by digital media.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, silk {{supplies}} from Japan were cut off, so western countries {{were forced to}} find substitutes. Synthetic fibres such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk {{was not able to}} regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> <b>and</b> a protectionist market policy, became the world's foremost exporter of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in importance of synthetic fibres and loosening of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 it was no longer a net exporter of silk.|$|E

5|$|Incinerating waste has {{traditionally}} been viewed as a method with the main purpose being {{the destruction of the}} waste involved. Recovering the energy generated from this process has become of greater importance, and all incineration facilities in England now operate as energy-from-waste plants (with many operating as combined heat and power facilities). Critics question the safety of the pollutants emitted during the process and argue that, as incinerators require constant levels of waste to operate, it encourages more waste. However, the levels of emissions from the incinerating process has been greatly reduced by developments <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> <b>and</b> legislation.|$|E
5|$|The {{founding}} educational {{philosophy is}} still {{evident in the}} modern day curriculum in the focus on learning by doing, teaching based on broad themes that cross subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a de-emphasis of textbooks. There remains a close integration of art and nature in daily activities and {{a focus on the}} development of social skills and education for social responsibility. These principles, adapted in the 1970s for gifted students, have been further extended to accommodate new developments <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> <b>and</b> educational research.|$|E
5|$|The new {{classical}} school {{culminated in}} real business cycle theory (RBC). Like early classical economic models, RBC models assumed that markets clear and that business cycles {{are driven by}} changes <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> <b>and</b> supply, not demand. New Keynesians tried to address many of the criticisms leveled by Lucas and other new classical economists against Neo-Keynesians. New Keynesians adopted rational expectations and built models with microfoundations of sticky prices that suggested recessions could still be explained by demand factors because rigidities stop prices from falling to a market-clearing level, leaving a surplus of goods and labor. The new neoclassical synthesis combined elements of both new classical and new Keynesian macroeconomics into a consensus. Other economists avoided the new classical and new Keynesian debate on short-term dynamics and developed the new growth theories of long-run economic growth. The Great Recession led to a retrospective {{on the state of}} the field and some popular attention turned toward heterodox economics.|$|E
