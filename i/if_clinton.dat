500|$|New Square {{had voted}} almost {{unanimously}} for Hillary Rodham Clinton in the New York Senate race. A lawyer following the matter stated that even <b>if</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{had promised to}} lobby her husband for clemency {{in exchange for the}} town's votes — a claim for which there was no proof — {{it would be difficult to}} establish a crime had taken place: [...] "Politicians make promises all the time.

500|$|Burgoyne's council {{discussed}} {{whether to}} attack the next day, and a decision was reached to delay further action at least one day, to September 21. The army moved to consolidate the position closer to the American line while some men collected their dead. [...] The attack on the 21st was called off when Burgoyne received a letter dated September 12 from Henry Clinton, who was commanding the British garrison in New York City. [...] Clinton suggested that he could [...] "make a push at [...] Montgomery in about ten days." [...] (Fort Montgomery was an American post on the Hudson River, in the New York Highlands south of West Point). <b>If</b> <b>Clinton</b> left New York on September 22, [...] "about ten days" [...] after he wrote the letter, he still could not hope to arrive {{in the vicinity of}} Saratoga {{before the end of the}} month. [...] Burgoyne, running low on men and food, was still in a very difficult position, but he decided to wait in the hope that Clinton would arrive to save his army. [...] Burgoyne wrote to Clinton on September 23, requesting some sort of assistance or diversion to draw Gates' army away. [...] Clinton sailed from New York on October 3, and captured Forts Montgomery and Clinton on October 6. The furthest north any of his troops reached was Clermont, where they raided the estate of the prominent Patriot Livingston family on October 16.|$|E

50|$|Lower {{unemployment}} rates were another {{large part of}} Clinton’s macroeconomic policies.
