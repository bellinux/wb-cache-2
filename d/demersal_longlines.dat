40|$|International audienceEffective {{management}} of albatross populations requires understanding {{the impacts of}} environmental factors on albatross demographics. An integrated modeling approach, incorporating multiple data sources, can further the understanding of albatross demographics by incorporating error from all components of modeling and distinguishing between variability related to one factor (e. g. environment) from that of another factor (e. g. density-dependence). We apply such an integrated, spatially-explicit population model to quantify the impact of environmental conditions (sea-surface temperature: SST), fisheries, and density-dependence on a black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) population breeding on Kerguelen Island, southern Indian Ocean for the period 1950 - 2011. The model is structured by sex, age-class, and breeding stage, with a 5  × 5  spatial scale and monthly temporal scale. All parameters are estimated within a maximum-likelihood framework. This includes estimation of the seabird bycatch rates of each of five fishing super-fleets, grouped by gear-type and reported bycatch rates: (i) Japanese pelagic longline, (ii) other pelagic <b>longline,</b> (iii) legal <b>demersal</b> <b>longline,</b> (iv) trawl, and (iv) illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) <b>demersal</b> <b>longline.</b> A decline in the Kerguelen black-browed albatross population occurred between the mid- 1990 s through the mid- 2000 s.

Gillnet mesh-size had major effects on catch composition and catch rate, whereas gillnet hanging ratio, hook-size, hook shank-length and hook-spacing had minor effects. The gillnets and longlines were much more effective at catching chondrichthyans than teleosts, and catches of species of cephalopoda, bivalvia, gastropoda, mammalia, aves and reptilia were negligible. Any reduction in the present legal minimum mesh-size of 6 inch the shark fishery would markedly increase by-catch.

Most of this decline is explained by reductions of 54 % by Cephaloscyllium laticeps and of 87 % by Galeorhinus galeus.

The longline comprised a 9600 m mainline, separated into four sections (termed lines) each with 120 gangions (20 m apart) rigged with hook timers and 16 / 0 circle hooks baited with either sea mullet Mugil cephalus or eastern Australian salmon Arripis trutta. The mainline was deployed on each of 17 nights (between 19 : 30 and 23 : 30  h), with two lines retrieved after 7 and 14  h respectively. From a total of 8160 hooks, 246 timers were activated without hooking fish. Twenty-two species comprising 684 individuals were caught, including 52 S. lewini, 12 C. taurus, 11 S. mokarran and 1 loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta. Several environmental factors, including water temperature, moon phase and depth had mostly homogeneous, positive effects on catches. The only identified variables that might be used to considerably reduce the catches of Sphyrna were soak time and/or diurnal gear retrieval, with most individuals hooked during daylight. Simply mandating shorter deployments and within nocturnal retrieval might limit exploitation, especially among juveniles (< 150 cm total length).

40|$|Sea turtle {{by-catch}} {{data in the}} Mediterranean {{were reviewed}} and analysed with fishing effort. The results indicate over 132000 captures per year, with probably over 44000 incidental deaths per year, while many others are killed intentionally. Small vessels using set net, demersal longline or pelagic longline represent most of the Mediterranean fleet and likely cause more incidental or intentional deaths than large vessels typically using bottom trawl or pelagic longline. When interactions, mortality, intentional killing, size (a proxy for reproductive value) and turtle populations are considered, results indicate that Mediterranean green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) are more affected (i) by fishing gears such as bottom trawlers, <b>demersal</b> <b>longlines</b> and set nets, (ii) by small-scale fisheries, and (iii) by fishing in the eastern basin. Although small-scale fisheries should be the priority target, available measures are easier to implement on the fewer large vessels. Moreover, these measures are few, {{and they are not}} implemented yet, while others should still be tested for the Mediterranean fisheries. Thus, measures for reducing captures or mortality through changing gear-specific characteristics may help, but probably a more holistic conservation strategy aimed to an ecosystem-based fishery management for a sustainable fishing would be the only solution for the long-term survival of Mediterranean Sea turtle populations and their habitats. Small-scale fisheries should manage marine resources, including turtles, in a responsible and sustainable way.

40|$|As Norwegian {{fisheries}} deploy <b>demersal</b> <b>longlines</b> {{at greater}} water depths in steep continental slope areas, ocean current displacement—the horizontal movements of longlines {{from the position}} at which the anchors are dropped to their positions on the seabed after sinking—may adversely affect this industry, primarily in two ways: o Economic : By loss of longlines, fishing opportunities and catching efficiency o Environmental : Marine pollution due {{to the loss of}} fishing gear The main factors resulting in ocean current displacement are: o Current Speed o Water Depth o Longline Sinking Speed : A complex factor influenced by the longline’s materials and composition which experimental research suggests is difficult to measure o Initial displacement of a longline The aim of the present work is to analyze the sinking speed of longlines on various parameters—thickness, materials, anchor weights, baits, shooting speed and shooting method—using numerical methods. Describing an underwater flexible structure like longline fishing gear in three dimensions requires the structure to be divided into finite elements. In the present work, the longline is modeled as mass points connected by springs. First, the modeling incorporates non-active points into a conventional mass-spring model to improve the efficiency of the calculation and the graphical representation. The modeling consists of the following: o Active mass points o Non-active points : These points are not involved in physical calculation but function to adjust the position of structures through a geometrical transformation. Implementing non-active points demonstrably enhances the efficiency of the calculation and graphical representation when compared to modeling only the active points. o Springs Experiments were conducted in a flume tank (still water) to measure the properties of different baits. This was done to ensure the correct resistance coefficients, depending on the shape, sinking orientations and sizes, which were implemented in the simulations. This research suggests that the bait’s resistance coefficient depends on the following: o The projected area of the bait, created by the method used to cut the bait o The method of attaching the bait to the hooks Full-scale longline sinking experiments were conducted to verify the results of the numerical methods, including varying the longline sinking speed with different anchor weights and without rigged snoods and hooks. These early experiments suggested that anchor weight does not have much influence on sinking speed for the middle part of longlines, though we suspected that the measured impact of the anchor weight might have been more pronounced had we conducted these experiments in deeper water. When we conducted full-scale longline sinking experiments with snoods, hooks and baits, we witnessed good agreement between the numerical method and experimental results. The behavior of different positions along the longlines was simulated with various parameters, such as bait properties, material properties (i. e., thickness and density), anchor weights, shooting speeds and shooting methods. To assist fishermen at sea (where the time required to analyze the results of the simulation would cause the loss of fishing opportunities), the results of these simulations were used to establish simplified equations for deriving the longline sinking speed as a function of depth and the parameters mentioned above. Finally, in order to calculate the current displacement, the current speed and direction were analyzed, considering the seasonal conditions, for the most common longlining area in Norway. This analysis resulted in the standardizing the displacement calculations for the longlines at current speeds and directions common for the Ormen Lange area. This study, therefore, has introduced another way to handle ocean current displacement phenomena in a manner directly helpful to Norway’s demersal longline fisheries.

40|$|International audienceDepredation in {{longline}} fisheries by odontocete whales is {{a worldwide}} growing issue, having substantial socio-economic consequences for fishers {{as well as}} conservation implications for both fish resources and the depredating odontocete populations.

Thus, we examined the factors influencing the decision making process of fishers facing such competition while operating on a patch.

40|$|Carcharhinus plumbeus (sandbar shark) and C. obscurus (dusky shark) {{occur in}} many global {{fisheries}} as targeted species and/or by catch. However, {{little is known}} about their movement and the possible fate of discards. We redressed this lack of knowledge using pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT) and acoustic tagging technologies off the eastern coast of Australia. Eight sharks of each species were caught by <b>demersal</b> <b>longline,</b> fitted with both types of tag and then released. PSATs indicated that 2 C. plumbeus and 1 C. obscurus died within 8 h of release, while tracks over periods of 1 to 60 d were obtained for 13 sharks. All surviving sharks first swam in an easterly, offshore direction to outer-shelf waters during the first 24 h. All C. plumbeus then moved approximately south (i. e. increasing latitude) by distances of up to 350 km. In contrast, most C. obscurus moved approximately north by distances between 212 and 606 km. Over an 18 mo period following release, acoustic tag detections occurred for 4 C. plumbeus (mostly within 30 km of release, suggesting some philopatry) and 6 C. obscurus (515 km south and 310 km north). Both species spent 85...|$|R
40|$|<b>Demersal</b> <b>longlining</b> is {{a fishing}} {{technique}} where {{one to three}} miles of baited fishing line {{is placed on the}} ocean floor and left to “soak ” for 8 - 20 hours before being retrieved to haul black cod. Historical whaling records indicate that sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) off southeast Alaska incorporate fish into their diets, particularly black cod (Anoplopoma fimbria). In the 1970 s sperm whales were encountered off longline gear in the Gulf of Alaska, but beginning in 1995 the frequency and intensity of depredation encounters between longline fishermen and sperm whales increased. Since 2002 the SE Alaska Sperm Whale Avoidance Project (SEASWAP) has been studying this phenomenon using fishermen reports, photo-ID, and biopsies (see related report by NPRB R 0309). In 2004 and early 2005 both passive acoustic towed arrays and autonomous recorders mounted on longline deployments have provided an opportunity to both monitor and track sperm whale acoustic activity, whenever fishing vessels were present and absent. This report summarizes work on the passive acoustic component of the project (NPRB F 0412) during 2004, with an emphasis on the development of passive acoustic technique...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Fisheries, Western Australia {{has divided}} its vast marine {{jurisdiction}} into four bioregions. The West Coast Bioregion extends from Kalbarri (27 ° 00 'S) to Augusta (115 ° 30 'E), {{adjacent to the}} major population centres of Western Australia. The West Coast Bioregion supports major commercial demersal finfish fisheries including the West Coast Demersal Gillnet and <b>Demersal</b> <b>Longline</b> Interim Managed Fishery and the West Coast Demersal Scalefish Fishery (WCDSF) that encompasses management of commercial, charter boat and recreational fishing of demersal scalefish within the West Coast Bioregion. Considering {{the social and economic}} importance of the various fisheries that target demersal scalefish in the West Coast Bioregion and the need for resource allocation within the bioregion (Rogers & Curnow 2002), the integrated management of all sectors of the scalefish fishery in the West Coast Bioregion is a significant challenge for the Department of Fisheries, Western Australia. The most pressing allocation issue at present concern the stocks of demersal scalefish as several of the key demersal fish species are heavily exploited. This problem of allocation within and between sectors is not unique to Western Australia and if the approaches developed in this project are successful, they could be applied to other important, geographically extensive fisheries in Australia...|$|R
40|$|The South African <b>demersal</b> <b>longline</b> {{experiment}} is assessed {{with emphasis on}} the target species, kingklip Genypterus capensis. The hypothesis that kingklip on the South African coast comprise a unit stock is tested. Recommendations {{for the management of}} the fishery are made. Longlining was found to be commercially viable. Techniques have been developed to target on either kingklip or the Cape hakes, Herluccius capensis and H. paradoxus. Longline fishermen exploit the kingklip spawner stock from August to No v ember by taking advantage of prespawning aggregations on the South-East Coast. Effort switches to the West Coast in late summer and early winter where kingklip are less abundant and a larger proportion of hake is caught. Catch rates of kingklip on the South Coast have declined sharply and the resource there has been exploited at a rate greater than that required to retain 50 % of the unexploited biomass. There is a 17, 6 % probability that the spawner biomass on the South Coast has already been depleted below its pristine level. On the West Coast the catch rates of kingklip are lower than on the South Coast and have not changed significantly, although within the 95 % confidence limits {{there is a possibility that}} the resource there has also been depleted below 50 % of its pristine level. Genypterus capensis on the South African coast comprise a unit stock. Comparison of kingklip morphology using multivariate and discriminant function analysis and of otolith morphology using univariate statistics shows that there are no significant differences between the fish on the West and South Coasts. They are a slow growing species and were aged up to 25 years. Kingklip on the West Coast are smaller and have a lower L~ than those on the South Coast, but this is not a characteristic of discrete stocks. Kingklip on the South Coast mature earlier than those on the West Coast and aggregate to spawn on the South - East Coast in spring. There is no obvious spawning period on the West Coast. It is hypothesized that kingklip spawning on the South-East Coast is in response to favourable environmental conditions that enhances the survival of their eggs and larvae. It is recommended that <b>demersal</b> <b>longlining</b> be established as a permanent kingklip-directed fishery but that effort should not be allowed to increase. The West and South Coasts should be managed. separately. A TAC of 5 OOOt for kingklip should be introduced for 1989 of which 2 OOOt should be allocated to the West Coast and 3 OOOt to the South Coast. A closed season for kingklip from 1 August to 30 September on the South-East Coast is recommended. Hake-directed longlining should not be allowed as its effect on the hake spawner stocks are unknown and could be a potential threat to the stability of the demersal trawl fishery...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{describes}} {{the impact of}} longline fishing on the seabirds breeding on the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands. The development of a <b>demersal</b> <b>longline</b> fishery for Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides close to the islands with almost complete observer coverage during the study allowed a detailed examination of the impacts of this fishery. The vast majority of seabird mortalities were adult males that were breeding {{at the time they}} were killed. White-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis were killed most frequently, but albatrosses and giant petrels were also killed when lines were set in the daytime. Birds were killed almost exclusively during their breeding season, and albatrosses were caught closer to the islands than whitechinned petrels. It is estimated that between 8 500 and 18500 birds could have been killed between 1996 - 2000, mostly due to high levels of Illegal Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing. This is likely to {{have a significant impact on}} the breeding populations of several species of seabirds breeding on the Prince Edward Islands. A large increase in the amount of fishing gear found next to seabird nests as well as fishery-derived items in the diets of wandering albatrosses was recorded concurrent to the development of the toothfish fishery around the Prince Edward Islands. There was also an increase in the number of observed seabird entanglements in fishing gear and mortalities due to the ingestion of fishing gear...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeabirds are {{amongst the}} most globally-threatened of all groups of birds, and {{conservation}} issues specific to albatrosses (Diomedeidae) and large petrels (Procellaria spp. and giant petrels Macronectes spp.) led to drafting of the multi-lateral Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP). Here we review the taxonomy, breeding and foraging distributions, population status and trends, threats and {{priorities for the}} 29 species covered by ACAP. Nineteen (66 %) are listed as threatened by IUCN, and 11 (38 %) are declining. Most have extensive at-sea distributions, and the greatest threat is incidental mortality (bycatch) in industrial pelagic or <b>demersal</b> <b>longline,</b> trawl or artisanal fisheries, often in both national and international waters. Mitigation measures are available that reduce bycatch in most types of fisheries, but some management bodies are yet to make these mandatory, levels of implementation and monitoring of compliance are often inadequate, and there are insufficient observer programmes collecting robust data on bycatch rates. Intentional take, pollution (including plastic ingestion), and threats at colonies affect fewer species than bycatch; however, the impacts of disease (mainly avian cholera) and of predation by introduced species, including feral cats (Felis catus), rats (Rattus spp.) and house mice (Mus musculus), are severe for some breeding populations. Although major {{progress has been made}} in recent years in reducing bycatch rates and in controlling or eradicating pests at breeding sites, unless conservation efforts are intensified, the future prospects of many species of albatrosses and large petrels will remain bleak...|$|R
