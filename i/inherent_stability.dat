After satisfying order and <b>inherent</b> quadratic <b>stability</b> conditions, the remaining free parameters are used to find the methods with large area of region of absolute stability.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} inherent robustness analysis for nonlinear discrete–time systems using {{the concept of a}} finite–time Lyapunov function. The main contribution is to prove that, for sufficiently continuous dynamics and finite–time Lyapunov functions, <b>inherent</b> global input–to–state <b>stability</b> to general disturbances can be established for nominally stable nonlinear systems. Moreover, under mere continuity of the finite–time Lyapunov function and of the dynamics, <b>inherent</b> input–to–state <b>stability</b> on a compact set is obtained...|$|R
25|$|The B.E.2 {{has always}} been the subject of a good deal of controversy. While it proved {{fundamentally}} unsuited to air-to-air combat it had a relatively low accident rate, and its high degree of <b>inherent</b> <b>stability</b> actually proved helpful in its artillery observation and aerial photography duties (although it also made it more difficult to manoeuvre quickly).|$|E
500|$|The F-16 was {{the first}} {{production}} fighter aircraft intentionally designed to be slightly aerodynamically unstable, also known as [...] "relaxed static stability" [...] (RSS), to improve maneuverability. Most aircraft are designed with positive static stability, which induces aircraft to return to {{straight and level flight}} attitude if the pilot releases the controls; this reduces maneuverability as the <b>inherent</b> <b>stability</b> has to be overcome. Aircraft with negative stability are designed to deviate from controlled flight and thus be more maneuverable. At supersonic speeds the F-16 gains stability (eventually positive) due to aerodynamic changes.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its <b>inherent</b> <b>stability,</b> the Tri Glide, {{like other}} {{three-wheeled}} motorcycles, is marketed to motorcycle riders who are experiencing health problems due to aging or injuries, and to female riders.

40|$|Drugs degrade to {{different}} extents on separate exposure to heat, moisture, oxidation and light. Combination of these stresses causes very complex behaviour. Many {{studies have been}} reported of the thermal behaviour of drugs in the solid-state, {{but most of the}} information available on the photodegradation of drugs refers to reactions in solution, (usually aqueous) and photoreactions in the solid-state are even more complex. In drug formulations, the presence of excipients adds further complications because the excipients may increase, have no effect on, or decrease the <b>inherent</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the drug. The literature has been explored to review the thermal and photostabilities of solid pharmaceuticals...|$|R
2500|$|Supporters of this {{traditional}} banking regulation {{argue that the}} 1933 Banking Act (and other restrictive banking legislation) produced a period of unparalleled financial stability. David Moss argues this stability may have induced a false belief in the <b>inherent</b> <b>stability</b> of the financial system. [...] Moss argues this false belief encouraged legislative and regulatory relaxations of traditional restrictions and that this led to financial instability.|$|E
2500|$|In {{service the}} F.K.8 (nicknamed the [...] "Big Ack") {{proved to be}} {{effective}} and dependable, being used for reconnaissance, artillery spotting, ground-attack, contact-patrol and day and night bombing. It was reputedly easier to fly than the R.E.8 and was sturdier but its performance was even more pedestrian and it shared the <b>inherent</b> <b>stability</b> of the Royal Aircraft Factory types. While the pilot and observer were placed reasonably close together, communication between the two lacked the [...] "tap on the shoulder" [...] intimacy of the Bristol Fighter (or the R.E.8 for that matter).|$|E
2500|$|The Type G flew {{successfully}} and usefully between 1913 and 1915. [...] It {{was designed}} to have <b>inherent</b> <b>stability</b> and for a time, early in its life, demonstrated this by flying without its tailfin. [...] Before the First World war it was flown by Rowland Ding, who later became Blackburn's main test pilot. [...] He took it to various aviation meetings and also made a cross-channel flight with Princess Lowenstein Wertheim as a passenger. [...] He also made many flights between meetings {{with his wife and}} six-year-old daughter in the front seat, qualifying the Type G as a three-seater.|$|E
40|$|We briefly {{summarized}} how {{to design}} and fabricate an insect-mimicking flapping-wing system and demonstrate how to implement <b>inherent</b> pitching <b>stability</b> for stable vertical takeoff. The effect of relative locations of the Center of Gravity (CG) and the mean Aerodynamic Center (AC) on vertical flight was theoretically examined through static force balance consideration. We conducted a series of vertical takeoff tests in which the location of the mean AC was determined using an unsteady Blade Element Theory (BET) previously developed by the authors. Sequential images were captured during the takeoff tests using a high-speed camera. The results demonstrated that <b>inherent</b> pitching <b>stability</b> for vertical takeoff can be achieved by controlling the relative position between the CG and the mean AC of the flapping system...|$|R

The main result reveals a relation between {{existence of a}} continuous Lyapunov function and <b>inherent</b> input-to-state <b>stability</b> on compact sets with respect to both inner and outer perturbations. If the Lyapunov function is K 8 -continuous, the result applies to unbounded sets as well...|$|R
2500|$|It first flew in 1926 and {{was soon}} in use with the RRG related Rhön and Rossitten gliding clubs. Plans were sold and many were built inside and outside Germany. As examples, one was flying with the Lancashire Aero Club and another with the London Gliding Club in the early 1930s. Despite such success, the Prüfling was {{something}} of a disappointment as a secondary training aircraft, for its performance was not much better than typical primaries. Its handling was also not good, with a lack of <b>inherent</b> <b>stability.</b> [...] Lippisch returned to the design of secondary gliders four years later, after exploring tailless types, resulting in the RRG Falke.|$|E
2500|$|The {{association}} between Canada's Indigenous peoples and the Canadian Crown is both statutory and traditional, the treaties being {{seen by the}} first peoples both as legal contracts and as perpetual and personal promises by successive reigning kings and queens to protect Aboriginal welfare, define their rights, and reconcile their sovereignty {{with that of the}} monarch in Canada. The agreements are formed with the Crown because the monarchy is thought to have <b>inherent</b> <b>stability</b> and continuity, as opposed to the transitory nature of populist whims that rule the political government, meaning the link between monarch and Aboriginals will theoretically last for [...] "as long as the sun shines, grass grows and rivers flow." ...|$|E
2500|$|In dinghy sailing, a boat {{is said to}} be turtling or to turn turtle {{when the}} boat is fully {{inverted}} with the mast pointing down to the lake bottom or seabed. The name stems from the appearance of the upside-down boat, similar to the carapace, that is the top shell of a sea turtle. [...] The term can be applied to any vessel; turning turtle is less frequent but more dangerous on ships than on smaller boats. [...] Relative to monohulls, it is more hazardous on multihulls, because of their <b>inherent</b> <b>stability</b> in an inverted position. [...] Measures can be taken to prevent a capsize (where the boat is knocked over but not yet inverted) from becoming a turtle (with bottom up).|$|E

50|$|While on Army {{sick leave}} in 1901, Dunne began a {{systematic}} study of flight. Like many other pioneers he closely observed birds in flight however, unlike most, {{he was convinced}} that a safe aeroplane needed to have <b>inherent</b> aerodynamic <b>stability.</b> Encouraged among others by H.G. Wells, whom he befriended in 1902, he made a great number of small test models which would eventually lead {{to the development of a}} stable tailless swept wing configuration.|$|R
2500|$|Partial {{internal}} compression {{was considered}} for the Concorde (the Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee, in 1959, had recommended an SST to cruise at Mach2.2) but an [...] "external configuration was chosen for the <b>inherent</b> <b>stability</b> of its shock system, it had no unstart mode". However, there was some internal compression terminated by a normal shock local to the ramp boundary layer bleed slot inside the intake. but Leyman states that the intake was aerodynamically self-compensating with no trace of any unstart problem. Early {{in the development of}} the B-1 Lancer its mixed external/internal intake was changed to an external one, technically safer but with a small compromise in cruise speed. and subsequently had fixed intakes to reduce complexity, weight and cost.|$|E
2500|$|Brian Carroll {{compared}} the Lightning and the F-15C Eagle, having flown both aircraft, stating that: [...] "Acceleration in both was impressive, {{you have all}} seen the Lightning leap away once brakes are released, the Eagle was almost as good, and climb speed was rapidly achieved. Takeoff roll is between , depending upon military or maximum afterburner-powered takeoff. The Lightning was quicker off the ground, reaching [...] height in a horizontal distance of [...] ". Chief test pilot for the Lightning Roland Beamont, who also flew most of the [...] "Century Series" [...] US aircraft, stated his opinion that nothing at that time had the <b>inherent</b> <b>stability,</b> control and docile handling characteristics of the Lightning throughout the full flight envelope. The turn performance and buffet boundaries of the Lightning were {{well in advance of}} anything known to him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wings of}} SpaceShipOne can be {{pneumatically}} tilted forwards into an aerodynamically stable high-drag [...] "feathered" [...] shape. This removes {{most of the}} need to actively control attitude during the early part of reentry: Scaled Composites refer to this as [...] "care-free reentry". One of the early test flights actually performed re-entry inverted, demonstrating the flexibility and <b>inherent</b> <b>stability</b> of Burt Rutan's [...] "shuttlecock" [...] design. This feathered reentry mode is claimed to be inherently safer than the behavior at similar speeds of the Space Shuttle. The Shuttle undergoes enormous aerodynamic stresses and must be precisely steered in order to remain in a stable glide. (Although this is an interesting comparison of behavior, it is not an entirely fair comparison of design concepts: the Shuttle starts reentry at much higher speed than SpaceShipOne, and so has some very different requirements. SpaceShipOne is more similar to the X-15 vehicle.) ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{extensions}} of the standard model predict heavy metastable particles which may be modeled as solitons (skyrmions of the Higgs field), relating their particle number to a winding number. Previous work {{has shown that the}} electroweak interactions admit processes in which these solitons decay, violating standard model baryon number. We motivate the hypothesis that baryon–number–violating decay is a generic outcome of collisions between these heavy particles. We do so by exploring a 2 + 1 dimensional theory which also possesses metastable skyrmions. We use relaxation techniques to determine the size, shape and energy of static solitons in their ground state. These solitons could decay by quantum mechanical tunneling. Classically, they are metastable: only a finite excitation energy is required to induce their decay. We attempt to induce soliton decay in a classical simulation by colliding pairs of solitons. We analyze the collision of solitons with varying <b>inherent</b> <b>stabilities</b> and varying incident velocities and orientations. Our results suggest that winding-number violating decay is a generic outcome of collisions. All that is required is sufficient (not necessarily very large) incident velocity; no fine-tuning of initial 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Limited {{information}} is available on <b>inherent</b> <b>stabilities</b> of four-chain-coils. We have developed a model system to study this folding motif using synthetic peptides derived from sequences contained in the tetramerization domain of Lac repressor. These peptides are tetrameric as judged by both gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium and the tetramers are fully helical as determined by CD. The four-chain coiled-coils are well folded as judged by the cooperativity of thermal unfolding and by the extent of dispersion in aliphatic chemical shifts seen in NMR spectra. In addition, we measured the chain length dependence of this four-chain coiled-coil. To this end, we developed a general procedure for nonlinear curve fitting of denaturation data in oligomeric systems. The dissociation constants for bundles that contain alpha-helical chains 21, 28, and 35 amino acids in length are 3. 1 x 10 (- 12), 6. 7 x 10 (- 23), and 1. 0 x 10 (- 38) M 3, respectively. This corresponds to tetramer stabilities (in terms of the peptide monomer concentration) of 180 microM, 51 nM, and 280 fM, respectively. Finally, we discuss the rules governing coiled-coil formation {{in light of the}} work presented here...|$|R

40|$|The spatiotemporally dynamic {{distribution}} of instructive ligands within embryonic tissue, and their feedback antagonists, including <b>inherent</b> <b>stabilities</b> {{and rates of}} clearance, are affected by interactions with cell surfaces or extracellular matrix (ECM). Nodal (here, Xnr 1 or Nodal 1 in Xenopus) and Lefty interact in a cross-regulatory relationship in mesendoderm induction, and are the conserved instructors of left-right (LR) asymmetry in early somitogenesis stage embryos. By expressing Xnr 1 and Lefty proproteins that produce mature functional epitope-tagged ligands in vivo, we found that ECM is a principal surface of Nodal and Lefty accumulation. We detected Lefty moving faster than Nodal, with evidence that intact sulfated proteoglycans in the ECM facilitate the remarkable long distance movement of Nodal. We propose that Nodal autoregulation substantially aided by rapid ligand transport underlies the anteriorward shift of Nodal expression in the left LPM (lateral plate mesoderm), and speculate that the higher levels of chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) in more mature anterior regions provide directional transport cues. Immunodetection and biochemical analysis showed transfer of Lefty from left LPM to right LPM, providing direct evidence that left-side-derived Lefty is a significant influence in ensuring the continued suppression of right-sided expression of Nodal, maintaining unilateral expression of this conserved determinant of asymmetry...|$|R
