25|$|Although Poe {{wrote this}} short story before the {{invention}} of modern psychological science, Roderick's condition can be described according to its terminology. It includes a form of sensory overload known as <b>hyperesthesia</b> (hypersensitivity to textures, light, sounds, smells and tastes), hypochondria (an excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness) and acute anxiety. It is revealed that Roderick's twin sister, Madeline, is also ill and falls into cataleptic, deathlike trances. Roderick and Madeline are the only remaining members of the Usher family.|$|E
25|$|The first {{description}} of symptoms associated with alcoholic polyneuropathy were recorded by John C. Lettsome in 1787 when he noted <b>hyperesthesia</b> and paralysis in legs more than arms of patients. Jackson {{has also been}} credited with describing polyneuropathy in chronic alcoholics in 1822. The clinical title of alcoholic polyneuropathy was widely recognized by the late nineteenth century. It was thought that the polyneuropathy was {{a direct result of}} the toxic effect alcohol had on peripheral nerves when used excessively. In 1928, George C. Shattuck argued that the polyneuropathy resulted from a vitamin B deficiency commonly found in alcoholics and he claimed that alcoholic polyneuropathy should be related to beriberi. This debate continues today over what exactly causes this disease, some argue it is just the alcohol toxicity, others claim the vitamin deficiencies are to blame and still others say it is some combination of the two.|$|E
40|$|Nerve injury-induced afferent {{discharge}} {{is thought}} to elicit spinal sensitization and consequent abnormal pain. Experimental neuropathic pain, however, also depends on central changes, including descending facilitation arising from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and upregulation of spinal dynorphin. A possible intersection of these influences at the spinal level was explored by measuring evoked, excitatory transmitter release in tissues taken from nerve-injured animals with or without previous manipulation of descending modulatory systems. Spinal nerve ligation (SNL) produced expected tactile and thermal <b>hyperesthesias.</b> Capsaicin-evoked calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release was markedly enhanced in lumbar spinal tissue from SNL rats when compared with sham-operated controls. Enhanced, evoked CGRP release from SNL rats was blocked by anti-dynorphin A (1 – 13) antiserum; this treatment did not alter evoked release in tissues from sham-operated rats. Dorsolateral funiculus lesion (DLF) or destruction of RVM neurons expressing �-opioid receptors with dermorphin–saporin, blocked tactile and thermal hypersensitivity, as well as SNL-induced upregulation of spinal dynorphin. Spinal tissues from these DLF-lesioned or dermorphin–saporin-treated SNL rats did not exhibit enhanced capsaicinevoked CGRP-IR release. These data demonstrate exaggerated release of excitatory transmitter from primary afferents after injury to peripheral nerves, supporting the likely importance of increased afferent input as a driving force of neuropathic pain. The data also show that modulatory influences of descending facilitation are required for enhanced evoked transmitter release after nerve injury. Thus, convergence of descending modulation, spinal plasticity, and afferent drive in the nerve-injured state reveals a mechanism by which some aspects of nerve injury-induced <b>hyperesthesias</b> may occur.

50|$|The {{results of}} tendon {{transfers}} {{for patients with}} complete injuries are predictable. On the other hand, {{it is well known}} that muscles lacking normal excitation perform unreliably after surgical tendon transfers. Despite the unpredictable aspect in incomplete lesions tendon transfers may be useful. The surgeon should be confident that the muscle to be transferred has enough power and is under good voluntary control. Pre-operative assessment is more difficult to assess in incomplete lesions.Patients with an incomplete lesion also often need therapy or surgery before the procedure to restore function to correct the consequences of the injury. These consequences are hypertonicity/spasticity, contractures, painful <b>hyperesthesias</b> and paralyzed proximal upper limb muscles with distal muscle sparing. Spasticity is a frequent consequence of incomplete injuries. Spasticity often decreases function, but sometimes a patient can control the spasticity in a way that it is useful to their function. The location and the effect of the spasticity should be analyzed carefully before treatment is planned. An injection of Botulinum toxin (Botox) into spastic muscles is a treatment to reduce spasticity. This can be used to prevent muscle shorting and early contractures.|$|R
5000|$|The {{severity}} {{and clinical}} course of Angiostrongylus disease depends significantly on the ingested load of third-stage larvae, creating great variability from case to case {{making it difficult}} to design clinical trials and to judge the effectiveness of treatments. Typical conservative medical management including analgesics and sedatives provide minimal relief for the headaches and <b>hyperesthesias.</b> Removing cerebrospinal fluid at regular three- to seven-day intervals is the only proven method of significantly reducing intracranial pressure and can be used for symptomatic treatment of headaches. This process may be repeated until improvement is shown. There is growing evidence of moderate quality that suggests corticosteroid therapy using prednisolone or dexamethasone has beneficial effect in treating the CNS symptoms related to A. cantonensis infections. Although early research did not show treatment with antihelminthic agents like thiobendazole or albendazole effective in improving the clinical course of the illness, a number or recent studies out of Thailand and China show that the combination of glucocorticoids and antihelminthics are safe and decrease the duration of headaches and the number of patients who had significant headache. Although the addition of antihelminthic agents for management of A. cantonensis infection has a theoretic risk of precipitating a neurologic crisis by releasing an overwhelming load of antigens though simultaneous death of the larvae, no study has shown this to exist in the clinical setting. Additionally, the failure to kill parasites before they attempt to migrate out of the CNS increases the risk of mechanical damage by migrating larvae. Although combination therapy using albendazole and prednisolone has no significant advantage compared to treatment using prednisolone alone in mild cases, the treatment with antihelminthics is demonstrably safe and may have significant benefit for patients with high parasite loads at risk for permanent disability or death. [...] Further studies to better define treatment regimens for mild, moderate and severe disease would be extremely useful but have not yet been performed due to the technical difficulties mentioned above.|$|R

40|$|Intrathecal {{injection}} of dynorphin or des-Tyr-dynorphin fragments, {{which do not}} bind to opioid receptors, produce tactile and thermal hypersensitivity in rodents. The maintenance, but not initiation, of experimental neuropathic pain depends upon pronociceptive effects of elevated levels of spinal dynorphin. Recent findings implicated a direct excitatory action of dynorphin A at bradykinin receptors in vitro. Here, {{the possibility that the}} pronociceptive actions of pharmacological dynorphin or of pathological levels of endogenous spinal dynorphin are mediated by interaction with bradykinin receptors was explored. While spinal administration {{of a wide range of}} bradykinin did not produce hyperalgesia in rats, intrathecal {{injection of}} non-opioid des-tyrosyl-dynorphin A(2 - 13) produced reversible tactile and thermal hypersensitivities that were reversed by bradykinin receptor antagonists. Dynorphin-induced behavioral <b>hyperesthesias</b> were observed in bradykinin B 2 receptor wild-type but not in B 2 receptor knockout mice. Spinal administration or infusion of B 1, and especially B 2, receptor antagonists reversed experimental neuropathic pain behaviors in rats with peripheral nerve injury but only when the antagonists were given at times at which dynorphin was upregulated. After nerve injury, both B 1 and B 2 receptor mRNA were increased in the dorsal root ganglion, but not in the spinal cord. While a marked increase in mRNA expression for prodynorphin in the lumbar spinal cord was found following nerve injury, expression of mRNA for kininogen was below detection levels. The possible interaction of spinal dynorphin with bradykinin receptors as a basis of the pronociceptive action of this peptide was further tested in the CFA-induced inflammatory pain and DBTC-induced pancreatitis pain. Intrathecal administration of bradykinin receptor antagonists or dynorphin antiserum reversed DBTC-induced abdominal hypersensitivity and CFA-induced hyperalgesia only when spinal dynorphin or prodynorphin is upregulated. The antihyperalgesic effect of the bradykinin receptor antagonists was not due to de novo production of bradykinin. Taken together, our results unravel a novel, non-opioid molecular target of dynorphin, and indicate that dynorphin acts at bradykinin receptors to produce persistent psin in the pathological pain states. This novel pronociceptive mechanism offers new approaches to the development of therapy for pathological pain states...|$|R
