For small values of , the displacement is not so large as to cause elastic deformation. Jun-ichi Ueda and Yoshiro Sadamoto have found that as [...] increases beyond 7, the effective mass of a spring in a vertical spring-mass system becomes smaller than Rayleigh's value [...] and eventually reaches negative values. This unexpected behavior of the effective mass can be explained in terms of the <b>elastic</b> <b>after-effect</b> (which is the spring's not returning to its original length after the load is removed).|$|E
40|$|Anelastic {{relaxation}} {{processes in}} single crystals of aluminum {{have been investigated}} after 3 MeV-electron irradiation at 4. 5 K. The <b>elastic</b> <b>after-effect</b> measurements were made on torsionally stressed and samples (defect concentration 7 · 10 ^- 4 and 4 · 10 ^- 4 respectively). The <b>elastic</b> <b>after-effect</b> method is weIl suited for investigating such relaxation processes where a defect reorientation jump mayaIso lead to migration, and therefore through reactions with other defects in the lattice, to annihilation of the relaxing defect. The advantage of the <b>elastic</b> <b>after-effect</b> method is that it requires only a few defect reorientation jumps {{in comparison to the}} several thousand necessary for an internal friction measurement. In addition to the relaxation processes which have been seen previously in internal friction studies, two new processes, A and B, have been observed. Process A has been identified as the reorientational relaxation of -dumbbell interstitials in recovery stage I_D+E. The measured activation energy (115 meV) for process A shows that reorientation and migration of thisdefect occurs by the same jump process. The value found for the elastic shape factor (A-B = 1. 1 eV) is consistent with that expected from theoretical estimateso Process B exhibits all the characteristics expected for reorientation of the Johnson di-interstitial in stage II_ 1. The defect symmetry and activationenergy for other relaxation processes have been determined, and possible configurations for corresponding defects are discussed. The dose dependence and annealing behaviour of the diaelastic modulus change have also been measured. The anisotropy and magnitude of the diaelastic effect indicate that the interstitialdefect created during irradiation at liquid helium temperature assumes the -split configuration. The annealing behaviour indicates that interstitial atoms in small clusters have an even higher diaelastic polarizability than single interstitials, and that the diaelastic polarizability decreases strongly when the interstitials form dislocation loops...|$|E

It is found that at relatively high interstitial solute concentrations some of the Snoek peak broadening is due to relaxations that are distinct from the main relaxation. This finding supports the view that interstitial solutes have an interaction that produces clusters of interstitials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Clay, rocks, {{concrete}} and other composite solids show {{evidence of a}} hierarchical structure. A fractal tree of nested viscoelastic boxes is proposed to describe the elastic after-effects in these composite solids. A generalized fractal transmission line approach is developed to relate the strain and stress responses. Power law for strain, under an applied stress step, is derived. The exponent in the power law is obtained as a well-defined function of the branching numbers and scaling parameters of the viscoelastic hierarchy. Then, a composite solid with both instantaneous (linear) elastic strain response and power law type (linear) <b>elastic</b> <b>after-effect</b> for an applied stress step, is considered. The stretched exponential stress relaxation to an applied strain step is derived as an approximation. For the same composite solid, the stretch parameter of the stretched exponential and the exponent of the power law result to be equal to each other...|$|E
40|$|Production of {{investment}} patterns for precision casting by molding of powders based on waxy materials {{makes it possible}} to improve dimensional and geometric properties of castings mainly at the expense of shrinkage defect elimination. However, during the formation of compact massive elements the pattern material relaxes elastically after load removal. In addition, non-uniform density distribution in dif-ferent parts of the compacts is observed in a number of cases. The necessity of finding the optimal re-gimes of compact formation with minimal anisotropy, and therefore minimal value of elastic aftereffect of compacted porous body after load removal determines the relevance of this study. In this paper we intro-duce experimental determination of one variant of powder body compaction and subsequent <b>elastic</b> <b>after-effect</b> due to load removal. Investigated powder body consists of single-component polymeric material. In accordance with the results of the experiments the dependence of material temperature in contact area between the die and the mold on compacting pressure was obtained. It was experimentally determined the influence of thermophysical properties of powder body compaction process on shrinkage formation and elastic aftereffect of compact material...|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms {{which may}} play a role in superplastic {{deformation}} (grain strain mechanisms, grain boundary sliding (GBS) mechanisms) are reviewed. Two well-known lattice dislocation mechanisms are re-evaluated for grain boundary dislocations (GBDs). The manner in which the deformation mechanisms interact, or are inhibited or obscured, is discussed. Mechanisms of anelastic deformation are outlined, with particular reference to fine-grained materials. Expressions for anelastic recovery caused either by grain boundary (GB) tension or by the relaxation of GBD pile-ups are derived. The plastic properties of Sn- 38. 1 w/o Pb and Sn- 2 w/o Pb are measured. They are similar in both alloys. No threshold stress for plastic deformation is detected, for stresses and strain rates as low as 0. IMPa and 10 - 10 s - 1 respectively. The presence of GB diffusion creep (Coble creep) is established experimentally in Sn- 2 w/o Pb with grain sizes ≥ 50 μm. Coble creep is inhibited for small grain sizes (~ 10 μm). The inhibition is explained by GBS caused by GBDs. In disagreement with the measurements, high threshold stresses are predicted for Sn- 38. 1 w/o Pb. This implies that GBD line tensions are lower than those of lattice dislocations. The anelastic properties of Sn- 2 w/o Pb and Sn- 38. 1 w/o Pb are determined from the <b>elastic</b> <b>after-effect</b> (anelastic recovery after unloading). They are remarkable: anelastic contractions larger than 0. 2 % and relaxation strengths (= ratio of anelastically recovered to elastically recovered strain) in excess of 100 are found. The anelastic strains are approximately proportional to the stress and the inverse grain size. A wide range of relaxation times (~ 6 decades) is observed. A mechanism based on the relaxation of GBD pile-ups is in qualitative agreement with the measured anelasticity. The high measured relaxation strengths, however, imply that the interaction between GBDs is much weaker (~ 2 orders of magnitude) than that between lattice dislocations. This could be due to a relatively low self-energy of GBDs and would be in qualitative agreement with the low GBD line tensions suggested above. The influence of anelasticity on transients (e. g. stress relaxation, dip test) is investigated using a rheological model with three Voigt elements (anelasticity) and a nonlinear dashpot (plasticity). Using independently determined plastic and anelastic parameters the 4 -th order differential equa tion corresponding to the model is solved numerically for several examples. Measured transients are much more accurately predicted with the present model than with models neglecting anelasticity. </p...|$|E
