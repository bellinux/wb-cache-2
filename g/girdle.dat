5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living <b>Girdle</b> in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole. The Living <b>Girdle</b> was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the solid rubber <b>girdle</b> was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|The bowfin is an {{actinopterygii}} {{which means}} that the pectoral <b>girdle</b> is partly endochondral but mostly dermal bone. In this group of fishes the fins function to maneuver, brake, and for slight positional adjustments. The pectoral <b>girdle</b> of the bowfin has six parts. The post temporal, supracleithrum, postcleithrum, cleithrum, scapulacoracoid, and the clavicle make up the pectoral girdle.The pectoral <b>girdle</b> is attached to the skull. The pectoral girl is made of mostly dermal and some endochondral bone. The paired pectoral and pelvic fins of fish are homologous with the limbs of tetrapods.|$|E

Most {{individuals are}} not C. vittifer, {{but in fact}} Limpopo <b>girdled</b> lizards (Cordylus jonesii). The Limpopo <b>girdled</b> lizard can be quickly distinguished from C. vittifer by its rounded, not flattened, body. The Limpopo <b>girdled</b> lizard also lacks the elongate first row of dorsal scales.|$|R
40|$|Leaf net CO 2 {{assimilation}} rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), carboxylation efficiency, and foliar nonstructural carbohydrates {{were measured}} on mature, field-grown Vitis vinifera L. (cv Thompson Seedless) vines {{that had been}} trunk <b>girdled,</b> sprayed with gibberellic acid, or both, shortly after anthesis. <b>Girdling</b> reduced A, gs, and carboxylation efficiency when measured 2 weeks after imposition of the treatments. Diurnal measurements indicated that A of <b>girdled</b> vines was {{less than that of}} control vines between 1000 and 1800 hours. Gibberellic acid mitigated the depressing effect of <b>girdling</b> on gs during the same diurnal measurements. The concentrations of foliar carbohydrates were greatest for the <b>girdled</b> vines, followed by the combination treatment and were lowest for the control vines. Foliar carbohydrates were greater for <b>girdled</b> vines 4 weeks after the treatments were imposed, however, by this time {{there was no significant difference}} in A between the control and <b>girdled</b> vines. Two and 4 weeks after the experiment was initiated root carbohydrate concentrations were less for the <b>girdled</b> vines when compared to the control vines. The data indicate that the reduction in A of <b>girdled</b> grapevines is not associated with the accumulation of leaf nonstructural carbohydrates following the <b>girdling</b> treatment...|$|R

5|$|Amphibians have a {{skeletal}} {{system that is}} structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though {{with a number of}} variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculo{{skeletal system}} is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral <b>girdle</b> is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic <b>girdle</b> is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E
5|$|An {{analogy is}} also made between Gawain's {{trial and the}} Biblical test that Adam {{encounters}} in the Garden of Eden. Adam succumbs to Eve just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak's wife by accepting the <b>girdle.</b> Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the <b>girdle</b> and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby allowing {{him to become a}} better Christian by learning from his mistakes. Through the various games played and hardships endured, Gawain finds his place within the Christian world.|$|E
50|$|The Transvaal <b>girdled</b> lizard {{is closely}} related to Machadoe’s <b>girdled</b> lizard (Cordylus machadoi) from northwestern Namibia. Both species have an {{elongate}} first row of dorsal scales. Machadoe’s <b>girdled</b> lizard is uniform yellow brown above and paler below. The head is dark brown with pale lips. The pale vertebral stripe found in the Transvaal <b>Girdled</b> Lizard is not present.|$|R
40|$|Stem or trunk <b>girdling</b> is a {{technique}} used in physiological studies and in horticultural practice for interrupting carbon flow through the phloem {{to other parts of}} the plant without influencing water flow in the xylem. Trunk <b>girdling</b> in peaches is practiced primarily to stimulate fruit growth but it also tends to decrease shoot vigour for a period of time after <b>girdling.</b> Water flow through the trunk or branches of peach trees is thought to be primarily dependent on the most recently formed ring of xylem and vegetative growth is closely related to stem water potential and stem hydraulic conductance. The aim of the present work was to determine whether vigour reduction due to <b>girdling</b> was correlated with a reduction in midday stem water potential during the period of time between <b>girdling</b> and the subsequent healing of stem tissue. 'Springcrest' peach trees were <b>girdled</b> on two different dates. Fruit yield and size, water sprout growth, proleptic shoot growth and stem water potential were measured. Early and late <b>girdled</b> trees yielded larger fruits and fewer and shorter water sprouts in comparison with control trees. Midday stem water potential declined significantly after <b>girdling</b> and gradually recovered until the time of fruit harvest. These results suggest that the vigour reduction of <b>girdled</b> trees is related to a decrease of midday stem water potential caused by <b>girdling.</b> Early tree <b>girdling</b> increased the reduction in midday stem water potential and shoot growth compared with the later <b>girdling</b> treatment. These results point out that even though <b>girdling</b> only removes bark and phloem tissue it can apparently affect water flow in xylem...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>girdling</b> were {{analysed}} in a sessile oak (Quercus petraea Matts. Leibl.) forest with an 80 -year-old coppice with standard structure in northern Spain. The study evaluated {{the viability of}} <b>girdling</b> {{as an alternative to}} felling trees during crown thinning. Eighty-four direct competitors of selected future crop trees were <b>girdled</b> by double notching and peeling. Three years after <b>girdling,</b> 100 % of the treated trees had died. Approximately half of the <b>girdled</b> trees did not resprout. The occurrence of basal sprouting was very low, and more than 35 % of the sprouts had very low vigour. No correlation was found between sprouting and the diameter of the <b>girdled</b> trees or the distance to their nearest neighbour. A negative relationship between the diameter of the <b>girdled</b> tree and the stage of decline was recognized. <b>Girdling</b> is an economic alternative to non-commercial thinning in oak stands and can be seen as an effective structural enrichment treatment...|$|R
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder <b>girdle</b> depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder <b>girdle</b> can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} <b>girdle</b> is well known. Both {{the left}} and right scapulae and coracoids are known, though incomplete. The scapulae are large, and robust, and thicken as they near the glenoids. The scapular blades are flat, although they are both convex along the anterior edge. Where the scapulae and coracoids articulate, the coracoids are thickest, and they become gradually thinner as they gain distance from the scapulae. The younger specimen of Patagosaurus possesses a slightly different morphology of the pectoral <b>girdle,</b> with slightly differing proportions, such as a slightly smaller scapular blade. The coracoids resemble Barapasaurus in shape, and differ from Camarasaurus, although they cannot be directly compared with those of Cetiosaurus.|$|E
5|$|By chewing the tap {{and lateral}} roots of trees, {{caterpillars}} {{feed on the}} cambium growth, produced by the tree {{at the site of}} the injury. The larvae may <b>girdle</b> a root, thereby causing its death, or the lesions may be only partial, allowing the root to continue functioning, albeit with some deformity.|$|E
40|$|Heat <b>girdling</b> is {{a method}} to {{estimate}} the relative contribution of phloem vs xylem water flow to fruit growth. The heat <b>girdling</b> process is assumed to destroy all living tissues, including the phloem, without affecting xylem conductivity. However, to date, the assumption that xylem is not affected by heat <b>girdling</b> remains unproven. * In this study, we used in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) velocimetry to test if heat <b>girdling</b> can cause xylem vessels to embolize or affect xylem water flow characteristics in the peduncle of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv Dirk). * Anatomical and MRI data indicated that, {{at the site of}} <b>girdling,</b> all living tissues were disrupted, but that the functionality of the xylem remained unchanged. MRI velocimetry showed that the volume flow through the secondary xylem was not impeded by heat <b>girdling</b> in either the short or the long term (up to 91  h after <b>girdling).</b> * This study provides support for the hypothesis that in the tomato peduncle the integrity and functionality of the xylem remain unaffected by heat <b>girdling.</b> It therefore confirms the validity of the heat <b>girdling</b> technique as a means to estimate relative contributions of xylem and phloem water flow to fruit growth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Limitations in the {{techniques}} used to separate root-derived and soil-organic-matter (SOM) -derived respiration have hampered {{the understanding of}} forest carbon cycling. Tree <b>girdling</b> {{is considered to be}} a robust approach with little disturbance to the root–soil system. Using this approach, we tried to separate root-derived respiration from SOM-derived respiration under Acacia crassicarpa and Eucalyptus urophylla plantations in South China. We found that <b>girdling</b> reduced soil respiration and temperature sensitivity of respiration (Q 10) under both plantations compared to controls, but the intensity of <b>girdling</b> effects was species specific. Six months after <b>girdling,</b> live fine root biomass was lower than the control in A. crassicarpa but not in E. urophylla. Soil microbial biomass (Cmic) under A. crassicarpa was increased by <b>girdling</b> 17 days after treatment, but decreased thereafter. In contrast, there was no difference in Cmic between <b>girdled</b> and control treatments under E. urophylla. <b>Girdling</b> significantly decreased soil or-ganic carbon (SOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) under A. crassicarpa, but not under E. urophylla. We ascribe differences in <b>girdling</b> effects on belowground carbon between the two species to differences in resprouting traits...|$|R
40|$|Fairchild' {{mandarins}} in the Phoenix {{area and}} 'Lisbon' lemons in Yuma were <b>girdled</b> beginning in November 1996. November, March and May <b>girdling</b> of the mandarins {{led to the}} greatest yield the first year, while March and May <b>girdling</b> led to the greatest yield in years 2 and 3. March <b>girdling</b> yield increases were generally due to greater fruit numbers, while in May, yield increases were due to greater fruit numbers and fruit size. Returns per acre suggest that March and or May <b>girdling</b> of mandarins will lead to greater profits for the grower. Like mandarins, lemon yields were greater following November, or November and March <b>girdling</b> after one year of the experiment. However, yields of these trees dropped considerably the second year, and the trees {{appear to be in}} an alternate bearing cycle. No lemon <b>girdling</b> treatment appears to be better than the untreated trees after three years...|$|R
5|$|Given {{the varied}} and even {{contradictory}} {{interpretations of the}} colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous. In English folklore and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man. Because of its connection with faeries and spirits in early English folklore, green also signified witchcraft, devilry and evil. It can also represent decay and toxicity. When combined with gold, as with the Green Knight and the <b>girdle,</b> green was often seen as representing youth's passing. In Celtic mythology, green was associated with misfortune and death, and therefore avoided in clothing. The green <b>girdle,</b> originally worn for protection, {{became a symbol of}} shame and cowardice; it is finally adopted as a symbol of honour by the knights of Camelot, signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; this displays both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour green.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} phylogenetic analyses of the group, Gardiner (1983) recognized five characteristics that made Temnospondyli a clade: a bone {{at the back of the}} skull, the parasphenoid, is connected to another bone on the underside of the skull, the pterygoid; large openings called interpterygoid vacuities are present between the pterygoids; the stapes (a bone involved in hearing) is connected to the parasphenoid and projects upward; the cleithrum, a bone in the pectoral <b>girdle,</b> is thin; and part of the vertebra called the interdorsal attaches to the neural arch. Additional features were given by Godfrey et al. (1987), including the contact between the postparietal and exoccipital at the back of the skull, small projections (uncinate processes) on the ribs, and a pelvic <b>girdle</b> with each side having a single iliac blade. These shared characteristics are called synapomorphies.|$|E
5|$|Since Patagosaurus {{is known}} from many specimens, {{including}} at least one juvenile, its anatomy and growth are fairly well understood. Both ages exhibit the typical features of a sauropod, a long neck, small head, a long tail, and being quadrupedal. The juvenile exhibits features different from the adult in regions like the mandible, pectoral <b>girdle,</b> pelvis and hindlimb, although overall their anatomy is quite similar. The many known specimens help fill in gaps in the anatomy of the genus, such as the forelimb and skull. Parts of the skeleton, like the pectoral <b>girdle,</b> tibia and pubis, are more robust, while others, like the forelimb and ischium, are more gracile. The material of Patagosaurus is similar to closely related taxa like Cetiosaurus and Volkheimeria, more primitive genera such as Barapasaurus and Amygdalodon, and more derived sauropods like Diplodocus and Camarasaurus.|$|E

50|$|The Limpopo <b>girdled</b> lizard is {{sometimes}} {{classified as a}} subspecies of the tropical <b>girdled</b> lizard (Cordylus tropidosternum). When both species are held together, the Limpopo <b>girdled</b> lizard has a noticeably shorter snout.

Scales on the throat and belly of Limpopo <b>girdled</b> lizards are smooth instead of keeled. Limpopo <b>girdled</b> lizards are exported from Mozambique for the pet trade, where they are often mislabeled as Cordylus vittifer. They make hardy captives, feeding on insects and other small arthropods.|$|R
5000|$|Tropical <b>girdled</b> lizards {{are almost}} {{identical}} to the Limpopo <b>girdled</b> lizard (Cordylus jonesii [...] ) and the Ukinga <b>girdled</b> lizard (Cordylus ukingensis).

The Ukinga <b>girdled</b> lizard has distinctive white lips, a small ridge over each eye (supraocular ridge), and the loreal scale is fused with the preocular scale (they are separate in C. tropidosternum and C. jonesii [...] ).|$|R
5|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, wrist (semi-lunate carpal), arm and pectoral <b>girdle,</b> furcula (wishbone), and breast bone. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens {{the case for the}} link.|$|E
5|$|Before going {{hunting the}} next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain {{whatever}} he catches {{on the condition that}} Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a <b>girdle</b> of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die {{the next day}}, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses – but Gawain says nothing of the <b>girdle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{literary}} critics see the poem as portraying women's ultimate power over men.

Gawain's misogynist passage, in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.|$|E

40|$|The availabilities {{of carbon}} (C) and {{nitrogen}} (N) in soil {{play an important}} role in soil carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission. However, the variation in the soil respiration (Rs) and response of microbial community to the combined changes in belowground C and N inputs in forest ecosystems are not yet fully understood. Stem <b>girdling</b> and N addition were performed in this study to evaluate the effects of C supply and N availability on Rs and soil microbial community in a subtropical forest. The trees were <b>girdled</b> on 1 July 2012. Rs was monitored from July 2012 to November 2013, and soil microbial community composition was also examined by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) 1 year after <b>girdling.</b> Results showed that Rs decreased by 40. 5 % with <b>girdling</b> alone, but N addition only did not change Rs. Interestingly, Rs decreased by 62. 7 % under the <b>girdling</b> with N addition treatment. The reducing effect of <b>girdling</b> and N addition on Rs differed between dormant and growing seasons. <b>Girdling</b> alone reduced Rs by 33. 9 % in the dormant season and 54. 8 % in the growing season compared with the control. By contrast, <b>girdling</b> with N addition decreased Rs by 59. 5 % in the dormant season and 65. 4 % in the growing season. <b>Girdling</b> and N addition significantly decreased the total and bacterial PLFAs. Moreover, the effect of N addition was greater than <b>girdling.</b> Both <b>girdling</b> and N addition treatments separated the microbial groups on the basis of the first principal component through principal component analysis compared with control. This indicated that <b>girdling</b> and N addition changed the soil microbial community composition. However, the effect of <b>girdling</b> with N addition treatment separated the microbial groups on the basis of the second principal component compared to N addition treatment, which suggested N addition altered the effect of <b>girdling</b> on soil microbial community composition. These results suggest that the increase in soil N availability by N deposition alters the effect of belowground C allocation on the decomposition of soil organic matter by altering the composition of the soil microbial community...|$|R

5|$|Frogs and toads are broadly {{classified}} into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four families of primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, {{by far the}} largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral <b>girdle,</b> and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.|$|E
5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping.

40|$|Stem-girdling {{treatments}} {{were applied}} {{in early spring}} to stimulate cone formation in two genotypes of interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco). After <b>girdling</b> treatments, male cone yield increased significantly in the next growing season. The increase was 14 -fold in genotype 9137. In genotype 9550, more than 8, 700 male cones were induced from each tree whereas no male cones were found in controls. Female cone yield was zero in controls and low for <b>girdled</b> trees in both genotypes. Multiple phytohormone-related compounds, including gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA) and their selected metabolites, were analyzed in developing long shoots after <b>girdling</b> treatments by high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Concentrations of GA 4 were slightly higher at week 2 following <b>girdling</b> treatment, whereas at week 8 lower GA 4 concentrations were found in <b>girdled</b> samples. Stem <b>girdling</b> did not affect concentrations of IAA and major cytokinins, such as zeatin riboside and isopentenyl adenosine. Concentrations of ABA differed two-fold between the genotypes. Although <b>girdling</b> treatment did not cause differences in ABA concentrations, it generally resulted in higher concentrations of ABA glucose ester.
