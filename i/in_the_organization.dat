Like the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society, it was focused on education and social welfare, but it also pushed for equal rights for women, including suffrage, equal inheritance, and an end to passport restrictions. The 1917 Revolution, catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated a surge of membership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization.</b> In the same year, because of the society's continued lobbying, Russia became the first major world power to grant women the right to vote.|$|E
