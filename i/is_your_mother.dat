6000|$|... "Not in the least. Who {{has ever}} succeeded in convincing fools? Let's try another subject. <b>Is</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{reconciled}} {{to your new}} plans?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Joyce continued. [...] "You say {{you know}} nothing about it. Why not find out {{something}} about it? Here <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> Study her." ...|$|E
60|$|DOROTHY. Why, you dear, silly fellow, I'm {{old enough}} to <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "Pardon my curiosity, Miss Lambert, but you've used {{a phrase}} {{once or twice}} which I've heard the people of a certain faith use. <b>Is</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> a spiritualist?" ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. Then it couldn't {{have been}} Mrs. Herriott. She {{was old enough}} to have <b>been</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> dear.|$|R
6000|$|... "True. You are a gentleman's daughter. But who <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother?</b> Who <b>are</b> <b>your</b> {{uncles and}} aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What do you persecute me for, if it isn't for the money. I'm {{old enough}} to <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> In a way I've <b>been</b> <b>your</b> mother.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And then, {{when all}} the world will know it, how <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{to be kept in}} the dark? And that which she fears and anticipates is as bad, probably, as the actual truth. If my advice be {{followed}} nothing will be kept from her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{some one}} said, but the Dean never {{calls on the}} {{officers}} unless there is some introduction, or {{there would be no}} end to it. It was a mistake letting him in to disturb Rachel. <b>Is</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> gone up to her, my dear?" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Is</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> dreadfully {{annoyed with}} you? And Paradine must be furious. I shall call him Uncle Paradine next time I see him. It'll {{make him feel}} so middle-aged. Charlie, you don't know how {{grateful}} I am {{for what you did}} yesterday. You acted like a real brick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah; exactly." [...] By such {{conversation}} {{he discovered the}} circumstances which had enveloped his wife and her child in such total obscurity that he had long ago believed them {{to be in their}} graves.

6000|$|... "Have I {{not told}} you, thickhead? You {{are not a}} man any more, you are a spirit. Once, so it seems, you ruled this people in the past, and now you will rule them again. You and the Shepherdess are both gods. She <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and you are her child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] she said, [...] "I {{thought your}} face had a {{familiar}} look. It <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> I knew and loved. I'm Miss Lucretia Penniman." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{will find}} her dressed now, Mr. Mason," [...] said she; [...] "but I conjure you, as you hope for mercy yourself, to be merciful to her.
