5|$|In his {{combined}} works, Kant {{constructed the}} basis for an ethical law from the concept of duty. Kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will. No other virtue has this status because every other virtue {{can be used to}} achieve immoral ends (the virtue of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person, for example). The good will is unique in that it is always good and maintains <b>its</b> <b>moral</b> value even when it fails to achieve <b>its</b> <b>moral</b> intentions. Kant regarded the good will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends.|$|E
5|$|In some {{interpretations of}} the novella, the male {{characters}} represent patriarchal society, with Hyde signifying <b>its</b> <b>moral</b> corruption. Other interpretations suggest {{that the lack of}} female companionship for the male characters indicates their latent homosexuality and that Hyde is engaged in homosexual activity. These interpretations are harder to apply to the play because of Sullivan's addition of female characters and heterosexual relationships.|$|E

5|$|Literature in Virginia often {{deals with}} the state's {{extensive}} and sometimes troubled past. The works of Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Glasgow often dealt with social inequalities {{and the role of}} women in her culture. Glasgow's peer and close friend James Branch Cabell wrote extensively about the changing position of gentry in the Reconstruction era, and challenged <b>its</b> <b>moral</b> code with Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice. William Styron approached history in works such as The Confessions of Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice. Tom Wolfe has occasionally dealt with his southern heritage in bestsellers like I Am Charlotte Simmons. Mount Vernon native Matt Bondurant received critical acclaim for his historic novel The Wettest County in the World about moonshiners in Franklin County during prohibition. Virginia also names a state Poet Laureate.|$|E

25|$|Kant’s second {{proposition}} {{states that}} “an action from duty has <b>its</b> <b>moral</b> worth {{not in the}} purpose to be attained by it but in the maxim in accordance with which it is decided upon, and therefore does not depend upon {{the realization of the}} object of the action but merely upon the principle of volition in accordance with which the action is done without regard for any object of the faculty of desire” (4:400). A maxim of an action is its principle of volition. By this, Kant means that the moral worth of an act depends not on its consequences, intended or real, but on the principle acted upon.|$|E
