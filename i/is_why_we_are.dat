The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a {{collection}} of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> calling it the New American Apartheid. This is the same segment of American society that has experienced some of the most drastic reductions in income and they have been targeted for their involvement in drugs and the subsequent violence that extends from the lack of legitimate means of goal attainment.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1993, {{an article}} in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, Bergens Tidende (BT), brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight. Two friends of Vikernes {{interview}}ed him and brought the interview to the newspaper, hoping they would print it. In the anonymous interview, 'Count Grishnackh' (Vikernes) claimed to have burnt the churches and killed a man in Lillehammer. BT journalist Finn Bjørn Tønder {{set up a meeting}} with 'Count Grishnackh', with help from the friends. The journalists were summoned to an apartment and reportedly warned that they would be shot if the police were called. There, Vikernes and his companions told the journalists that they had burnt the churches, or knew who had done it, and said that the attacks would continue. They claimed to be Devil worshippers and said: [...] "Our intention is to spread fear and devilry [...] that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> telling this to Bergens Tidende." [...] They gave the journalists details about the arsons that hadn't been released to the press and so BT spoke with the police before publishing it, who confirmed these details.|$|E

[...] Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said, [...] "The Supreme Court has delivered {{one of the most significant}} victories for religious freedom in our generation. We are thankful the Supreme Court agreed that the government went too far by mandating that family businesses owners must violate their consciences under threat of crippling fines." [...] The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said, [...] "We welcome the Supreme Court's decision to recognize that Americans can continue to follow their faith when they run a family business...

2500|$|There is a {{progression}} from this {{opening of the}} nominal group, with the greatest specifying potential, through items that have successively less identifying potential and are increasingly permanent as attributes of the head. As Halliday points out, [...] "the more permanent the attribute of a thing, the less likely it is to identify it in a particular context" [...] (that is, of the speech event). The most permanent item, of course, is the head itself. This pattern from transient specification to permanent attribute explains why the items are ordered {{as they are in}} a nominal group. The deictic ("those") comes first; this is followed by the numerative, if there is one ("five"), since the number of apples, in this case, is the least permanent attribute; next comes the interpersonal epithet which, arising from the speaker's opinion, is closer to the speaker–now matrix than the more objectively testable experiential epithet ("shiny"); then comes the more permanent classifier ("Jonathon", a type of apple), leading to the head itself. This ordering of increasing permanence from left to right <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> more likely to say [...] "her new black car" [...] than [...] "her black new car": the newness will recede sooner than the blackness.|$|E
