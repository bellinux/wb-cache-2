It is acted upon by the [...] "loud" [...] or damper pedal, which raises the outer projection, and by being hinged to the main rail about the same height as this projection, the entire rod is thrown outward against the lower ends of the damper levers, releasing all the dampers simultaneously. This being the only office of the right pedal, it is readily seen that this pedal does not increase the loudness, but simply sustains any number of tones struck successively, giving the effect of more volume.|$|E

40|$|The studied {{bump stop}} is a hollow folded {{polyurethane}} cylinder mounted around the <b>damper</b> <b>rod</b> in a MacPherson front wheel suspension, restricting the upward wheel displacement. It {{is a critical}} component for durability since the force transfer through the bump stop determines the vertical peak loads to the car body. In extreme load cases as driving over a curb, the bump stop is subjected to impact loading giving a highly non-linear behavior. The nominal compressive strain can reach 80 % under a load duration of milliseconds. The presented model is based on impact test data. By performing drop tests, high load levels and short contact times can be combined, giving a realistic loading in view of road load data from the test track. The main objective of the model is to predict the behavior at high strain rates and strain levels. The strongly progressive behavior, shown in a stress strain diagram, {{both in terms of}} the loading curve and the hysteresis, requires special attention. The main feature of the model is a linear viscoelastic Maxwell model combined with a function that takes care of the strongly progressive behavior. This function, obtained from a dynamic loading curve in the impact test, is multiplied with the Maxwell stress, giving the sought progressive behavior. The model is accurate, simple to obtain from the impact test, computationally efficient, and easy to implement in commercial multi-body-system codes as ADAMS and can thus successfully be used in the product development of new cars...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new power {{harvesting}} application is developed and simulated. Power harvesting is chosen within the European Clean Sky {{project as a}} solution to powering in-blade health monitoring systems as opposed to installing an elaborate electrical infrastructure to draw power from and transmit signals to the helicopter body. Local generation of power will allow for a ‘plug and play’ rotor blade and signals may be logged or transmitted wirelessly. The lag damper is chosen to be modified as it provides a well defined loading due to the re-gressive damping characteristic. A piezo electric stack is installed inside the <b>damper</b> <b>rod,</b> effec-tively coupled in series with the damper. Due to the well defined peak force generated in the damper the stack geometry requires a very limited margin of safety. Typically the stack geometry must be chosen to prevent excessive voltage build-up as opposed to mechanical overload. Development and simulation of the model is described starting with a simplified blade and piezo element model. Presuming specific flight conditions transient simulations are conducted using various power harvesting circuits and their performance is evaluated. The best performing circuit is further optimized to increase the specific power output. Optimization of the electrical and mechanical domains must be done simultaneously due to the high electro-mechanical cou-pling of the piezo stack. The non-linear electrical properties of the piezo material, most notably the capacitance which may have a large influence, are not yet considered in this study. The power harvesting lag damper provides sufficient power for extensive health monitoring systems within the blade while retaining the functionality and safety of the standard component. For the 8. 15 m blade radius and 130 knots flight speed under consideration simulations show 7. 5 watts of power is generated from a single damper...|$|E
40|$|Cabinet {{vibrations}} during spinning {{cycles of}} washing machines are often perceived negatively by customers, both in acoustic and visual terms. Therefore, {{in a market}} that {{is more and more}} oriented towards customer satisfaction and appliance efficiency, reducing cabinet vibrations and noise is a very attractive target. Previous experimental campaigns have highlighted that currently installed dry-friction dampers have highly non-linear characteristics and they are the main source of broadband forcing on the cabinet panels. To overcome these negative effects, two innovative designs for the suspension system have been studied and are here presented: The first solution is a secondary suspension system, designed to filter out the high frequency force components introduced by the dampers and therefore to mitigate panel vibrations; the second solution is more radical and it consists in removing the existing dampers and to substitute them with a tuned mass damper (TMD), directly fixed to the oscillating group. These solutions are a compromise between cost and efficiency, since a linear oil damper would impact excessively on the final cost of the appliance. The secondary suspension system has been designed to meet the very strict requirements of the manufacturer: low cost (which implies small mass) and applicable to the existing machine without any modification of any part other than the dampers themselves. The desired results have been achieved increasing the mass of the <b>damper</b> <b>rod</b> and introducing a fixedfixed (or hinged-hinged) beam spring. The prototype of the secondary suspension has been tested independently and assembled in the washing machine, and the vibratory and acoustic results will be reported. The introduction of a TMD and the contextual removal of the dry-friction dampers, on the contrary, requires the modification of the oscillating group in order to work efficiently. As a matter of fact, a principle for the design of oscillating groups is the space optimization, which usually leads to asymmetric distributions of mass of the oscillating group, that in their turn lead to asymmetrically coupled mode shapes. This dynamic characteristic does not suit the design of a simple and compact TMD, with a limited number of degrees of freedom. We show that careful mass distribution and a specifically designed 2 -dofs TMD can efficiently substitute the original dampers. An elemental prototype of the so defined TMD has been tested on a shaking table, and it seems an effective alternative to classical suspension systems. Copyright © 2013 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|Currently the {{lifespan}} of helicopter {{rotor blades}} is determined {{based on a}} conservative lifetime calculation. This leads to blades being discarded while they still possess a significant residual amount of flighthours. Blade health monitoring systems are desired to actively track the strains in the blade {{as a means to}} determine the residual life of the blade, significantly extending the technical life expectancy. A major drawback is the need for an electrical infrastructure to transmit all the signals to and from the rotor hub to the aircraft body. It would be advantageous if the required power could be generated locally. Within the European Clean Sky project vibrationbased power harvesting is chosen as a solution to powering in-blade health monitoring systems. In this paper simulations of a new power harvesting concept are validated experimentally. Local generation of power will allow for a ‘plug and play’ rotor blade and signals may be logged or transmitted wirelessly to the body of the aircraft. Examples are the blade strains, hinge forces, vibrations and so on. At the ERF 2011 [1] presented a simulation model to predict the electrical output of a lag damper augmented with a piezoelectric based energy harvester. Simulations indicated that for an 8. 15 m blade the output is to be around 5 W. The concept includes a piezo electric stack mounted in the <b>damper</b> <b>rod</b> and in series with the damping element. All forces generated by the damper are also passed through the stack and through the piezo electric effect electric charge is generated. Through the use of advanced circuits the power is conditioned and can be stored in a large capacitor or battery located in the rotor hub. The concept is validated in the lab. The setup consists of a large stroke shaker delivering a high force at low frequency. A piezoelectric stack with a large pre-stress is used so that it can also cope with the tensile forces generated by the damper. A viscous damper which has no dead zone upon reversal of the motion is used to mimic the lag damper. Although the damper does not possess a similar damping profile as an actual lag damper this does not pose a problem as the peak force {{is more important than the}} exact profile. Lastly a laser vibrometer, a force sensor, a thermocouple and a voltmeter are utilized to log relevant data through a SigLab system. A number of experiments are conducted to verify the simulation model. Following individual component experimentation, different electrical circuits are coupled to the stack and each result is then compared to a simulation of the respective electrical configuration. Two circuits are to be validated: Direct Current Impedance Matching is used as it is a passive circuit and the ‘standard’ for power harvesting and Synchronous Switch Harvesting on Inductor is used as it is shown to be the best performing circuit investigated in previous simulations [2]. The desired end result is an experimentally validated simulation model of the lag damper - harvester model which can be used to predict power output of similar power harvesting system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Based on Interaction {{energy of}} solid ball, the new {{particle}} damper is designed {{which can be}} used in a high temperature and high shock energy. To verify the design of the damper, a falling weight Impact test rig is designed, a sensor, data acquisition card and computer hardware constitutes a signal test system.

40|$|A {{new method}} to model {{vibrational}} power flow and predict the resulting energy density levels in uniform rods and beams is investigated. This method models {{the flow of}} vibrational power in a manner analogous to the flow of thermal power in a heat conduction problem. The classical displacement solutions for harmonically excited, hysteretically <b>damped</b> <b>rods</b> and beams are used to derive expressions for the vibrational power flow and energy density in the rod and beam. Under certain conditions, the power flow in these two structural elements will {{be shown to be}} proportional to the energy density gradient. Using the relationship between power flow and energy density, an energy balance on differential control volumes in the rod and beam leads to a Poisson's equation which models the energy density distribution in the rod and beam. Coupling the energy density and power flow solutions for rods and beams is also discussed. It is shown that the resonant behavior of finite structures complicates the coupling of solutions, especially when the excitations are single frequency inputs. Two coupling formulations are discussed, the first based on the receptance method, and the second on the travelling wave approach used in Statistical Energy Analysis. The receptance method is the more computationally intensive but is capable of analyzing single frequency excitation cases. The traveling wave approach gives a good approximation of the frequency average of energy density and power flow in coupled systems, and thus, is an efficient technique for use with broadband frequency excitation...|$|R

40|$|In {{almost all}} {{production}} of electricity the rotating machines serves as {{an important part of}} the energy transformation system. In hydropower units, a hydraulic turbine connected to a generator converts the potential energy stored in the water reservoir into electrical energy in the generator. An essential part of this energy conversion is the rotating system of which the turbine and the generator are crucial parts. During the last century the machines for {{production of electricity}} have been developed from a few megawatts per unit, up to several hundreds megawatts per unit. The development and increased size of the hydropower machines has also brought a need for new techniques. The most important developments are the increased efficiency of the turbines and generators, new types of bearings and the introduction of new materials. Vibration measurement is still the most reliable and commonly used method for avoiding failure during commissioning, for periodic maintenance, and for protection of the systems. Knowledge of the bearing forces at different operational modes is essential in order to estimate the degeneration of components and to avoid failures. In the appended Paper A, a method has been described for measurement of bearing load by use of strain gauges installed on the guide bearing bracket. This technique can determine the magnitude and direction of both static and dynamic loads acting on the bearing. This method also makes it possible to find the cause of the radial bearing force among the various eccentricities and disturbances in the system. This method was used in Paper C to investigate bearing stiffness and damping. A principal cause of many failures in large electrical machines is the occurrence of high radial forces due to misalignment between rotor and stator, rotor imbalance or disturbance from the turbine. In this thesis, two rotor models are suggested for calculation of forces and moments acting on the generator shaft due to misalignment between stator and rotor. These two methods are described in appended papers B and D. In Paper B, a linear model is proposed for an eccentric generator rotor subjected to a radial magnetic force. Both the radial force and the bending moment affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the rotor spider hub deviates from the centre of the rotor rim. The magnetic force acting on the rotor is assumed to be proportional to the rotor displacement. In Paper D, a non-linear model is proposed for analysis of an eccentric rotor subjected to radial magnetic forces. Both the radial and bending moments affecting the generator shaft are considered when the centre of the generator spider hub deviates from the centre of the generator rim. The magnetic forces acting on the rotor are assumed to be a non-linear function of the air-gap between the rotor and stator. The stability analysis shows that the rotor can become unstable for small initial eccentricities if the position of the rotor rim relative to the rotor hub is included in the analysis. The analysis also shows that natural frequencies can decrease and the rotor response can increase if the position of the rotor rim in relation to the rotor spider is considered. In Paper E, the effect of <b>damping</b> <b>rods</b> was included in the analysis of the magnetic pull force. The resulting force was found to be reduced significantly when the <b>damper</b> <b>rods</b> were taken into account. An interesting effect of the rotor <b>damper</b> <b>rods</b> was that they reduced the eccentricity forces and introduced a force component perpendicular to the direction of eccentricity. The results from the finite-element simulations were used to determine how the forces affect the stability of the generator rotor. Damped natural eigenfrequencies and the damping ratio for load and no-load conditions were investigated. When applying the forces computed in the time- dependent model, the damped natural eigenfrequencies were found to increase and the stability of the generator rotor was found to be reduced, compared with when the forces were computed in a stationary model. Damage due to contact between the runner and the discharge ring have been observed in several hydroelectric power units. The damage can cause high repair costs to the runner and the discharge ring as well as considerable production losses. In Paper F a rotor model of a 45 MW hydropower unit is used for the analysis of the rotor dynamical phenomena occurring due to contact between the runner and the discharge ring for different grades of lateral force on the turbine and bearing damping. The rotor model consists of a generator rotor and a turbine, which are connected to an elastic shaft supported by three isotropic bearings. The discrete representation of the rotor model consist of 32 degrees of freedom. To increase the speed of the analysis, the size of the model has been reduced with the IRS method to a system with 8 degrees of freedom. The results show that a small gap between the turbine and discharge ring can be dangerous, due to the risk of contact with high contact forces as a consequence. It has also been observed that backward whirl can occur and in some cases the turbine motion becomes quasi-periodic or chaotic. The endurance of hydropower rotor components is often associated with the dynamic loads acting on the rotating system and the number of start-stop cycles of the unit. Measurements, together with analysis of the rotor dynamics, are often the most powerful methods available to improve understanding of the cause of the dynamic load. The method for measurement of the bearing load presented in this thesis makes it possible to investigate the dynamic as well as the static loads acting on the bearing brackets. This can be done using the suggested method with high accuracy and without re-designing the bearings. During commissioning of a hydropower unit, measurement of shaft vibrations and forces is the most reliable methods for investigating the status of the rotating system. Generator rotor models suggested in this work will increase the precision of the calculated behaviour of the rotor. Calculation of the rotor behaviour is important before a generator is put in operation, after overhaul or when a new machine is to be installed. Godkänd; 2008; 20081111 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|With {{operating}} anvil hammers, {{there are}} rigid impacts of die tools, {{and as a}} result, almost instantaneous impact stops of the falling parts of hammer. Such operating conditions lead to the accelerated breakdowns of rods because of significant wave stresses arising in them. Common differential and integral methods to estimate wave stresses are widespread in engineering practice. However, to use them a researcher has to possess certain skills and special software. We consider the method for estimating the wave stresses in the rods of anvil hammers based on Laplace transforms (LT) of wave equation. The article shows a procedure {{to set up and}} solve differential wave equations by operator method. These equations describe the wave propagation process of strains and stresses in the rods of anvil hammers with rigid impact and taking into account a <b>damping</b> <b>rod</b> connection with the head of hammer. The method takes into consideration an influence of both piston and rod weights and of mechanical and geometrical characteristics of rod on the stress value in the placement of rod in hammer head. Results analysis shows that a sufficiently efficient method for practical improving the durability of rods is the method of damping impact load on the rod through setting the damping devices in the form either of elastic "pad" of one or another design or of hydraulic shock absorbers in the placement of its connection with the hammer head. In this case there is a change of the wave front, it becomes flatter. It is shown that the stresses in the rod are proportional to the amount of wave stresses because of the own impact of rod and piston, which make a total weight of the system. Effect of piston weight on the stresses value at the rod during impact is directly proportional to the ratio of its weight to the rod weight. The geometric parameters of rod and the speed of the falling parts before the impact also influence on the value of stresses in the rod. The represented method of the stresses analysis can be successfully applied to the selection of optimal weights and the geometric parameters of the piston and rod during rigid impact of falling parts without damping and taking into account the energy dissipation until the stiff stop of falling parts of the anvil hammer. </p...|$|R

It is shown that strong targeted energy transfer from the rod to the attachment occurs when there is strong stiffness asymmetry in the attachment. For weak viscous dissipation, a clear understanding of dynamical transitions in the integrated rod-non-linear attachment system can be gained by wavelet transforming the time series and superimposing the resulting wavelet spectra in the frequency-energy plot (FEP) of the periodic orbits of the underlying Hamiltonian system. Two distinct NES configurations are analyzed in detail, and their damped responses are analyzed by the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). We show that the HHT is capable of analyzing even complex non-linear damped transitions, by providing the dominant frequency components (or equivalently, time scales) at which the non-linear phenomena take place, and clarifying the series of non-linear resonance captures between the rod and attachment dynamics that are responsible for the broadband energy exchanges in this system.

This representation enables one to clearly distinguish between the different types of periodic motions, forming back bone curves and subharmonic tongues. Then the damped dynamics of the system is computed; the rod and attachment responses are initially analyzed by the numerical Morlet wavelet transform (WT), and then by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) or Hilbert–Huang transform (HTT), whereby, the time series are decomposed in terms of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) at different characteristic time scales (or, equivalently, frequency scales). Comparisons of the evolutions of the instantaneous frequencies of the IMFs to the WT spectra of the time series enables one to identify the dominant IMFs of the signals, as well as, the time scales at which the dominant dynamics evolve at different time windows of the responses; hence, it is possible to reconstruct complex transient responses as superposition of the dominant IMFs involving different time scales of the dynamical response. Moreover, by superimposing the WT spectra and the instantaneous frequencies of the IMFs to the FEPs of the underlying hamiltonian system, one is able to clearly identify the multi-scaled transitions that occur in the transient damped dynamics, and to interpret them as ‘jumps’ between different branches of periodic orbits of the underlying hamiltonian system. As a result, this work develops a physics-based, multi-scaled framework and provides the necessary computational tools for multi-scaled analysis of complex multi-frequency transitions of essentially nonlinear dynamical systems...|$|R
40|$|Planetary {{drilling}} {{is a vital}} task in {{the challenge}} for space exploration. Drilling and planetary soil/rock sample acquisition provides information about history of past events, minerals and chemical composition of the soil/rock of the planetary body, available resources for future manned missions and the mechanical behavior of the planetary soil/rock. Several types of drilling devices have been proposed for lunar, Mars, and planetary subsurface exploration. However, these devices have limitations (e. g. heavy equipment and need for large axial force) {{that need to be}} addressed in order to be feasible for extraterrestrial bodies’ exploration. A special type of ultrasonic percussive drill have been proposed by Honeybee Spacecraft Mechanisms Corporation and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to address the limitations of current drilling devices. In this study, the mechanical system of the ultrasonic percussive drill and its interaction with the supporting medium is studied. The percussive mechanism consists of an ultrasonic horn, a free mass, and the drill rod. Special attention is given to the impact between the free mass and the drill rod, including the effects of structural damping, the supporting medium of the rod, plastic deformation in the contact area, and repeated impacts of the free mass on the drill rod. A general methodology to analyze the impact of the free mass on the drill rod, analogous to the longitudinal impact of a mass on a rod, is developed. The methodology involves uncoupling the nonlinear problem by determining the response of each body independently under the contact force to find the local indentation, then using Hertz force-indentation relation to find the contact force. This method is applied using mode superposition method and finite element technique for various support conditions of the rod (e. g. rigid, elastic, free, viscoelastic). Additionally, a model to account for drill rod penetration into the supporting medium due to impact of the free mass is also presented. It was found that for an undamped rod, the support condition of the rod does not affect the contact force if the contact ends before the arrival of the reflected wave to the point of contact. It was also observed that the contact force due to impact, for a given support condition, increases with increasing <b>damping</b> of the <b>rod.</b> Moreover, a modified Hertz equation is introduced to include plastic deformation on the rod due to impact of the free mass. The study was performed for identical repetitive impacts and it was found that the largest plastic deformation occurs in the first impact, with additional plastic deformation decreasing with the increasing number of impacts. The dynamic response of the overall percussive drill was investigated with a finite element model, including the interaction of the free mass with the ultrasonic horn and the drill rod. A numerical example indicated that the dynamic response of the ultrasonic drill is directly affected by the supporting medium. It was found that system with fixed support experienced a higher frequency of oscillation of the free mass and higher impact force compared to the system with the elastic support and the model accounting for penetration into the supporting medium...|$|R
