5|$|For otariids {{and some}} phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups {{for a few}} days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These {{foraging}} trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. While their mothers are away, the pups will fast. Lactation in otariids may last 6–11 months; in the <b>Galápagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> it can last as long as 3 years. Pups of these species are weaned at lower weights than their phocid counterparts. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. The female rests at the surface with its head held up, and the young suckle upside down. Young pinnipeds typically learn to swim on their own and some species can even swim at birth. Other species may wait days or weeks before entering the water. Elephant seals do not swim until weeks after they are weaned.|$|E

50|$|Pinta Island is {{also home}} to swallow-tailed gulls, marine iguanas, <b>Galapagos</b> hawks, <b>Galapagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> {{and a number of other}} birds and mammals. The most {{northern}} major island in the Galápagos, at one time Isla Pinta had a thriving tortoise population. The island's vegetation was devastated over several decades by introduced feral goats, thus diminishing food supplies for the native tortoises. A prolonged effort to exterminate goats introduced to Pinta was completed in 1990, and the vegetation of the island is starting to return to its former state.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Galápagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> has {{virtually}} no constant predators. Occasionally, sharks and orcas {{have been seen}} feeding on the seals, but this is very rare.

50|$|The <b>Galápagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> is {{endemic to}} the Galápagos Islands, {{with a single}} colony in {{northern}} Peru, according to the Organisation for Research and Conservation of Aquatic Animals; they live on the rocky shores of the islands, {{which tend to be}} on the west sides, leaving only to feed.|$|E
50|$|Male otariids {{range in}} size from the 70-kg (150-lb) <b>Galápagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> {{smallest}} of all pinnipeds, to the over 1,000-kg (2,200-lb) Steller sea lion.

50|$|<b>Galápagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> {{have had}} a declining {{population}} since the 19th century. Thousands of these seals were killed for their fur in the 1800s by poachers. Starting in 1959, Ecuador established strict laws to protect these animals. The government of Ecuador declared the Galápagos Islands a national park, and since then no major poaching has occurred.Despite the laws, another tragic blow to their population occurred during the 1982-1983 El Niño weather event. Almost all of the seal pups died, and about 30% {{of the adult population}} was wiped out.|$|R
5000|$|Fernandina (Narborough) Island - The {{name was}} given in honor of King Ferdinand II of Aragon, who {{sponsored}} the voyage of Columbus. Fernandina has an area of 642 km2 (248 sq mi) and a maximum altitude of 1,494 m (4,902 ft). This is the youngest and westernmost island. On 13 May 2005, a new, very eruptive process began on this island, when an ash and water vapor cloud rose to a height of 7 km and lava flows descended {{the slopes of the}} volcano {{on the way to the}} sea. Punta Espinosa is a narrow stretch of land where hundreds of marine iguanas gather, largely on black lava rocks. The famous flightless cormorants inhabit this island, as do Galápagos penguins, pelicans, Galápagos sea lions and <b>Galápagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> Different types of lava flows can be compared, and the mangrove forests can be observed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Galápagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> {{have the}} lowest {{reproductive}} rate reported in seals, and it takes an unusually long time to raise seal pups to independence. Females bear only one pup at a time, and she remains with her newborn for a week before leaving to feed. She then periodically returns to the pup and stays to suckle {{it for a few}} days before leaving on another hunting trip. Females recognize their own pups by smell and sound, and pups also learn to identify their mothers by the females’ “Pup Attraction Calls”. Mother-pup recognition is crucial because females exclusively nurse their own pups, often violently rejecting strange pups that approach. Orphaned seal pups usually try to sneak up on sleeping or calling females to suckle, but stealing milk is not enough to sustain the pups, and they usually die within a month.|$|R
50|$|During {{periods when}} {{there is very little}} prey, interbrood {{conflict}} increases. <b>Galapagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> population is drastically affected by El Niño, a period accompanied by high water temperatures and a deepening thermocline. Food becomes scarce during El Niño, and thus older seals exhibit an intense aversion to weaning, causing the mother seal to neglect the younger sibling.|$|E
50|$|The Juan Fernández {{fur seal}} {{is the second}} {{smallest}} of the fur seals, {{second only to the}} <b>Galápagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal.</b> They are found only on the Pacific Coast of South America, more specifically on the Juan Fernández Islands and the Desventuradas Islands. There is still much that is unknown about this species. Scientists still do not know the average life span of this species, or the diet and behavior of males apart from the breeding season.|$|E
50|$|Fur seals {{share with}} other otariids {{the ability to}} turn their rear limbs forward and move on all fours. Fur seals are {{generally}} smaller than sea lions. At under 1 m, the <b>Galápagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> is the smallest of all pinnipeds. However, their flippers tend to be proportionately longer, their pelage tends to be darker, and their vibrissae are more prominent. Males are often {{more than five times}} heavier than the females, making them among the most sexually dimorphic of all mammal groups.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fur</b> <b>seal</b> pups rely {{on their}} mother’s milk for the first {{eighteen}} months, and weaning may be delayed {{for up to two}} or three years if conditions are poor. The result is that every year up to 23% of pups are born when an older sibling is still suckling. Survival of the younger sibling greatly depends on the availability of resources. In years when there is abundant food, the mortality rate of second pups is as low as 5%, which is equivalent to the mortality rate of pups without siblings. In years when food is scarce, 80% of pups with suckling older siblings die within a month. The younger sibling thus serves as an insurance in case the first sibling dies, and also provides extra reproductive value in case conditions prove better than expected. Such a bet-hedging strategy is particularly useful in <b>Galapagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals,</b> since {{there is a great deal}} of maternal investment in raising a seal pup to independence in an environment that has great fluctuations in food.|$|R
40|$|In {{our study}} of the {{development}} of diving in <b>Galápagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals,</b> we analysed changes in diving activity and body mass trends over the lunar cycle. Based on previously observed lunar cycles in colony attendance patterns, we hypothesized a greater impact of prey migrations of deep scattering layer organisms on younger <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> Using electronic dive recorders, we determined that seals dived less and deeper on moonlit nights than at new moon, and incurred body mass losses. These changes in foraging over the lunar cycle correlate with the suppression of the vertical migration of prey by lunar light. All effects were more pronounced in juveniles than adult females, with greater relative mass loss during full moon, which must (i) negatively affect long-term juvenile growth rates, (ii) lengthen periods of maternal dependence, and (iii) contribute to the lowest reproductive rate reported for seals. This underlines the importance of studying ontogeny in order to understand life histories, and for determining the susceptibility of animal populations to fluctuations in food availability...|$|R
5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, flatfish, flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking <b>Galapagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys. The sharks were not slowed by rotenone (a fish toxin) or shark repellent, and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Galápagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> feeds {{primarily}} on fish and cephalopods. They feed relatively close to shore {{and near the}} surface, but have been seen at depths of 169 m. They primarily feed at night because their prey {{is much easier to}} catch then. [...] During normal years, food is relatively plentiful. However, during an El Niño year, there can be fierce competition for food, and many young pups die during these years. The adult seals feed themselves before their young and during particularly rough El Niño years, most of the young seal populations will die.|$|E

40|$|Summary In vertebrates, {{patterns}} of resource utilization change throughout development according to age- and or size-specific abilities and requirements. Thus, interspecific competition affects different age classes differently. Adults of sympatric species often show distinct foraging niche segregation, but juvenile resource use might overlap with adult competitors of similar body size. Resultant {{negative effects on}} juveniles can have important consequences for population dynamics, yet such interactions have received little attention in studies of mammalian communities. Using GPS tracking devices, time-depth recorders and stable isotope data, we compared diving depth, activity time, trophic position and foraging habitat characteristics to investigate foraging niche overlap between similar-sized sympatric juvenile Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) and adult <b>Galapagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and compared each group with much larger-bodied adult Galapagos sea lions. We found little indication for direct competition but a complex pattern of foraging niche segregation: juvenile sea lions and adult <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> dived to shallow depths at night, but foraged in different habitats with limited spatial overlap. Conversely, juvenile and adult sea lions employed different foraging patterns, but their foraging areas overlapped almost completely. Consistency of foraging habitat characteristics between juvenile and adult sea lions suggests that avoidance of competition may be important in shaping foraging habitat utilization. Resultant specialization on a limited habitat could contribute to low sea lion numbers that contrast with high <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> abundance. Our data suggest that exploitation by multiple predators within spatially restricted foraging ranges of juveniles might negatively impact juvenile foraging success and ultimately influence population dynamics...|$|R

50|$|The {{lifetime}} parental {{investment is}} the fixed amount of parental resources {{available for all}} of a parent's young, and an offspring will want {{as much of it}} as possible. Siblings in a brood will often compete for parental resources by trying to gain more than their fair share of what their parents have to offer. There are numerous examples in nature where sibling rivalry is escalated to such an extreme that one sibling will try to kill off his other broodmates in order to maximize his own parental investment (See Siblicide). In the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> the second pup of a female is usually born when the first pup is still suckling. This competition for the mother’s milk is especially fierce during periods of food shortage such as an El Niño year, and this usually results in the older pup directly attacking and killing the younger one.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} protect the unique fauna of the Galapagos Islands, it is {{critical}} that we understand how and when parasites spread throughout the archipelago. There are several key components of host-parasite dynamics that influence parasite spread, including the basic reproductive rate of the parasite, host density, transmission mode, and host movement, among other factors. Host movement could be especially important in determining parasite spread in island systems like the Galapagos, because parasites are not always able to move larger distances unaided. Because some hosts (and vectors) show population genetic structure within the Galapagos Islands, we can make inferences about potential parasite spread from knowledge of host population connectivity. In this chapter, we review patterns of population connectivity in Galapagos vertebrates (hosts), arthropod vectors, and parasites, focusing on population genetic studies. Hosts with little to no population genetic structure and high rates of inferred movement (e. g., <b>Galapagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> Galapagos penguin, great frigatebird, Galapagos dove, small ground finch, small tree finch, large tree finch) are the most likely to spread parasites. More research is needed on parasite spread, particularly studies that simultaneously estimate population connectivity of both host (or multiple hosts, including vectors) and parasite.

40|$|Abstract Background Oceans {{are high}} gene flow environments that are {{traditionally}} believed to hamper the build-up of genetic divergence. Despite this, divergence appears to occur occasionally at surprisingly small scales. The Galápagos archipelago provides an ideal {{opportunity to examine}} the evolutionary processes of local divergence in an isolated marine environment. Galápagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) are top predators in this unique setting and have an essentially unlimited dispersal capacity across the entire species range. In theory, this should oppose any genetic differentiation. Results We find significant ecological, morphological and genetic divergence between the western colonies and colonies from the central region of the archipelago that are exposed to different ecological conditions. Stable isotope analyses indicate that western animals use different food sources than those from the central area. This is likely due to niche partitioning with the second Galápagos eared seal species, the <b>Galápagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) that exclusively dwells in the west. Stable isotope patterns correlate with significant differences in foraging-related skull morphology. Analyses of mitochondrial sequences as well as microsatellites reveal signs of initial genetic differentiation. Conclusion Our results suggest a key role of intra- as well as inter-specific niche segregation {{in the evolution of}} genetic structure among populations of a highly mobile species under conditions of free movement. Given the monophyletic arrival of the sea lions on the archipelago, our study challenges the view that geographical barriers are strictly needed for the build-up of genetic divergence. The study further raises the interesting prospect that in social, colonially breeding mammals additional forces, such as social structure or feeding traditions, might bear on the genetic partitioning of populations. </p...|$|E
40|$|The feeding {{behavior}} of marine predators {{varies with the}} level of competition to which they are exposed. Populations living in the same or overlapping geographic regions (sympatric) are generally subject to inter-specific competition, which can lead to the development of differing trophic strategies that maximize both nutritional and reproductive efficiency. The otariids of the islands in the western Galapagos Archipelago represent appropriate subjects for studying the response mechanisms of sympatric species exposed to strong competition, both trophic and spatial. The present study has focused on evaluating the possible differences in the trophic niches of the Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki) and the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) over time, based upon the analysis of stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen (? 13 C and ? 15 N), and observation of both species at sea. A comparative analysis of the isotopic signal of skin samples from pups of both species was performed for rookeries on Fernandina Island between 2003 and 2009. Analyses of the isotopic signal present in prey covering the entire trophic range of these predators were also performed, in order to relate this information to otariid sighting records collected during offshore cruises in 1993 – 1994 and 2000. The ? 13 C and ? 15 N values defined differences in the feeding zones and in the trophic level of each species; which were related with the interannual variability of the ecosystem, i. e. El Niño and La Niña events. Whereas Z. wollebaeki showed a coastal (inshore) foraging strategy, relying on the consumption of small epipelagic fishes, A. galapagoensis {{turned out to be a}} more oceanic (offshore) predator, with a preference for small squid. These results are in good agreement with the distribution of these animals at sea, as indicated by the sighting data. The findings of this study provide new insights to our understanding of how sympatric species exposed to strong inter-specific competition can develop foraging strategies leading to a decreasing level of food competition and facilitate their survival in a stochastic environment that is highly demanding in terms of the availability of resources[URL]...|$|E

40|$|Modelling <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> populations {{requires}} the accurate assessment of demographic parameters such as age-specific mortality.
