Murray defeated Federer in straight sets to win the gold medal, denying Federer a Career Golden Slam. In 2013 Murray beat Federer {{for the first time in}} a Major in the semifinals of the Australian Open, prevailing in five sets after Federer <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> twice from a set down.

25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to me and had brought me a gift.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there were many}} {{uncertainties}} about moving to such a place as America. Stories <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from there about failed colonies. There were fears that the native people would be violent, {{that there would be}} no source of food or water, that exposure to unknown diseases was possible, and that travel by sea was always hazardous. Balancing all this was a local political situation that was in danger of becoming unstable. The truce was faltering in what came to be known as the Eighty Years' War, and there was fear over what the attitudes of Spain might be toward them.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, the Rays trailed the Cleveland Indians 7–0 {{after the}} top of the 4th inning, but would rally to score eight {{unanswered}} runs over the remainder of the game to win, capped off by a walk-off home run by B.

Previously, the Rays had never won a game in which they had trailed by at least seven runs. They <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from a six run deficit on five occasions.|$|E

25|$|In 1979 {{the crash}} of American Airlines Flight 191 led to a global {{grounding}} of all DC-10s, stranding hundreds of passengers {{on both sides of}} Air New Zealand's Los Angeles–Auckland route. The airline chartered a Pan Am Boeing 747 to transport stranded passengers and to keep a shuttle service open. The airline's two remaining DC-8s maintained a trans-tasman shuttle service along with its single international standard equipped 737-200, ZK-NAR. The decision not to take up NAC's purchase rights of the trans-tasman capable Boeing 727-200 <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to haunt the airline. With no DC-8 replacement in sight Air New Zealand began looking for a mid-sized wide bodied jet and ordered the Boeing 767-200ER in 1983.|$|E
25|$|Police {{announced}} in January that the DNA {{from the scene}} <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> as belonging to a male. From the crime scene and other evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had developed {{a profile of the}} man. They said it was likely that he had lived near Hedgepeth in the past, had expressed an interest in her and his behavior may have changed since the crime, including showing an unusual interest in the case. Notwithstanding this release of information, the town successfully petitioned the court to keep the warrants under seal, saying that phase of the investigation was still not complete; in May 2013 the court extended the seal another 60 days.|$|E
25|$|Cho {{made another}} miraculous comeback, {{this time in}} 1992 against his biggest rival Kobayashi Koichi in the Honinbo. Kobayashi had {{challenged}} for the Honinbo in 1990 and 1991, but Cho was too stubborn to give it up. Cho <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> in both finals, being down 3 games to 1, but pulled back 3 wins to defend the Honinbo. In 1991, he was down 2 to 0 in 1990, then won 4 {{games in a row}} to defend once more. In 1992, it was even more unbelievable. Cho was losing 3 games to 0, but was so relentless, that he came back and won 4 straight games once more to take the Honinbo away from Kobayashi's grip. This certainly showed that Cho could come back from any deficit and win again.|$|E

25|$|Martínez {{planned a}} {{breakout}} {{on the night}} of 16 August. Rovira, who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from Cadiz, menaced the north side of MacDonald's siege works with 2,000 guerillas. However, a French force chased his men out of the area. As soon as night fell, Martínez launched a massed column of his fittest troops at the southwestern siege lines. The Spanish column overran the pickets and the outpost line, but the soldiers were brought to a stand by a dense abatis. While they were caught in this awkward position, two French batteries opened fire on the column. After suffering 400 casualties, the survivors fled back into the fortress. The following day d'Hilliers sent an officer under a flag of truce into the fort and Martínez agreed to surrender after issuing his last rations. On 19 August 1811, the Spanish garrison marched out and laid down its weapons.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War she {{represented}} the Allies {{in a number}} of charity concerts including one organized by the Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, and she received an award from the Grand Duchess Tatiana at the Winter Palace. In the summer of 1916 she toured with a five-member concert party in the Caucuses, and also performed in Petrograd and travelled south to Odessa where she sang in a concert honouring the Premier of Serbia at the Odessa Opera. By March 1917 when the Russian revolution broke out, Crawford <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> west to Helsinki, Finland and she did not return to Petrograd until after the Bolsheviks took power in the fall of 1917. During 1917 she joined a cross-country tour which took her as far east as Vladivostok before returning to Finland. During her time in Russia she sang with such major Russian opera stars as bass Feodor Chaliapin, tenor Leonid Sobinov, and tenor Dmitri Smirnov.|$|E
25|$|In November, as Herman Cain's {{campaign}} was stumbling, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich {{rose in the}} polls and asserted himself as the fourth major opponent to Romney. Gingrich <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from serious staff problems in his campaign just weeks after he had entered the race in May that had seemingly derailed his campaign for the nomination. But in the weeks before the Iowa caucus, Gingrich's new-found lead began to quickly evaporate as super PACs sympathetic to Mitt Romney and others spent over $4.4 million in negative advertising targeting the former Speaker. With Gingrich's support faltering, Ron Paul surged to the lead in Iowa. Rick Santorum, who despite spending months traveling to all 99 counties in Iowa and holding some 381 town hall meetings, was polling in the single digits in Iowa as late as December 18. However, in the final weeks of 2011, Santorum positioned himself as the prime opposition to Romney with his staunch socially conservative views.|$|E
