40|$|The {{feasibility}} of performance enhancing the sandwich panel heat pipe was investigated for moderate temperature range heat rejection radiators on future-high-power spacecraft. The hardware development program consisted of performance prediction modeling, fabrication, ground test, and data correlation. Using available sandwich panel materials, {{a series of}} subscale test panels were augumented with high-capacity sideflow and temperature control variable conductance features, and test evaluated for correlation with performance prediction codes. Using the correlated prediction model, a 50 -kW <b>full</b> size <b>radiator</b> was defined using methanol working fluid and closely spaced sideflows. A new concept called the hybrid radiator individually optimizes heat pipe components. A 2. 44 -m long hybrid test vehicle demonstrated proof-of-principle performance...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade the drag {{coefficient}} of most passenger cars has dropped significantly to values around 0. 3 and for certain models even below. A consequence {{of this is that}} the so called “cooling drag” constitutes a larger portion of the total drag coefficient, and one key problem in the minimization of the “cooling drag” is to optimize the cooling package. However, the situation is even more complex, since in this drag minimization model experiments are commonly used and the flow field in the model scale cooling package will be different as compared to the full scale. This effect {{must be taken into account}} in the total optimization process. Hence, the aim of the current work was to develop a realistic radiator geometry to be used in model scale wind tunnel experiments. In this work, the CFD code Fluent was used for studies of the scaling phenomenas by the use of a simplified radiator core geometry. Initial data available for the <b>full</b> size <b>radiator</b> geometry was an empiric expression for the pressure drop over the cooling package and in the computations the <b>full</b> scale <b>radiator</b> was modelled as a porous media in with its resistance described by an empirical equation. The results from the Fluent computations were used to design a model scale radiator, and to replicate the full scale cooling package a model radiator was manufactured out of honeycomb, for flow guidance, and fine wire meshes to obtain the relevant pressure drop. The set up was tested in a rig where the designed model was calibrated using different configurations of wire meshes. It was found in the test measurements that the outcome was a fully functional model scale radiator...|$|R

40|$|Testing {{cooling air}} flow on scaled vehicle models has become {{increasingly}} popular amongst car manufactures. To be able to predict the drag and lift changes at low cost early in the development the model has to be equipped with detailed engine compartments, including the <b>radiator.</b> Scaling a <b>full</b> size cooling package is not possible due to the geometry and the changes of the flow. Thus is it common to simplify the cooling package and fine tune it to match {{the properties of the}} <b>full</b> size <b>radiator.</b> The aim of this diploma work was to develop {{and with the help of}} numerics verify a simplified radiator package for a scaled wind tunnel car model. The main property of interest was the pressure drop. It was also important to design a radiator model that has a flow which was similar to the original cooling package. To determine the pressure drop of the <b>full</b> size <b>radiator</b> the commercial CFD code Fluent was used. The results from the simulations were used as reference when the radiator simulator was designed due to the limited amount of data available concerning the original cooling package. The core of the radiator model consists of honeycomb with flow guiding properties and mesh that creates the pressure drop. A number of different meshes were used to calibrate the radiator model in a test rig. Then was the total pressure measured in front of and behind the model to determine the pressure drop. These values were then compared to the scaled pressure drop curve from the calculations performed on the full scale cooling package in Fluent. The outcome from these simulations and tests was a model scale radiator with the properties of the full scale cooling package. There is still work to be done to refine the results even more. Test with other mesh configurations, different turbulence intensity and a redesigned test rig would be recommended...|$|R

The base model was the Standard, and this sported no chromework, painted rear light surrounds, steel slatted grille and limited interior trim. The deluxe had a chrome side strip, chrome rear lights, glovebox lid, sun visor and <b>full</b> width chrome <b>radiator</b> grille. The {{top of the range}} was the Super, which had twin chrome side strips, contrasting coloured roof and side flash, plusher interior trim, together with the 1198 cc engine and a gearbox with synchromesh on first gear.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} control system and {{component}} temperatures, many spacecraft thermal control systems use a radiator {{coupled with a}} pumped fluid loop to reject waste heat from the vehicle. Since heat loads and radiation environments can vary considerably according to mission phase, the thermal control system {{must be able to}} vary the heat rejection. The ability to "turn down" the heat rejected from the thermal control system is critically important when designing the system. Electrochromic technology as a radiator coating is being investigated to vary the amount of heat rejected by a radiator. Coupon level tests were performed to test the feasibility of this technology. Furthermore, thermal math models were developed to better understand the turndown ratios required by <b>full</b> scale <b>radiator</b> architectures to handle the various operation scenarios encountered during a mission profile for the Altair Lunar Lander. This paper summarizes results from coupon level tests as well as the thermal math models developed to investigate how electrochromics can be used to increase turn down ratios for a radiator. Data from the various design concepts of radiators and their architectures are outlined. Recommendations are made on which electrochromic radiator concept should be carried further for future thermal vacuum testing...|$|R
5000|$|In 1957 the TR3 was {{updated with}} various changes {{including}} a <b>full</b> width <b>radiator</b> grille and this facelifted model was {{commonly referred to}} as the Triumph [...] "TR3A". However the cars were not badged as such and the [...] "TR3A" [...] name was not used officially, as is evident from contemporary sales brochures.The [...] "TR3A" [...] was built between 1957 and 1962.The [...] "TR3A" [...] was a minor update from the TR3. The updates included the new wide front grill, exterior door handles, lockable boot handle and came with a full tool kit as standard (this was an option on the TR3). The total production run of the [...] "TR3A" [...] was 58,236. This makes it the third best-selling TR after the TR6 and TR7. The TR3A was so successful that the original panel moulds eventually wore out and had to be replaced. In 1959 a slightly modified version came out that had raised stampings under the bonnet and boot hinges and under the door handles, as well as a redesigned rear floor section. In addition, the windscreen was attached with bolts rather than the Dzus connectors used on the early [...] "A" [...] models. It is estimated that only 9,500 of the original 58,000 built survive today.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{management}} {{is essential for}} obtaining the lowest possible product manufacturing cost. Many systems have been created {{over the years to}} manage the energy used in manufacturing. However, for a variety of reasons, most of them never reached their <b>full</b> potential. Harrison <b>Radiator</b> first installed an energy management system in 1973. Energy consumption was reduced 42 % from 1973 through 1984. However, the gains {{the last couple of years}} have been small. In 1984, important changes were made to the system and energy reporting was added, resulting in 1985 energy consumption reduction of about 16 %. This paper will briefly describe Harrison's successful energy management, reporting and accounting system. Examples of reports, available data, information flow and benefits will be covered, with special mention of all factors that lead to our system's success...|$|R
5000|$|The Morris Major Elite, {{designated}} YDO1, {{was introduced}} in March 1962. It replaced the Series II models, supplanting the Austin Lancer range completely due {{to a change in}} BMC Australia's dealer network: there were now [...] "BMC Dealers" [...] only rather than separate outlets for each BMC marque. It was seen as unnecessary to have two versions of the same vehicle, though a [...] "Series III Lancer" [...] had been considered right up to the Elite's introduction. The Elite was powered by the enlarged 1622 cc engine [...] with greater performance, and this version employed a Zenith VN carburettor and Goss mechanical fuel pump. Telescopic rear shock absorbers, seat belt mounting points and uprated front suspension rubbers featured among other technical revisions. A visually striking facelift was achieved with only minimal changes to sheet metal; this constituted chrome window surrounds, a new <b>full</b> width <b>radiator</b> grille closely resembling that of the Mk VI Morris Oxford, and a [...] "rocket" [...] colour flash on the tailfins. Some changes to basic equipment level included a fresh air heater/demister, duo-tone paint in various new plain and pastel colours, brighter interiors and a windscreen washer. The price was also lowered from the previous Series II list price, this made the already highly competitive Major outstanding value-for-money. Sales were fairly good and warranty claims were the least for any BMC (Aust.) model then to date. Production of the Elite ceased in 1964 when the model was replaced by the Morris 1100.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally {{radiator}} {{designs are}} based off a passive or flow through design depending on vehicle requirements. For cyclical heat loads, a novel idea of combining a <b>full</b> flow through <b>radiator</b> to a phase change material {{is currently being}} investigated. The flow through radiator can be designed for an average heat load while the phase change material {{can be used as}} a source of supplemental heat rejections when vehicle heat loads go above the average load. Furthermore, by using water as the phase change material, harmful radiation protection can be provided to the crew. This paper discusses numerous trades conducted to understand the most optimal fusible heat sink design for a particular heat load. Trades include configuration concepts, amount of phase change needed for supplemental heat rejection, and the form of interstitial material needed for optimal performance. These trades were used to culminate to a fusible heat sink design. The paper will discuss design parameters taken into account to develop an engineering development unit...|$|R
40|$|Cooling systems {{based on}} a {{continuous}} flow of fresh air are typically used in electronic devices. For applications in adverse environment such us underwater applications of industrial applications using air with {{a great amount of}} dust, hermetic devices are needed. The major problem when designing hermetic devices is to provide a proper cooling system. The cooling system of a hermetic device must meet two fundamental requirements: • Continuous airflow through all electronic components inside the case. • Enough heat transfer between the inside air and the outside environment. Non-hermetic systems are usually designed with the air inlet in the front, and the fans with the air outlet in the back. Using this configuration it is easy to warranty a correct airflow through the electronic components of the system (see Figure 1). This paper describes different alternatives for cooling hermetic devices. The study was done for a personal computer, evaluating the amount of heat produced during sleep condition and busy condition. Different cooling alternatives are presented: natural convection using standard radiators (for a noiseless system), and forced convection using radiators and fans. Both configurations are compared with the equivalent ones using thermoelectricity to increase the heat transfer between the inside of the hermetic box and the outside environment. It is demonstrated that without thermoelectricity, {{it is almost impossible to}} evacuate enough heat because the box of the PC has to be <b>full</b> of <b>radiators.</b> While applying the Peltier effect the heat transfer is highly increased. Figure 1 : Conventional equipment ventilation Hermetic devices use airflow to cool circuits, like conventional system, but also a set of internal ducts and heat exchangers. The ducts are used to guide the airflow properly and the heat exchangers are needed to transfer heat to the outside. Schematically, both systems can be represented as in Figure 2...|$|R
