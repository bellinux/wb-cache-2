40|$|ABSTRACT. Narrow <b>groove</b> <b>welding</b> is an {{important}} technique for increasing pro-ductivity {{in the manufacture of}} thick-walled components. The nature of the process demands an automated approach and precise control to ensure consistently high weld quality. The most important ob-jective of narrow <b>groove</b> <b>welding</b> is to maintain uniform and sufficient penetra-tion at both groove faces. Several different approaches, such as wire bending tech-nique and wire rotating method, have been adopted in an attempt to minimize the incomplete fusion in the narrow groove GMAW process. In this study, a welding system using electromagnetic arc oscillation was developed for narrow <b>groove</b> <b>welding.</b> The electromagnet for applying a magnetic field to the welding arc was designed from the electromag-netic analysis results. This paper shows the arc and bead characteristics in narrow groove GMAW using electromagnetic arc oscillation. Based on the results, the ap-propriate welding and oscillation condi-tions were selected to satisfy high weld quality. Consequently, magnetic arc oscil-lation resulted in uniform and sufficient penetration to both groove faces. Arc sig-nal characteristics for automatic joint tracking were also investigated. The peri-odic change of welding current in electro-magnetic arc oscillation was examined by experiments and numerical analysis. To establish the mathematical model of the arc sensor, some assumptions were needed to calculate the arc length. Ana-lytical results using these assumptions showed good agreement with experimen-tal ones. The periodic signal was adopted to develop an automatic joint tracking sys-tem in narrow groove GMAW...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{laboratory tests}} of arc-welded T-joints between equal width rectangular hollow sections (called “matched box connections” in ANSI/AWS D 1. 1 - 2000 Structural Welding Code). The brace and chord members were cold-formed with a nominal yield stress of 350 MPa. The welds were laid using MMAW and GMAW processes without profiling the brace ends. The brace of each specimen was loaded in tension to failure with the chord supported continuously {{so as not}} to induce significant bending effects. The test results showed that the joint strength can be improved by using backing strips for the butt (or <b>groove)</b> <b>welds,</b> while backing rods (or filler rods) should not be used as they led to larger variation in joint strengths, and often, inferior strengths. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths obtained using the IIW Recommendations and Eurocode 3, Part 1. 8. It is shown that for cold-formed tubes with a nominal yield stress of 350 MPa (or above), a design check on the strength of the butt (or <b>groove)</b> <b>weld</b> is required in addition to the checks on the strengths of the chord and brace members specified in the current design guidelines.

40|$|AbstractLarge-dimension welding joints {{are widely}} used in shipyards and oilfields. These joints need multi-pass welding {{processes}} and tens of hours to complete. Although the development of robotic welding techniques shortens the welding time, {{it is important to}} have a detailed plan of the entire process before welding starts. During detailed planning, pass planning is crucial for the trajectory generation of the robot, since pass planning provides the welding sequence in a deep groove and the welding parameters of every pass. A knowledge database is used in this research to obtain the relationship between the bead geometry and welding parameters. For the pass planning of deep <b>groove</b> <b>welding,</b> this paper proposes an optimization method with the objective to maximize the section area of the weld bead, so that the number of passes can be minimized.

30|$|A {{short arc}} is suited to {{applications}} that require low heat input, {{and it allows}} the joining of thin materials and sheet metals in any position. It {{is a good choice}} when distortion of the construction needs to be minimized. It is suitable for <b>grooved</b> <b>welds</b> as the root pass or for filling the gaps of joints, {{as well as for the}} root pass of open groove joints and plate <b>groove</b> <b>welds.</b> The short arc mode is widely used in the pipe industry and very applicable to root pass welds in pipes. It can be utilized with carbon steel with 100 % carbon dioxide shielding gas or a blend of a maximum of 25 % CO 2 and a balance of argon. The short arc mode is also applicable to low carbon steel, low alloy steel, and stainless steel with thicknesses between 0.5 and 2.6  mm. However, it is unable to perform welding of aluminium (Deruntz 2003). Although, conventional short arc is used in many applications, its use is limited by high potential excessive spatter generation, fume generation, lack of fusion, lower gap bridgability, and arc instability (Hermans and Ouden 1999; Jenkins et al. 2005). The poor performance of conventional short arc results from the limited ability of the power source to control every sequence of the short circuiting metal transfer mode (Lyttle and Praxair 1990; Althouse et al. 2004; Laren 2004; Goecke 2005 a, b; Jeffus and Bower 2010). As a consequence of this limitation, conventional short arc is being progressively replaced by controlled short arc in root-pass sheet metal welding.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of narrow groove wall fusion, {{improving}} the weld formation, the welding test of different oscillation width and frequency is carried out by adopting the narrow high-speed swing MAG welding torch. On the basis of measuring the macro metallographic to determine the weld cross section size, the curve fitting of the variation trend of the weld section size with the swing width and the swing frequency is carried out. The effect of the high speed swing arc narrow <b>groove</b> <b>welding</b> MAG parameters on weld formation is studied. The results show that increasing the swing width or frequency can reduce the weld penetration and increase lateral wall penetration; when the swinging width makes side spacing greater than - 0  5 mm and less than 1 mm, good weld forming will be gained; when the oscillation frequency increases to more than 5 Hz, weld finger penetration can be eliminated, but when it is above 9 Hz, increasing the swing frequency cannot cause obvious change of the dimension of weld. The effects of these oscillating parameters on weld formation can provide guidance for the selection of welding parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{disastrous}} {{consequences of}} the partial collapse of the Ronan Point apartment in 1968 and Northridge earthquake in 1994, exposed the vulnerability of steel moment frames subjected to extreme loading. The reports of these two catastrophic events revealed the significant role of beam to column connection where the damage was mainly formed in this area. In this research, the performance of three different steel beam to column connections known as SidePlate, reduced beam section (RBS) and a new proposed “saddlebag” connection subjected to cyclic and progressive collapse experimentally and numerically were investigated. The main objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the adequacy of the new proposed connection to resist extreme loading compared to SidePlate and RBS. Seismic performance evaluation was focused on the interstory drift angles based on 2010 AISC seismic provisions. In the other hand, investigation of progressive collapse was associated with satisfaction of acceptance criteria by rotational capacities of the connections provided in UFC 4 - 023 - 03 guideline. The results indicated that the new proposed connection was capable of achieving adequate rotational capacity of 0. 2 radians, two times bigger than acceptance criteria, and developing full inelastic capacity of the connecting beams during the progressive collapse analysis. In addition, an excellent cyclic performance was demonstrated by the proposed connection as plastic hinges only appeared in the connected beams at the interstory drift angle of 0. 06 radians, 1. 5 times bigger than acceptance criteria. The seismic assessment also revealed that the proposed saddlebag connection possess adequate energy dissipation capacity attained by stable hysteretic behaviour into the inelastic range. The study also concluded that SidePlate provide adequate performance as it develop 0. 2 radians of plastic hinge rotation angle and 0. 06 radians of interstory drift angle to resist progressive collapse and cyclic loading respectively. However, RBS connection showed vulnerable performance to resist seismic and progressive collapse loading where tensile stress mainly appear at the <b>groove</b> <b>welding...</b>|$|E

The variation of weld metal chemistry in the multi pass GMA and P-GMA weld depositions are studied by spark emission spectroscopy. It is {{observed that the}} narrow <b>groove</b> GMA <b>weld</b> joint shows significant variation of weld metal chemistry compared to the conventional V-groove GMA weld joint since the dilution of base metal extends from the deposit adjacent to <b>groove</b> wall to <b>weld</b> center through dissolution by fusion and solid state diffusion. Further, it is noticed that {{a high rate of}} metal deposition along with high velocity of droplet transfer in P-GMAW process enhances the dilution of weld deposit and accordingly varies the chemical composition in multi-pass P-GMA weld deposit. Lower angle of attack to the groove wall surface along with low heat input in NG- 13 <b>weld</b> <b>groove</b> minimizes the effect of dissolution by fusion and solid state diffusion from the deposit adjacent to <b>groove</b> wall to <b>weld</b> center.

40|$|Reinforcement strength, {{ductility}} and bendability {{properties are}} important components in design of reinforced concrete members, as {{the strength of}} any member comes mainly from reinforcement. Strain compatibility and plastic behaviors are mainly depending on reinforcement ductility. In construction practice, often welding of the bars is required. Welding of reinforcement is an instant solution in many cases, whereas welding is not a routine connection process. Welding will cause deficiencies in reinforcement bars, metallurgical changes and re-crystallization of microstructure of particles. Weld metal toughness is extremely sensitive to the welding heat input that decreases both of its strength and ductility. For determining the effects of welding in reinforcement properties, 48 specimens were tested with 5 different bar diameters, divided into six groups. Investigated parameters were: properties of un-welded bars; strength, ductility and density of weld metal; strength and ductility reduction due to heat input for bundled bars and transverse bars; welding effect on bars’ bending properties; behavior of different joint types; properties of three <b>weld</b> <b>groove</b> shapes also the locations and types of failures sections.

40|$|AbstractA {{generalised}} view on {{the causes}} leading to humping during high-speed seam welding is proposed.

As a consequence of solidification from the walls of the <b>weld</b> <b>groove,</b> the shape of the free cross section for the melt flow is changed {{in such a way that}} the rest melt stream experiences an upwards deflection which initiates the formation of a hump. Conservation of volume in an incompressible fluid requires that in the solidified seam regions of smaller and larger cross sections compared to that of the groove must exist.
