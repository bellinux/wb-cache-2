50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a drum brake's {{friction}} contact area is at the circumference of the brake, a drum brake can provide more braking force than an equal diameter disc brake. The increased friction contact area of drum brake shoes on the drum allows drum brake shoes to last longer than <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pads</b> used in a brake system of similar dimensions and braking force. Drum brakes retain heat and are more complex than disc brakes but are often the more economical and powerful brake type to use in rear brake applications due to the low heat generation of rear brakes, a drum brake's self-applying nature, larger friction surface contact area, and long life wear characteristics (%life used/kW of braking power).|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{nonlinear}} {{behavior of}} a one-dimensional model of the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> is examined. The contact normal force between the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> lining and rotor is represented by a second order polynomial of the relative displacement between the two elastic bodies. The frictional force due to the sliding motion of the rotor against the stationary pad is modeled as a distributed follower-type axial load with time-dependent terms. By Galerkin discretization, the equation governing the transverse motion of the beam model is reduced {{to a set of}} extended Duffing system with quasi-periodically modulated excitations. Retaining the first two vibration modes in the governing equations, frequency response curves are obtained by applying a two-dimensional spectral balance method. For the first time, it is predicted that nonlinearity resulting from the contact mechanics between the <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> lining and rotor can lead to a possible irregular motion (chaotic vibration) of the pad in the neighborhood of simple and parametric resonance. This chaotic behavior is identified and quantitatively measured by examining the Poincaré maps, Fourier spectra, and Lyapunov exponents. It is also found that these chaotic motions emerge as a result of successive Hopf bifurcations characterized by the torus breakdown and torus doubling routes as the excitation frequency varies. Various aspects of the numerical difficulties in the solution of the nonlinear equations are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{parametric}} {{instability of}} a beam {{subjected to a}} moving distributed contact load that also oscillates in the transverse direction of the beam is studied. Due {{to the presence of}} friction between the beam and the moving contact surface, the beam is excited by a pulsating, distributed, follower-type axial load, which results in the problem of a Leipholz column subjected to parametric excitation. The study of this prototypical one-dimensional model is intended to provide further understanding of the instability of systems that have similar loading conditions such as automotive <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pads</b> rubbed by the oscillatory rotor or beam-like structures. Effects of several parameters such as boundary conditions, coefficient of friction, intermediate supports, and waviness of the contact load on the instability are examined.

40|$|Antimony trisulfide (Sb 2 S 3) {{is used as}} a {{lubricant}} in friction material. X-ray diffraction {{analysis revealed}} Sb in 3 / 3 <b>disc</b> <b>brake</b> <b>pads</b> (range 41, 000 - 46, 000 mg/kg) and in 2 / 2 disc brake dust samples (21, 000 and 17, 000 mg/kg) from trucks. Considerably lower concentrations were found in drum brake pads (3 / 5, 59 - 6400 mg/kg) and in drum brake dust (4 / 18, 78 - 2800 mg/kg). Other toxic metals were also detected in pads and dust. The health risk of Sb in particulate brake emissions should be dependent on particle size and chemical entity, in particular solubility. A significant amount of the emitted dust was shown by size-fractionated optical particle counting to be inhalable in environmental (> 90 % mass) and occupational (> 50 % mass) exposure situations. Differentiation via selective solubility showed a considerable amount of Sb 2 S 3 to oxidize during the braking process, likely leading to the formation of Sb 2 O 3, a suspected human carcinogen. Sb in brake dust was soluble in calf serum (8. 5 +/- 1. 2 %, 8. 9 +/- 1. 7 mg/l at 37 degreesC for 3 d). Hence, the use of Sb in friction material should be suspected to pose a human cancer risk and be deterred. To design healthy and environmentally sound alternatives, we propose to apply the Intelligent Product System that distinguishes products of consumption and products of service. Brake pads are true products of consumption, because they are released to biological cycles, and should thus consist of materials with positively defined health and environmental properties...|$|E
