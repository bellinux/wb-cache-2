5|$|In {{the story}} {{explored}} in Konquest mode, {{a young man}} named Shujinko is deceived into spending his entire life collecting the Kamidogu for Onaga, who uses the guise of an emissary of the Elder Gods, the beings who created the realms, named Damashi. Onaga reveals his identity and intentions after Shujinko has gathered all the Kamidogu. Shujinko, led to believe he was working for the <b>greater</b> <b>good,</b> decides to continue training to defeat Onaga.|$|E
5|$|Keith Jacobson {{was offered}} only two {{opportunities}} to buy child pornography through the mail. Both times, he ordered. Both times, {{he asked for}} opportunities to buy more. He needed no Government agent to coax, threaten, or persuade him; no one played on his sympathies, friendship, or suggested that his committing the crime would further a <b>greater</b> <b>good.</b> In fact, no Government agent even contacted him face to face.|$|E
5|$|The {{case set}} a legal {{precedent}} which has shaped copyright law {{to the present}} day. It established the common law doctrine of fair abridgement, which was cited in other cases, ultimately building up {{to the idea of}} fair use. The opinion also recognised the author's right to a work through the nature of the labour it took to produce it, shifting copyright away from publishing rights and towards the idea of serving the <b>greater</b> <b>good</b> by encouraging the production of new, useful works.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be done}} to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the <b>greater</b> <b>good,</b> which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} 24, series co-creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran executive-produced La Femme Nikita for its entire five-year run on USA Network. Both series deal with anti-terrorist operations, {{and the lead}} {{characters}} of both series are placed in situations in which they must make a tragic choice in order to serve the <b>greater</b> <b>good.</b> There are numerous on- and off-screen creative connections between 24 and La Femme Nikita. Several actors from La Femme Nikita have portrayed similar roles on 24, a number of story concepts from La Femme Nikita have been revisited on 24, {{and many of the}} creative personnel from La Femme Nikita worked on 24 in their same role.|$|E
5|$|Introduced as Billie Jenkins's long-lost sister, she {{secretly}} collaborates {{with the}} demonic council {{known as the}} Triad with their plans to destroy the Charmed Ones. She eventually convinces Billie that the Charmed Ones are corrupt, and use their power to fulfill their own personal desires, rather than help for the <b>greater</b> <b>good.</b> Billie kills Christy in self-defense after being unable to convince her to understand the Halliwell sisters were good, and to return home with her. Throughout season eight, Christy is {{shown to be a}} powerful witch with a mastery of her powers of telepathy and pyrokinesis. She is also called the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her connection with Billie, who is prophesied to be the Ultimate Power. Christy is referenced in canonical Charmed material such as comic books and novels.|$|E

5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the <b>greater</b> <b>good.</b> He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E
5|$|With the {{nomination}} undecided, Weed maneuvered for New York {{to send an}} uncommitted delegation to the 1848 Whig National Convention in Philadelphia, hoping to be a kingmaker in position to place former governor Seward on the ticket, or to get him high national office. He persuaded Fillmore to support an uncommitted ticket, {{though he did not}} tell the Buffaloan of his hopes for Seward. Weed was an influential editor, and Fillmore tended to cooperate with him for the <b>greater</b> <b>good</b> of the Whig Party. But Weed had sterner opponents, including Governor Young, who disliked Seward {{and did not want to}} see him gain high office.|$|E

25|$|Rome was {{essentially}} a landowning military aristocracy. From {{the early days of}} the Republic, ten years of military service were a citizen's duty and a prerequisite for election to public office. Devotio (willingness to sacrifice one’s life to the <b>greater</b> <b>good)</b> was central to the Roman military ideal, and was the core of the Roman military oath. It applied from highest to lowest alike in the chain of command. As a soldier committed his life (voluntarily, at least in theory) to the greater cause of Rome's victory, he was not expected to survive defeat.|$|E

Obey your military superiors and never refuse an order unless doing so would break another of Ulric's tenets. Never refuse a direct challenge. Modern weapons, such as gunpowder weapons, artillery, crossbows and fire-bombs, {{because they do not}} rely any physical strength are shunned. Followers of Ulric must never allow one of the fires of a shrine or temple to go out. Oppose Chaos wherever you see it. Never flee a fight unless facing overwhelming odds and the <b>greater</b> <b>good</b> would be served by such a flight.|$|E
25|$|Troughton {{played the}} role {{generally}} in a more lightweight, comical manner, albeit still {{with much of the}} original character's passionate hatred of evil and desire to help the oppressed. He also on occasion showed a darker side, manipulating his companions and the people around him for the <b>greater</b> <b>good</b> (examples include The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Evil of the Daleks). Davis left the show {{at the end of the}} fourth season, and was replaced by Peter Bryant. A few months later, Lloyd left the show and Bryant was promoted to producer. Bryant's successor as script editor was Derrick Sherwin (though Victor Pemberton had filled the job for Bryant's first serial, The Tomb of the Cybermen).|$|E

Mary Jane sees Spider-Man's true identity and feelings, which he says is why they cannot be together. Peter returns Mary Jane to John, and leaves.|$|E
25|$|Her protagonists often {{attempt to}} uphold {{existing}} social institutions and norms {{in the service}} of the <b>greater</b> <b>good</b> while the antagonists often attempt to exploit, subvert or radically alter the predominant social order for selfish gain. She uses the theme of the outsider finding his (or her) place in society and how individuals interact with The Other. A number of Cherryh's novels focus on military and political themes. One underlying theme of her work is an exploration of gender roles. Her characters reveal both strengths and weaknesses regardless of their gender, although her female protagonists are portrayed as especially capable and determined, and many of her male characters are portrayed as damaged, abused, or otherwise vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|Hobbes {{describes}} human psychology {{without any}} reference to the summum bonum, or <b>greatest</b> <b>good,</b> as previous thought had done. Not only {{is the concept of}} a summum bonum superfluous, but given the variability of human desires, there could be no such thing. Consequently, any political community that sought to provide the <b>greatest</b> <b>good</b> to its members would find itself driven by competing conceptions of that good with no way to decide among them. The result would be civil war.|$|R
50|$|Later Greek {{schools of}} philosophy, {{such as the}} Epicureans and Stoics, debated the {{conditions}} of the good life.

The Stoics thought the <b>greatest</b> <b>good</b> not pleasure but reason and everything in accord with reason, even if painful. Hence they praised the life of reason lived in accordance with nature.|$|R
