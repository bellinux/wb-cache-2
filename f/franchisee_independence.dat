40|$|Problem {{investigated}} and objectives: Franchisees often complain that franchisors {{do not meet}} their needs, and are generally viewed as being unhappy with the franchise relationship between franchisees and franchisors. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the level of satisfaction of franchisees with the franchise relationship, including the following elements: <b>franchisee</b> <b>independence,</b> support with the selection of a distribution point, allocation of geographical trading areas, support with the design and layout of distribution points, comprehensive training programmes, the provision of continuous market and product information and operational support, and advertising and financial support, including systems for bookkeeping. Approach: The data represents two groups of the same franchise, namely franchisees operating for two years and less as franchisees and franchisees who have been operating for longer than two years as franchisees. The extent to which these two groups view the relationship elements differently will be examined. Findings: The findings indicate that both groups had a high level of satisfaction with the franchise relationship between franchisees and franchisors, with the exception of identified opportunities, which could be further developed in order to increase the franchisees' level of satisfaction with the franchise relationship between franchisees and franchisors. Conclusion: In view of the results of this research, it was concluded that the franchisees of the selected franchisor in the franchise industry displayed a high level of satisfaction with the franchise relationship between franchisors and franchisees. </p...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePurpose - Network {{uniformity}} {{is crucial}} in franchising, but an excessive number of imposed constraints to maintain this uniformity jeopardizes a <b>franchisee's</b> <b>independence</b> and too much <b>independence</b> given to <b>franchisees</b> jeopardizes franchise network uniformity. So, how to find an equilibrium and avoid the reclassification of a franchise contract as a branch manager contract or as an employment contract with all its related consequences? The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The research {{is based on a}} multiple cases approach. The four complementary cases deal with Yves Rocher (cosmetics and body/face care), Bata (shoes), Fiventis (real estate, life insurance and tax-sheltered savings products), and France Acheminement (express transportation), all analyzed in the French context. Findings - A franchise contract can be reclassified as a branch manager contract if there is economic dependence or as an employment contract if there is a legal subordination relationship. These reclassifications have not only financial consequences, but also an impact in terms of image. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on secondary data. Collecting data along with interviews of franchisors and franchisees would be beneficial. Practical implications - The research is of specific interest to franchisors, franchise experts and lawyers in terms of minimizing the possible risks of facing such types of reclassification of franchise contracts. It can also inform franchisees who may be running their businesses under such conditions. Originality/value - This paper uses a business and law approach in order to analyze the paradox of network uniformity and franchisee autonomy and raises the question of "how to find equilibrium?...|$|R
