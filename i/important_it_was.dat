He had often spoken to friends about how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for him to get {{travelers}} to their destinations on time and how proud he was of USAir's on-time record. All the same, he was also portrayed as a by-the-book, cautious pilot.|$|E
5|$|Jelling, in Denmark, is {{the largest}} royal {{memorial}} from the Viking Age and it was made by Harald Bluetooth in memory of his parents Gorm and Tyra, and in honour of himself. It {{was only one of}} the two large tumuli that contained a chamber tomb, but both barrows, the church and the two Jelling stones testify to how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to mark death ritually during the pagan era and the earliest Christian times.|$|E

25|$|Del Toro {{wanted to}} include a fairy tale about a dragon for Ofelia to narrate to her unborn brother. The tale {{involved}} the dragon, named Varanium Silex, who guarded a mountain surrounded by thorns, but at its peak is a blue rose that can grant immortality. The dragon and the thorns ward off many men though, who decide {{it is better to}} avoid pain than to be given immortality. Although the scene was thematically <b>important,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> cut short for budget reasons.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of pagan {{influence}} on emerging Christian medical practice {{was provided by}} many prominent early Christian thinkers, such as Origen, Clement of Alexandria, and Augustine, who studied natural philosophy and held important aspects of secular Greek philosophy that were in line with Christian thought. They believed faith supported by sound philosophy was superior to simple faith. Other similarities between Christian and pagan views on medicine existed. Christian ideas {{about the role of}} physicians were influenced by previous pagan ideals. The classical idea of the physician as a selfless servant who had to endure unpleasant tasks and provide necessary, often painful treatment was of great {{influence on}} early Christian practitioners. The metaphor was not lost on Christians who viewed Christ as the ultimate physician. Another similarity shared with the pagan perspective was the view of the relationship between disease and the individual. Pagan philosophy had previously held that the pursuit of virtue should not be secondary to bodily concerns. Similarly, Christians felt that, while caring for the body was <b>important,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> second to spiritual pursuits. Early Christianity was eager, for the most part, to borrow these certain aspects of pagan classical philosophy.|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} Laurie Guy {{observed that}} Sexual Preference relied on adult recollection of childhood, {{a type of}} evidence that had been criticized by Gagnon and Simon {{as long ago as}} 1973. Guy argued that gay rights organizations in New Zealand over-relied upon the work in the debate that preceded the passage of the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986, writing that while <b>important,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only one study, and as such did not support gay rights activist claims that [...] "all evidence" [...] shows that sexual orientation is fixed early in life. The neuroscientist Simon LeVay wrote in Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why (2010) that statistical studies support Freud′s view that on average gay men are more likely than straight men to describe their relationships with their mothers as close and their relationships with their fathers as distant or hostile; he cited Bell et al. in support of this claim.|$|E

500|$|Retrospective reviews {{have also}} been positive. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times gave [...] "Rose" [...] {{four out of five}} stars in 2013, {{particularly}} praising Rose's fleshed-out life and how it welcomed in new viewers. While he noted [...] "minor gripes" [...] and felt the Autons' destruction was toned-down, he praised the direction and the performances and called it [...] "a blinding success". The A.V. Club reviewer Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a grade of a B, also noting how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that Rose's world was shown first. He felt that some effects already seemed dated in 2013 and Jackie and Mickey were one-dimensional, but the episode succeeded above all else, especially in developing Rose and the Doctor's relationship and pointing out that Doctor Who is dangerous. In 2013, Ben Lawrence of The Daily Telegraph named [...] "Rose" [...] {{as one of the top}} ten Doctor Who stories set in the contemporary time.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher broke into tears when asked if matching Ayrton Senna's number of victories {{meant a lot to}} him. He later regained his composure and spoke about how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to maintain the life of the engine at the circuit. Michael Schumacher revealed that the cause of his emotion was of him thinking about Senna's death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix and said that he was surprised at how the media reacted to the moment which said that Schumacher [...] "was human after all". Häkkinen revealed that his team made modifications to his car at his pit stop which contributed to him setting the fastest lap of the race. He also admitted that he was unable to catch Michael Schumacher due to the presence of the two Minardis which cost him time. Ralf Schumacher said he was not worried from being challenged by Verstappen and Zonta during the event because of the Williams's quick pace. He also was confident that Williams had confirmed itself as the third strongest team in Formula One.|$|E
500|$|Comparing Jack's {{relationship}} with Ianto to his romantic tension with Gwen, David-Lloyd states [...] "I think [...] different sorts of love or lust, {{as it might}} be, and I think that's an ongoing thing ... At the moment, I think there's two different sorts of love going on there." [...] He also states that he feels that Ianto's {{relationship with}} Jack is his first same-sex relationship, and doesn't feel that Ianto would be a [...] "labelist", but were he, he would identify as bisexual, but that he [...] "wouldn't regard himself {{the same way as}} Jack does because they're from different times." [...] Author Stephen James Walker feels sorry for Ianto, perceiving his relationship with Jack as a one-sided one. To him, Ianto views the relationship as [...] "serious and committed", as seen in [...] "A Day in the Death" [...] where he tells Owen that it is not just about sex. However, from dialogue in [...] "Something Borrowed", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a [...] "recreational activity". Walker also notes how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for Ianto when he cut in to dance with Jack, as {{this is the first time}} that his relationship with Jack is presented before the rest of the crew. The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Gwen tries to clarify whether Ianto understands the nature of his relationship with Jack, saying [...] "You do know he's ...", which Ianto finishes [...] "Just a shag?" [...] before adding [...] "Yes I know. I can't help it, though. I've never been much good at casual." [...] In radio play [...] "The Dead Line", set just prior to series three, Ianto expounds his insecurities to Jack, who refutes them, confirming that his feelings for Ianto are real. When asked if the relationship will continue in series three, executive producer Julie Gardner replied, [...] "Yes, I like seeing them as a couple", while director Euros Lyn stated that [...] "the love story between Captain Jack and Ianto [...] to unfold" [...] in the third series. While Gareth David-Lloyd feels that the love story between Jack and Ianto was not fully resolved, which is [...] "part of the tragedy", the character and his relationship with Jack had been sufficiently explored in the third series for David-Lloyd to be [...] "happy to walk away from it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Legend and {{obfuscation}} cloud his work, so it {{is uncertain}} whether he truly contributed much to mathematics or natural philosophy. Many of the accomplishments credited to Pythagoras may actually have been accomplishments of his colleagues or successors, or originated earlier. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were <b>important.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{said that he was}} the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom, and Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato, and through him, all of Western philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|Hokusai {{created the}} [...] "Thirty-Six Views" [...] {{both as a}} {{response}} to a domestic travel boom and as part of a personal obsession with Mount Fuji. It was this series, specifically The Great Wave print and Fine Wind, Clear Morning, that secured Hokusai’s fame both in Japan and overseas. As historian Richard Lane concludes, [...] "Indeed, if there is one work that made Hokusai's name, both in Japan and abroad, it must be this monumental print-series". While Hokusai's work prior to this series is certainly <b>important,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not until this series that he gained broad recognition.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{have argued}} that the anthem is too male-centric. Lyrics such as [...] "Our manhood we pledge to thy liberty" [...] suggest the song was {{originally}} intended to be sung only by men. Amandala correspondent Naomi Burn suggested that [...] "manhood" [...] be replaced by [...] "honour" [...] so that the lyrics would have more relevance for women. It has also been noted that women are never mentioned in the anthem, only men. A 1998 survey of approximately 2,000 Belizean women asked how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to include women in the national anthem. 14.6% answered [...] "most important", 19.7% answered [...] "somewhat important", and 63.4% answered [...] "not very important".|$|E

Butterfield's testimony lasted from 2 PM to 6:30 PM.

Chief Counsel Samuel Dash says he immediately informed his subordinate, Deputy Chief Counsel Rufus L. Edmisten, and then Democratic Senator Sam Ervin, chairman of the committee. Both Ervin and Dash realized how <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> politically to have had a Republican uncover the taping system. That same night, Ervin asked Dash to have Butterfield testify on Monday, July 16.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{the late}} Saxon period and 1209 {{there was a}} series of wooden bridges across the Thames, but in that year a stone bridge was completed. The work was overseen by Peter de Colechurch, a priest and head of the Fraternity of the Brethren of London Bridge. The Church had from early times {{encouraged}} the building of bridges and this activity was so <b>important</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> perceived to be an act of piety – a commitment to God which should be supported by the giving of alms. London’s citizens made gifts of land and money [...] "to God and the Bridge". The Bridge House Estates became part of the City's jurisdiction in 1282.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Servetus, {{using the}} name [...] "Michel de Villeneuve" [...] during his stay in France, was Vesalius' fellow student and the best Galenist at the University of Paris, {{according}} to Johann Winter von Andernach, who taught both. In the Galenism of the Renaissance, editions of the Opera Omnia by Galen were very <b>important.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> begun in Venice in 1541–1542 by the Guinta. There were fourteen editions of the book from that date until 1625. Just one edition was produced from Lyon between 1548 and 1551. The Lyon edition has commentaries on breathing and blood streaming that correct the work of earlier renowned authors such as Vesalius, Caius or Janus Cornarius. [...] "Michel De Villeneuve" [...] had contracts with Jean Frellon for that work, and the Servetus scholar-researcher Francisco Javier González Echeverría [...] presented research that became an accepted communication in the International Society for the History of Medicine, which concluded that Michael De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus) {{is the author of}} the commentaries of this edition of Frellon, in Lyon.|$|E
