These are composed of a complex mixture containing dimethylalkanes, n-alkanes, and monomethylalkanes. They are straight-chain and have methyl branches. The most common chemicals are 13,17- dimethylhentriacontane (18%) 3-methyl-nonacosane (13%), 3-methylheptacosane (11%), and n-heptacosane (8%). These serve to protect the wasps from dehydration. Their composition tends to be unique to each species of wasp. Hydrocarbons are present {{on the surface}} of workers, males, eggs, and larvae, as well as the surface of the nest and its pedicel. The lipids in the nest paper probably function in kin recognition among workers, while those in the pedicel likely deter predators. The free fatty acids of the pedicel induce the necrophoric response in ants, which causes them to avoid the pedicel rather than cross over it and prey on the nest’s inhabitants. In ants, the necrophoric response is defined as the behavior of recognizing dead colony members and carrying them to a refuse pile away from the nest. Adult males have the hydrocarbon compounds as the workers, but they are present in different amounts. In males, the most common component is 3-methylnonacosane (21%); in eggs, 3-methylnonacosane makes up 23% of lipids; in larvae 13- and 15-methylnonacosane are the most common (15%).

G2A may similarly {{be responsible for the}} activities of other phospholipids which, like LPC have not been shown to bind to G2A but still require G2A for certain of their activities viz., lysophosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine; these two lyso-phospholipids stimulate calcium signaling pathways in human neutrophils by a G2A dependent mechanism. [...] Furthermore, activated neutrophils greatly increase their surface membrane content of lysophosphatidylserine. In a mouse model, mouse neutrophils with increased levels of lysophosphatidylserine on their surface membrane due to cell activation or artificial addition showed an increase in there engulfment by mouse macrophages in vitro that was dependent on the expression of G2A in the macrophages and an increased rate of clearance in mice by a mechanism that was dependent on the expression of G2A by the mice. [...] Lysophosphotidylserine-laden neutrophils stimulated the G2A-dependent production the anti-inflammatory mediator, prostaglandin E2, by macrophages in the in vitro studies and inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, interleukin-6 and keratinocyte chemoattractant, in in vivo studies. Taken together, these studies suggest that G2A, activated by certain phospholipids contributes not only to the development but also the resolution of certain inflammation and innate immune responses in mice and may also do so in humans.|$|E

40|$|Background & Objectives: The new, more {{effective}} antibiotic sources are urgently needed now {{to overcome the}} multi-drug resistance (MDR) {{in the treatment of}} infectious diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms. This study was aimed to find out the bioactivity of the <b>hexadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> isolated from hydroid AglaopheniacupressinaLamoureoux with inhibition mechanisms or lethal to Salmonella typhi that frequently contaminate food materials. Methods: This study was an experimental study with the following treatment steps: Isolation and characterization of the compounds from hydroid A. cupressinaLamoureoux by chromatography. Hexadecanoic acids and the isolates from hydroid A. cupressinaLamoureoux were then tested against S. typhi at various concentrations (10 ppm, 20 ppm, and 30 ppm). Result: Study findings indicated that: (1) <b>hexadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> at the concentration of 30 ppm is bactericidal against S. syphi. Interpretation & Conclusion: From the study findings, it can be concluded that <b>hexadecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (30 ppm) has antibacterial activity by damaging the cells wall of S. typhi...|$|E
40|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel {{electrophoresis}} {{was used to}} analyze the macromolecular heterogeneity of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from seven fresh clinical isolates and three culture collection strains of the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori. All the clinical isolates produced smooth-form LPS with O side chains of relatively homogeneous chain length, whereas the culture collection strains yielded rough-form LPS. A better yield of the latter LPS was obtained when combined protease pretreatment and hot phenol-water extraction were used than when the conventional phenol-water technique alone was used for extraction. The LPS of the three culture collection strains (S- 24, C- 5437, and NCTC 11637) were chemically characterized. Constituents common to all the LPS were fucose, D-mannose, D-glucose, D-galactose, D-glycero-D-manno-heptose, L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, and 3 -deoxy-D-manno- 2 -octulosonic acid. The molar ratios of the hexoses differed between different strains, thereby reflecting structural differences. Phosphate, phosphorylethanolamine, and pyrophosphorylethanolamine were present also. Free lipid A contained D-glucosamine and fatty acids, with phosphate and a minor amount of ethanolamine. The major fatty acids were ester- and amide-bound 3 -hydroxyoctadecanoic acid and ester-bound octadecanioc and 3 -hydroxyhexadecanoic acids, with minor amounts of ester-bound tetradecanoic and <b>hexadecanoic</b> <b>acids.</b> In addition to the uncommonly long 3 -hydroxy fatty acids, an unusual phosphorylation pattern was deduced to be present in the lipid A...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNatural {{products}} are among {{one of the}} most promising fields in finding new molecular targets in cancer therapy. Laryngeal carcinoma is {{one of the most}} common cancers affecting the head and neck regions, and is associated with high morbidity rate if left untreated. The aim of this study was to examine the antiproliferative effect of Araucaria angustifolia on laryngeal carcinoma HEp- 2 cells. The results showed that A. angustifolia extract (AAE) induced a significant cytotoxicity in HEp- 2 cells compared to the non-tumor human epithelial (HEK- 293) cells, indicating a selective activity of AAE for the cancer cells. A. angustifolia extract was able to increase oxidative damage to lipids and proteins, and the production of nitric oxide, along with the depletion of enzymatic antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase and catalase) in the tumor cell line. Moreover, AAE was able to induce DNA damage, nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation. A significant increase in the Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF), Bax, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase- 3 cleavage expression were also found. These effects could be related to the ability of AAE to increase the production of reactive oxygen species through inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I activity and ATP production by the tumor cells. The phytochemical analysis of A. angustifolia, performed using High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) in MS and MS/MS mode, showed the presence of dodecanoic and <b>hexadecanoic</b> <b>acids,</b> and phenolic compounds, which may be associated with the chemotherapeutic effect observed in this study...|$|R
