40|$|Resonant {{effects and}} energy {{dissipation}} due to sloshing fuel inside propellant tanks are problems {{that arise in}} the initial design of any spacecraft or launch vehicle. A faster and more reliable method for calculating these effects during the design stages is needed. Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques, a model of these fuel tanks can be created and used to predict important parameters such as resonant slosh frequency and damping rate. This initial study addresses the case of free surface slosh. Future studies will focus on creating models for tanks fitted with propellant management devices (PMD) such as diaphragms and baffles. During {{the initial stages of}} spacecraft and launch vehicle design, it is important to account for the forces created by the sloshing propellant in the fuel tanks. The variable conditions under which these propellant tanks operate make analytical models rather difficult to construct.

40|$|The {{nutation}} (wobble) of {{a spinning}} spacecraft {{in the presence}} of energy dissipation is a well-known problem in dynamics and is of particular concern for space missions. Even with modern computing systems, CFD type simulations are not fast enough to allow for large scale Monte Carlo analyses of spacecraft and launch vehicle dynamic behavior with slosh included. Simplified mechanical analogs for the slosh are preferred during the initial stages of design to reduce computational time and effort to evaluate the Nutation Time Constant (NTC). Analytic determination of the slosh analog parameters has met with mixed success and is made even more difficult by the introduction of propellant management devices such as elastomeric diaphragms. By subjecting full-sized fuel tanks with actual flight fuel loads to motion similar to that experienced in flight and measuring the forces experienced by the tanks, these parameters can be determined experimentally. Currently, the identification of the model parameters is a laborious trial-and-error process in which the hand-derived equations of motion for the mechanical analog are evaluated and their results compared with the experimental results. Of particular interest is the effect of <b>diaphragms</b> and <b>bladders</b> on the slosh dynamics and how best to model these devices.

Even with modern computing systems, CFD type simulations are not fast enough to allow for large scale Monte Carlo analyses of spacecraft and launch vehicle dynamic behavior with slosh included. It is still desirable to use some type of simplified mechanical analog for the slosh to shorten computation time. Analytic determination of the slosh analog parameters has met with mixed success and is made even more difficult by the introduction of propellant management devices such as elastomeric diaphragms.

Currently, the identification of the model parameters is a laborious trial-and-error process in which the hand-derived equations of motion for the mechanical analog are evaluated and their results compared with the experimental results.

40|$|SINCE Kaposi's {{original}} {{description of}} multiple hemorrhagic sarcoma {{of the skin}} in 1872, more than 600 cases {{have been reported in}} the literature. In the great majority of these cases the skin has been primarily affected. A large number progress slowly for many years and at autopsy show no spread beyond the cutaneous site. However, the finding of sarcomatous deposits in the viscera is a common one. Almost every organ of the body has been implicated. In addition to the skin the most frequent sites of involvement are the penis, the gastrointestinal tract, the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the superficial and deep lymph nodes. 1 Unusual localizations include the serous membranes, spleen, liver, adrenal glands, myocardium, mesentery, <b>diaphragm,</b> urinary <b>bladder,</b> thyroid and brain. 2 Because of such widespread systemic involvement this disease must be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of conditions manifesting multiple systemic complaints and physical findings. The alimentary canal may be involved wholly or in part from the oral cavity to the anus. The stomach and small intestine are most often affected, the large intestine and appendix less frequently. Gastrointestinal symptoms are not as a rule prominent but instances of severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hemorrhage have been described. 3 A recent case is recorded 4 in which a 17 year old boy died of in-testinal intussusception caused by a solitary Kaposi nodule in the ileum. It has been emphasized that "death may occur from infiltration of the lungs, liver or spleen but by far the most common sequence is metastasis to the intestinal mucosa with ulceration causing hemorrhage and exsanguination.

40|$|Botulinum {{neurotoxins}} (BoNTs) {{are used}} extensively as therapeutic agents. Serotypes A and B are available as marketed products. Higher doses of BoNT/B {{are required to}} reach an efficacy {{similar to that of}} products containing BoNT/A. Advances in our understanding of BoNT/B mechanism of action have afforded the opportunity to make rational modifications to the toxin aimed at increasing its activity. Recently, a mutation in the light chain of BoNT/B (S 201 P) was described that increases the catalytic activity of the isolated BoNT/B light chain in biochemical assays. In this study, we have produced two full-length recombinant BoNT/B toxins in E. coli-one wild type (rBoNT/B 1) and one incorporating the S 201 P mutation (rBoNT/B 1 (S 201 P)). We have compared the activity of these two molecules along with a native BoNT/B 1 in biochemical cell-free assays and in several biological systems. In the cell-free assay, which measured light-chain activity alone, rBoNT/B 1 (S 201 P) cleaved VAMP- 2 and VAMP- 1 substrate with an activity 3 - 4 -fold higher than rBoNT/B 1. However, despite the enhanced catalytic activity of rBoNT/B 1 (S 201 P), {{there was no significant difference}} in potency between the two molecules in any of the in vitro cell-based assays, using either rodent spinal cord neurons or cortical neurons. Similarly in ex vivo tissue preparations rBoNT/B 1 (S 201 P) was not significantly more potent than rBoNT/B 1 at inhibiting either <b>diaphragm</b> or detrusor (<b>bladder)</b> muscle activity in C 57 BL/ 6 N and CD 1 mice. Finally, no differences between rBoNT/B 1 and rBoNT/B 1 (S 201 P) were observed in an in vivo digit abduction score (DAS) assay in C 57 BL/ 6 N mice, either in efficacy or safety parameters. The lack of translation from the enhanced BoNT/B 1 (S 201 P) catalytic activity to potency in complex biological systems suggests that the catalytic step is not the rate-limiting factor for BoNT/B to reach maximum efficacy. In order to augment the efficacy of BoNT/B in humans, strategies other than enhancing light chain activity may need to be considered...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years low-toxicity “green” {{storable}} liquid propellants have become considerably more attractive as possible substitutes for nitrogen oxides and hydrazines. The main advantage of “green” propellants {{is represented by the}} significant cost savings associated with the drastic simplification of the health and safety protection procedures necessary during propellant production, storage and handling. Fuel Vapor Pressurization (FVP) technology of “green” bipropellant rocket engines potentially offers very significant additional advantages in terms of system cost, complexity, reliability, safety and mass, with practically no penalty in propulsive performance compared to traditional storable propellants such as mixed nitrogen oxides and hydrazines. Pioneering FVP experiments were carried out by Goddard, Wyld and others. Detailed studies have been conducted and several tests have been successfully performed since 1994 in the US, but no such experience is presently available in Europe, nor FVP has ever attained flight readiness anywhere in the world. The main characteristics of the FVP system examined in this work consist in the use of storable, non-toxic, inexpensive, non hypergolic, high-energy propellants such as hydrogen peroxide (HP, H 2 O 2) and ethane (C 2 H 6) and in the storage of these propellants in a single lightweight tank, using a flexible <b>diaphragm</b> or a <b>bladder</b> to separate the fuel from the oxidizer and a catalytic reactor to decompose the hydrogen peroxide before mixing and combustion with ethane. This configuration therefore yields a very simple and yet highly efficient and reliable propulsion system by eliminating the cost, the weight and complexity of propellant tanks and pressurization bottles, pressure and flow regulators and ignition systems. These advantages are of special relevance in low- or mediumthrust rocket engines for the rapidly expanding market of “small” space missions and led the authors to focus on the analysis and assessment of propulsion systems operating according to this concept. The present paper reports therefore the preliminary evaluation of fuel vapor pressurized H 2 O 2 -C 2 H 6 rocket propulsion systems. The results of the analysis confirm that the development of FVP technology may represent a significant contribution to the containment of the propulsion cost of small- and medium-size spacecrafts...|$|R

In the present study we determined the in vivo distribution of the venom following its subcutaneous injection into mice. B. erythromelas venom and albumin were labeled individually with 131 I by the chloramine T method, and separated in a Sephacryl® S- 200 column. The efficiency of labeling was 68 %. Male Swiss mice (40 - 45 g), which had been provided with drinking water containing 0. 05 % KI {{over a period of}} 10 days prior to the experiment, were inoculated dorsally (sc) with 0. 3 ml (2. 35 x 105 cpm/mouse) of 131 I-venom (N = 42), 131 I-albumin or 131 I (controls, N = 28 each). Thirty minutes and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h after inoculation, the animals were perfused with 0. 85 % NaCl and skin and various organs were collected in order to determine radioactivity content. There was a high rate of venom absorption in the skin (51 %) within the first 30 min compared to albumin (20. 1 %) and free iodine (8. 2 %). Up to the third hour after injection there was a tendency for venom and albumin to concentrate in the stomach (3 rd h), small intestine (3 rd h) and large intestine (6 th h). Both control groups had more radioactivity in the digestive tract, especially in the stomach, but these levels decreased essentially to baseline by 12 - 18 h postinjection. In the kidneys, the distribution profiles of venom, albumin and iodine were similar. Counts at 30 min postinjection were low in all three groups (1. 37, 1. 86 and 0. 77, respectively), and diminished to essentially 0 % by 12 - 18 h. Albumin tended to concentrate in muscle until the 3 rd h postinjection (1. 98 %). There was a low binding of labeled venom in the liver (< 0. 54 %), thyroid (< 0. 11 %) and lungs (< 0. 08 %), and no iodinated venom was detected in brain, heart, <b>diaphragm,</b> spleen or <b>bladder.</b> The low venom binding observed in most internal organs, comparable to that of albumin, suggests that B. erythromelas venom does not specifically target most internal organs.
