The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected motions for appeal by his defense on March 8, 2010. Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time. State court Judge Robin Reese signed an execution warrant on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the death sentence.|$|E
5|$|Lewis {{enters a}} country pub and {{unexpectedly}} meets Audrey {{and her daughter}} Gail. Upon seeing them, he pretends he is his own identical twin brother. Neither Audrey or Gail are fooled and Lewis offers {{to pay for their}} drinks. He then leaves the pub and heads to Coronation Street. Lewis visits Peter Barlow, apologises for stealing from him and returns the money he took with an extra £1000 as compensation. Lewis then goes to Audrey's salon and he tells her he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> hurt her. He asks Audrey to drive him to the police station to prove how sorry he is. After he is given bail, Lewis enters the Rovers Return and is punched by Deirdre. Lewis faces hostility from Audrey's grandson, David (Jack P. Shepherd) upon his return to the salon. He begs Audrey for forgiveness but she throws him out. Lewis sends her flowers and Audrey visits his address and finds he is living in a bedsit. David's wife, Kylie (Paula Lane), introduces herself to Lewis and he defends her against Brian Packham's (Peter Gunn) accusations that she is giving her son the wrong food.|$|E

He thus had no interest in mounting a decisive counterattack on the Allied beachhead using the substantial number of troops he already had {{in the southern part of}} Bougainville. Instead, he reinforced the Buka Island area, just off the north coast of the larger island, believing it to be the Allies' real target. Thus, the Army repeated the error of Guadalcanal, while the Navy could not convince Imamura of the Americans' real intentions.|$|E
500|$|Crawford {{sees the}} {{events at the}} 1913 Derby as a lens [...] "through which... whole life has been interpreted", and the {{uncertainty}} of her motives and intentions that day has affected how she has been judged by history. Carolyn Collette, a literary critic who has studied Davison's writing, identifies the different motives ascribed to Davison, including [...] "uncontrolled impulses" [...] or a search for martyrdom for women's suffrage. Collette also sees a more current trend among historians [...] "to accept what some of her close contemporaries believed: that Davison's actions that day were deliberate" [...] and that she attempted to attach the suffragette colours to the King's horse. Cicely Hale, a suffragette {{who worked at the}} WSPU and who knew Davison, described her as [...] "a fanatic" [...] who was prepared to die but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to.</b> Other observers, such as Purvis, and Ann Morley and Liz Stanley—Davison's biographers—agree that Davison <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> die.|$|E

Former World Champion Scheckter praised both Ferrari and Michael Schumacher, though he expressed disappointment at losing his status as the final World Champion for Ferrari. However, the former President of Italy Francesco Cossiga criticised Michael Schumacher's conduct during the Italian National Anthem where the German traditionally imitated a conductor when it was heard.

500|$|Prior to {{its release}} in North America, 1UP blogger Alejandro Quan-Madrid equated the Moja {{characters}} in LocoRoco to blackface, and citing {{the game as}} an example of [...] "institutionalized racism that needs calling out". Quan-Madrid and 1UP reporter Jemery Parish noted that the Japanese culture does not have the same racial population as western countries like the United States, and as such, blackface or other similar representations of black persons are taken for granted in that country, and localization usually handles such issues. Quan-Madrid called on Sony to make a simple color change to the Moja, similar to what Capcom had done for the character of Oilman in Mega Man Powered Up. Developers for the game, including Kouno, noted that the Moja character design was based on the hairstyle of Keigo Tsuchiya, the game's artist, at the time of development, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> imply any racist tones. The accusation of racism came days before a similar charge against Sony for an advertisement for the white-colored PSP, portraying a white woman subjugating a black woman.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] is {{credited}} as a ballad {{compared to the}} rest of the dance-fuelled tracks from The Fame. It is a 1980s-influenced synthpop and bubblegum pop song, while incorporating the [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] hook from Rihanna's single [...] "Umbrella", according to Freedom du Lac from The Washington Post. Gaga stated that the lyrics of [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] are about love and she explained that [...] "'Eh, Eh' is my simple pop song about finding someone new and breaking up with the old boyfriend." [...] Writer James E. Perone mentioned in his book The Album: A Guide to Pop Music's Most Provocative, Influential, and Important Creations that with the lyrics, Gaga maintained a focus on transitory relationships. Although the lyrics explained her former lover that she had found someone new and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> hurt him with the news, the continuous repetition of the phrase [...] "nothing else I can say" [...] solidifies the transient nature of the relationship portrayed. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 94 beats per minute. Gaga's vocal range spans from B3 to C5 with the main key in which the song is set being E major. The song follows in the chord progression of E–B–Fm–E–B–Fm. Synthpop musician Frankmusik remixed the track for Gaga's 2010 album, The Remix, where he manipulated Gaga's vocals and created a dreamy quality with them, as noted by Nicki Escuedo from Phoenix New Times.|$|E
500|$|Hughes was {{scheduled}} to fight Georges St-Pierre in a rematch at UFC 63, but after St-Pierre sustained a severe groin injury, the UFC announced that B.J. Penn would replace him in the title fight. At this point in their careers, Penn was the only mixed martial artist to beat Hughes after March 2001. In fact, it was Hughes' only loss in his last 19 fights. In the bout, Penn controlled the first two rounds, but sustained a rib injury during the scramble to take Hughes' back in round two. He was visibly different in the third round, appearing exhausted and missing punches he was landing earlier. Hughes {{was able to take}} Penn to the mat, and in side-control crucifix position rained punches on Penn's head until referee [...] "Big" [...] John McCarthy stopped the fight at 3:53 of the third round.
