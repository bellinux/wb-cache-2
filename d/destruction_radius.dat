40|$|Long-baseline optical interferometers can now {{detect and}} resolve hot dust {{emission}} thought to arise at the inner edge of circumstellar disks around young stellar objects (YSOs).

We consider how realistic dust optical properties and gas opacity dramatically affect the predicted location of this dust <b>destruction</b> <b>radius,</b> an exercise routinely done in other contexts but so far neglected in the analysis of near-infrared sizes of YSOs. We also present the accumulated literature of near-infrared YSO sizes {{in the form of a}} ``size-luminosity diagram'' and compare with theoretical expectations.

40|$|Abstract. The {{sidewall}} rock {{area was}} divided into destruction zone, damage zone and elastic zone, considering that the fracturing fluid can cause sidewall rock damage and change the stress status of sidewall rock. The stress distribution calculation models for every zone were established basing on elasticity and damage mechanics. The relationship between radial stress, circumferential stress and <b>destruction</b> <b>radius,</b> damage zone was calculated. We can conclude from the calculation results that the radial stress and circumferential stress will increase with the distance away from the axis of wellbore increasing, and radial stress is greater than circumferential stress in destruction and damage zone. However, in elastic zone the radial stress and circumferential stress will decrease with the distance away from the axis of wellbore increasing. The radial stress approaches the maximum horizontal principle stress, and the circumferential stress approaches the minimum horizontal principle stress at last...|$|E
40|$|We apply an {{algorithm}} for radiative {{feedback on}} a dusty flow (detailed in Edgar and Clarke (2003)) {{to the problem}} of Bondi [...] Hoyle accretion. This calculation is potentially relevant to the formation of massive stars in ultradense cores of stellar clusters. We find that radiative feedback is more effective than in the case of previous calculations in spherical symmetry. The Bondi-Hoyle geometry implies that material is flowing nearly tangentially when it experiences the sharp radiative impulse at the dust <b>destruction</b> <b>radius,</b> and consequently it is readily perturbed into outflowing orbits. We find that it is difficult for stellar masses to grow beyond around 10 M_sol (for standard interstellar dust abundances). We discuss the possible implications of this result for the formation mechanism of OB stars in cluster cores. We end by proposing a series of conditions which must be fulfilled if Bondi [...] Hoyle accretion is to continue. Comment: 10 pages, 11 figures. Accepted for publication by MNRA...|$|E
40|$|Magnetars are {{a special}} class of slowly {{rotating}} neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields [...] {{at least an}} order of magnitude larger than those of the "normal" radio pulsars. The potential evolutionary links and differences between these two types of objects are still unknown; recent studies, however, have provided circumstantial evidence connecting magnetars with very massive progenitor stars. Here we report the discovery of an infrared elliptical ring or shell surrounding the magnetar SGR 1900 + 14. The appearance and energetics of the ring are difficult to interpret {{within the framework of the}} progenitor's stellar mass loss or the subsequent evolution of the supernova remnant. We suggest instead that a dust-free cavity was produced in the magnetar environment by the giant flare emitted by the source in August 1998. Considering the total energy released in the flare, the theoretical dust [...] <b>destruction</b> <b>radius</b> matches well with the observed dimensions of the ring.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a simplified method of treating the radiative acceleration of dusty flows. This method retains the sharp impulse at the dust <b>destruction</b> <b>radius</b> that is a feature of frequency dependent radiative transfer, whilst placing minimal demands on computing resources. As such, it is suitable for inclusion in hydrodynamic codes. We have applied this method {{to the formation of}} massive stars in spherical geometry, and find that the fraction of a cloud which can accrete on to the central star is a strong function of the Jeans' Number and density profile of the cloud. Massive star formation is favoured by cold homogeneous conditions, as might result in regions where gas is swept up by some external triggering agent. We find (in contrast to previous authors) that massive star formation does not require a depleted dust mixture, although the use of dust at typical interstellar abundances does reduce the final stellar mass compared to cores formed from a depleted mixture.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} of magnetically-mediated disk accretion in Herbig Ae/Be stars. Magnetospheric accretion models of Balmer and sodium profiles calculated with appropriate stellar and rotational parameters are in qualitative {{agreement with the}} observed profiles of the Herbig Ae star UX Ori, and yield a mass accretion rate of ~ 10 ^{- 8 } Msun/yr. If more recent indications of an extremely large rotation rate for this object are correct, the magnetic field geometry must deviate {{from that of a}} standard dipole in order to produce line emission consistent with observed flux levels. Models of the associated accretion shock qualitatively explain the observed distribution of excess fluxes in the Balmer discontinuity for a large ensemble of Herbig Ae/Be stars, and imply typically small mass accretion rates, < 10 ^{- 7 } Msun/yr. In order for accretion to proceed onto the star, significant amounts of gas must exist inside the dust <b>destruction</b> <b>radius,</b> which is potentially problematic for recently advocated scenarios of "puffed" inner dust wall geometries. However, our models of the inner gas disk show that for the typical accretion rates we have derived, the gas should be generally optically thin, thus allowing direct stellar irradiation of the inner dust edge of the disk.

40|$|We {{propose that}} the two newly {{detected}} Earth-size planets around the hot B subdwarf star KIC 05807616 are remnant of the tidally destructed metallic core of a massive planet. A single massive gas-giant planet was spiralling-in inside the envelope of the red giant branch star progenitor of the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) star KIC 05807616. The released gravitational energy unbound most of the stellar envelope, turning it into an EHB star. The massive planet reached the tidal <b>destruction</b> <b>radius</b> of ~Ro from the core, where the planet's gaseous envelope was tidally removed. In our scenario the metallic core of the massive planet was tidally destructed into several Earth-like bodies immediately after the gaseous envelope of the planet was removed. Two, and possibly more, Earth-size fragments survived at orbital separations of >Ro within the gaseous disk. The bodies interact with the disk and among themselves and migrated to reach orbits close to a 3 : 2 resonance. These observed planets can have a planetary magnetic field about ten times as strong as that of Earth. This strong magnetic field can substantially reduce the evaporation rate from the planets and explain their survivability against the strong UV radiation of the EHB star. Comment: Submitte...|$|E
40|$|It was {{recently}} {{discovered that the}} temperature in the surface layer of externally heated optically thick gray dust clouds increases with the optical depth for some distance from the surface, as opposed to the normal decrease in temperature with distance {{in the rest of the}} cloud. This temperature inversion is a result of efficient absorption of diffuse flux from the cloud interior by the surface dust exposed to the external radiation. A micron or bigger size grains experience this effect when the external flux is of stellar spectrum. We explore what happens to the effect when dust is a mixture of grain sizes (multigrain). Two possible boundary conditions are considered: i) a constant external flux without constrains on the dust temperature, and ii) the maximum dust temperature set to the sublimation temperature. We find that the first condition allows small grains to completely suppress the temperature inversion of big grains if the overall opacity is dominated by small grains. The second condition enables big grains to maintain the inversion even when they are a minor contributor to the opacity. In reality, the choice of boundary condition depends on the dust dynamics. When applied to the physics of protoplanetary disks, the temperature inversion leads to a previously unrecognized disk structure where optically thin dust can exist inside the dust <b>destruction</b> <b>radius</b> of an optically thick disk. We conclude that the transition between the dusty disk and the gaseous inner clearing is not a sharp edge, but rather a large optically thin region.

40|$|We present {{observations}} of four T Tauri stars using long baseline infrared interferometry from the Palomar Testbed Interferometer. The target sources, T Tau N, SU Aur, RY Tau and DR Tau, are all {{known to be}} surrounded by dusty circumstellar disks. The observations directly trace the inner regions (< 1 AU) of the disk and can be used to constrain the physical properties of this material. For three of the sources observed, the infrared emission is clearly resolved. We first use geometric models to characterize the emission region size, which ranges from 0. 04 to 0. 3 AU in radius. We then use Monte Carlo radiation transfer models of accretion disks to jointly model the spectral energy distribution and the interferometric observations with disk models including accretion and scattering. With these models, we are able to reproduce the data set with extended emission arising from structures larger than 10 milliarcseconds contributing less than 6 % of the K band emission, consistent with there being little or no envelope remaining for these Class II sources (d log(lambda*F_lambda) /d log(lambda) ~ - 2 to 0 in the infrared). The radiation transfer models have inner radii for the dust similar to the geometric models; however, for RY Tau emission from gas within the inner dust radius contributes significantly to the model flux and visibility at infrared wavelengths. The main conclusion of our modeling is that emission from inner gas disks (between the magnetic truncation radius and the dust <b>destruction</b> <b>radius)</b> can be a significant component in the inner disk flux for sources with large inner dust radii.

40|$|We model how the {{mid-infrared}} {{colors of}} Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) vary with stellar temperature. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of each object has contributions from thermal emission of circumstellar dust, from direct stellar photospheric emission, and from scattered stellar emission. We first isolate {{the effects of}} stellar contributions (direct+scattered) to the SED using homologous "Class I" models, where {{the shape of the}} thermal contribution to the SED remains constant. Stellar light contributes relatively more to the MIR emission of YSOs with lower temperature stars (Tstar ~ 4000 K) because the emission peak wavelength of the star is closer to that of the thermal radiation. Next we consider realistic Class 0, I, and II source models and find that the other dominant effect of varying stellar temperature on YSO SEDs is that of the inner disk wall: In high-Tstar models, the dust <b>destruction</b> <b>radius</b> is much further out with a consequently larger inner disk wall that contributes relatively more to the 2 - 10 um flux. This effect partially offsets that of the stellar contribution leading to varying behaviors of the 2 - 10 um flux. Our modeled MIR protostellar colors have implications for interpretations of Spitzer IRAC observations of star formation regions: It is commonly assumed that the slope of the SED at 1 - 10 um is directly related to evolutionary state. We show that inclination effects, aperture size, scattered light, and stellar temperature cause a broad spread in the colors of a source at a single evolutionary state. Color magnitude diagrams can help sort out these effects by separating sources with different Tstar based on their different brightness (for sources at the same distance) ...|$|E
40|$|We model how the mid-IR {{colors of}} young stellar objects (YSOs) vary with stellar temperature. The {{spectral}} energy distribution (SED) of each object has {{contributions from the}} thermal emission of circumstellar dust, from direct stellar photospheric emission, and from scattered stellar emission. We first isolate the effects of stellar contributions (direct + scattered) to the SED using homologous ‘‘Class I’ ’ models: the distribution of circumstellar matter is chosen to scale with stellar temperature T such that {{the shape of the}} thermal contribution to the SED remains constant. The relative contribution of stellar direct and scattered light varies with T, changing the 1 – 10 m (MIR) colors. Stellar light contributes more to the mid-IR emission of YSOs with lower temperature stars (T 4000 K) because the emission peak wavelength of the star is closer to that of the thermal radiation. In YSOs with hotter central stars, since the peak of the stellar and thermal spectra are more separated in wavelength, the 1 – 10 m spectrum is closer to a pure thermal spectrum and the objects are redder. Next we consider realistic Class 0, I, and II source models and find that the other dominant effect of varying stellar temperature on YSO SEDs is that of the inner disk wall: in high-T models, the dust <b>destruction</b> <b>radius</b> is much farther out, with a consequently larger inner disk wall that contributes relatively more to the 2 – 10 m flux.

40|$|We present 7 mm and 3. 5 cm {{wavelength}} continuum observations {{toward the}} Herbig AeBe star HD 169142 {{performed with the}} Very Large Array (VLA) with an angular resolution of ~ 1 ". We find that this object exhibits strong (~ 4. 4 mJy), unresolved (~ 1 ") 7 mm continuum emission, {{being one of the}} brightest isolated Herbig AeBe stars ever detected with the VLA at this wavelength. No emission is detected at 3. 5 cm continuum, with a 3 sigma upper limit of ~ 0. 08 mJy. From these values, we obtain a spectral index of ~ 2. 5 in the 3. 5 cm to 7 mm wavelength range, indicating that the observed flux density at 7 mm is most likely dominated by thermal dust emission coming from a circumstellar disc. We use available photometric data from the literature to model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of this object from radio to near-ultraviolet frequencies. The observed SED can be understood in terms of an irradiated accretion disc with low mass accretion rate, 10 ^{- 8 } solar masses per year, surrounding a star with an age of ~ 10 Myr. We infer that the mass of the disc is ~ 0. 04 solar masses, and is populated by dust grains that have grown to a maximum size of 1 mm everywhere, consistent with the lack of silicate emission at 10 microns. These features, as well as indications of settling in the wall at the dust <b>destruction</b> <b>radius,</b> led us to speculate the disc of HD 169142 is in an advanced stage of dust evolution, particularly in its inner regions.

40|$|Planetary {{systems are}} born in circumstellar disks around young stellar objects (YSOs) and the disk {{is thought to}} play a major role in the {{evolution}} of planetary systems. A good understanding of disk structure and its time evolution is therefore essential in comprehending planet formation, planet migration and the diversity of planetary systems. In this thesis, I use high angular resolution observations and state-of-the-art radiative transfer modeling to probe circumstellar disk structure and validate current disk models. First, I discuss models and observations of the gas-dust transition region in YSOs. The dust component in circumstellar disks gets truncated at a finite radius from the central star, inside of which it is too hot for dust to survive. The truncated disk forms an ``evaporation front'' whose shape depends sensitively on dust properties. The possibility of using the front as a probe of the dust physics operating in circumstellar disks is explored. The Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy~(CHARA) near-infrared~(near-IR) array is used to resolve out the evaporation front in the Herbig Ae stars MWC 275 and AB Aur, and the presence of an additional near-IR opacity source within the ``conventional'' dust <b>destruction</b> <b>radius</b> is reported. Second, I describe comprehensive disk models that simultaneously explain the spectral energy distribution (from UV to milli-meter) and long-baseline interferometry (from near-IR to mm) of Herbig Ae stars. The models are constrained with a wide range of data drawn from the literature as well as new interferometric observations in the K-band with the CHARA array and in the mid-IR with the novel Keck Segment Tilting Experiment. I show that the mid-IR size of MWC 275 relative to AB~Aur is small, suggesting that dust grains in the outer disk of MWC 275 are significantly more evolved/settled than the grains in the AB~Aur disk. I conclude with a discussion on exciting prospects for measuring the gas-disk morphology on scales of fractions of an AU with the CHARA array, introducing a new powerful tool to understand the ``star-disk connection''...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, several disks with inner holes that are empty of small dust grains have been {{detected}} and are known as transitional disks. Recently, Spitzer has identified {{a new class of}} "pre-transitional disks" with gaps; these objects have an optically thick inner disk separated from an optically thick outer disk by an optically thin disk gap. A near-infrared spectrum provided the first confirmation of a gap in the pre-transitional disk of LkCa 15 by verifying that the near-infrared excess emission in this object was due to an optically thick inner disk. Here we investigate the difference between the nature of the inner regions of transitional and pre-transitional disks using the same veiling-based technique to extract the near-infrared excess emission above the stellar photosphere. We show that the near-infrared excess emission of the previously identified pre-transitional disks of LkCa 15 and UX Tau A in Taurus as well as the newly identified pre-transitional disk of ROX 44 in Ophiuchus can be fit with an inner disk wall located at the dust <b>destruction</b> <b>radius.</b> We also model the broad-band SEDs of these objects, taking into account the effect of shadowing by the inner disk on the outer disk, considering the finite size of the star. The near-infrared excess continua of these three pre-transitional disks, which can be explained by optically thick inner disks, are significantly {{different from that of the}} transitional disks of GM Aur, whose near-infrared excess continuum can be reproduced by emission from sub-micron-sized optically thin dust, and DM Tau, whose near-infrared spectrum is consistent with a disk hole that is relatively free of small dust. The structure of pre-transitional disks may be a sign of young planets forming in these disks and future studies of pre-transitional disks will provide constraints to aid in theoretical modeling of planet formation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{two-dimensional}} structure of protoplanetary disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars is studied. This {{is done by}} constructing a self-consistent model based on 2 -D radiative transfer coupled to the equation of vertical hydrostatics. As a simplifying assumption a grey opacity is used. It is found that the disk can adopt four different structures, dependent on the surface density distribution Sigma(R) {{as a function of}} radius, i. e. on radial- and vertical optical depth of the disk. For the case of high to intermediate vertical optical depth, the temperature and density structures are in agreement with the simple "disk with inner hole" model of Dullemond et al. (2001, henceforth DDN 01). At large radii the disk adopts a flaring shape as expected, and near the dust <b>destruction</b> <b>radius</b> (located at about 0. 5 AU for most Herbig Ae stars) the disk is superheated and puffs up. The region directly behind this "puffed-up inner dust wall" is shadowed, as predicted by DDN 01. For the case of intermediate to low vertical optical depth, but still high radial optical depth, the 2 -D models show that the shadow can cover the entire disk. For such competely self- shadowed disks the inner rim emission in the near infrared constitutes the dominant part of the SED, since the flaring component in the mid-and far infrared is suppressed by the self-shadowing effect. When the disk is optically thin even in radial direction, it becomes unshadowed again because the inner rim can no longer block the stellar light. Such disks have relatively weak infrared excess compared to the stellar flux. Finally, for disks that flare at intermediate radii, but become too optically thin at large radii, the outer parts once again become shadowed. But this time the shadowing is caused by the flaring part of the disk, instead of the inner rim. The disk then consists of a bright inner rim, a shadow, a flaring part and finally a (dim) shadowed outer part. Different observational methods of determining the size of the disk (e. g. from the SED, from continuum mapping or from CO mapping) may yield different results...|$|E
