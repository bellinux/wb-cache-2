50|$|For a long time, it was {{believed}} that <b>kinetin</b> was an artifact produced from the deoxyadenosine residues in DNA, which degrade on standing for long periods or when heated during the isolation procedure. Therefore, it was thought that <b>kinetin</b> does not occur naturally, but, since 1996, it has been shown by several researchers that <b>kinetin</b> exists naturally in the DNA of cells of almost all organisms tested so far, including human and various plants. The mechanism of production of <b>kinetin</b> in DNA is thought to be via the production of furfural — an oxidative damage product of deoxyribose sugar in DNA — and its quenching by the adenine base's converting it into N6-furfuryladenine, <b>kinetin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Kinetin</b> (/'kaɪnɪtɪn/) {{is a type}} of cytokinin, a {{class of}} plant hormone that {{promotes}} cell division. <b>Kinetin</b> was originally isolated by Miller and Skoog et al. as a compound from autoclaved herring sperm DNA that had cell division-promoting activity. It was given the name <b>kinetin</b> because of its ability to induce cell division, provided that auxin was present in the medium. <b>Kinetin</b> is often used in plant tissue culture for inducing formation of callus (in conjunction with auxin) and to regenerate shoot tissues from callus (with lower auxin concentration).|$|E

50|$|In {{plant tissue}} culture IBA and other auxins are used to {{initiate}} root formation in vitro in a procedure called micropropagation. Micropropagation of plants {{is the process of}} using small samples of plants called explants and causing them to undergo growth of differentiated or undifferentiated cells. In connection with cytokinins like <b>kinetin,</b> auxins like IBA can be used to cause the formation of masses of undifferentiated cells called callus. Callus formation is often used as a first step process in micropropagation where the callus cells are then caused to form other tissues such as roots by exposing them to certain hormones like auxins that produce roots. The process of callus to root formation is called indirect organogenesis whereas if roots are formed from the explant directly it is called direct organogenesis.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between <b>kinetin</b> and naphthaleneacetic acid {{in the regulation}} of senescence of excised tissue of mature broccoli leaves {{has been used to}} examine the extent of synchrony between changes in chlorophyll, RNA, and protein. <b>Kinetin</b> increased the net uptake of 14 C-labeled orotic acid and leucine. Naphthaleneacetic acid decreased the effect of <b>kinetin</b> on net uptake after long treatment, but in short-time treatments the auxin increased the effect of <b>kinetin</b> on net uptake. Results of long (24 hr) treatments indicated a general synchrony between the loss of RNA, protein, and chlorophyll. Naphthaleneacetic acid reduced the stabilizing effect of <b>kinetin</b> upon chlorophyll content and upon the content and synthesis of RNA. In short-time experiments, however, RNA content and synthesis were transiently increased by <b>kinetin,</b> and further increased by <b>kinetin</b> plus naphthaleneacetic acid, while chlorophyll content decreased in the presence of <b>kinetin</b> and decreased further in the presence of <b>kinetin</b> plus naphthaleneacetic acid. Actinomycin-D accelerated the loss of chlorophyll, RNA and protein and strongly depressed the rate of RNA synthesis. In the presence of actinomycin-D the stabilizing effect of <b>kinetin</b> upon RNA was substantially reduced. In contrast, the chlorophyll and protein contents remained higher than in the control. Actinomycin-D did not nullify the basal incorporation of orotic acid into RNA, nor did it negate the effect of <b>kinetin</b> upon incorporation. The failure of synchrony between changes in chlorophyll and RNA does not substantiate the proposal that <b>kinetin</b> regulates senescence by a direct effect upon DNA-dependent RNA synthesis...|$|E
