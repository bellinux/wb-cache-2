Antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities of hydroxamic acids are connected with their ability to inhibit various enzymes, viz., matrix metalloproteinases (4, 5), 5 -lipoxygenase (6, 7), urease (8) or ribonucleotid reduc-tase (9). Some ion exchange resins are based on hydroxamic acids (10), and a number of hydroxamic acids are currently accepted therapeutic agents (desferrioxamine B, hydro-xycarbamide, <b>ibuproxam,</b> oxametacin, bufexamac, adrafinil) (11). The promising thera-peutic potential of this class of compounds prompted us to screen antimicrobial activity of several hydroxamic acids previously synthesized by our group (12). In this paper, we report the results of the undertaken antimicrobial evaluation. EXPERIMENTA...|$|E
