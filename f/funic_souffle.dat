5000|$|<b>Funic</b> <b>souffle</b> (funicular souffle, foetal souffle) is a sharp, {{whistling}} {{sound that}} is synchronous with {{the pulse of}} the foetus, usually heard during the second trimester of pregnancy (13-28 weeks). It is heard because of the rush of blood through the umbilical arteries of the foetus, and is therefore synchronous with the foetal pulse. The <b>funic</b> <b>souffle</b> is not heard consistently. On auscultation, <b>funic</b> <b>souffle</b> may often be confused with uterine souffle, which is a soft, blowing sound synchronous with the maternal pulse. Therefore, the maternal pulse must be palpated simultaneously in order to differentiate uterine souffle from <b>funic</b> <b>souffle.</b>|$|E

50|$|Uterine souffle is a soft, blowing sound heard using a stethoscope, {{usually in}} the second {{trimester}} of pregnancy (13-28 weeks). This sound is heard most clearly in {{the lower part of}} the uterus and is synchronous with the pulse of the mother. The uterine souffle is produced by the rush of blood through the dilated vessels of the uterus. On auscultation, uterine souffle may often be confused with <b>funic</b> <b>souffle,</b> which is a sharp, whistling sound that is synchronous with the pulse of the foetus. Therefore, the maternal pulse must be palpated simultaneously in order to confirm uterine souffle. Uterine souffle is considered as a probable objective sign of pregnancy.|$|E
