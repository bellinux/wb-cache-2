40|$|Background Compression paddles {{can move}} during {{mammography}} exposures. Speculation {{suggests that this}} movement can cause image blurring. No research has been published to demonstrate whether such movement could cause image blurring. Aim Develop a method to determine whether paddle movement can cause image blurring Method A Hologic Selenia Dimensions mammography machine calibrated to give compression force in Newtons (N) with 24 × 30 cm fixed and flexible paddles was used. Eleven metal ball-bearings with 1. 50 mm diameter were inserted {{onto the surface of}} a deformable breast phantom. The ball-bearings were placed at various points, from nipple to chest wall. The phantom was compressed using the foot pedal then hand wound to 80 N and also 150 N respectively to represent low and high compression forces used in clinical mammography. Under these conditions, images were created by exposing the phantom/ball-bearings. Image blurring was determined by measuring the change <b>in</b> <b>ball-bearing</b> diameter (distortion) using computer software. Results Ball-bearing diameters increased, illustrating the effect of compression paddle motion on the images. The change <b>in</b> <b>ball-bearing</b> diameter is the highest around the nipple region for both fixed (1. 688 ± 0. 013 mm at 80 N, 1. 694 ± 0. 005 mm at 150 N) and flexible (1. 714 ± 0. 003 mm at 80 N, 1. 661 ± 0. 005 mm at 150 N) paddles. Conclusion The increase <b>in</b> <b>ball-bearing</b> diameter suggests that image blurring due to paddle movement can be identified on images of ball-bearings adhered to the surface of a deformable breast phantom.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of solid or fluid {{lubricants}} <b>in</b> <b>ball-bearings</b> is to separate the balls and races from contacting each other in so-called asperity collisions. Steel to steel contacts lead to microwelds which roughen functional rolling-contacting surfaces and deteriorate the lubricant. By using balls with a ceramic TiC coating, two goals are achieved. First, there are fewer asperity collisions because of the extreme smoothness of the high precision polished TiC coated balls. Second, if collisions do occur, there is practically no microwelding taking place, leaving the surfaces and the lubricant in good condition. Examples are given where the bearing lifetime is increased up to 10 times if the steel balls are replaced by TiC-coated balls...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of new steel grades is largely driven {{by the need to}} produce high quality steel at a competitive price. The principal aims are to attain ultra-high purity, (especially low interstitial elements) and ultra-cleanliness (by the control of the inclusion content and size). Whereas the steel used to build the Titanic contained 650 ppm sulphur, resulting in MnS stringer-inclusions 25 mm in length, modern quality requirements for arctic pipelines would only allow 10 ppm of sulphur and inclusions <b>in</b> <b>ball-bearing</b> steels must be smaller than 5 µm. Most developments are aimed at hot-metal treatment before refining and ladle treatment after decarburisation. Because ferroalloys are added during or after the refining step, it is the secondary (ladle) refining production technologies that are of specific interest to the ferroalloy producer. Through ladle treatment, hydrogen and nitrogen contents are reduced, ultra-low levels of solute impurities are attained and the shapes as well as the composition of inclusions are modified. Steelmakers are concerned about the cost effectiveness of the use of ferroalloys such as consistent product analysis and delivery, improved financing arrangements and technical support.

40|$|The injhence {{of surface}} {{roughness}} and third-body particulates on tribological contacts will be reviewed in general, but in particular their injuence on rolling contacts and contacts where rolling and sliding occur simultaneously {{will be considered}} in some detail. Such non-conformiag contacts are {{often referred to as}} Hertzian, and when lubricated are often considered to be protected by an elastohydrodynamic [EHD) lubricant film. Transferring these concepts to the loaded interjiaces of real engineering components such as gears, rolling bearings, constant-velocity joints and cams, etc., can have serious shortcomings and lead engineers to many miscon-ceptions.

40|$|Aero-engines {{have high}} speed rotors {{carrying}} multi-stage turbine and compressor discs. Such systems need continuous monitoring during the operating regime. These rotors are mounted on ball bearings supported with squeeze film dampers {{and connected to}} stator casings. The motions of bearings and rotor are influenced by each other and therefore such a system requires structural dynamic studies. These rotors involve several nonlinear factors including contact forces, varying compliance vibration of ball bearing, nonlinear oil-film force of squeeze film damper etc Solving such nonlinear dynamic problems using the traditional transfer matrix method, modal synthesis approach, finite element method or impedance coupling technique is therefore a challenging task. Present work focuses on modelling of rotors using ball bearing nonlinearities along with nonlinear secondary transient excitations using finite element modelling. In order to validate the finite element model, preliminary dynamic analysis is carried out using linear spring-damper bearing elements. Results are illustrated both for LP rotor model and twin-spool rotor. Initially, the natural frequencies obtained from the computer program based on Timoshenko beam elements are validated with ANSYS results. Further, the results are also validated with those obtained from impact hammer tests on a scaled dual disk rotor-bearing system. To utilize this finite element model, the time and frequency-domain response studies are conducted with double-row ball bearing forces, rub-impact forces, Muszynska’s gas transients along with squeeze-film forces. In all the cases, differences from simple rotor supported by single-row ball bearings with only unbalance excitations have been reported. Using the fundamental frequency and its amplitude, an inverse modelling approach is applied to predict the parameters of rotor bearing system such as increased bearing clearance, changes in disc unbalances and the centralizing spring constants in squeeze-film damper. In this regard, a trained model of 3 -layer perceptron neural network model is employed. In the second study, changes in dynamic response due to waviness and race-way defects <b>in</b> <b>ball-bearings</b> are first studied using modified contact force relations. Using this data, type of bearing fault is estimated from the statistical parameters of the time-domain signal by training an unsupervised Kohenen’s neural network model. Here, the simulated data is collected from the rotor over an operating speed range. In the third study, the additional stiffness of rotor due to rub-impact forces is identified from optimization modelling. Such identification of rotor stiffening effect using finite element modelling is a new concept. Two types of control studies are proposed to minimize the amplitudes of rotor during the critical operating conditions. Semi active electromagnetic damper design helps in reducing vibration amplitudes of the LP rotor over a frequency range of interest. Here, the damper comprises of an electro-magnet and a spring. The required current and spring stiffness are identified from the basic relations {{and the results of}} control are illustrated with a two-disc LP rotor model. In active controller design, an electromagnetic actuator model is employed. The nominal gap maintained between the rotor and actuator coils is used in computing the actuator force. A proportional derivative (PD) control strategy is used to estimate the required forces. A neural network based alternate control scheme also proposed to compute the required actuator forces. In overall, the work focussed on the dynamic analysis of dual disc rotor model subjected to parametric nonlinear bearing loads under the action of various external forces and some controller design aspects applicable to this rotor. ...|$|R

40|$|Concrete-related {{construction}} industry consumes {{considerable amount of}} energy, resulting in large CO 2 release into the atmosphere. Cement which is used as the main binder in concrete is energy intensive to produce and contributes about 7 % to total global anthropogenic carbon emission. Infrastructure across the globe suffers from durability problems and requires frequent repair and maintenance. This brings about high direct cost for rehabilitation and unaccounted indirect cost resulted from loss of productive time, traffic congestion and diversion, {{and in the process}} more CO 2 emission. In the meantime, buildings which are part of the overall civil infrastructure system require extensive amount of energy to keep the internal environment comfortable to users. The sector accounts for about 40 % of global primary energy consumption. With increasing population and demand, actions from various building disciplines are needed to build a more sustainable industry. This research addresses these issues through {{the development of a new}} high performance fiber-reinforced concrete, its durability studies and its application to reduce operational energy in buildings. Durability is critical for infrastructure systems whose frequent maintenance and rehabilitation pose adverse impacts to the environment and add considerable costs to the economy. By accounting for sustainability aspects from materials conception to usage and disposal, this study encompasses the concept of sustainability through life cycle consideration. This represents a deviation from conventional sustainable approach where a focus is usually spent on reducing embodied energy of concrete composites. The first area of focus was on the development of a new concrete composite called high performance green hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete (HP-G-HyFRC) reinforced with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) micro- and hooked-end steel macrofibers. For easy construction and durability, the design criteria were defined to cover high workability, high strength and deflection hardening which is defined as an ability of the composite to carry increasing load after the first crack is formed. It was demonstrated that theoretical analysis could be used to limit the number of trials in determining the critical fiber volume fractions for the deflection hardening behavior in the composite. As compared to conventional self-consolidating concrete (SCC), fine aggregate over coarse aggregate ratio had to be increased in FRC for enhanced workability. Addition of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in concrete especially fly ash helped to improve the composite’s workability. This is attributed to fly ash’s favorable fineness, size distribution and spherical shape which resulted <b>in</b> <b>ball-bearing</b> action provided to other concrete constituents. PVA microfibers controlled propagation of micro cracks inherent in concrete or formed during loading. They also provided toughening around steel fibers and ensured a gradual pullout of steel fibers. The synergy of PVA micro- and steel macrofibers led to a smooth deflection hardening behavior of the composite under flexure at a relatively low fiber volume fractions of 1. 5 % steel fibers and 0. 15 % PVA fibers. A study on corrosion performance of HP-G-HyFRC with accelerated corrosion test with an impressed current was then conducted. It was found that wide cracks ranging from 1. 1 to 2 mm were observed in high performance concrete (HPC) without fibers. The presence of hybrid fibers in HP-G-HyFRC, on the other hand, reduced corrosion rates by half, attributable to crack bridging of fibers and the resulting formation of distributed cracks of small sizes. Also, under no applied current, all embedded steel rebars in HP-G-HyFRC were in the inactive corrosion zone even with the presence of 4 % NaCl in the mixing water. Microscopic observation at steel-concrete interface showed a densification of corrosion products, which is postulated to limit iron dissolution and subsequently to reduce corrosion rates of the embedded bars. HP-G-HyFRC corrosion samples were also able to retain most of its strength after the accelerated corrosion tests. As corrosion resistance of HP-G-HyFRC was considered at a composite level, the effects of individual mix component such as slag and fibers on corrosion were yet unknown. The next area of focus was on the influence of high-volume slag as cement replacement, hybrid fibers and steel-concrete interface on corrosion of steel in concrete. The studies elaborated various phenomena observed in the corrosion study of HP-G-HyFRC and also provided a fundamental understanding of different concrete parameters on corrosion. It was found that due to shrinkage-induced cracking and possibly poor quality passive film due to the presence of reducing agents in concrete pore solutions, samples with 60 % slag replacement and with no fiber reinforcement showed an early corrosion initiation and higher mass loss induced by the impressed current. Microstructural imaging showed that the samples with slag, despite having a higher gas permeability, showed a denser matrix but more continuous distributed microcracking in the matrix. This led to its poor ability to accommodate corrosion products at the interface and as a result the concrete experienced an early onset of cracking. Under the same regime of applied current, samples made of slag concrete also experienced higher gravimetric mass losses. This is attributed to a less stable passive film and more intense acidification at the interface due to a reduction in calcium hydroxide (CH) in the matrix. Also, an inclusion of hybrid fibers in concrete slightly increased concrete permeability although this did not adversely affect corrosion initiation performance of concrete. However, under propagation stage achieved by an induced current, hybrid fibers in concrete significantly reduced corrosion rates through confinement and densification of corrosion products at steel-concrete interface. The influence of interface qualities on corrosion of steel in concrete showed conflicting performance in corrosion initiation and propagation stages. It was found that higher porosity at the steel-concrete interface initiated an early corrosion. However, the porous interface could accommodate more corrosion products. This led to a smaller pressure buildup from the corrosion products and less damage to the surrounding concrete. As a result, smaller corrosion rates were observed in the samples with more porous interfaces after impressed current regimes. The finding helps to explain the more extensive damage in high performance concrete (HPC) as compared to normal strength concrete. This warrants the inclusion of fibers in HPC to extend the service life of structures constructed with the composite. The study ended with a proposed application of HP-G-HyFRC in an innovative double skin façade (DSF) system in place of a conventional solid façade system to enhance operational energy performance of buildings. It was found that although the DSF is more energy intensive and more costly to construct, it allowed for a full recovery of the additional embodied energy within the first year of operation and cost recovery within the first 6 years of operation. The overall study exemplifies a life-cycle consideration adopted for materials design, durability investigation and application to ensure more sustainable infrastructure and buildings for our society...|$|R

Objectives: The aims of {{this pilot}} study were to {{quantify}} respiratory and potential dermal exposure of nail technicians to acetone, formaldehyde, ethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, toluene and xylene. Fifteen female nail technicians, working in different salons {{participated in this}} study. Products used for nail treatments differed between salons. Most salons used acrylate based nail products whereas others used UV–gel products exclusively. Methods: The participants {{were divided into two}} groups, those who used acrylate– and those who used UV–gel products exclusively. Eight hour personal respiration exposure to acetone, formaldehyde, ethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, toluene and xylene were determined. The concentration of airborne volatile organic compounds in the salons was also determined {{with the use of a}} direct reading instrument (EntryRAE). Potential dermal exposure to the above mentioned solvents (excluding formaldehyde) was determined with the use of charcoal pads (surrogate skin method). During respiratory and dermal sampling, observations were made regarding work practices and control measures used in the salons. Results: It was found that the eight hour time weighed average exposure is well below the recommended occupational exposure limits of the individual chemicals and showed no additive effect. The highest mean respiratory exposures in both groups were acetone (27. 22 mg/m 3 and 28. 36 mg/m 3). EntryRAE results showed peak periods of exposure to volatile organic compounds during the day (322. 16 ppm) that were much higher than the average eight hour exposure (0. 21 ppm). The two groups’ exposure levels were compared to determine if there is a significant difference between the exposures levels but no statistically significant difference was found. The dermal exposures on hand and neck to acetone, ethyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate showed strong significant correlations to the concordant chemical’s respiratory exposures. Correlations between air and dermal exposure was calculated once more after adjusting dermal exposure but the findings indicated only one statistically significant correlation of 0. 42 in the case of ethyl methacrylate. Conclusion: Nail technicians are not at immediate health risk as the exposure in nail salons are well below recommended occupational exposure limits. However the unknown effects of chronic low level exposure to solvents and the large number of previous studies that reported increased health risks in nail technicians must also be considered. The use of methyl methacrylate in nail products sold in South Africa is also worrying as methyl methacrylate is banned by the FDA in the US due to its skin sensitisation potential that may lead to allergic contact dermatitis. The methods used to determine potential dermal exposure as well as adjusted dermal exposure remains problematic. This is due to the high percentage of adjusted dermal exposure values that had to be estimated and the fact that the activated charcoal pads have a higher absorption potential than human skin. Both methods must be improved to increase accuracy of results. Observations and EntryRAE results demonstrated the irregular nature of a nail technician’s work shift as well tasks performed from day to day. This complicates gathering data that is representative of a nail technicians eight hour exposure. Therefore to further improve accuracy of results, sampling should in future be task specific. Conventional <b>ball–bearings</b> <b>in</b> rotational applications can potentially be replaced by active magnetic bearings (AMBs). AMBs levitate the rotor via contact–free, actively controlled, electromagnetic forces. At the North–West University, AMBs are applied to a flywheel unin–terrupted power supply (Fly–UPS) system. Regrettably, AMBs are inherently open–loop un–stable because of the inverse displacement–force relationship, and for this reason requires closed–loop feedback control. Thus, the feasibility of multivariable H control for a Fly–UPS system is investigated. At present, the Fly–UPS system is being controlled by a number of decentralized single–input single–output (SISO), PD controllers. Ultimately, the combination of a multivariable plant, inherent instability, model uncertainties, cross–coupled stiffness, high rotational speed as well as external disturbances, calls for the development of a multivariable robust H controller. The aim of H control is to compute a controller such that the modelling uncertainties, noise and disturbances are minimized according to predefined performance and robustness re–quirements. A state–space model of both the radial AMBs and the axial AMB of the Fly–UPS system is developed and modelled according to the parameters of the physical rotor system. The sen–sors, power amplifiers and anti–aliasing filters are modelled and cascaded onto the rotor model. Finally, the system response is evaluated whereby the developed multivariable model is verified and validated. In the context of robust H control, it is vital in specifying the uncertainty bound (difference weighting function) between the mathematical model and physical system in order to ascer–tain stability robustness. Thus, the additive uncertainties between the nominal simulation model and the physical model at varied rotational speeds are characterised. Furthermore, the mixed sensitivity H control synthesis strategy is described. Different weighting schemes are explained and the six block problem weighting scheme is used for H controller synthesis. A multivariable controller is synthesised with weighting functions relevant to the AMB Fly–UPS system and the controller is reduced to a 19 th order controller for implementation. Master...|$|R
