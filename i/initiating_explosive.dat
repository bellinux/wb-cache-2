For good efficiency, based on the ideas that directional sampling reduces dimensionality and importance sampling focuses on the domain contributing to failure probability, the joint probability density function of importance sampling is constructed, and the sampling center is moved to MPP to ensure that more random sample points draw belong to the failure domain and the simulation efficiency is improved.

40|$|Intense {{rainfall}} over active volcanoes {{is known}} to trigger dangerous volcanic hazards, from remobilizing loose volcanic surface material into lahars or mudflows to <b>initiating</b> <b>explosive</b> activity including pyroclastic flows at certain dome-forming volcanoes. However, {{the effect of the}} heated volcanic surface on the atmospheric circulation, including any feedback with precipitation, is unknown. This is investigated here, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The recent activity at the Soufrière Hills Volcano (SHV), Montserrat, is a well-documented case of such rainfall–volcano interaction and is used as a template for these experiments. The volcano is represented in the model by an idealized Gaussian mountain, with an imposed realistic surface temperature anomaly on the volcano summit. A robust increase in precipitation over the volcano is simulated for surface temperature anomalies above approximately 40 °C, an area-average value that is exceeded at the SHV. For wind speeds less than 4 m s− 1 and a range of realistic atmospheric conditions, the precipitation increase is well above the threshold required to trigger volcanic hazards (5 – 10 mm h− 1). Hence, the thermal atmospheric forcing due to an active, but nonerupting, volcano appears to be an important factor in rainfall–volcano interactions and should be taken account of in future hazard studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of hot spots {{is an essential}} {{step in the process}} of <b>initiating</b> <b>explosive</b> crystals by shock or impact. Consequently, any attempt to understand the initiation of explosive crystals must first establish how the energy of the shock or impact is localized to form hot spots. More generally, it appears that energy localization occurs in all crystalline solids, both inert and energetic, when they are subjected to shock or impact induced plastic deformation. This paper is in part a review of our current research to understand the process of energy localization on a microscopic level by examining the energy dissipated by moving dislocations. Dislocation generation and motion are the fundamental mechanism of plastic deformation. The energy dissipated in the phonon field generated by moving dislocations is determined and shown to be both localized and intense. Energy dissipation rates are calculated for mild shocks and impacts. For high level shocks it is shown that direct pumping of the interna 1 energy levels of the molecules near the dislocation core is possible which can produce rapid molecular dissociation. The generation of shear bands is modelled. These shear bands are formed by the accumulation of many dislocations in small regions of intense shear in the crystal and are taken to be the macroscopic sites of the hot spots...|$|E

50|$|Organic {{peroxides}} are {{organic compounds}} containing the peroxide functional group (ROOR′). If the R′ is hydrogen, the compounds are called organic hydroperoxides. Peresters have general structure RC(O)OOR. The O−O bond easily breaks, producing free radicals {{of the form}} RO•. Thus, organic peroxides are useful as initiators for some types of polymerisation, such as the epoxy resins used in glass-reinforced plastics. MEKP and benzoyl peroxide are commonly used for this purpose. However, the same property also means that organic peroxides can either intentionally or unintentionally <b>initiate</b> <b>explosive</b> polymerisation in materials with unsaturated chemical bonds, and this process {{has been used in}} explosives.

40|$|Atmospheric flow over {{orography}} is {{a classic}} research area, while the atmospheric response to surface heating has become a focus more recently {{in the context of}} solar heating and forest fires. Here, for the first time, these forcing mechanisms are superposed to examine atmospheric flow over a mountain with a heated summit, i. e. an active volcano. Intense rainfall over active volcanoes is known to trigger dangerous volcanic hazards, from remobilising loose surface material into lahars or mudflows, to <b>initiating</b> <b>explosive</b> activity such as pyroclastic flows. The effect of a heated volcanic surface on the atmospheric circulation is investigated here – including examining the triggering of precipitation over the volcano. Recent activity at the Soufri`ere Hills Volcano (SHV), Montserrat, Eastern Caribbean, is a well-documented example of such rainfall–volcano interactions. Hence, Montserrat is used as a template for the experiments, although the experimental setup is general so the results will have applicability for other tropical island volcanoes. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric model has been used for the study, run in an idealised configuration with horizontal grid sizes down to 100 m. Initially, the effect of the heated surface is studied through idealised simulations over a Gaussian mountain with an imposed surface temperature anomaly on the volcano summit. Subsequently, a digital elevation model (DEM) of Montserrat is used to study the effects over this specific island. The atmospheric structure in most simulations is that of a typical tropical setting – easterly TradeWinds, capped by a temperature inversion. In these cases, localised convection triggered by the heat source can overcome convective inhibition and force deep convection, if there is sufficient convective available potential energy. A significant increase in precipitation over the volcano covering a 4 km 2 area is consistently simulated for surface temperature anomalies above 40 �C, an area-average value that is exceeded at the SHV. For a range of realistic atmospheric conditions, covering up to 18...|$|E

50|$|Many organic {{peroxides}} can <b>initiate</b> <b>explosive</b> polymerization in materials with unsaturated chemical bonds, and specifically triacetone triperoxide (TATP) and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) are powerful explosives. TATP is an inexpensive compound and {{is relatively easy}} to make.

For this reason, it is an explosive favored by terrorists. TATP and HMTD were used in several executed or planned terrorist acts of the early 2000s, most notably in the 2001 shoe bomb plot and the 2005 London Underground bombings. Several detection devices have been designed since those events. One, for example, releases a chemical mixture which changes color when interacting with traces of TATP.|$|R

5000|$|Organic {{peroxides}} can accidentally <b>initiate</b> <b>explosive</b> polymerization {{in materials}} with unsaturated chemical bonds. Most notably, TATP and HMTD are high explosives, and TATP, {{because of its}} high susceptibility to accidental detonation by shock, friction, or sparks, has earned the nickname [...] "Mother of Satan" [...] among certain Islamic militant groups. TATP can accidentally form as by-products in many commonly used reactions. These reactions range from synthesis of MDMA, where TATP is formed via isosafrole oxidation in acetone, to industrial production of phenol, where the second product of the cumene process, acetone, is partially oxidized to peroxide on the second reaction step. Accidental preparation of organic peroxides can occur by mixing ketone solvents (most commonly acetone) with waste materials containing hydrogen peroxide or other oxidizers and leaving the mixture standing for several hours. In addition, many liquid ethers {{in the presence of}} air, light and metals (which act as catalysts) slowly - over a period of months - form highly unstable ether peroxides such as diethyl ether peroxide. Therefore, ethers are often stored over potassium hydroxide, which not only destroys peroxides but also acts as a powerful desiccant.|$|R
