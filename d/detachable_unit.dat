40|$|There are {{numerous}} constraints that visually challenged people face in independent mobility and navigation. They primarily use the white cane as a mobility aid {{allowing them to}} detect close by obstacles on the ground. The detection of objects above knee height is almost impossible and is a major hindrance for them. In this work, we have reported the design and implementation of a <b>detachable</b> <b>unit</b> which acts to augment the functionality of the existing white cane, to allow knee-above obstacle detection. This unit consists of an ultrasonic ranger and a vibrator controlled by an eight bit microcontroller to offer an increased detection range of three meters. The distance information is conveyed to the user through non-interfering multi-frequency vibratory stimuli, the frequency of vibration indicating the proximity of obstacles. This unit is also capable of detecting fast moving obstacles. Considerable effort has gone into the electromechanical design of this unit conveying the vibrations effectively and ensuring that it is easily attachable on the existing white cane without sighted assistance. A crucial design optimization goal was cost – the unit has been developed as a ” low cost ” device which is affordable by the poor in developing countries. ...|$|E

50|$|Video cameras {{originally}} designed for television broadcast were large and heavy, mounted on special pedestals and wired to remote recorders in separate rooms. As technology improved, out-of-studio video recording was possible with compact video cameras and portable video recorders; a <b>detachable</b> recording <b>unit</b> could be carried to a shooting location. Although the camera itself was compact, {{the need for}} a separate recorder made on-location shooting a two-person job. Specialized videocassette recorders were introduced by JVC (VHS) and Sony (U-matic, with Betamax) releasing a model for mobile work. Portable recorders meant that recorded video footage could be aired on the early-evening news, since it was no longer necessary to develop film.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we have {{proposed}} a methodology to develop an amperometric biosensor {{for the analysis of}} glucose concentration using a simple microcontroller based data acquisition system. The work involves the development of <b>Detachable</b> Membrane <b>Unit</b> (enzyme based biomembrane) with immobilized glucose oxidase on the membrane and interfacing the same to the signal conditioning system. The current generated by the biosensor for different glucose concentrations was signal conditioned, then acquired and computed by a simple AT 89 C 51 -microcontroller. The optimum operating parameters for the better performance were found and reported. The detailed performance evaluation of the biosensor has been carried out. The proposed microcontroller based biosensor system has the sensitivity of 0. 04 V/g/dl, with a resolution of 50 mg/dl. It has exhibited very good inter day stability observed up to 30 days. Comparing to the reference method such as HPLC, the accuracy of the proposed biosensor system is well within ± 1. 5 %. The system can be used for real time analysis of glucose concentration in the field such as, food and fermentation and clinical (In-Vitro) applications...|$|R
5000|$|These were {{followed}} by fifteen more railmotors for the L&SWR system. The first two were built in 1904, the engines at Nine Elms and the carriages at Eastleigh. Two feet (600 mm) shorter than the earlier cars, these seated eight in first class and thirty-two in third. Thirteen more were built in 1905-6 to slightly different design and with the boiler pressure increased from [...] to [...] Engines and carriages were not <b>detachable</b> and these <b>units</b> were capable of towing an additional carriage.

40|$|Abstract. This paper reports {{our efforts}} to develop an {{integrated}} system for telesurgery of the throat and upper airway. The system is described while focusing on the novel design of its slave robot. The slave robot is a 3 -armed robot that implements novel Distal Dexterity Units (DDU’s). These DDU’s are dexterous robots for surgical tool manipulation and suturing in confined spaces. Each DDU is composed from a Snake-Like Unit (SLU) and a <b>detachable</b> Parallel Manipulation <b>unit</b> (PMU). The proposed design of the DDU’s provides an enhanced downsize scalability and distal dexterity that are crucial for medical applications such as laryngeal surgery where simultaneous manipulation of 2 - 3 long tools through a narrow laryngeoscope is required. The paper presents the design of these units and the experimentation results with a 4. 2 mm diameter SLU {{to be used for}} constructing the first DDU for the 3 -armed slave robot. ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was one of}} four concept {{vehicles}} {{produced by}} the company in the five-month period following the appointment of Olivier Boulay as its head of design in 2001, after DaimlerChrysler's purchase of a controlling interest in Mitsubishi Motors. Boulay, the General Manager of DCX's Advanced Design Studio in Yokohama, was seconded to MMC, and immediately began creating a strong image for their cars through a common [...] "face" [...] seen on all the concepts, in the curvature of the lower edge of the grille, {{the size and shape of}} the badge and the sharp crease rising up the leading edge of the bonnet. More radical styling concepts included the thick wraparound tubeline encircling the body which also housed the front and rear lamp <b>units,</b> <b>detachable,</b> semi-transparent body panels in the doors, and seatback-mounted backpacks. The hardtop's large louvred sunroof was replaced by a convertible top and hideaway rear glass in the cabriolet.|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} for dc (average) voltage power supply for the functionality of consumer electronics {{has made the}} study of rectifier circuits a very popular topic in analog electronics course. DC power pact (unit) could be inbuilt with the electronic appliances as seen in desktop computers and some heavy telecom equipment or they could be separate, <b>detachable</b> (plug in) <b>unit</b> as seen in laptops, cell phones, iPads and tablets. In this class project, we designed and constructed a 12 V, dc regulated, bridge rectifier. Bridge rectifier is chosen over half‐wave rectifier or full‐wave center‐tap because of its many advantages over the two. The displayed results include the transformer step‐down voltage waveform, the unfiltered and capacitor‐filtered dc rectified waveforms and the ripple voltage waveform. The 146 mV peak‐to‐peak ripple voltage obtained accounted for less than 2 percent of the 12 V rectified dc voltage and it matches the theoretical values computed. This qualifies the dc power supply we constructed as an ideal candidate for powering laptops and other related electronic equipment...|$|R
