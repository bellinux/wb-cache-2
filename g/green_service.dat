Compared to green goods, little attention is paid to <b>green</b> <b>services,</b> although services are an essential part of developed countries' economies. <b>Green</b> <b>services</b> in the Czech Republic stand at the starting point of breakthrough. Until the present comprehensive marketing information about this area has been absent. The aim of this thesis is to fill the gap in information by setting up a framework for strategic marketing planning of <b>green</b> <b>services</b> in the Czech Republic. The information needed has been collected from other markets' data, an interview with an insider and a consumer survey. The data obtained has been used in the various steps of <b>green</b> <b>services</b> strategic marketing framework in Czech circumstances...|$|R

40|$|Green Care is an {{international}} concept, where utilization of agricultural farms is a base for promoting human mental and physical health, as well as {{quality of life for}} a variety of client groups. The {{purpose of this study was}} to improve knowledge and understanding of opportunities and difficulties faced by providers of <b>Green</b> Care <b>services,</b> and to discuss the role of being a <b>Green</b> Care <b>service</b> provider. Data were collected by three qualitative multi-stage focus group interviews with seven providers of <b>Green</b> Care <b>services</b> (five women, two men). The findings indicated that running <b>Green</b> Care <b>services</b> means different kinds of challenges such as low predictability and complicated cooperation with authorities and stakeholders. Efforts toward increased quality assurance are regarded positive. Being a <b>Green</b> Care <b>service</b> provider means that the farmer’s function is extended, that is, by shaping a therapeutic environment and being a role model, which takes a genuine interest and belief in the idea of Green Care, and ability to think creatively and innovatively. To watch the users grow as persons and master new tasks is rewarding to the service provider. Providers of <b>Green</b> Care <b>Services</b> have to face different and sometimes incompatible social worlds. Their role is sometimes indistinct and they find themselves in a border position. Perhaps some of the potential in Green Care will get lost with a more professionalized provider role...|$|R

30|$|The above three {{equations}} may {{be interpreted}} as characteristics availability functions which convert commodities into attributes. In the framework of this paper, any good j can be recognized as (x_j,q_j 1,...,q_jC+G) and any <b>greening</b> <b>service</b> ℓ can be represented as (V_ℓ,q_ℓ C+ 1,...,q_ℓ C+G,q_ℓ C+G+ 1,...,q_ℓ C+G+S). The amount of any characteristic associated with each good and service {{can be regarded as}} a parameter that is objective and common to all consumers, i.e., it has the public-good property. Thus, the inhabitants as consumers must behave as “price and quality takers,” since they can only change their consumption of z_ic, z_ih, and z_ig, via the choice of x_ij and V_iℓ, given the price and the quality of each good and service. Producers and gardeners can choose the composition of attributes embedded in their goods and their <b>greening</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
