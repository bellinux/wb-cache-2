5|$|McEwan {{wanted to}} write a novel dealing with the social turmoil of the 1970s, and Sweet Tooth <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large extent based on his own life. The story explores the {{relationship}} between artistic integrity and government propaganda, and addresses competing approaches to literature; the boundary between reality and fiction is tested throughout. The novel is dedicated to McEwan's late friend Christopher Hitchens. He is not referred to directly in the book, but he did play a part as the host of a real-life literary event fictionalised in the book, involving McEwan and Martin Amis, who does appear in the story. Critical reception was mixed; some reviewers found the novel moving and poignant, while others saw it as weaker than much of McEwan's previous work.|$|E

25|$|The {{coral reef}} {{community}} at the Houtman Abrolhos {{is unusual in}} having tropical coral growing alongside and in direct competition with, temperate seaweed. As {{a result of this}} competition for light, space and nutrients, coral at the Houtman Abrolhos tends to grow more slowly and die younger than is usual. Reef production <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large extent due to the production of carbon by coralline algae rather than by coral.|$|E

25|$|In Old Japanese, the {{particles}} ga and no had overlapping functions as genitive and nominative markers, and were ultimately distinguished by {{their degree of}} politeness. Satsugū, like other Western Kyūshū and Ryukyuan dialects, is notable in that this original distinction <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> certain extent, kept. Thus, the particle ga is considered somewhat more derogatory and occurs mainly with a human subject or possessor, whereas no (or n) is considered more neutral or polite.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of {{suburban}} development in the mid-twentieth century, the built-up area of Beeston is now contiguous with the former villages of Chilwell to the west, and Wollaton and Lenton Abbey to the north. Beeston <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> degree separated from Bramcote to the northwest by the Beeston Fields Golf Course. The Broxtowe-City of Nottingham border runs immediately {{to the east of}} the town and essentially forms the town's eastern edge.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{diagnostic}} technique is with appropriate X-rays and hip scoring tests. These {{should be done}} at an appropriate age, and perhaps repeated at adulthood - if done too young they will not show anything. Since the condition <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large degree inherited, the hip scores of parents should be professionally checked before buying a pup, and the hip scores of dogs should be checked before relying upon them for breeding. Despite {{the fact that the}} condition is inherited, it can occasionally arise even to animals with impeccably hip scored parents.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} Aredvi Sura Anahita <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> degree blurred {{with that of}} Ashi, the Gathic figure of Good Fortune, {{and many of the}} verses of the Aban Yasht also appear in Yasht 17 (Ard Yasht), which is {{dedicated}} to Ashi. So also a description of the weapons bestowed upon worshippers (5.130), and the superiority in battle (5.34 et al.). These functions appears out of place in a hymn to the waters, and may have originally been from Yasht 17.|$|E
25|$|The English-based orthography {{commonly}} used in North America <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> degree, an accommodation of the Pan-Vlax orthography to English-language keyboards, replacing those graphemes with diacritics with digraphs, such as the substitution of ts ch sh zh for c č š ž. This particular orthography seems to have arisen spontaneously as Romani speakers have communicated using email, a medium in which graphemes outside the Latin-1 charset have until recently been difficult to type. In addition, it is this orthography which is recommended for use by Romani scholar and activist Ronald Lee.|$|E
25|$|A red {{and white}} bar {{across the bottom of}} the screen {{indicates}} battle advantage. Where the {{red and white}} portions of the bar meet indicates which duelist has the advantage. The closer the meeting point <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> duelist, the worse they are doing. When the player properly performs a blocking move, or strikes the enemy, the bar shifts towards the opponent, indicating that he has lost advantage. The duelist with more advantage can attack faster, while the duelist with less advantage attacks slower. Also, a failed attack has the chance of disorienting the attacker, causing them to become even slower for a short time.|$|E
