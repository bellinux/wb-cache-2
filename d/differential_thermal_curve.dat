40|$|SUMMARY. The {{constituent}} manganese minerals of an {{ore body}} {{located at the}} Lecht mines near Tomintoul include cryptomelane and lithiophorite. The latter, now known to occur extensively in softs, was characterized by X-ray, thermal, and electron microscope t chniques. Lithiophorite yields a distinctive <b>differential</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>curve</b> and this was studied in some detail. A platy morphology is revealed under the electron microscope and from selected-area electron diffraction patterns it was con-cluded that the b parameter of the mineral is 8 " 73 /~, three times the value determined by Wadsley (1952). As suggested byWadsley, this could arise from the distribution oflithium ions. Chemical nalysis shows that the Lecht lithiophorite is slightly unusual in {{that it has a}} high iron and zinc content but is relatively ow in cobalt. The associated cryptomelane contains asignificant amount of thallium. LITHIOPHORITE was first recognized as an individual mineral species by Ramsdell (I 932), whose conclusions were subsequently confirmed by Fleischer and Richmond (1943). From single crystal studies Wadsley (1952) determined the structure of the mineral and suggested the formula (A 1,Li) MnO 2 (OH) 2.

40|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>thermal</b> analysis, using {{conventional}} equipment, {{has been}} used to differentiate between ranks of coal. Five distinct <b>thermal</b> <b>curve</b> types are recognized, based upon physical, chemical, and structural changes in coals of different ranks. Classification of curve type is based principally upon the number and temperature of endothermic devolatilization thermal peaks. Natural rank boundaries, where curve types change, occur between recta-anthracite and anthracite, semi-anthracite and low-volatile bitumi-nous, medium-volatile bituminous and high-volatile bituminous, and high-volatile bituminous and subbituminous.

The clay fraction of these soils had previously been identified as predominantly interlayered illite-montmorillonite minerals. The < 2 micron clay fraction varied from 7. 4 to 37. 0 percent. The <b>thermal</b> <b>curves</b> howed characteristic exothermic organic reactions in the treated soils and relationships were found between the thermal reactions, the percent aniline-furfural, and the percent clay. Double peaks were observed on the curves of all soils containing 2 percent or more of aniline-furfural. The area under the organic double peaks was found to be a function of the percent aniline-furfural. The double peak is believed to be caused by initial burning of readily available aniline-furfural followed by final burning of the remaining aniline-fur-rural. The release of the resin responsible for the second peak may be due to a breakdown of the clay crystal structure at about 550 ~ C. This indicates a close association of the resin and the clay minerals. The foregoing statement is further strengthened bya linear correla-tion of distance between peaks and the amount of clay present. Higher aniline-furfural contents increase the area under the second peak; this increase indicates that a larger amount of the resin is being utilized in cementation of grains and is reflected by the mechanical strength of stabilized soil specimens...|$|R

From the standpoint of octahedral-tetrahedral charge relationships, beidellites and "itliles " should be more similar than montmorillonites and "illites.

X-ray diffraction can be used to positively identify chlorite in a soil clay, (a) by careful analysis of reflections at least as great as 14 A, and (b) by the influence heat treatment (550 ~ C for 30 minutes) has on the X-ray pattern.

Towards this end attention has been focussed on X-ray diffraction patterns, micro-hardness analysis, a study of various optical properties and <b>differential</b> <b>thermal</b> analysis characteristics. X-ray diffraction patterns using Cr(Ka) radiation have been established for some twenty mineral species and provide the most satisfactory means of recognising the constituents of fine grained mineral intergrowths. The applications and limitations of micro-hardness testing are reviewed and hardness values given for the minerals studied. Attention {{has been paid to the}} variation of hardness with applied load and crystal orientation and hardness values given in selected cases. Reflectivity values for white light and for eight wavelengths within the visible spectrum are given for both air and oil. Refractive and absorption indices as determined by the method of Cambon (1949) are quoted, the latter corresponding very well with values determined by classical methods. <b>Differential</b> <b>thermal</b> analysis <b>curves</b> are given for the majority of the minerals, including all the more important forms, and such provide a satisfactory means of distinguishing the main mineral groups...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} and characterization of Mn doped ZnO nanocrystals, {{both in the}} free standing and PVP capped particle forms. The nanocrystals size could be controlled by capping them with polyvinylpyrollidone and was estimated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The chemical compositions of the products were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that the capping of ZnO leads to blue shift due to quantum confinement effect. The morphology of the particles was evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Both the Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and <b>Differential</b> <b>Thermal</b> Analysis (DTA) <b>curves</b> of the ZnO show no further weight loss and thermal effect at a temperature above 510  °C...|$|R
