40|$|The present paper {{describes}} the experimental activity {{carried out to}} evaluate the effectiveness of the CFD-based shape optimisation of several components of a common helicopter platform of the heavy-weight class. The considered geometry is basically the same of the model tested in the frame of thÃ¨ <b>GO</b> <b>AHE</b> AD project. The comprehensive wind tunnel campaign includes both the original helicopter configuration and the optimised version to assess the optimisation effectiveness by comparison. The optimised components included different hub-cap configurations, a set of fairings for the blade-stubs attachments and the sponsons. Moreover, the effects on drag reduction produced by an array of vortex generators positioned on the back-ramp were investigated. Different measurement techniques were employed as loads and moments measurements, steady and unsteady pressure surveys and stereo particle image vclocimetry. The performed measurements confirm a overall drag reduction of about 6 % at cruise attitude for the optimised configuration...|$|E
