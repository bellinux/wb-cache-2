Class 1 competitors could compete in the 25 metre freestyle event with <b>flotation</b> <b>devices</b> with or without <b>flotation</b> <b>devices.</b> Class 2 competitors could compete in the same events, but only against class 2 competitors.

5|$|Grand Teton National Park allows boating on all {{the lakes}} in Jackson Hole, but {{motorized}} boats can only be used on Jackson and Jenny Lakes. While there is no maximum horsepower limit on Jackson Lake (though there is a noise restriction), Jenny Lake is restricted to 10horsepower. Only non-motorized boats are permitted on Bearpaw, Bradley, Emma Matilda, Leigh, Phelps, String, Taggart and Two Ocean Lakes. There are four designated boat launches located on Jackson Lake and one on Jenny Lake. Additionally, sailboats, windsurfers and water skiing are only allowed on Jackson Lake and no jet skis are permitted {{on any of the}} park waterways. All boats are required to comply with various safety regulations including personal <b>flotation</b> <b>devices</b> for each passenger. Only non-motorized watercraft are permitted on the Snake River. All other waterways in the park are off limits to boating, and this includes all alpine lakes and tributary streams of the Snake River.|$|E
5|$|The spa {{that was}} {{featured}} in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power a light bulb. The former spa room featured recycled products like wood, plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, an open kitchen that paid respects to the Pacific Rim and a portable garden where the HouseGuests would collect compost and grow their own herb garden {{was added to the}} backyard. The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort. The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like <b>flotation</b> <b>devices.</b> The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E

25|$|The Mae West was {{a common}} {{nickname}} for the first inflatable life preserver, which was invented in 1928 by Peter Markus (1885–1974) (US Patent 1694714), with his subsequent improvements in 1930 and 1931. The nickname originated because someone wearing the inflated life preserver often appeared to be as large-breasted as the actress Mae West. It was popular during the Second World War with U.S. Army Air Forces and Royal Air Force servicemen, who were issued inflatable Mae Wests {{as part of their}} flight gear.

500|$|The {{camera and}} its film {{magazines}} with an {{inertial navigation system}} were carried in a cramped [...] "Q-bay" [...] below the drone's air intake. These components were built into a module that fit into the bay and {{was known as a}} [...] "hatch". The hatch would be ejected {{at the end of the}} mission and then snagged out of the air by a JC-130 Hercules, a technique that had been developed by the Air Force to recover film canisters from satellites. If the C-130 missed, the hatch was equipped with <b>flotation</b> <b>devices</b> so it could be recovered by ship if released over water. Honeywell built the avionics systems; new construction techniques and materials had to be developed for the systems to withstand the high temperatures, extreme vibrations, and lack of space in the D-21.|$|E

[...] Yankeetown received an even higher storm surge of [...] The main street through the center of Cedar Key—the most populous island in the Cedar Keys island chain—was severely flooded by [...] of water, which invaded every building and left large sinkholes when it receded. Sidewalks along the street were washed out. The surge of water undermined the foundations of stone buildings, weakening many of them to the point of collapse, while sweeping away weaker structures. Inside the buildings left intact, mud was sometimes found several feet deep. The hurricane also contaminated wells with seawater and debris, so residents were forced to travel for clean water. Hardest-hit were the small outlying islands, which were fully submerged by the storm surge and [...] "completely cleared out". Survivors often braced against young, supple trees that were able to withstand the storm's force, or used pieces of debris as <b>flotation</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E
