5|$|Angelou <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> {{to create}} her own {{narrative}} until The Heart of a Woman, which depends less upon {{the conventions of}} fiction than her previous books. For example, there is less dialog and fewer dramatic episodes. The Heart of a Woman is more uplifting than its predecessors due to Angelou's resolution of her conflict between her duties as {{a mother and her}} success as a performer.|$|E
5|$|For {{patients}} who benefit, half achieve a seizure reduction within five days (if the diet starts {{with an initial}} fast of one to two days), three-quarters achieve a reduction within two weeks, and 90% achieve a reduction within 23 days. If the diet <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> with a fast, the time for half of the patients to achieve an improvement is longer (two weeks) but the long-term seizure reduction rates are unaffected. Parents are encouraged to persist with the diet {{for at least three}} months before any final consideration is made regarding efficacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{protective}} effect <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs {{one to two}} weeks before arriving and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward). The use of preventative drugs is often not practical for {{those who live in}} areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations. During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anemia in the mother. The use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.|$|E

5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes × hookeriana {{has also}} been {{verified}} as occurring in the wild, but only in disturbed locations. The two parent species have overlapping ranges and are pollinated by the same honeyeater species; and though preferring different soils, they often occur near enough {{to each other for}} pollinators to move between them. It therefore appears that the only barrier to hybridisation in undisturbed areas is the different flowering seasons: B.prionotes has usually finished flowering by the end of May, whereas flowering of B.hookeriana usually <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> until June. In disturbed areas, however, the increased runoff and reduced competition mean extra nutrients are available, and this results in larger plants with more flowers and a longer flowering season. Thus the flowering seasons overlap, and the sole barrier to interbreeding is removed. The resultant F1 hybrids are fully fertile, with seed production rates {{similar to that of the}} parent species. There is no barrier to backcrossing of hybrids with parent species, and in some populations this has resulted in hybrid swarms. This raises the possibility of the parent species gradually losing their genetic integrity, especially if the intermediate characteristics of the hybrid offer it a competitive advantage over the parent species, such as a wider habitat tolerance. Moreover, speciation might occur if the hybrid's intermediate characteristics allow it to occupy a habitat unsuited to both parents, such as an intermediate soil type.|$|E

25|$|The Jellyfish Lake golden {{jellyfish}} {{migration pattern}} {{is similar to}} Mastigias sp. in other Palauan marine lakes and coves which all migrate west to east in the morning.

25|$|Yellowstone {{cutthroat}} trout (Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri) have suffered considerable declines since European settlement, but recently began flourishing in some areas. Especially in Yellowstone Lake itself, long-term records indicate an almost remarkable restoration of robust populations from only {{three decades ago}} when the numbers of this fish were depleted because of excessive harvest. Its current recovery, though a significant management achievement, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> to restore the species' historical abundance. Also, they declined because of invasive lake trout. An aggressive lake trout removal program has caused the cutthroats to rebound.|$|E
25|$|In new construction, minimum {{requirements}} are typically more stringent. All smoke detectors must be hooked {{directly to the}} electrical wiring, be interconnected and have a battery backup.

25|$|In {{the second}} moult, white down begins to return when the chicks are seven weeks old, {{followed}} by white semi-plumes then white contour feathers. The first white basic plumage is complete {{after three months}} and resembles that of adults. By this time, the legs and feet are now an incipient pink and the bill has become bicoloured (pale blue and maroon). Although the young now resemble adults, the skin surrounding the eye remains black {{for about a year}} before turning red, and the dark brown iris <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> to yellow until after two years old. These are two potentially useful features that identify juvenile maguari storks; but in the field, the dark iris of the juveniles is the most reliable feature that distinguishes them from adults.|$|E
25|$|According to Fredriksen, {{two events}} in the Gospels {{probably}} happened: John's baptism and Pilate's crucifixion of Jesus. These events are mentioned in all four gospels. Moreover, they {{do not conform to}} Jewish tradition in which there are no baptized and crucified messiahs. They are also embarrassing to the early Church. John the Baptist's prominence in both the gospels and Josephus suggests that he may have been more popular than Jesus in his lifetime; also, Jesus' mission <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> until after his baptism by John. Fredriksen suggests that it was only after Jesus' death that Jesus emerged as more influential than John. Accordingly, the gospels project Jesus' posthumous importance back to his lifetime. Ways this was accomplished were by minimizing John's importance by having John resist baptizing Jesus (Matthew), by referring to the baptism in passing (Luke), or by asserting Jesus' superiority (John).|$|E
