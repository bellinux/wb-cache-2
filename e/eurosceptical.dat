50|$|The People's Movement {{against the}} EU is a cross-party movement. It does not regard itself a {{political}} party and claims to be non-affiliated to the traditional left/right-scale, hence it does not contest national parliamentary or local elections. Its traditional base is found among left-wingers and trade union members, {{but there are also}} non-partisans and non-socialist members, e.g., from the Social Liberal Party, the Social Democrats, the Conservative Party, the Green Party and the small georgeist liberal Justice Party. The movement aims at a cooperation with other political forces, although it has distanced itself from the right-wing <b>eurosceptical</b> Danish People's Party.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{acceptance}} of the European Union in all member states saw a strong increase of support till the 1990s and a major decline afterwards, support sinking to 1980s levels then. Due to the timely connection with the Maastricht Treaty 1992, it {{has been called the}} post-Maastricht-Blues. The European integration process faced a major defeat with the failed Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and <b>eurosceptical</b> opinions gained more impact overall. The role of public opinion had been lower before but gained importance with state referendums, as in the rejection of the constitution by French and Dutch voters in 2005.|$|E

The organisations of The Rural Party of Finland bankcrupted. In 1995 the members of The Rural Party of Finland established the True Finns. The main argument has been to promote confederalist thinking and preserving the national state as a vehicle to fulfil national democracy, which has led into the <b>eurosceptical</b> thinking as far as it concerns the EMU bailouts.|$|E
50|$|The party's co-founder is Nils Lundgren, {{a former}} member of the Swedish Social Democratic Party and chief {{economist}} of the bank Nordea, who is sceptical of the euro. Lundgren hoped to receive support from <b>eurosceptical</b> voters dissatisfied with their usual parties' positive attitudes towards the euro and further European integration. Among the Swedish parties represented in parliament, only the Left Party, the Green Party and the Sweden Democrats are eurosceptic, while the Social Democratic Party, the major left-wing party, and all right-wing parties are positive towards European integration. Aiming at receiving support from this broad political spectrum, the board of the party contained people that had been previously active in both left- and right-wing parties.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the changing {{role of the}} EU agenda in Slovak politics. It identifies old and newly emerging faces of Euroscepticism and compares them with general theoretical concepts. Furthermore, it asks to what extent <b>Eurosceptical</b> appeals mobilised Slovak voters in the European Parliament (EP) elections of 2014 and whether <b>Eurosceptical</b> parties represent a meaningful electoral choice for voters. In the past, many analyses have provided evidence that the European agenda is not salient and the EU political arena is perceived as one where there is less at stake. Nevertheless, the economic crisis and so-called Greek bailout were followed by a rise in Euroscepticism and EU-criticism. In some EU countries, this enhanced voter mobilisation in the EP elections. In others – including Slovakia – we saw not only a significant decline in electoral turnout but relatively poor results for <b>Eurosceptical</b> parties as well. This study identifies the factors behind abstention and explores voting patterns in this specific second-order election in Slovakia. Moreover, it investigates how the parties are perceived {{in terms of their}} positions on EU integration and the potential impact on voter choices. I conclude that the EU agenda is still not the deciding factor for voters even in the case of EP elections. <b>Eurosceptical</b> appeals are less mobilising in this context, and the public sees no differences among parties’ stances on the EU...|$|E

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{acceleration}} of the integration process of the European Union {{there has been a}} rise in political parties expressing either scepticism or outright criticism {{of the nature of the}} integration process. Using a four-fold differentiation between single issue, protest, established parties and factions within parties, the first part of the article presents an overview of Euroscepticism within EU member states and Norway. This reveals the diversity of sources of Euroscepticism both in ideology and in the types of parties that are <b>Eurosceptical</b> but with a preponderance of protest parties taking <b>Eurosceptical</b> positions. The second part of the article is an attempt to map Euroscepticism in West European party systems through a consideration of ideology and party position in the party system. The conclusions are that Euroscepticism is mainly limited to parties on the periphery of their party system and is often there used as an issue that differentiates those parties from the more established parties which are only likely to express Euroscepticism through factions. Party based Euroscepticism is therefore both largely dependent on domestic contextual factors and a useful issue to map emergent domestic political constellations...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} built on four propositions. First, there is a latent {{potential}} within the German polity for the mobilisation of what remains a significant level of popular unease about aspects of the ongoing process of European integration. Second, at present this potential is unfulfilled and, as a result, Euroscepticism remains the ‘dark matter’ of German politics. Third, {{the absence of a}} clearly stated <b>Eurosceptical</b> agenda is not due to the inherent ‘enlightenment’ of the German political class about the European project, but rather is the result of systemic disincentives shaping the preferences of rational acting politicians. Finally, these systemic disincentives are to be found within the formal institutions of the German polity. The key ideas here are of ‘hard’ versus ‘soft’ <b>Eurosceptical</b> narratives, sustained versus heresthetic agendas, and ‘polis constraining’ versus ‘polis shaping’ strategies for their promotion. Political agents’ choice of strategy depends {{on the nature of the}} institutional setting within which they are operating. The institutional configuration of the Federal Republic provides poor returns for party-based Euroscepticism.

40|$|Euroscepticism is {{considered}} as a stream of thoughts whch {{is typical of the}} EU distrust or of the European integration and its goals as such. The most common objections to joining the integration proces are loss of national sovereignty, not paying enough attention to national interests or too strict policy unification that does not allow for national particularities. This master thesis will focus on euroscepticism as a concept, il will analyze its ideological roots and the most frequent arguments in favour of this concept. Furthermore, it will analyze various classifications of euroscepticism as well as its potential to be called a new cleavage or even ideology as I suggest that there is no widely-accepted definition. Great Britain - a representative of traditionally very sceptical approach towards European integration project has been chosen as a model case. In this case study firstly, the development of potential <b>eurosceptical</b> thinking within the Conservative Party and the Labour Party will be explored.

The paper argues that political agents' choice of strategy depends {{on the nature of the}} institutions available to them and the type of political opportunity structures they provide. Thus, the German system of federalism-which is moderately demos constraining-suggests a demos constraining strategy, whilst the Federal level party system-where the demos is shaped-makes a demos shaping strategy more appropriate. The paper concludes by arguing that the institutional configuration of the Federal Republic provides a poor political opportunity structure for Eurosceptic agendas, and that only "soft" agendas- harnessed to demos constraining strategies-are likely to have any impact on the future development of the European debate in Germany...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{and tries to}} explain the rise of anti-European and <b>Eurosceptical</b> sentiment in the United States {{since the end of}} the Cold War. Contrary to anti-Europeanism, which has always permeated American culture and underpinned American exceptionalism, Euroscepticism is more confined to political and business elites and targets the process, main policies and identity of the European Union. Although usually conservative, Anti-Europeans and Eurosceptics do not necessarily overlap: anti-Europeans are <b>Eurosceptical</b> but the reverse is not necessarily true. However, Anti-Europeanism and Euroscepticism have become entrenched beliefs among many conservatives. Europe's positive image since WWII and the wide support for European unification among American elites, have been replaced by competing views: for example, neo-conservatives believe Europe to be in economic, demographic and cultural decline that the EU only precipitates. Others see a unifying Europe as a rising power which will become more a rival than an ally for the US. Since the early 1990 s and increasingly until the war in Iraq, conservative commentators have attacked the style and content of European foreign policy, especially with regard to the Middle-East, Europe's weak defence budgets, its lack of resolve against terrorism, its welfare state and highly regulated economy, its left-leaning political culture, its growing anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism. The centralizing, elitist and regulatory aspects of the EU have also been denounced to justify Euroscepticism. The paper reviews and discusses possible explanations for such trends: a backlash against rising anti-Americanism in Europe? The projection of US domestic politics? The import of British Euroscepticism? The demise of communism and the Soviet Union and the common threat they represented? America's new hegemonic ambitions? The rising influence of American conservatives? Clashes over globalization? A resurgent awareness of deep differences in political and economic cultures, which help cast Europe as the anti-model? The answer lies most likely in a combination of such factors. international relations...|$|E

His increasingly <b>Eurosceptical</b> party and a press that is often hostile towards the European Union makes the task a particularly challenging one. In this series of five essays, Frank Vibert, a Senior Visiting Fellow in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics and Political Science, draws on his experience as a founder director of the European Policy Forum to analyse the five strands of Cameron’s renegotiation strategy. He concludes that – if he succeeds - the Prime Minister’s approach may lead member states and Brussels institutions to move away from their current strategy of stressing EU citizens’ rights, rather than their consent...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} the article {{is to use the}} changed {{landscape}} of Euroscepticism to look broadly across a set of cases of government participation by parties holding <b>Eurosceptical</b> positions to examine whether government participation has an effect on their European positions and whether participation by Eurosceptic parties in government has had an effect on their European policy. In general, while {{there does seem to be}} a moderating effect of government participation on a party's Euroscepticism, there are notable cases of Eurosceptic party participation in government having some discernible impact on policy, but under somewhat specific conditions. The impact is clearly different for major and minor parties and, in the case of the latter, moderating their Euroscepticism is often a signifier of a wider process of party mainstreaming. In some cases, while parties continue to use Eurosceptic rhetoric when in office, this does not appear to translate into substantial policy chang...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this article}} we empirically examine similar attitudes towards the {{accession}} to the European Union of Estonian and Polish students. This tendency is possible to detect applying the Identity Structural Analyses (ISA) method, elaborated by Prof. P.

There have been determined these basic factors which are influencing Estonian and Polish students ' attitudes in the current EU accession phase. One of the common features for Polish and Estonian students is identification with people who work for European community (negotiators) and negative attitudes towards persons with <b>eurosceptical</b> views. One of the most important factors of the integration success of the accession countries is the youth attitude towards the European engagement, their attitude towards the European values, cultural tradition and co-operation practices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to describe and}} account for the major changes undergone by Spain as an EU player since her accession in 1986.

Undoubtedly, ideological considerations (and, more importantly perhaps, differences in political culture) must be taken into account when examining the evolution of Spain’s European policy over the past fifteen years. However, this paper will argue that changing policy styles and contents should be understood in terms of both the learning process undergone by all new member states as they mature, and the need to adapt and respond to developments within the EU, most notably the evolution of the European integration process itself...|$|E
40|$|The recent vote {{to leave}} the European Union has reenergised Liberal Democrat {{commitment}} to the EU.

The turmoil that now defines UK–EU relations (the settling of which will likely dominate the rest of this parliament) led to justifiable quips that David Cameron was only able to last a year without Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. Europe, however, has not always been an easy issue for the party, either internally or externally, especially when in coalition with a <b>Eurosceptical</b> Conservative Party.

40|$|This article revisits {{the age-old}} debate about eliteĝ€"mass {{linkages}} in the European Union (EU) {{by examining the}} way in which political contexts shape individual differentiation in Euroscepticism. We argue that the growing uncertainties about the future of European integration among national publics are increasingly politicized by <b>Eurosceptical</b> elites on both the extreme right and left of the political spectrum. To analyse the cueing effects of these extremist parties, we employ a two-level hierarchical linear model which combines individual-level and contextual data. We show that Eurosceptic cues are, indeed, found on both extremes, but for different reasons. Whereas right-wing extremist parties oppose European integration with the defence of 'national sovereignty' and successfully mobilize national identity considerations against the EU, left-wing extremist parties resist further integration in Europe {{on the basis of the}} neoliberal character of the project and effectively cue voters against the EU on the basis of economic insecurity arguments.

40|$|Conservative Party {{policy on}} the EU has {{hardened}} in recent years, both in order to outflank Labour and {{as a reflection of}} an increasingly <b>Eurosceptical</b> membership, inside parliament and without. Yet {{at the same time the}} Tories have increasingly downplayed ‘Europe’. In the light of the apparent defeat of the EU’s Constitutional Treaty and the Labour government’s more assertive stance, this could – and perhaps should – be the precursor to the party’s return to a more pragmatic, ‘softer’ Euroscepticism which acknowledges the reality of multilevel governance but seeks to tilt it in a more liberal direction. Abandoning the attempt to turn back the clock would also dovetail with David Cameron’s broader modernisation strategy. Whether the party is ready for a ‘Eurorealism’ that sees Britain’s relationship with the EU as a ‘valence issue’ – one revolving around competence – rather than a ‘position issue’ – one which demands people take sides – is another matter. Nor will things be made any easier by Cameron’s arguably rash promise to take Tory MEPs out of the EPP-ED group in Brussels...|$|E
40|$|The euro crisis points {{towards the}} limits of the post-war pro-European {{integration}} consensus in Germany, a trend that has manifested itself in both the legal and political realms. In the legal arena, the powerful German Constitutional Court (GCC) has heard complaints on several key rescue measures, including the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the European Central Bank’s (ECB) bond buying programme. The Court’s ruminations on these initiatives both reflect and feed German eurosceptics ’ concerns. They also have implications for the Eurozone as a whole, insofar as they limit the German government’s room to manoeuvre. In the political arena, a new eurosceptic party, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), contested the September 2013 federal election and the May 2014 European parliamentary election, winning a handful of seats in the latter. AfD’s emergence potentially marks a shift towards a more overtly <b>eurosceptical</b> political discourse in Germany. Thus, both legal and political developments have the potential to constrain the choices for the EU as a whole by reconfiguring the political and policy landscape of Germany, the Union’s reluctant hegemon...|$|E
