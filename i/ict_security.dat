30|$|Security: Businesses that handle excess cash {{at their}} {{premises}} cited {{the use of}} <b>ICTs</b> to aid <b>security</b> of their operations {{through the use of}} point of sale machines that provided customers with an option to swipe for their payments using bank credit or debit cards. This was a major driver to the use of ICTs by these type of SMEs as they did not require frequent visits to banks to make deposits and the security needed to escort them. Another use of <b>ICTs</b> for <b>security</b> was the implementation of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) which used cameras connected to a network that were placed strategically and were able to provide live pictures of the area under surveillance whilst recording it. In this manner, business premises were able to be monitored all the times to avoid thefts and for accountability purposes.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to analyze the factors that influence the adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by SMEs in Colombia. Design/methodology: To prove empirically these hypotheses, we administered a questionnaire to a sample of 474 SMEs in Colombia regarding the adoption of ICT and independent variables identified in the literature. Then, we conducted a series of multiple regression models using the data we obtained. Findings: We developed a model that identifies a positive relation between new business opportunities that ICT offer and their adoption level. Likewise, this research identified that a lack of confidence in <b>ICT's</b> <b>security</b> and privacy, a perception of ICT cost-benefit unbalance have a negative impact on the implementation of these technologies. Research limitations/implications: This study has limitations that are inherent to cross-sectional research. These restrict the possibility of conducting dynamic analysis between independent and dependent variables. Likewise, the generalization of results is circumscribed to a geographical context and the type of enterprises surveyed. Practical implications: The results of this research provide valuable contributions to decision-making by SMEs' directors and to public policies that foster the implementation of ICT in SMEs based on an analysis of benefits and barriers found in this study. Originality/value: In view of a lack of empirical work that analyzes the implementation of technology in enterprises in emerging countries, this study provides a valuable contribution to the creation of knowledge when attempting to explain the implementation of ICT using a representative sample of SMEs in Colombia identifying the quantitative form of the impact of the benefits and barriers of these technologies.

In this paper we evaluate the security of a random set range query scheme in a real-world web surfing scenario. We demonstrate that the scheme does not sufficiently obfuscate characteristic query patterns, which can be used by an adversary to determine the visited websites. We also illustrate how to thwart the attack and discuss practical challenges. Our results suggest that previously published evaluations of range queries may give a false sense of the attainable security, because they do not account for any interdependencies between queries.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} is about {{improvement of the}} <b>ICT</b> <b>security</b> management process in non-commercial organisations {{in order to reduce}} possible financial damage, taking into consideration the realities found in developing countries. The research took place in a developing country—Tanzania, where five organisations were involved. The study is organised into seven papers covering: the state of <b>ICT</b> <b>security</b> management in the organisations; prerequisites when utilising the existing <b>ICT</b> <b>security</b> management approaches in attaining a solution for managing <b>ICT</b> <b>security</b> in the organisations; issues and challenges of managing ICT security; important aspects to be taken into consideration in order to successfully manage ICT security; and how the management of <b>ICT</b> <b>security</b> in non-commercial organisations could be improved.

40|$|Keywords Based on a {{study of}} ICT use at an airport {{security}} checkpoint, this paper explores a possible explanation to the paradox that travelers find existing airport security measures inadequate {{while at the same}} time believing air travel to be sufficiently secure. We pursue this explanation by showing that, for the security checkpoint to function properly in relation to the overall function of the airport, travelers have to be enrolled in a particular program of action. They are then locked into this program through sanctions. Travelers are forced into participating in a system many of them find ethically and morally objectionable. Yet, active participation makes it difficult for them to object to the moral and ethical issues of their actions without damning themselves. Our explanation of the security paradox is, therefore, that while travelers remain critical of airport security, they avoid damning themselves by criticizing the system in terms of its own logic. They have been made accomplices.
