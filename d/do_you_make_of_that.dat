6000|$|... "What in hell <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Crocker?" [...] cried my client, eyeing me {{closely and}} repeating the {{question}} again and again, {{as was his}} wont when agitated.|$|E
6000|$|... "My young friend," [...] he said, [...] "your {{eyes are}} better than mine. You see the road there? Look along it, between the white posts, {{as far as you}} can. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> black speck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Uncle Holly," [...] said Leo, {{with a sort}} of gasp, as he {{replaced}} it on the table. [...] "We have been looking for a mystery, and we certainly seem to have found one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child, the {{greatest}} statesmen {{have had their}} distractions. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> my hereditary talent? That's a tremendous force." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this, White Buffalo?" [...] asked Dave, {{after they}} had left the Indian village a goodly {{distance}} behind them.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, this is strange, {{to say the}} least,” remarked Phil, {{after they}} had called out several times. “What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it, Roger?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, it {{just happens}} that I have already read all the {{available}} evidence, including {{the report of the}} inquest, with some care. By the way, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> tobacco pouch, found on the scene of the crime? Is there no clue there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What now, Bunting?--what now, Greenly?" [...] demanded Sir Gervaise, a sea having {{struck the}} side of the ship and thrown so much spray into his face as to reduce him to the {{necessity}} of using his pocket-handkerchief, at the very moment he was anxious to be looking through his glass. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> gentlemen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I'll {{show you}} the explanation. There IS a second stain, {{but it does not}} {{correspond}} with the other. See for yourself." [...] As he spoke he turned over another portion of the carpet, and there, sure enough, was a great crimson spill upon the square white facing of the old-fashioned floor. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Mr. Holmes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A jolly good morrow indeed," [...] said Sir John, {{turning a}} shade paler. [...] "And now, daughter, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this business?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's mighty queer, {{to say the}} least," [...] {{observed}} Roger, {{after they}} had taken their departure. [...] "Dave, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Four times five will do handsomely, will it?" [...] said Mr. Jaggers, {{knitting}} his brows. [...] "Now, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> {{four times}} five?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You think {{then that}} {{everything}} is for the best?" [...] asked Stoutenburg grimly, [...] "you did not begin to wonder how it was that--as Jan ascertained at Zegwaard and at Zevenhuizen--Gilda continued her journey without any protest. According to the people whom Jan questioned she looked sad certainly, but she was always willing to restart on her way. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> my friend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When Arthur {{had gone}} I {{went back to}} the room. Lucy was {{sleeping}} gently, but her breathing was stronger. I could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently. The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a whisper, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> mark on her throat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No fear. This fellow {{has been}} pickled in natron, and looked after {{in the most}} {{approved}} style. They did not serve hodsmen in that fashion. Salt or bitumen was enough for them. It has been calculated {{that this sort of}} thing cost about seven hundred and thirty pounds in our money. Our friend was a noble at the least. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> small inscription near his feet, Smith?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} Mrs. Cavendish," [...] {{continued}} Poirot. [...] "That's another {{who is not}} telling all she knows! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> her attitude?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Mulford, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> her?" [...] {{he called}} {{out as soon as}} the mate {{announced}} that he saw the strange vessel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] asked Sam, whose {{religious}} education {{had not been}} attended to {{as well as that}} of his friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take care, Lassiter, I {{might think}} that a proposal," [...] she replied, gaily. [...] "It's {{dangerous}} to propose elopement to a Mormon woman. Well, I was expecting you. Now {{will be a good}} hour to show you Milly Erne's grave. The day-riders have gone, and the night-riders haven't come in. Bern, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that?</b> Need I worry? You know I have to be made to worry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From the Plymouth hotel, Watson," [...] he said. [...] "I {{learned the}} name of it from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's account was true. It appears that he did indeed spend last night there, and that he has {{actually}} allowed some of his baggage to go on to Africa, while he returned to be present at this investigation. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Watson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Sir. Allow me {{to remind}} you (though there is no legal {{necessity}} for my doing so, as you are aware) that the bill at two months' date drawn on yourself by Mr. Matthew Bagnet, and by you accepted, for the sum of ninety-seven pounds four shillings and ninepence, will become due to-morrow, when you will please be prepared {{to take up the}} same on presentation. Yours, Joshua Smallweed.' What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Phil?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bent, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> thet?" [...] asked Lem, as {{he waved}} his hand toward the house. [...] "Buster Jack ridin' up with Sheriff Burley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} devilish in this, Watson," [...] said he, more moved than I had ever before seen him. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it all, then, Hawkins?" [...] {{asked the}} captain, with a troubled face. [...] "What {{is your own}} theory on the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, it {{is surely}} not quite so bad as that. The cipher message begins with a large 534, does it not? We may {{take it as a}} working {{hypothesis}} that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers. So our book has already become a LARGE book, which is surely something gained. What other indications have we as to the nature of this large book? The next sign is C2. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Watson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Regulus,' he said, 'was not a leader-writer for {{the penny}} press, nor, for that matter, was Horace. Regulus says: [...] "The soldier ransomed by gold will come keener for the fight--will he by--by gum!" [...] That's {{the meaning of}} scilicet. It {{indicates}} contempt--bitter contempt. [...] "Forsooth," [...] forsooth! You'll be talking about [...] "speckled beauties" [...] and [...] "eventually transpire" [...] next. Howell, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> doubled [...] "Vidi ego--ego vidi"? It wasn't put in to fill up the metre, you know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Farther. And {{everybody}} else thinks so. Everybody except my wife. She {{tells me that}} I am a model of manly beauty. You know Lancelot? Well, she says I have Lancelot whipped to a custard. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that?</b> And here's another thing. It is perfectly {{obvious to me that}} my wife {{is one of the most}} beautiful creatures in existence. I have seen them all, and I tell you that she stands alone. She is literally marooned in Class A, all by herself. Yet she insists that she is plain. What do you make of it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] asked Paul, impatiently, as he {{bent over}} to examine the object as it lay in his younger brother's palm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Many things; {{more than}} I can tell you--things you've only {{to think of}} for yourself. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> all that I've done for myself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make,</b> Mr Nickleby,' said Tim, {{taking his}} pen {{out of his}} mouth, 'what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> four hundred and twenty-seven times three {{thousand}} two hundred and thirty-eight?' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1940 I {{could at}} least fly as far as Glasgow in most of my aircraft, but not now! It makes me furious when I see the Mosquito. I turn green and yellow with envy. The British, who can afford {{aluminium}} better than we can, knock together a beautiful wooden aircraft that every piano factory over there is building, and they give it a speed which they have now increased yet again. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that?</b> There is nothing the British do not have. They have the geniuses {{and we have the}} nincompoops. After the war is over I'm going to buy a British radio set - then at least I'll own something that has always worked.|$|E
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of MeanjinMoving around: {{an interview with}} Stephen Muecke. HEALY: Reading the country, the book you coauthored in 1984 with Krim Benterrak and Paddy Roe, is dedicated ‘to the nomads of Broome, always there and always on the move’. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> dedication now? MUEKE: When I worked in the Kimberley {{in the late seventies}} and through the eighties I was experiencing a frontier complex of cultures. Land rights were under negotiation. For nearly a hundred years whitefellas had been ‘settling’ and imposing pastoral and mining economies of exploitation; blackfellas were being displaced yet had obviously always belonged. Whitefellas and Asians were part of diasporic movements. People were moving around a lot, in modes quite unlike, say, suburban commuting. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|I {{bought my}} first zine today! Actually, I had a {{bag full of}} zines ($ 48. 44 worth, to be exact) by the time I left Bizarro-Wuxtry Comics in {{downtown}} Athens. You might say I got a bit carried away. But I've been interested in checking out zine culture for some time now. Several kids I know locally write zines, and Michele Knobel's recent talk [Knobel & Lankshear, 2001] on zines at the University of Georgia piqued my interest even further. Truth is, I've been thinking about zines {{and other forms of}} popular culture a lot this week—largely due to a question directed my way as I worked with some colleagues on a grant proposal to study adolescents ' literacy practices as they engage with popular media. The question had to do with frivolity. Did I think the reviewers of our proposal would dismiss it as being too frivolous? After all, my friends noted, there are teenagers who can't read, and we're proposing to study youth's fascination with zines, comics, videos, CDs, instant messaging, and the like. The question gave me pause, but then I remembered Robert (self-selected Alvermann & Heron 2 pseudonym) from our media club study. Do you recall how he struggled to read in school and yet seemed to have so little difficulty reading text from the Dragon Ball Z series on the computer screen?

6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> hear that? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> hear that? There's {{my voice}} over there, and here I am here! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it?" [...] whispered Sticky-toes.|$|R
6000|$|... "This stumps me," [...] {{declared}} the senator's son. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> it? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think Shadow and Plum {{are up to}} something between them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never make}} {{exception}}s. An exception disproves the rule. Have {{you ever had}} occasion to study character in handwriting? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> this fellow's scribble?" ...|$|R
