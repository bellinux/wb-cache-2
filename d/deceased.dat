5|$|At present, some 192 spells are known, {{though no}} single {{manuscript}} contains them all. They served {{a range of}} purposes. Some are intended to give the <b>deceased</b> mystical knowledge in the afterlife, or perhaps to identify them with the gods: for instance, Spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god Atum. Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, and to give the <b>deceased</b> control over the world around him. Still others protect the <b>deceased</b> from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgement of the <b>deceased</b> in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.|$|E

5000|$|The Fore {{believe that}} the land they live in, or bagina, is alive, and that it created the world.

[...] When a person dies, the Fore conduct mortuary rituals to ensure that each soul reaches its proper destination. Upon death, the auma, or good aspects of a person, travels to kwelanandamundi, the land of the dead. To help the auma reach kwelanandamundi, the <b>deceased’s</b> family members leave food with the body. Two to three days after death, the body may be buried, entombed, or cooked and consumed. If consumed, the <b>deceased’s</b> ama blesses those who eat. The aona, or special abilities of a person, passes on to the <b>deceased’s</b> preferred child, while the yesegi, or ancestral power of a person, is passed on to all the <b>deceased’s</b> children. Purification rituals during and after consumption of the body ensure that the kwela, or the pollution of a dead body, does not taint those who eat it. Through such rituals, the Fore assure that the <b>deceased’s</b> positive aspects remain in the tribe, while the auma, ama, and kwela reach kwelanandamundi.|$|R
