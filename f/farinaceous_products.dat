40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{consumption}} of fibrous foods has been stimulated in recent years. While wheat and oat brans {{are still the}} conventional sources of fiber for human consumption, other new fibrous products have been developed – at research level – from waste or by-products generated by food industries. This research aimed {{to develop a new}} dehydrated food product- peach palm fibrous flour- from the waste generated during the processing of the heart-of-peach palm. The average yield in dry weight from this waste into <b>farinaceous</b> <b>products</b> was 129. 8 g kg- 1. The flours showed high values for the total dietary fiber, 59. 1 to 65. 5 g 100 g- 1, almost entirely represented by the insoluble fiber, as well as a low proportion of calories- 96. 1 to 101. 1 kcal or 408. 2 - 429. 5 kJ per 100 g of product- when compared to wheat bran. These results highlighted the peach palm flour as a potential source of fiber for human nutrition, particularly as fibrous ingredient of formulated food and functional supplements. Also, it contributes to minimizing waste disposal and to the agribusiness of peach palm grown for heart-of-palm production...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of pasting properties of newly developed plantain and banana (Musa spp.) and cassava (Manihot spp.) varieties were investigated with emphasis on their application in the baking industry. The new varieties were released to farmers in West and Central Africa (WCA) and East and Southern Africa (ESA) {{in line with the}} mandate of the Consultative Group on Agricultural Research which aims at reducing hunger and improving the livelihood of Africans. Supplementation of wheat flour with high quality flours from improved plantain, banana and cassava varieties may complement composite baking technology in Africa. This may reduce importation of wheat and other related <b>farinaceous</b> <b>products</b> and consequently enhance industrial development. Results show that BITA 3 had the highest Peak Viscosity (373. 1 RVU), Trough Value (304. 9 RVU), Final Viscosity (425. 2 RVU), Setback Viscosity (120. 3 RVU) and Pasting Time (5. 2 min) and differed significantly (P< 0. 05) from other cultivars. PITA 26 had the highest values in Breakdown Value (93. 8 RVU) and differed significantly (P< 0. 05) from other cultivars, while AGBAGBA had the highest values in Pasting Temperature (86. 2 oC and differed significantly (P< 0. 05) from other cultivars. TMS 98 / 0581 had the highest values in Trough Value (188. ...|$|E
40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {{conventional}} baker's yeast, {{remains the most}} domesticated yeast monopolizing the baking industry. Its rapid consumption of sugars and production of CO 2 {{are the most important}} attributes required to leaven the dough. New research attempts highlight that these attributes are not unique to S. cerevisiae, but also found in several non-conventional yeast species. A small number of these yeast species with similar properties have been described, but remain poorly studied. They present a vast untapped potential for the use as leavening agents and flavor producers due to their genetic and phylogenetic diversity. We assessed the potential of several non-conventional yeasts as leavening agents and flavor producers in dough-like conditions in the presence of high sugar concentrations and stressful environments mimicking conditions found in flour dough. We tested the capabilities of bread leavening and aroma formation in a microbread platform as well as in a bakery setup. Bread leavened with Kazachstania gamospora and Wickerhamomyces subpelliculosus had better overall results compared to control baker's yeast. In addition, both displayed higher stress tolerance and broader aroma profiles than the control baker's yeast. These attributes are important in bread and other <b>farinaceous</b> <b>products,</b> making K. gamospora and W. subpelliculosus highly applicable as alternative baker's yeasts...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the analysis of recipes of confectionary products on the basis of essential indicators of chemical composition meeting the demands of definite group of consumers (corresponding the physiological norms of feeding the different group of population). The ratio of carbohydrates and proteins which is determined for correlating group of the intensity of labour is analized. Criteria of optimality of the composition of present products were adopted on this basis. The received results give the possibility of choice of the composition of <b>farinaceous</b> confectionary <b>product</b> concidering the aminoacid composition. Variants of the optimized recipes of the <b>farinaceous</b> confectionary <b>product</b> enriched with gluten were obtained. Key indicators of quality of the made <b>farinaceous</b> confectionary <b>product</b> were defined...|$|R
60|$|During the {{two weeks}} which I spent in this little settlement, I had good {{opportunities}} of observing the natives at their own home, and living in their usual manner. There is a great monotony and uniformity in everyday savage life, {{and it seemed to}} me a more miserable existence than when it had the charm of novelty. To begin with the most important fact in the existence of uncivilized peoples--their food--the Aru men have no regular supply, no staff of life, such as bread, rice, mandiocca, maize, or sago, which are the daily food of a large proportion of mankind. They have, however, many sorts of vegetables, plantains, yams, sweet potatoes, and raw sago; and they chew up vast quantities of sugar-cane, as well as betel-nuts, gambir, and tobacco. Those who live on the coast have plenty of fish; but when inland, as we are here, they only go to the sea occasionally, and then bring home cockles and other shell-fish by the boatload. Now and then they get wild pig or kangaroo, but too rarely to form anything like a regular part of their diet, which is essentially vegetable; and what is of more importance, as affecting their health, green, watery vegetables, imperfectly cooked, and even these in varying and often in sufficient quantities. To this diet may be attributed the prevalence of skin diseases, and ulcers on the legs and joints. The scurfy skin disease so common among savages has a close connexion with the poorness and irregularity of their living. The Malays, who are never without their daily rice, are generally free from it; the hill-Dyaks of Borneo, who grow rice and live well, are clean skinned while the less industrious and less cleanly tribes, who live for a portion of the year on fruits and vegetables only, are very subject to this malady. It seems clear that in this, as in other respects, man is not able to make a beast of himself with impunity, feeding like the cattle on the herbs and fruits of the earth, and taking no thought of the morrow. To maintain his health and beauty he must labour to prepare some <b>farinaceous</b> <b>product</b> capable of being stored and accumulated, so as to give him a regular supply of wholesome food. When this is obtained, he may add vegetables, fruits, and meat with advantage.|$|R
40|$|The emetic toxin cereulide, {{which can}} be {{produced}} by Bacillus cereus, can {{be the cause of}} food poisoning upon ingestion by the consumer. The toxin causes vomiting and is mainly produced in <b>farinaceous</b> food <b>products.</b> This article includes the prevalence of B. cereus and of cereulide in food products in The Netherlands, a characterization of B. cereus isolates obtained, cereulide production conditions, and a comparison of consumer exposure estimates with those of a previous exposure assessment. Food samples (n= 1, 489) were tested for the presence of B. cereus; 5. 4 % of the samples contained detectable levels (> 10 2 CFU/ g), and 0. 7 % contained levels above 10 5 CFU/g. Samples (n= 3, 008) also were tested for the presence of cereulide. Two samples (0. 067 %) contained detectable levels of cereulide at 3. 2 and 5. 4 μg/kg of food product. Of the 481 tested isolates, 81 produced cereulide and/or contained the ces gene. None of the starch-positive and hbl-containing isolates possessed the ces gene, whereas all strains contained the nhe genes. Culture of emetic B. cereus under nonoptimal conditions revealed a delay in onset of cereulide production compared with culture under optimal conditions, and cereulide was produced in all cases when B. cereus cells had been in the stationary phase for some time. The prevalence of cereulide-contaminated food approached the prevalence of contaminated products estimated in an exposure assessment. The main food safety focus associated with this pathogen should be to prevent germination and growth of any B. cereus present in food products and thus prevent cereulide production in foods. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cookies {{constitute}} a varied group of <b>farinaceous</b> <b>products.</b> Their consumption is widespread {{and they can}} be considered one of products that families consume. Some cookies belong within the group of functional food, thus are allowed to be eaten by people with special dietary needs, such as patients with diabetes. The main goal of this publication was to asses, by using the nutrition labeling, the amount of fat, saturated fatty acids and sodium contained in low glycemic value cookies available at health food stores in Rosario. Material and Methods: Cookies were divided into three categories: Adequate, Moderately Adequate cookies and Not Adequate cookies, according to the study of their critical nutrient concentrations analyzed by the “Nutrition Traffic Light” method (Labelling Regulation by the United Kingdom’s National Agency of Food). Results: All cookies analyzed were classified as follows: firstly, taking into account their fat content, they are all within the moderately content category. Secondly, 71 % of cookies belong to the moderately content category as regards saturated fatty acids. Thirdly, only 29 % of cookies can be included in the low content group. 57 % of the cookies analyzed contain a moderate level of sodium, 14 % have a high level of sodium and 29 % a low level. Conclusions: In all, it may be stated that 86 % of cookies of a low glycemic value that were analyzed in this sample were classified as Moderately Adequate, {{while the rest of the}} cookies analyzed are Not Adequate (14 %). None of them reaches the requirements to be included within the Adequate group. </p...|$|E
40|$|The body {{structure}} and nutritional status of Moroccan {{women who have}} immigrated to Italy are examined here in relation to changes in their alimentary behaviors and life-styles, and {{compared with those of}} women living in Morocco, who still retain a traditional rural life-style. It is known that the choice to migrate to a foreign country may not only lead to conflicting situations, when the people involved encounter socio-cultural contexts which are very different from those of their original countries, but such choices may also involve severe consequences for health and nutritional status, following changes in alimentary behaviors and life-styles. Among groups recently migrated to Italy, the Moroccan community is an appropriate reference to highlight these effects. The choice to examine women as the focus of this survey allows extension of observations of their nutritional behavior to the whole family group. According to the bio-indicators examined here, groups of immigrant women are quite different from those remaining at home. The former show a considerable increase in weight, as assessed by both anthropometric and impedentiometric parameters. More than one-third of Moroccan immigrant women are obese, to an extent well beyond that of women in Morocco. The cause of this difference is ascribed to quantitative and qualitative changes induced after migration. Migrant women tend to adopt a mixed diet, which includes both traditional food and that typical of the host country. However, there is a considerable increase in the use of prepared foods, such as pasta, among <b>farinaceous</b> <b>products,</b> and meat, although vegetables and fruit are also consumed. Moroccan women consider both their socio-economic status and alimentary behavior as very private matters - an attitude which makes it difficult to recruit them for this kind of research. Future interventions require their preliminary acceptance and involvement in research aims, to demonstrate its great importance in improving the health status of present and future immigrants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For millennia, the “yeast” Saccharomyces cerevisiae remains by far {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied and exploited yeast in food and industrial applications. A number of researches and developments have been done since the establishment of the biochemical function of yeast by Louis Pasteur in 1860, however modern lifestyles often connected to food related health trends demand new and innovative food products. An immense natural yeast biodiversity on Earth (approx. 1500 yeast species, a vast majority are poorly studied) exists at our disposal. These non-conventional yeasts present a vast untapped potential to deliver innovations in food and other industrial applications. This thesis explored the potential in the diversity of natural non-conventional yeast isolates as well as the generation of artificial diversity for applications in fermentation biotechnologies. Natural yeasts strains were obtained from the CBS collections centre. Firstly, our findings show that two non-conventional yeasts, Kazachstania and Wickerhamomyces may be used to improve aroma profiles of wine from Ribolla Gialla, a grape variety from Italy and Slovenia. These strains could be used as pure cultures or as mixed cultures for improving mixed fermentations. Secondly, these yeasts were tested for bread leavening as either alternatives to the conventional baker’s yeast S. cerevisiae or complementing it. Results show that these yeasts’ baking properties were not only comparable to the conventional baker’s yeast but displayed a novel aromatic profile in bread. This represents an alternative to supplementation of natural or artificial flavors, which is a common practice in the baking industry. These results highlight that alternative yeasts can be used to improve aroma profiles of <b>farinaceous</b> <b>products</b> and wines, increasing the number of yeast species available for food production. Although an immense biodiversity exist, not many types of yeast isolates have the natural phenotypic traits that are directly transferrable for industrial applications. Due to the need to develop strains to perform better in an industrial setup, I therefore focused on the development of a non-recombinant engineering approach, adaptive experimental evolution, to develop strains with more extreme traits such as elevated ethanol production and ethanol tolerance and/or elevated stress tolerance. Using bacteria as a selection pressure as crucial for the trigger of aerobic ethanol production, I attempted to mimic evolution in a primordial environment, where yeasts and their cross-kingdom competitors, e. g. bacteria, could have competed for a sudden appearance of excess fruit sugars. Analysis of variants generated from this work resulted in the isolation of strains characterized by an increased fermentative capacity, tolerance to thermal stress and high titers of ethanol as well as large-scale genomic rearrangements. In some cases, by combining the whole genome sequencing approach, RNASeq and pulsed field gel electrophoresis, associated chromosomal rearrangements, point mutations and gene duplications behind the “improved” traits were revealed. This unique non-recombinant approach yielded several mutants now available for screening of interesting phenotypes. This study also substantially expands our knowledge about how to study ecological processes and how to design experiments to reprogram yeast genomes to generate industrial strains with new metabolic networks without recombinant technology...|$|E
