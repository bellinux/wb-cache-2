5|$|Decades {{of civil}} war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly {{to the demise of}} the old {{aristocracy}} of Rome, which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in prominence during {{the early part of the}} 1st century. One such family, the Flavians, or gens Flavia, rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Domitian's great-grandfather, Titus Flavius Petro, <b>had</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> centurion under Pompey during Caesar's civil war. His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Mermaid {{signaled}} the re-establishment {{of the musical}} film format as a standard for Disney animated films. The majority of Disney's most popular animated films from the 1930s on had been musicals, though by the 1970s and 1980s the role of music had been de-emphasized in the films. 1988's Oliver & Company <b>had</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> test of sorts {{to the success of}} the musical format before Disney committed to the Broadway-style structure of The Little Mermaid.|$|E
5|$|Romulus' father Orestes was a Roman citizen, {{originally}} from Pannonia, who <b>had</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> secretary and diplomat for Attila the Hun and later {{rose through the}} ranks of the Roman army. The future emperor was named Romulus after his maternal grandfather, a nobleman from Poetovio in Noricum. Many historians have noted the coincidence that the last western emperor bore the names of both Romulus, the legendary founder and first king of Rome, and Augustus, the first emperor.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{also made}} a number of changes to the {{coaching}} staff before the season. Bob Voigts, the tackles coach in 1946, left to become head football coach at Northwestern University.

Red Conkright, the end and center coach in 1946, left for an assistant coaching job with the Buffalo Bills; he was replaced by Dick Gallagher.

5|$|The {{foundation}} of Bartholdi's statue {{was to be}} laid inside Fort Wood, a disused army base on Bedloe's Island constructed between 1807 and 1811. Since 1823, it had rarely been used, though during the Civil War, it <b>had</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> recruiting station. The fortifications of the structure were {{in the shape of}} an eleven-point star. The statue's foundation and pedestal were aligned so that it would face southeast, greeting ships entering the harbor from the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} of this period {{that would have a}} profound impact on Kannada literature even into the modern age was the birth of the Haridasa ("servants of Hari or Vishnu") movement. This devotional movement, although reminiscent in some ways of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12thcentury (which produced Vachana poetry and taught devotion to the god Shiva), was in contrast intimately devoted to the Hindu god Vishnu as the supreme God. The inspiration behind this movement was the philosophy of Madhvacharya of Udupi. Naraharitirtha (1281) is considered the first well-known haridasa and composer of Vaishnava devotional songs in Kannada. Before his induction into the Madhva order, he <b>had</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> minister in the court of Kalinga (modern Orissa). The Vaishnava poetry however disappeared for about two centuries after Naraharitirtha's death before resurfacing as a popular form of folk literature during the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire. Only three of Naraharitirtha's compositions are available today.|$|E

5|$|In 1881, the {{congregation}} hired Oakland's first rabbi, Meyer Solomon Levy. Born in England in January 1852 and raised there, {{he was the}} son of Rabbi Solomon Levy of Borough Synagogue in London. Meyer Solomon Levy had been ordained in England as an Orthodox rabbi before he was twenty, and moved to Australia as a young man. An early supporter of Zionism, he <b>had</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rabbi in Melbourne before moving to California in 1872 or 1873, where he served as the rabbi of Temple Emanu-El (then Bickur Cholim) in San Jose. Levy was paid $100 a month (today $), and donated a percentage to the poor.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the only}} Bond film to be {{directed}} by Peter R. Hunt, who <b>had</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> film editor and second unit director on previous films in the series. Hunt, along with producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, decided to produce a more realistic film that would follow the novel closely. It was shot in Switzerland, England, and Portugal from October 1968 to May 1969. Although its cinema release was not as lucrative as its predecessor You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service was {{still one of the}} top performing films of the year. Critical reviews upon release were mixed, but the film's reputation has improved greatly over time.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh {{returned}} to England in June 1909. On {{reporting to the}} P & O, he was informed that due to his impaired sight he was discharged. Without immediate prospects of employment, he agreed, early in 1910, to accompany Douglas Mawson (who <b>had</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> geologist on the Nimrod Expedition and was later to lead the Australasian Antarctic Expedition) {{on a trip to}} Hungary, to survey a potential goldfield which Shackleton was hoping would form the basis of a lucrative business venture.

Mackintosh later launched his own treasure-hunting expedition to Cocos Island off the Panama Pacific coast, but again returned home empty-handed.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{negotiations}} {{continued with}} the Americans. Oliver Franks, the British Ambassador to the United States, lodged a formal request on 2 August 1951 {{for use of}} the Nevada Test Site. This was looked upon favourably by the United States Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, {{and the chairman of the}} United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, but opposed by the Robert A. Lovett, the Deputy Secretary of Defense and Robert LeBaron, the Deputy Secretary of Defence for Atomic Energy Affairs. The British government had announced on 7 June 1951 that Donald Maclean, who <b>had</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, had been a Soviet spy. In view of security concerns, Lovett and LeBaron wanted the tests to be conducted by Americans, with British participation limited to Penney and a few selected British scientists. Truman endorsed this counterproposal on 24 September 1951.|$|E
5|$|Moses Fleetwood Walker {{was born}} in 1856 in Mount Pleasant, a working-class town in Eastern Ohio that <b>had</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{sanctuary}} for runaway slaves since 1815. Its population included a large Quaker community and a unique collective of former Virginian slaves. Walker's parents, Moses W. Walker and Caroline O' Harra, were both mulattos. According to Walker's biographer David W. Zang, his father came to Ohio from Pennsylvania, likely a beneficiary of Quaker patronage, and married O' Harra, who was a native to the state, on June 11, 1843. When Walker was three years old, the family moved 20 miles northeast to Steubenville where Moses W. {{became one of the}} first black physicians of Ohio and later a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church. There, Walker's fifth or sixth sibling, his younger brother Weldy, was born the same year. Walker and Weldy attended Steubenville High School in the early 1870s, just as the community passed legislation for racial integration.|$|E
