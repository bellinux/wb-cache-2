40|$|The typical new {{start-up}} firm acquires external financing in stages through its development. Researchers have frequently examined the later stages of financing; however, they have rarely analyzed the <b>early</b> stages of <b>financing.</b> This study examines {{the determinants of}} the initial start-up financing of entrepreneurial firms in 27 countries. There are information asymmetries and moral hazard problems inherent in the funding of an initial {{start-up firm}}. Empirical results show that institutional investors rely {{on the experience of}} entrepreneurs in managing start-ups and the quality of investor protection to reduce moral hazard. On the other hand, informal investors are also common in initial start-up funding. They tend to be attracted to the type of products in the new firm. In comparison, informal investors are likely to have a social relationship with the entrepreneur, and thus have information about that person's skill and character, which renders entrepreneurial experience less important.

40|$|This paper uses new panel {{data from}} the Kauffman Firm Survey to examine racial {{differences}} in the incidence and determinants of financial capital use among young firms. We find a heavy reliance on owner's equity at startup that declines substantially in subsequent years, whereas the reliance on outsider debt remains as high in subsequent years as {{at the point of}} startup. We find that black-owned businesses face persistent difficulty in accessing external capital markets. Black-owned businesses rely much more on owner equity than do white-owned businesses indicating that black-owned businesses face more difficulty in raising external capital. Direct evidence on average levels of external capital reveals large racial disparities between blacks and whites. Regression analyses indicate that racial disparities in the amounts and types of <b>early</b> <b>financing</b> between blacks and whites do not entirely disappear after controlling for differences in credit quality, human capital, and firm characteristics.

40|$|AbstractFinancing and {{provision}} {{of long-term care}} is an increasingly important concern for many middle-income countries experiencing rapid population aging. We examine three countries (South Korea, Japan, and Germany) that use social insurance to finance medical care and have developed long-term care insurance (LTCI) systems. These countries have adopted different approaches to LTCI design within the social insurance framework. We contrast their financing systems and draw lessons regarding revenue generation, benefits design, and eligibility. Based on this review, it seems important for middle-income countries to start developing LTCI schemes early, before aging becomes a significant problem and substantial revenues are needed. <b>Early</b> <b>financing</b> also ensures that the service delivery system has time to adapt because most middle-income countries lack the infrastructure for providing long-term care services. One approach is {{to start with a}} limited benefit package and strict eligibility rules and expanded the program as the country develops sufficient experience and more providers became available. All three countries use some form of cost-sharing to discourage service overuse, combined with subsidies for poor populations to maintain appropriate access.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} venture capital (VC) syndication creates value for en-trepreneurial firms in two dimensions. First, VC syndication creates product market value for their portfolio firms. Specifically, VC syndicates invest significant amounts in younger firms, in <b>earlier</b> <b>financing</b> rounds, and {{in early stage}} firms. Further, VC syndicates nurture innovation of their portfolio firms and help them achieve better post-initial public offering operating performance. Second, VC syndication creates financial market value for their portfolio firms. Specifically, VC syndicate-backed firms {{are more likely to}} have a successful exit, enjoy a lower initial public offering (IPO) under-pricing, and receive a higher IPO market valuation. The findings are robust to a variety of alter-native syndication measures, subsamples, econometric models, and controlling for endogeneity in VC syndication.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} the intellectual property (IP) system on the market for entrepreneurial finance. If the market for entrepreneurial finance were efficient, investors’ valuations of start-up firms should be independent of whether their patents ’ were pending or granted. However, during the pre-grant period, the need to disclose unprotected knowledge, asymmetric information and adverse selection could result in lower valuations. This study therefore estimates whether patent grant, which reduces uncertainty about the scope of the IP rights conferred, enhances start-up valuations by venture capitalists. Original panel data pertaining to 188 Israeli technological start-ups, who received more than 600 financing rounds, enter a fixed-effects analysis that controls for firms ’ unobserved heterogeneity. The results show a positive association between patent applications and firm valuations. The additional impact of granted patents is positive and significant for younger firms and during <b>early</b> <b>financing</b> rounds but small and insignificant for more mature start-ups. These findings suggest that, in the case of younger start-ups, uncertainty about patent scope, coupled with imperfections in the entrepreneurial finance market, adversely affect the relationship between entrepreneurs and investors. A more speedy examination process of younger firms ’ patent applications therefore could enhance their ability to attract financing. ...|$|E
40|$|While the {{importance}} of venture capital (VC) can be highlighted by policy goals outlined in the 2 ̆ 7 Lisbon agenda 2 ̆ 7, the European VC industry remains nascent {{in comparison to the}} more sophisticated VC market in the US. Researchers have identified key determinants that foster VC success on a broad level, and have often identified syndication as an important factor of success. This paper seeks to understand the role of syndication on the VC-backed company 2 ̆ 7 s success. I take a novel departure from past research in this area in three ways 1) I measure performance {{from the perspective of the}} portfolio company, rather than the VC firm which invests in the company 2) I isolate syndication in the first financing round and 3) I utilize a logistical model as well as a simultaneous equation model for which I introduce an instrumental variable. I gather VC data for both Europe and the US from the VentureXpert database to test various hypotheses regarding syndication. The results are significant and provide evidence to support that syndication in the first financing round is associated with greater success in achieving IPO exit in both regions. This should encourage VC firms, VC-backed companies, and policymakers to increase the practice of VC syndication in <b>early</b> <b>financing</b> rounds, thereby providing access to greater long-term growth opportunities. This paper adds to the existing, but limited, literature base on cross-region venture capital syndication...|$|E
40|$|Committee members: Jeffrey Charles (chair), Jill Watts, Anne LombardThe {{principal}} {{purpose of}} this contextual biography of Dr. Attilio Henry Giannini, known as Doc, is to recognize his importance to the City of San Francisco. He was {{a major contributor to}} the community as a medical practitioner and {{as a member of the}} Board of Supervisors on two occasions. The major part of this thesis also documents Doc's innovative presence as a banker, on both the country's East and the West Coasts. He was a key factor in the <b>early</b> <b>financing</b> of both Broadway and Hollywood. The biography will improve and correct the historiography of the Southern California Motion Picture Industry. It is important to be correct in recognizing the individual who initiated the financing of the Southern California Motion Picture Industry. The industry leaders recognized Doc as the initial principal lender of what became Hollywood, and that is an impelling reason to research and write Doc's biography. He was the first banker to recognize motion picture making as a legitimate industry and was the major financial contributor to the initiation, development and growth of the motion picture industry and its capital city, Hollywood. Doc was a medical practitioner and part time branch bank manager of the Bank of Italy as he initiated and developed the bank's loaning policies and practices toward the movie industry. As Hollywood became the showcase of the country, Dr. Giannini loaned 130, 000, 000 to the Southern California Motion Picture Industry without suffering a single loss. However, the history of Hollywood's main initial financial backer was lost to obscurity, this thesis will restore Dr. Attilio Henry Giannini, the man nobody knows, to his rightfully deserved prominence.
