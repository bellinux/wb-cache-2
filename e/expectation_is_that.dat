5|$|After {{extensive}} {{negotiations to}} implement a collateral structure open to all eurozone countries, on 4 October 2011, a modified escrow collateral agreement was reached. The <b>expectation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> only Finland will utilise it, due, in part, to a requirement to contribute initial capital to European Stability Mechanism in one instalment instead of five instalments over time. Finland, {{as one of the}} strongest AAA countries, can raise the required capital with relative ease.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, in a {{case where}} a child's eyes are {{straightened}} surgically {{after the age of}} about five or six years and the child had no opportunity to develop stereo vision in early childhood, normally the clinical <b>expectation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this intervention will lead to cosmetic improvements but not to stereo vision. Conventionally, no follow-up for stereopsis was performed in such cases.|$|E
25|$|Animals in {{the wild}} appear to be {{relatively}} free from eating disorders although their body composition fluctuates depending on seasonal and reproductive cycles. However, domesticated animals including farm, laboratory and pet animals are prone to disorders. Evolutionary fitness drives feeding behavior in wild animals. The <b>expectation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> farm animals also display this behavior, but questions arise if the same principles apply to laboratory and pet animals.|$|E

2500|$|Captain John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, {{was quoted}} in a December 2011 Reuters article: [...] "Efforts to {{increase}} tension {{in that part of}} the world are unhelpful and counter-productive.

2500|$|In the 4th India – England ODI in the 2008 series, {{the first}} innings was {{interrupted}} by rain on two occasions, resulting in the match being reduced to 22 overs each. India (batting first) made 166/4. England's target was set by the D/L method at 198 from 22 overs. As England knew they had only 22 overs the <b>expectation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they will be able}} to score more runs from those overs than India had from their (interrupted) innings. England made 178/8 from 22 overs, and so the match was listed as [...] "India won by 19 runs (D/L method)".|$|E

2500|$|In March 2007, [...] "ethanol diplomacy" [...] was {{the focus}} of President George W. Bush's Latin American tour, in which he and Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, were seeking to promote the {{production}} and use of sugar cane based ethanol throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The two countries also agreed to share technology and set international standards for biofuels. The Brazilian sugar cane technology transfer will permit various Central American countries, such as Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, several Caribbean countries, and various Andean Countries tariff-free trade with the U.S. thanks to existing concessionary trade agreements. Even though the U.S. imposes a USD 0.54 tariff on every gallon of imported ethanol, the Caribbean nations and countries in the Central American Free Trade Agreement are exempt from such duties if they produce ethanol from crops grown in their own countries. The <b>expectation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> using Brazilian technology for refining sugar cane based ethanol, such countries could become exporters to the United States in the short-term. In August 2007, Brazil's President toured Mexico and several countries in Central America and the Caribbean to promote Brazilian ethanol technology.|$|E

"To be {{resolved}} into the elements," [...] said the hardened atheist, pressing his fettered arms against his bosom; [...] "my hope, trust, and <b>expectation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the mysterious frame of humanity shall melt {{into the general}} mass of nature, to be recompounded in the other forms with which she daily supplies those which daily disappear, and return under different forms--the watery particles to streams and showers, the earthy parts to enrich their mother earth, the airy portions to wanton in the breeze, and those of fire to supply the blaze of Aldebaran and his brethren.--In this faith have I lived, and I will die in it!--Hence! begone!--disturb me no farther!--I have spoken the last word that mortal ears shall listen to." ...|$|E

6000|$|When {{you have}} a theory of any kind, proofs of it are apt to seek you out, and I, who am rather fond of my faith in New England's {{influence}} of this sort, had as pretty an instance of it the day after my arrival as I could wish. A colored brother of Massachusetts birth, as black as a man can well be, and of a merely anthropoidal profile, was driving me along shore {{in search of a}} sea-side hotel when we came upon a weak-minded young chicken in the road. The natural <b>expectation</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> any chicken in these circumstances will wait for your vehicle, and then fly up before it with a loud screech; but this chicken may have been overcome by the heat (it was a land breeze and it drew like the breath of a furnace over the hay-cocks and the clover), or it may have mistimed the wheel, which passed over its head and left it to flop a moment in the dust and then fall still. The poor little tragedy was sufficiently distressful to me, but I bore it well, compared with my driver. He could hardly stop lamenting it; and when presently we met a young farmer, he pulled up. [...] "You goin' past Jim Marden's?" [...] "Yes." [...] "Well, I wish you'd tell him I just run over a chicken of his, and I killed it, I guess. I guess it was a pretty big one." [...] "Oh no," [...] I put in, [...] "it was only a broiler. What {{do you think it was}} worth?" [...] I took out some money, and the farmer noted the largest coin in my hand; [...] "About half a dollar, I guess." [...] On this I put it all back in my pocket, and then he said, [...] "Well, if a chicken don't know enough to get out of the road, I guess you ain't to blame." [...] I expressed that this was my own view of the case, and we drove on. When we parted I gave the half-dollar to my driver, and begged him not to let the owner of the chicken come on me for damages; and though he chuckled his pleasure in the joke, I could see that he was still unhappy, and I have no doubt that he has that pullet on his conscience yet, unless he has paid for it. He was of a race which elsewhere has so immemorially plundered hen-roosts that chickens are as free to it as the air it breathes, without any conceivable taint of private ownership. But the spirit of New England had so deeply entered into him that the imbecile broiler of another, slain by pure accident and by its own contributory negligence, was saddening him, while I was off in my train without a pang for the owner and with only an agreeable pathos for the pullet.|$|E
