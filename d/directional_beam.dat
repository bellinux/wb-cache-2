40|$|It is {{possible}} to obtain enhanced and <b>directional</b> <b>beams</b> using subwavelength metallic structures. However, the enhanced beams throughout such structures are only directed towards the propagation direction. In this study, we design the output surface gratings asymmetrically in order to steer the beaming angle. We use a metallic structure with a subwavelength slit (λ/ 10) and grating periods of 14 mm and 22 mm on different sides of the output surface. We demonstrate off-axis <b>directional</b> <b>beaming</b> in the microwave regime with an FWHM of 10 ° with a beaming angle of 15 °. The beaming angle can be changed by arranging the grating periods of the output surface of the metallic structure. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and radar, a planar array is an antenna {{in which all}} of the elements, both active and parasitic, are in one plane. A planar array provides a large aperture and {{may be used for}} <b>directional</b> <b>beam</b> control by varying the relative phase of each element. A planar array may be used with a reflecting screen behind the active plane.|$|E
50|$|Some of the station's radio {{transmitters}} {{were utilized}} for wide area radio broadcasts using a single, constant radio frequency, while others provided dedicated radio transmissions, i.e. radio circuits, to individual Navy ships, using <b>directional</b> <b>beam</b> antennas. Transmitters assigned to individual ship circuits were often changed in frequency, as dictated by changing ionospheric conditions and resultant signal fading, or other tactical reasons.|$|E

40|$|The random-access (RA) {{technique}} {{is a key}} procedure in cellular networks and self-organizing networks (SONs), but the overall processing time of this technique in millimeter-wave (mm-wave) cellular systems with <b>directional</b> <b>beams</b> is very long because RA preambles (RAPs) should be transmitted in all directions of Tx and Rx beams. In this paper, {{two different types of}} preambles (RAP- 1 and RAP- 2) are proposed to reduce the processing time in the RA stage. After analyzing the correlation property, false-alarm probability, and detection probability of the proposed RAPs, we perform simulations to show that the RAP- 2 is suitable for RA in mm-wave cellular systems with <b>directional</b> <b>beams</b> because of the smaller processing time and high detection probability in multiuser environments...|$|R
30|$|According to {{the above}} analysis, a large spacing is {{beneficial}} for realizing the highly <b>directional</b> <b>beaming</b> with the independent foci of microlenses in an array. However, the large spacing results in a relatively low fill factor, which deteriorates the optical efficiency. For practical applications, a trade-off should be taken.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{two-stage}} filter {{structure is}} introduced for speech enhancement. The first stage is an adjustable filter and sum beam-former with four-microphone array. The control of beam-forming filter is realized by adjusting {{only a single}} control variable. Different from the adaptive beam-forming filter, the proposed filter structure does not bring to any adaptive error noise, thus, it also does not bring the trouble to {{the second stage of}} the speech signal processing. The second stage of the proposed filter is a Wiener filter. The estimation of signal’s power spectrum for Wiener filter is realized by cross-correlation between primary outputs of two adjacent <b>directional</b> <b>beams.</b> This estimation {{is based on the assumption}} that the noise outputs of the two adjacent <b>directional</b> <b>beams</b> come from two independent noise source but the speech outputs come from the same speech source. The simulation results shown that the proposed algorithm can improve the Signal-Noise-Ratio (SNR) about 6 dB...|$|R
50|$|Straggling: Energy loss of {{particle}} in a dense medium is statistical in nature {{due to a}} large number of individual collisions between the particle and sample. Thus the evolution of an initially mono energetic and mono <b>directional</b> <b>beam</b> leads to dispersion of energy and direction. The resulting statistical energy distribution or deviation from initial energy is called energy straggling. Energy straggling data are plotted as a function of depth in the material.|$|E
5000|$|In all wave-producing sources, the {{directivity}} of any source, at maximum, {{corresponds to}} the size of the source compared to the wavelengths it is generating: The larger the source is compared to the wavelength of the sound waves, the more <b>directional</b> <b>beam</b> results [...] The specific transduction method has no impact on the directivity of the resulting sound field; the analysis relies only on the aperture function of the source, per the Huygens-Fresnel principle.|$|E
5000|$|Following the Donald Report {{and discussions}} with the Dominions, {{it was decided that}} the {{high-power}} Rugby longwave station (announced on 13 July 1922 by the previous government) would be completed since it used proven technology, in addition to which a number of shortwave [...] "beam stations" [...] would be built (so called because a directional antenna concentrated the radio transmission into a narrow <b>directional</b> <b>beam).</b> The beam stations would communicate with those Dominions that chose the new shortwave technology. Parliament finally approved an agreement between the Post Office and Marconi to build beam stations to communicate with Canada, South Africa, India and Australia, on 1 August 1924.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this article}} is to {{introduce}} a nanowriter system that could lead to a sub-micrometer spot size using a visible light source under ambient conditions. The key component of the system is a focusing optical head, which incorporates a plasmonic-based lens instead of a conventional lens. Based on knowledge of the physical origin of extraordinary transmission and <b>directional</b> <b>beaming,</b> we theorize that the <b>directional</b> <b>beaming</b> phenomenon can be explained simply as a surface plasmon (SP) diffraction along the corrugations as long as the multiple scattering effects are taken into account to modify the dispersion relationship of the surface plasmon. We introduce a Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) formulation to pursue a precise dispersion relationship needed for the lens design. Comparing the resultant theoretical data between Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations and RCWA results, we found good agreement and the many important characteristic parameters needed for an innovative lens design. We also set up a writing-test optomechanical system to examine the photoresist exposure ability of the plasmonic-based lens...|$|R

5000|$|Like other toothed whales, the pygmy {{sperm whale}} has a [...] "melon", a body of fat and wax in the head that it uses to focus and {{modulate}} the sounds it makes. The inner core of the melon has a higher wax content than the outer cortex. The inner core transmits sound more slowly than the outer layer, allowing it to refract sound into a highly <b>directional</b> <b>beam.</b> Behind the melon, separated by a thin membrane, is the spermaceti organ. Both the melon and the spermaceti organ are encased in a thick fibrous coat, resembling a bursa. The whale produces sound by moving air through the right nasal cavity, which includes a valvular structure, or museau de singe, with a thickened vocal reed, functioning like the vocal cords of humans.|$|E
50|$|The station {{broadcasts}} at 50,000 watts {{around the}} clock from facilities in Miramar, Florida, but broadcasts on a <b>directional</b> <b>beam</b> at night to the south, to protect Class-A clear channel stations WOR in New York City and KIRO in Seattle. This, in consequence, gives the station a clear signal over the neighboring nation of Cuba. Because of the broadcast area over Cuba, Radio Martí broadcasts an hour of news on WAQI nightly from midnight to 1AM. However, its signal {{is reported to be}} jammed in that nation's capital by the co-channel signal of Havana-based Radio Rebelde. http://uscpublicdiplomacy.com/index.php/newsroom/pdblog_detail/070104_tv_radio_marti_boost_their_volume_to_cuba_expanding_their_services/ The jamming is likely due to intentional suppression of the station's programming, which typically voices anti-Castro, anti-communist sentiment, shared overwhelmingly by the Cuban diaspora of the United States and especially those in the station's home area of South Florida.|$|E
5000|$|While the 2-meter band is {{best known}} as a local band using the FM Mode, there are many {{opportunities}} for long distance(DX) communications using other modes. The typical 2 meter station using CW (Morse code) or SSB (single side band) modes consists of an exciter (radio) driving a power amplifier generating about 200-500 watts of RF power. This power is usually fed to a multi-element horizontally polarized, <b>directional</b> <b>beam</b> antenna knowns as a Yagi. Stations that are located in relatively high locations with views clear to the horizon have a big advantage over other stations at lower elevations. Such stations are able to communicate 100-300 mi consistently and it is not unusual to be heard at distances much further; beyond line of sight. These distances can be traversed on a daily basis without any noticeable help from known [...] "Signal Enhancements". However, when coupled with these well known signal enhancements, astonishing distances can be bridged.|$|E
50|$|For VLF, LF, MF and HF the ERP is {{typically}} not determined separately. In {{most cases the}} transmission power found in lists of transmitters is the value for {{the output of the}} transmitter. This is only correct for omnidirectional aerials with a length of a quarter wavelength or shorter. For other aerial types there are gain factors, which can reach values until 50 for shortwave <b>directional</b> <b>beams</b> in the direction of maximum beam intensity.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{compensate}} for the outdoor impairments, especially those associated with propagation losses at high frequencies, beamforming can be used. Beamforming uses an array of active antenna elements to form <b>directional</b> <b>beams</b> to enhance the signal for desired recipients, while nulling the interference for others. The short wavelength corresponding to high frequencies allows large-sized phased-array antennas to be exploited, which can offer a large beamforming gain while keeping the size of active antenna elements low.|$|R
30|$|A {{detailed}} {{method for}} constructing an assortative ad-hoc network {{is beyond the}} scope of this study. However, this could be achieved by selecting node deployment techniques and transmission-power control techniques. For example, nodes with similar degrees are likely to be connected when more nodes are arranged near the center of the field. Constructing shortcut links between nodes with similar degrees also contributed toward an assortative network and reflected cases in which nodes used <b>directional</b> <b>beams</b> or long-range omnidirectional transmission.|$|R
5000|$|Earlier remotes {{could turn}} sets on/off and change channels, but were {{connected}} to the TV with a cable. The Flash-matic came in response to consumer complaints about the inconvenience of these cables running from the transmitter to the TV monitor. Earlier remotes served as the central control system for transmitting complex signals to the receiving monitor. The Flash-matic instead placed the complexity in the receiver {{as opposed to the}} transmitter. It used a <b>directional</b> <b>beam</b> of light to control a television outfitted with four photo cells in the corners of the screen. The light signal would activate one of the four control functions, which turned the picture and sound on or off, and turned the channel tuner dial clockwise and counter-clockwise. The bottom receptors received the signal to mute and power on/off, and the upper cells received signals to channel up/down. In order for the various signals to be received by the monitor, the remote control had to be directed towards one of the four photocells. The system responded to full-spectrum light so could be activated or interfered with by other light sources including indoor light bulbs and the sun. Despite these defects, the Flash-matic remained in high demand. In September 1955, Zenith released an apology for its inability to meet the high demand of consumers. The Flash-matic was quickly replaced by new control systems. The [...] "Zenith Space Command" [...] remote control went into production in 1956 with aims to improve upon the Flash-matic's design.|$|E
5000|$|The station {{comprised}} 1,937 acres. The core of its transmission capability {{was located}} in two transmitter buildings. The primary building, referred to as [...] "Main Deck", housed {{a large number of}} high power, high frequency (HF) transmitters. It also housed microwave radio-relay equipment for reception and distribution of data received from the NavComStaPhil for subsequent short-wave radio transmission. The secondary transmitter building, referred to as [...] "Bull Horn", housed a smaller number of transmitters, but with similar capabilities to those at Main Deck. Additionally, the Bull Horn site held the S-500 transmitter trailer. The S-500, known affectionately as [...] "Big Sam", was a high power, low frequency (LF) transmitter dedicated for fleet broadcast, capable of generating 500 kW of broadcast signal power. Radio transmitters employed at both sites were in the category of high-power output, meaning, they generated radio signal powers in the range from a few kilowatts (kW) to several 10's of kW, but the majority of transmitters operated at either 10 kW or 40 kW. A large number and variety of LF and HF antennas were used at both transmitter sites. These included <b>directional</b> (<b>beam</b> antennas), omnidirectional antennas, and tall antenna towers for dedicated, wide-area broadcast capability. An extensive infrastructure supported the station. This included a multi-purpose building with barracks, administration offices, mess hall, navy exchange, and recreation room; an enlisted men's club, autonomous power generating facility, water and sewer treatment facilities, helicopter pad, and security posts. Eventually, a swimming pool and tennis court were added.|$|E

30|$|Directional {{transmission}} can overcome this disadvantage. A directional antenna can form a <b>directional</b> <b>beam</b> {{pointing at the}} receiver by concentrating its transmit power into that direction.
