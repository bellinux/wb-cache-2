5|$|A major {{example of}} 18th century {{architecture}} lies {{just outside the}} city (although within the City of Leeds boundaries) in the Grade I listed Harewood <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> was built between 1759 and 1771 and funded from the proceeds of the West Indian Slave Trade.|$|E
5|$|On April 9, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia {{continued}} to flee westward. Infantry led by Generals John Brown Gordon and James Longstreet, and cavalry led by Fitzhugh Lee formed a battle line near the Appomattox Court <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> was their {{last chance to}} escape to Lynchburg, as Union troops were attempting to surround them.|$|E
5|$|A {{landscaped}} {{park with}} lakes and statues {{was laid out}} around the house, and the drive to the house was along a semicircular avenue of trees. Sir Edward died in 1766. Sir Gregory Page-Turner, 3rd Baronet considered the house too large, so in 1767 he sought to demolish part of it to create a smaller <b>house.</b> <b>This</b> proved impossible so in 1768 he had the entire house demolished.|$|E

40|$|Social {{housing in}} the UK is {{currently}} required to meet higher levels of sustainability than new private housing. But since tenants have little choice about their <b>housing,</b> <b>this</b> poses important issues about coerced consumption of sustainable <b>housing.</b> <b>This</b> article reports on on a survey of tenants attitudes to 'sustainable' features of their housing in two developments in Kent...|$|R
5|$|A smaller barn {{built in}} the 16thcentury, the Little Barn, was {{converted}} to a library and opened on 2 November 1937. The original cowbyre was destroyed by fire in 1979 and was rebuilt as an exhibition centre. An archaeological excavation {{was carried out by}} the Museum of London Archaeological Service in 1997 around the Farm <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> discovered the remains of the old priory were beneath the house, as this had been the bailey, surrounded by the motte.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the <b>house.</b> <b>This</b> altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E
5|$|Among the few {{surviving}} {{buildings of}} Faversham Abbey {{are the two}} barns at Abbey Farm. Minor Barn was built around 1425; Major Barn, {{the larger of the}} two, dates from 1476. Next to the barns is the Abbey Farmhouse, part of which dates from the 14th century. The Abbey Guest house, {{on the east side of}} the Abbey's Outer Gateway, has survived as Arden's <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> house, now a private residence in Abbey Street, was the location of the murder of Thomas Arden in 1551. The Faversham Almshouses were founded and endowed by Thomas Manfield in 1614, with additional houses being built by Henry Wright in 1823.|$|E

5|$|Another celebrated {{image of}} Washington is the Lansdowne {{portrait}}, a large portrait with one version {{hanging in the}} East Room of the White <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> painting was saved during the burning of Washington by British troops in the War of 1812 through the intervention of First Lady Dolley Madison and Paul Jennings, one of President James Madison's slaves. Four versions of the portrait are attributed to Stuart, and additional copies were painted by other artists for display in U.S. government buildings. In 1803, Stuart opened a studio in Washington, D. C.|$|E
5|$|Because of the immigrants’ {{loneliness}} {{for their}} homeland, Addams started hosting ethnic evenings at Hull <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> would include ethnic food, dancing, music, {{and maybe a}} short lecture on a topic of interest. Some of the themed evenings were Italian, Greek, German, Polish, etc. Ellen Gates Starr described one Italian evening as having the room packed full with people. One of the ladies who attended “recited a patriotic poem with great spirit” and everyone was moved by it.|$|E
5|$|Between late 1962 {{and early}} 1964 the east {{ends of the}} {{platforms}} were extended to allow longer 8-car trains to be operated. This involved carefully enlarging the tunnels under the Metropolitan Police's original headquarters at New Scotland Yard (now Norman Shaw Buildings). The station was completely rebuilt to incorporate new deep-level platforms for the Jubilee line when it was extended to the London Docklands in the 1990s. During the works, {{the level of the}} sub-surface platforms was lowered to enable ground level access to Portcullis <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> was achieved in small increments which were carried out when the line was closed at night.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the house, which has a full basement, the museum uses a separate building as a gallery. That building, the Northwest Gallery, was formerly used for storage and as a shop, but looks similar to the Rice <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> gallery focuses on items from Oregon, Idaho, and Washington, and includes collections of agates, thundereggs, zeolites, and placer gold, among others.|$|E
5|$|In {{incidents}} on 18 April, 21 May and 15 December, {{tear gas}} grenades were fired at Rajab's {{house in the}} village of Bani Jamra by unknown assailants. In the first incident, HRW identified the grenades thrown into the Rajab family's compound as US-manufactured munitions to which only Bahrain's security forces would have had access. Tear gas penetrated into the adjacent home of Rajab's 78-year-old mother who suffers from respiratory disease, causing her great distress. On 21 May, four gas grenades were fired at the <b>house.</b> <b>This</b> time, according to Rajab, the grenades were smaller than those used in the mid-April assault and there were no marks identifying the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|In the {{indirect}} or French process, metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907°C (typically around 1000°C). Zinc vapor reacts with the {{oxygen in the}} air to give ZnO, accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag <b>house.</b> <b>This</b> indirect method was popularized by LeClaire (France) in 1844 and therefore is commonly known as the French process. Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process.|$|E

In conversation, Judd unintentionally reveals that Jacqueline is staying with Mary at the rooming <b>house.</b> <b>This</b> makes the audience aware that the Palladists were able to trace Jacqueline to Mary's room to kidnap her. In the truncated theatrical print, how the Palladists found Jacqueline is left unclear.|$|E
5|$|Soay has a {{primitive}} hut known as Taigh Dugan (Dugan's <b>house).</b> <b>This</b> {{is little more}} than an excavated hole under a huge stone with two rude walls on the sides. The story of its creation relates to two sheep-stealing brothers from Lewis who came to St Kilda only to cause further trouble. Dugan was exiled to Soay, where he died; the other, called Fearchar Mòr, was sent to Stac an Armin, where he found life so intolerable he cast himself into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the park was originally waterlogged marshland and a lake covered the area {{of what is now}} the Museum Gardens. The land was drained in the early 19th century and the Museum Gardens were raised with silt dredged from Minster Pool. The large northern area of the park once formed the land and gardens of Beacon <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> land was incorporated into the park when the owner of Beacon House, Colonel Swinfen Broun, donated the land after his death.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{political}} division is unknown. It might have happened {{at the beginning of}} Peribsen's rule or shortly before. Because Peribsen chose the deity Seth as his new throne patron, Egyptologists are of the view that Peribsen was a chieftain from Thinis or a prince of the Thinite royal <b>house.</b> <b>This</b> theory is based on Seth being a deity of Thinite origin, which would explain Peribsen's choice: his name changing may have been nothing more than smart political (and religious) propaganda. Peribsen is thought to have gained the Thinite throne and ruled only Upper Egypt, whilst other rulers held the Memphite throne and ruled Lower Egypt.|$|E
5|$|West of Winton, NY96 {{passes through}} the East Avenue Historic District, a {{primarily}} residential area with historic upper-class houses, including the George Eastman <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> stretch of the route was narrowed in mid-2010 from four lanes to two, to improve the residential feel and reduce automobile speeds. At Alexander Street, the environment turns more commercial as the route enters the downtown area. After crossing the Inner Loop, the route passes the Little Theatre before terminating at a Y-junction with East Main Street.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{entered the}} White House as a bachelor, {{and his sister}} Rose Cleveland joined him, to act as hostess {{for the first two}} years of his administration. However, unlike the {{previous}} bachelor president James Buchanan, Cleveland did not remain a bachelor for very long. In 1885 the daughter of Cleveland's friend Oscar Folsom visited him in Washington. Frances Folsom was a student at Wells College. When she returned to school, President Cleveland received her mother's permission to correspond with her, and they were soon engaged to be married. On June 2, 1886, Cleveland married Frances Folsom in the Blue Room at the White House. He was the second President to wed while in office, and has been the only President married in the White <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> marriage was unusual, since Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom's estate and had supervised Frances's upbringing after her father's death; nevertheless, the public took no exception to the match. At 21 years, Frances Folsom Cleveland was the youngest First Lady in history, and the public soon warmed to her beauty and warm personality.|$|E
