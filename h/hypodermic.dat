5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection moulding machine in 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it worked like a large <b>hypodermic</b> needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E
5|$|Artemis decodes the Book using {{translating}} software, {{and in the}} process, learns {{the specifics}} of the ritual fairies use to replenish their magic: take an acorn from an ancient oak tree near a bend in a river under the full moon and plant it elsewhere. Artemis and Butler track down 129 possible locations for the ritual and start a stakeout, they discover Holly performing the ritual. Butler tranquilizes Holly with a <b>hypodermic</b> dart gun.|$|E
5|$|In Los Angeles, Garrett Lorre, {{a middle-aged}} businessman, embarks on a one night stand with an {{anonymous}} woman he has {{met at a}} corporate party. However, as they are having sex in his hot tub, the woman bites Lorre to drink his blood. Two other men join the woman, helping her kill Lorre by repeatedly stabbing him using <b>hypodermic</b> needles.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hypodermics</b> on the shore: Medical {{waste was}} found {{washed up on}} the beaches of Long Island, New Jersey, and Connecticut after being {{illegally}} dumped at sea. Before this event, waste dumped in the oceans was an [...] "out of sight, out of mind" [...] affair. This has been cited {{as one of the}} crucial turning points in popular opinion on environmentalism.|$|R
50|$|The iMedicor Web portal, {{which went}} live on October 10, 2007, is online {{personal}} health data exchange and secure messaging portal for physician collaboration, community and referrals. iMedicor reached its 32,000th physician registration on December 12, 2007. It {{has been discussed}} in such journals as Healthcare Informatics, Advance for Health Information Professionals, Virtual Medical Worlds, and Highway <b>Hypodermics</b> among others and received positive review by the Internet journal Medgadget.|$|R
50|$|Richard Virenque (born 19 November 1969) is {{a retired}} French {{professional}} road racing cyclist. He {{was one of the}} most popular French riders with fans for his boyish personality and his long, lone attacks. He was a climber, winning the King of the Mountains competition of the Tour de France a record seven times. He is best remembered as the central figure in a widespread doping scandal in 1998, and his being regularly displayed as a moronic rubber puppet with <b>hypodermics</b> in his head on the satirical television programme, Les Guignols de l'info.|$|R
5|$|In Traverse City, Michigan, Mary Lefante {{goes to a}} local {{pharmacy}} to get her passport photo taken. Realizing she {{has forgotten}} her wallet, she returns to her car and finds that her boyfriend has been murdered. The killer, clad in a hooded raincoat, renders Lefante unconscious with a <b>hypodermic</b> needle, then kidnaps her. Meanwhile, in the pharmacy, the elderly clerk peels open Lefante's developed photo, which shows her screaming amidst a distorted background.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{performances}} often set {{the play}} in the contemporary world. For example, in 1986, the Royal Shakespeare Company set the play in modern Verona. Switchblades replaced swords, feasts and balls became drug-laden rock parties, and Romeo committed suicide by <b>hypodermic</b> needle. In 1997, the Folger Shakespeare Theatre produced a version set in a typical suburban world. Romeo sneaks into the Capulet barbecue to meet Juliet, and Juliet discovers Tybalt's death while in class at school.|$|E
5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} <b>hypodermic</b> syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E

[...] "Sometimes almost am I convinced that you are utterly Red Cloud, planting your acorns and singing your savage joy of the planting. And, sometimes, almost you are to me the ultramodern man, the last word of the two-legged, male human that finds Trojan adventures in sieges of statistics, and, armed with test tubes and <b>hypodermics,</b> engages in gladiatorial contests with weird microorganisms. Almost, at times, it seems you should wear glasses and be bald-headed; almost, it seems...." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{never moved}} after he struck. The seventy-foot fall broke {{his neck and}} crushed his skull. And right there Young Dick learned death--not the ordered, decent death of civilization, wherein doctors and nurses and <b>hypodermics</b> ease the {{stricken}} one into the darkness, and ceremony and function and flowers and undertaking institutions conspire to give a happy leave-taking and send-off to the departing shade, but sudden death, primitive death, ugly and ungarnished, like {{the death of a}} steer in the shambles or a fat swine stuck in the jugular.|$|R
50|$|Nancy's haircolor {{is changed}} to titian, George's from black to brown, {{and the story}} {{eliminates}} subplots and extraneous descriptive vocabulary, including non-essential scenes and passages, including descriptive and humorous passages where Nancy works undercover as a file clerk and finds the work unappealing. Additionally, the revised version removes questionable (in 1969) descriptive elements of George's drugged status and <b>hypodermics.</b> Strangely, the revision also eliminates the importance of George's recovery; although she leads investigators {{to the scene of}} the kidnapping, Mr. Drew is nearly as instrumental in finding Nancy as George. Her discovery of a dress button Nancy has planted at the scene is downplayed. In the original version, Nancy has changed clothes, so only George knows what Nancy and Bess were wearing when they disappeared.|$|R
5|$|In {{the decade}} {{between the end}} of the Star Trek {{television}} series and the film, many of the futuristic technologies that appeared on the show—electronic doors that open automatically, <b>hypodermic</b> injections, talking computers, weapons that stun rather than kill, and personal communication devices—had become a reality. Roddenberry had insisted that the technology aboard the Enterprise be grounded in established science and scientific theories. The Motion Picture likewise received technical consultation from NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as individuals such as a former astronaut and the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} to find himself {{strapped}} to a table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before inserting a large <b>hypodermic</b> needle into his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben enters, carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, <b>hypodermic</b> needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5000|$|The third segment, [...] "Night of the Dolphin" [...] {{was written}} by Carolyn Omine. The writers {{wanted to have a}} segment in a tribute to an animal and settled on dolphins, because they are [...] "the friendliest animal in the world". Omine {{conceived}} the way the dolphins walked on land and pitched this to director Matthew Nastuk. The King Dolphin's voice is Harry Shearer's normal voice. There are two deleted scenes that are now available on the DVD: One with Dr. Julius Hibbert fighting with <b>hypodermics</b> and one where Moe Szyslak puts a gas tube down a dolphin's blow hole during the humans vs. dolphin war. During production, the writers included a scene with Kang and Kodos, which was mentioned at the episode's conclusion. Several elements of the [...] "Night of the Dolphin" [...] segment was used in The Simpsons Game.|$|R
2500|$|Later, {{he became}} {{the editor of the}} art {{magazine}} Artele Frumoase, and, in 1922, traveled to Transylvania, where he befriended Aurel Popp. The same year, he took Camil Ressu's defense during a scandal involving the latter's design for a National Theater curtain, attacking the artistic guidelines advocated by the cultural establishment (" [...] the country where scientist historians compose erotic pieces and embarrassing rhymes, [...] where intellectual women draw the gusty gestures of decrepit election agents, [...] where physicians push their rusty <b>hypodermics</b> into the unmentionable muscle tissues of artists as a means to draw up aesthetical logarithms"). In 1926, Tonitza, Oscar Han, Francisc Şirato, and Ştefan Dimitrescu, organized themselves as Grupul celor patru ("The Group of Four"). He met success in 1925, after opening a large exhibit of his Vălenii de Munte paintings in Bucharest, while raising controversy (including criticism from Ressu) over his [...] "poster-like" [...] style.|$|R
50|$|Captain D.C. Heggie, RCAMC, the depot's Medical Officer, {{spent the}} night of 3/4 May under fire amid bombs and falling masonry, binding up wounds and {{relieving}} suffering. He forced his way into demolished buildings, directed rescue operations and at times crawled into cellars to administer <b>hypodermics</b> to trapped and wounded civilians. Once he was lowered head-first into {{the basement of a}} wrecked dwelling to give morphine to a badly crushed civilian pinned in the ruins. For his 'conspicuous gallantry' on that night, he was awarded the George Medal. Early on the 7th, a land mine was dropped near the First Aid Post, injuring Captain Heggie in the head. Although bleeding profusely, he dragged himself to the injured Nursing Sisters and pulled them clear of the wreckage, and helped bandage their wounds. Then loss of blood forced him to give in, and the following day he was evacuated to a Canadian military hospital.|$|R
5|$|Starting in mid-August, {{there was}} a string of attacks in which as many as 476 {{individuals}} may have been stabbed with <b>hypodermic</b> needles. Officials believed that the attacks were targeting Han civilians and had been perpetrated by Uyghur separatists. In response to both concern over the attacks and dissatisfaction over the government's slowness in prosecuting people involved with the July riots, thousands of Hans protested in the streets. On 3 September, five people died during the protests and 14 were injured, according to an official. The next day, the Communist Party Chief of Ürümqi, Li Zhi, was removed from his post, along with the police chief, Liu Yaohua; the provincial Party secretary Wang Lequan was replaced in April 2010.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated <b>hypodermic</b> needles. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E
5|$|With the Orca slowly sinking, {{the trio}} attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on scuba gear {{and enters the}} water in a shark-proof cage, {{intending}} to lethally inject the shark with strychnine using a <b>hypodermic</b> spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly, killing Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the mast, shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, destroying it. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces, and he and Brody paddle to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage.|$|E
5000|$|The Festina affair {{led to a}} {{trial in}} Lille, {{northern}} France, in October 2000. Virenque was a witness with others from the former Festina team. He at first denied he had doped himself but then confessed. [...] "Oui, je me suis dopé", he told the court's president, Daniel Delegove, on 24 October. But he denied doping himself intentionally. Voet said {{he was aware of}} what he was doing and participated in trafficking between cyclists. Virenque said this happened without his approval. That led the satirical television programme, Les Guignols de l'info - which displayed Virenque as a moronic rubber puppet with <b>hypodermics</b> in his head - to change his words to [...] "à l'insu de mon plein gré" [...] ("willingly but without knowing"), and the phrase passed into French popular culture as a sign of hypocritical denial. Voet wrote a book, Massacre à la Chaîne, published in a legally-censored English edition as Breaking the Chain, in which he came close to identifying Virenque as an unrepentant doper.|$|R
40|$|Aspiration {{during any}} kind of {{injection}} is meant {{to ensure that the}} needle tip is at the desired location during this blind procedure. While aspiration appears to be a simple procedure, it has generated a lot of controversy concerning the perceived benefits and indications. Advocates and opponents of aspiration both make logically sound claims. However, due to scarcity of available data, {{there is no evidence that}} this procedure is truly beneficial or unwarranted. Keeping in view the huge number of injections given worldwide, it is important that we draw attention to key questions regarding aspiration that, up till now, remain unanswered. In this review, we have attempted to gather and present literature on aspiration both from published and non-published sources in order to provide not only an exhaustive review of the subject, but also a starting point for further studies on more specific areas requiring clarification. A literature review was conducted using the US National Institute of Health’s PubMed service (including Medline), Google Scholar and Scopus. Guidelines provided by the World Health Organization, Safe Injection Global Network, International Council of Nursing, Center for Disease Control, US Federal Drug Agency, UK National Health Services, British Medical Association, Europe Nursing and Midwifery Council, Public Health Agency Canada, Pakistan Medical Association and International Organization of Standardization recommendations 7886 parts 1 - 4 for sterile <b>hypodermics</b> were reviewed for relevant information. In addition, curricula of several medical/nursing schools from India, Nigeria and Pakistan, the US pharmacopeia Data from the WHO Program for International Drug Monitoring network in regard to adverse events as a result of not aspirating prior to injection delivery were reviewed. Curricula of selected major medical/nursing schools in India, Nigeria and Pakistan, national therapeutic formularies, product inserts of most commonly used drugs and other possible sources of information regarding aspiration and injections were consulted as well...|$|R
5|$|Scully visits Kresge, {{wanting to}} look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, {{despite the fact}} that the police think it is a simple suicide. Scully finds a {{striking}} resemblance between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when she was a little girl but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used <b>hypodermic</b> needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E
25|$|Parenteral {{administration}} {{can be performed}} by injection, that is, using a needle (usually a <b>hypodermic</b> needle) and a syringe, or by the insertion of an indwelling catheter.|$|E
25|$|A jet {{injector}} {{is a type}} of medical injecting syringe that uses a high-pressure narrow jet of the injection liquid instead of a <b>hypodermic</b> needle to penetrate the epidermis. The {{jet injector}} was invented by Aaron Ismach in 1962.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{successfully}} applied to air flow in lung alveoli, for the flow through a drinking straw {{or through a}} <b>hypodermic</b> needle. It was experimentally derived independently by Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille in 1838 and Gotthilf Heinrich Ludwig Hagen, and published by Poiseuille in 1840–41 and 1846.|$|E
25|$|A sharps {{container}} is a {{hard plastic}} container {{that is used to}} safely dispose of <b>hypodermic</b> needles and other sharp medical instruments, such as an IV catheters and disposable scalpels. Sharps containers may be single use which are disposed of with the waste inside, or reusable which are robotically emptied and sterilized before being returned for re-use.|$|E
25|$|Most {{vaccines}} {{are given}} by <b>hypodermic</b> injection {{as they are}} not absorbed reliably through the intestines. Live attenuated polio, some typhoid, and some cholera vaccines are given orally to produce immunity in the bowel. While vaccination provides a lasting effect, it usually takes several weeks to develop, while passive immunity (the transfer of antibodies) has immediate effect.|$|E
25|$|Male {{sheep and}} pigs – Wireless Microvalve. Using a {{piezoelectric}} polymer that will deform {{when exposed to}} a specific electric field broadcast from a key fob (like a car alarm) the valve will open or close, preventing the passage of sperm, but not seminal fluid.

25|$|Morphine {{was first}} {{isolated}} between 1803 and 1805 by Friedrich Sertürner. This is generally {{believed to be}} the first isolation of an active ingredient from a plant. Merck began marketing it commercially in 1827. Morphine was more widely used after the invention of the <b>hypodermic</b> syringe in 1853–1855. Sertürner originally named the substance morphium after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus, as it has a tendency to cause sleep.|$|E
25|$|Poirot then {{calls for}} a meeting and {{explains}} how {{each member of the}} family has, in turn, discovered Mrs. Boynton to be dead and, suspecting another family member, failed to report the fact. None of the family would have needed to murder the victim with a <b>hypodermic,</b> since an overdose could much more effectively have been administered in her medicine. This places the suspicion on one of the outsiders.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} autopsy recorded {{kidney failure}} {{as the cause}} of death. Hughes was in extremely poor physical condition {{at the time of his}} death. He suffered from malnutrition. While his kidneys were damaged, his other internal organs, including his brain, were deemed perfectly healthy. X-rays revealed five broken-off <b>hypodermic</b> needles in the flesh of his arms. To inject codeine into his muscles, Hughes had used glass syringes with metal needles that easily became detached.|$|E
25|$|The urticating setae or spines {{can cause}} {{irritation}} when they break off and lodge in skin. In some species these structures are hollow {{and connected to}} poison-producing cells, functioning like a <b>hypodermic</b> needle. Generally most hairs are only irritating, but some are dangerous to the eyes and respiratory tract, and some can cause severe skin necrosis and shedding. Certain species of Lonomia in the family Saturniidae actually can inject venom that is life-threatening to humans.|$|E
25|$|Myovirus bacteriophages use a <b>hypodermic</b> syringe-like {{motion to}} inject their genetic {{material}} into the cell. After making {{contact with the}} appropriate receptor, the tail fibers flex to bring the base plate closer {{to the surface of}} the cell; this is known as reversible binding. Once attached completely, irreversible binding is initiated and the tail contracts, possibly with the help of ATP present in the tail, injecting genetic material through the bacterial membrane.|$|E
25|$|Could {{the same}} {{ordinance}} cover <b>hypodermic</b> needles, Pritzker was asked. He replied that Illinois law already prohibited their possession or sale without a prescription, and limited their sale to pharmacies. Also, he noted, states like North Dakota had exempted {{them when they}} adopted the DEA model, since it was common for farmers to inject veterinary medicine into animals themselves. He denied that a needle ban would be vague because the law already clearly defined hyodermic needles and syringes.|$|E
