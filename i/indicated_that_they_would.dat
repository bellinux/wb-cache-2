5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse {{and told them that}} this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|Republican {{legislative}} {{leaders said}} that they would not whip their members to vote for Shumlin, leaving them free to vote their consciences. Though Republican Lieutenant Governor Phillip Scott did not have a vote, he said that he would vote for Shumlin, and Republican State Representative Kurt Wright said that he would do so. Initially, no Democrats <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> vote for Milne. Indeed, several Democrats whose districts voted for Milne over Shumlin {{said that they}} would vote for Shumlin, citing his plurality win.|$|E
5|$|The organisers of the Philadelphia Cycling Classic <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> {{invite the}} top twenty ranked UCI teams {{at the end}} of 2014, and then any further {{allocations}} would be assigned to highly ranked national teams and other UCI teams. A list of seventeen participating teams was published in March, just over 10 weeks prior to the race. Of those teams, Astana-Acca Due O, BePink-La Classica and Cycling Canada did not feature in the race, while further teams were added to feature 96 riders across 19 teams.|$|E

5|$|By 1875 {{encroachment}} on Malvern's wastelands by landowners {{had reached}} new heights and {{action was taken}} by the people of Malvern and the Commons Society to preserve the hills and common land and to prevent encroachment. Local lords of the manor <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> like to give their rights to the wastes to the public. After preventing the enclosure of a common in 1882, negotiations were initiated with the owners of the northern hills and the first Malvern Hills Act was secured in parliament in 1884. Later Acts empowered the Malvern Hills Conservators to acquire land to prevent further encroachment on common land and by 1925 they had bought much of the manorial wastelands.|$|E
5|$|Villagers in {{northern}} Albania and western Kosovo reported hearing explosions {{in the vicinity}} of the ambush and seeing helicopters flying overhead for much of the following day. Albanian officials later alleged that two of these helicopters had violated the country's airspace, and Albania moved elite army units to the Yugoslav border in response. Yugoslav authorities accused Albania of backing the KLA. In response to the ambush, U.S. officials <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> push for sanctions to be re-implemented against Yugoslavia, and said they would look to freeze the country's assets overseas. Some Albanian sources alleged that the men had not been ambushed, rather they were abducted and killed by Yugoslav security forces. Such claims could not be verified by Western journalists, and later that year, Amnesty International affirmed that the men were killed in an ambush while smuggling weapons across the border.|$|E
5|$|Resignations {{from the}} order {{can take place}} only through the {{prescribed}} channels, which include the member submitting to the Secretary General of the Order of Canada a letter notifying the chancellery {{of his or her}} desire to terminate their membership, and only with the governor general's approval can the resignation take effect. On 1 June 2009, the governor general accepted the resignations of astronomer and inventor René Racine, pianist Jacqueline Richard, and Cardinal Jean-Claude Turcotte; on 11 January 2010, did the same for Renato Giuseppe Bosisio, an engineering professor, and Father Lucien Larré; and on 19 April 2010 for Frank Chauvin. It was also reported that other constituents of the Order of Canada had, in reaction to Henry Morgentaler's induction into their ranks, <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> return or had returned their emblems in protest, including organizations such as the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate and Madonna House Apostolate doing so on behalf of deceased former members.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{soon began}} {{detecting}} signs of preparations {{for a new}} convoy. A Japanese floatplane of the type normally used for anti-submarine patrols in advance of convoys was sighted on 7 February 1943. The Allied Air Forces South West Pacific Area commander – Lieutenant General George Kenney – ordered an increase in reconnaissance patrols over Rabaul. On 14 February, aerial photographs were taken that showed 79 vessels in port, including 45 merchant ships and six transports. It was clear that another convoy was being prepared, but its destination was unknown. On 16 February, naval codebreakers in Melbourne (FRUMEL) and Washington, D.C. finished decrypting and translating a coded message revealing the Japanese intention to land convoys at Wewak, Madang and Lae. Subsequently, codebreakers decrypted {{a message from the}} Japanese 11th Air Fleet to the effect that destroyers and six transports would reach Lae about 5 March. Another report <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> reach Lae by 12 March. On 22 February, reconnaissance aircraft reported 59 merchant vessels in the harbour at Rabaul.|$|E
5|$|The {{sale of the}} Olympic brand {{has been}} controversial. The {{argument}} is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised sporting spectacle. Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares. The IOC <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games. Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income. Host cities continue to compete ardently {{for the right to}} host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments. Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, Boeing, {{the builder}} of the F/A18E/F Super Hornet, <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> take {{legal action against}} the Danish {{decision}} to buy the F-35A, indicating that data used was flawed.|$|E

Their parents <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> appeal this cut-off date.|$|E
2500|$|Ralph Nader praised Kucinich as [...] "a genuine progressive", {{and most}} Greens were {{friendly}} to Kucinich's campaign, some {{going so far}} as to <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not have run against him had he won the Democratic nomination. However, Kucinich was unable to carry any states in the 2004 Democratic primaries, and John Kerry eventually won the Democratic nomination at the Democratic National Convention.|$|R
40|$|A {{non-binding}} consultation on Catalan {{independence was}} held on 9 November, with over 80 per cent of those voting <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> like Catalonia to be independent. Montserrat Guibernau argues that while {{there is still some}} uncertainty over what the legal consequences of the vote will be, the people of Catalonia have made it clear <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{should have the right to}} choose their future status in an official referendum...|$|R
50|$|From {{the early}} 17th century, until the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the Scottish Highlander's main means of defence in battle was his targe. After the {{disastrous}} {{defeat of the}} Jacobites at Culloden, the carrying of the targe had been banned, and many were destroyed, or put to other uses. Those that remain have intricate patterns, and are decorated, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have originally belonged to important people.|$|R

AAI {{went out of business}} in April 2009 without producing any aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The 84th was {{the only}} Highland {{regiment}} to keep and use its traditional highland uniform; plaids and swords, {{for the duration of}} the war.

5000|$|One metric for product/market fit is if {{at least}} 40% percent of {{surveyed}} customers <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be [...] "very disappointed" [...] if {{they no longer}} have access to a particular product or service. Alternatively, it could be measured by having at least 40% of surveyed customers considering the product or service as [...] "must have." [...] Sean Ellis is noted for popularizing this heuristic after examining many startups.|$|R

5000|$|Doctors take {{a cardiac}} MRI to {{determine}} extent {{and location of}} the damage.
