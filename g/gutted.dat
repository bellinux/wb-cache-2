40|$|Antibiotic feeding {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on the firebrat, Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma, Lepismatidae) {{to determine if the}} insect's <b>gut</b> cellulases were of insect or microbial origin.

Each antibiotic significantly reduced the firebrat's <b>gut</b> micro-flora. Nystatin reduced the firebrat's viable <b>gut</b> fungi by 89 %.

40|$|Objective: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} updated {{information about the}} <b>gut</b> microbiota-brain axis. Data Sources: All articles about <b>gut</b> microbiota-brain axis published up to July 18, 2016, were identified through a literature search on PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science, with the keywords of “gut microbiota”, “gut-brain axis”, and “neuroscience”. Study Selection: All relevant articles on <b>gut</b> microbiota and gut-brain axis were included and carefully reviewed, with no limitation of study design. Results: It is well-recognized that <b>gut</b> microbiota affects the brain's physiological, behavioral, and cognitive functions although its precise mechanism {{has not yet been}} fully understood. <b>Gut</b> microbiota-brain axis may include <b>gut</b> microbiota and their metabolic products, enteric nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic branches within the autonomic nervous system, neural-immune system, neuroendocrine system, and central nervous system. Moreover, there may be five communication routes between <b>gut</b> microbiota and brain, including the gut-brain's neural network, neuroendocrine-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, <b>gut</b> immune system, some neurotransmitters and neural regulators synthesized by <b>gut</b> bacteria, and barrier paths including intestinal mucosal barrier and blood-brain barrier. The microbiome is used to define the composition and functional characteristics of <b>gut</b> microbiota, and metagenomics is an appropriate technique to characterize <b>gut</b> microbiota. Conclusions: <b>Gut</b> microbiota-brain axis refers to a bidirectional information network between the <b>gut</b> microbiota and the brain, which may provide a new way to protect the brain in the near future...|$|R
