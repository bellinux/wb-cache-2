40|$|During {{the last}} IAIS Global Seminar in June 2017, IAIS {{disclosed}} {{the agenda for}} a gradual shift in the systemic risk assessment methodology from the current Entity Based Approach (EBA) to a new Activity Based Approach(ABA). The EBA, which {{was developed in the}} aftermath of the 2008 / 2009 financial crisis, defines a list of Global Systemically Important Insurers (G-SIIs) based on a pre-defined set of criteria related to the size of the institution. These G-SIIs are subject to additional regulatory requirements since their <b>distress</b> <b>or</b> disorderly <b>failure</b> would potentially cause significant disruption to the global financial system and economic activity. Even if size is still a needed element of a systemic risk assessment, the strong emphasis put on the too-big-to-fail approach in insurance, i. e. EBA, might be partially missing the underlying nature of systemic risk in insurance. Not only certain activities, including insurance activities such as life or non-life lines of business, but also common exposures or certain managerial practices such as leverage or funding structures, tend to contribute to systemic risk of insurers but are not covered by the current EBA (Berdin and Sottocornola, 2015). Therefore, we very much welcome the general development of the systemic risk assessment methodology, even if several important questions still need to be answered...|$|R

In order to take the full potential of business in Europe, should be created the background that genuinely talented entrepreneurs have every opportunity to get another second chance. The European Commission lays out proposals to actively help businesses at financial risk and prevent bankruptcy.

In response to recommendations from these reviews, with assistance of external consultants, CDC staff developed a plan to conduct surveillance for and investigation of AIPH. In developing this response, CDC recommends a definition for a clinically confirmed case of AIPH among infants on the basis of evidence of blood in the airway, age </= 1 year, absence of medical conditions related to pulmonary hemorrhage, and severe acute respiratory <b>distress</b> <b>or</b> respiratory <b>failure.</b> CDC recommends that pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) report cases that meet the CDC case definition to state health departments.

Isolated esophageal atresia without tracheoesophageal fistula comprise approximately 6 to 8 % of cases (Laberge and Puligandla 2008), with the remainder associated with fistula between the esophagus and trachea. Associated anomalies include the VACTERL associations (vertebral, anal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal and limb anomalies) (Laberge and Puligandla 2008). Respiratory comorbidities and complications are common. Lung function studies are impaired in both infants and adolescents (Milligan and Levinson 1979; Agrawal et al. 1999; Beardsmore et al. 1994). Lower respiratory tract infections are common in the post operative period (Beardsmore et al. 1994) as are swallowing incoordination and gastro-esophageal reflux associated with tracheo-bronchial aspiration (Beardsmore et al. 1994). Tracheal collapse (tracheomalacia) manifesting as stridor or episodes of respiratory <b>distress</b> <b>or</b> <b>failure</b> is a known contributor to respiratory symptoms in infancy (Beardsmore et al. 1994), and if symptomatic, is typically treated by aortopexy which requires thoracotomy or thorascopy.

" A pillar of this heightened regulatory regime is that each covered financial institution must submit "credible" plans to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) detailing how the firm could be quickly resolved in an orderly fashion under the U.

40|$|The first paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} credit unions' audit quality choice {{and the implications of}} this choice on financial statement management and financial distress. Credit unions provide a setting with large variation in audit quality, ranging from a "self audit" to an independent CPA audit. I find credit unions select higher audit quality if faced with higher business risk, size and agency costs. Audit quality is inversely associated with the probability of earnings management but is not associated with other forms of financial statement management. However, audit quality is not associated with an increased likelihood of financial <b>distress</b> <b>or</b> <b>failure.</b> My findings suggest that other forms of monitoring, such as regulatory examinations, may substitute for low audit quality. Accordingly, mandating higher audit quality alone may not have a substantial effect on the quality of reported financial results or the likelihood of financial distress.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the factors that}} influence the success of labor induction with synthetic intravenous oxytocin infusion in term pregnancies with favourable Bishop score. Material and Methods: 150 pregnant women with completed 37 weeks of gestation and Bishop score> 6 who had single and cephalic presentation of pregnancy and were decided to underwent labor induction with intravenous oxytocin infusion were included in the study. Labor induction was considered unsuccessful if a vaginal delivery did not occur within 24 hours after the onset of loxytocin infusion or a cesarean section was performed during oxytocin infusion due to foetal <b>distress,</b> cephalopelvic disproportion <b>or</b> <b>failure</b> to progress in labor. Multivariable regression were used to identify odds of induction success. Results: Out of 150 women, induction of labor was unsuccessful in 23 (15. 3 %). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that nulliparity, shorter gestation period, persistent occiput posterior presentation and greater birth weight were independent risk factors for the induction failure. ROC curve analysis stated that gestation period of 3445 -gram-birth weight has a sensitivity of 82. 6 % and a spesificity of 71. 7 % for the prediction of failure. Conclusion: Nulliparity, shorter gestation period, persistent occiput posterior presentation and greater birth weight increase the failure risk of labor induction with intravenous synthetic oxytocin infusion.

40|$|Introduction: Cases of {{pulmonary}} embolism (PE) concurrent with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection are {{rare in the}} medical literature. We describe a patient with M. pneumoniae bronchiolitis and pneumonia who developed multiple right-sided, sub-segmental PE. Case Description: A 54 -year-old man presented following one week of respiratory and constitutional symptoms. He was admitted for respiratory distress and started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and oseltamivir. Because {{of a lack of}} clinical improvement, antibiotics were escalated to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. M. pneumoniae IgM and IgG serologies returned positive, and antibiotics were narrowed to azithromycin, with clinical improvement and gradual decrease in supplemental oxygen requirement. One week into the hospitalization, the patient abruptly developed an increased oxygen requirement. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest found stable M. pneumoniae bronchiolitis and pneumonia and the interval development of multiple right-sided, sub-segmental PE. He was treated with unfractionated and then low-molecular-weight heparin as a bridge to warfarin, azithromycin, and a prednisone taper. In the outpatient setting, repeat CTA revealed resolution of M. pneumoniae infection and PE. Discussion: Although the mechanism and association are unclear, other case reports have proposed that M. pneumoniae infection promotes hypercoagulability or a prothrombotic state, predisposing patients to thromboembolism. In a patient with M. pneumoniae infection who develops sudden respiratory <b>distress</b> <b>or</b> <b>failure</b> despite appropriate treatment, clinicians should have a high suspicion for PE, and a CTA should be considered as part of further evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Self-compassion is {{the ability}} to be kind and {{understanding}} towards oneself in times of <b>distress</b> <b>or</b> <b>failure</b> (Neff, 2003 a). Self-compassion in adulthood is linked to childhood experiences of care and compassion (Gilbert 2005), and is associated with a number of positive outcomes. Experimental studies show that self-compassion increases in response to explicit instruction (Leary et al., 2007); however, the implicit effect of one’s current social interactions on self-compassion remains unknown. This study examined whether hearing someone talk self-compassionately about an academic failure would unconsciously increase the listener’s self-compassion levels when recalling their own personal failure. Participants were 90 female undergraduates. In session 1, they completed the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (RSE; Rosenberg, 1965) and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) (Neff, 2003). In session 2, participants recalled a personal academic failure. They then listened to an audio clip of someone describing her academic failure in a self-compassionate, self-esteem preserving, or factual way. Participants subsequently completed measures of affect and state self-compassion vis-à-vis their failure. Results showed that controlling for trait self-compassion and self-esteem, there was a significant effect of condition on state self-compassion such that those in the self-compassion condition reported significantly higher state self-compassion compared to the other two conditions. There was also a main effect of condition on negative affect (NA). Contrasts revealed that controlling for pre-manipulation NA, those in the self-compassion condition had significantly lower NA after hearing the audio clip than those in the other two conditions. Findings are the first to indicate that exposure to another person’s display of self-compassion has a significant effect on one’s own self-compassion levels and affect. These findings also suggest that raising self-compassion may not require targeted individual interventions; rather, modeling self-compassionate behavior may be sufficient to quickly yield higher self-compassion in others. Additional implications and directions for future research are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The deplorable {{conditions}} {{that have developed}} in our highway system {{is one of the}} major problems confronting transportation agencies today. Rapidly escalating maintenance and reconstruction costs, coupled with a nearly fixed level of highway funding have contributed significantly to this problem. Asphalt pavement recycling is a viable rehabilitation method that can be used to help solve this serious problem; for recycling can be an economical, as well as an energy efficient rehabilitation alternative. The purpose of this study is to fully investigate asphalt pavement recycling. ^ Asphalt pavement recycling can be classified into three major areas: surface recycling; central plant recycling; and in-place recycling. This study investigates the type of equipment used, the construction methods employed, as well as the various considerations and limitations associated with each recycling method. Previous recycling jobs were analyzed to determine rates of production, unit costs, unit rates of energy consumption and specific problems encountered during recycling operations. ^ A set of guidelines was developed to assist the pavement engineer in determining if an asphalt pavement is a suitable candidate for recycling. The recycling guidelines provide a formal method for evaluating the existing pavement structure, identifying its rehabilitation needs, determining the probable cause of <b>distress</b> <b>or</b> <b>failure,</b> as well as identifying an appropriate recycling method. The recycling guidelines also comment on the design of the recycled mixture and the design of the recycled pavement. ^ A set of construction guidelines was developed to assist the construction engineer in implementing the recycling method identified by the recycling guidelines. The guidelines provide assistance in formulating and evaluating a specific recycling system. Project management decisions, recycling process variability and potential problem areas associated with the proposed recycling system were identified. Guide specifications were synthesized for the major forms of asphalt pavement recycling so that existing specifications can be modified or supplemented for recycling use. ^ A section of an Indiana highway was selected to demonstrate the use of the recycling guidelines. The existing pavement structure was fully characterized and a recycling rehabilitation method, including six design and pavement design, was selected and formulated using the procedures developed in this study. ...|$|E
