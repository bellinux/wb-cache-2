I have {{on more than one occasion}} brought to the notice of His Majesty's Government the deep antipathy with which the Arabs regard the prospect of French Administration of any portion of Arab territory. In this lies considerable danger to our future relations with France, because difficult and even impossible though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> convince France of her mistake, if we do not endeavour to do so by warning her of the real state of Arab feeling, we may hereafter be accused of instigating or encouraging the opposition to the French, which the Arabs now threaten and will assuredly give.|$|E

If St. Stephen and Giselle were indeed Agatha's parents, her offspring would have had a strong claim to the Hungarian crown. Actually, there is no indication in Hungarian sources that any of Stephen's children outlived him. Likewise, all of the solutions involving Henry II would seem to make Agatha much older than her husband, and prohibitively old at the time of the birth of her last child, Edgar.|$|E

500|$|A pre-taped {{performance}} of Brown performing {{a medley of}} [...] "Beautiful People" [...] and [...] "Forever" [...] was shown on the American version of Dancing with the Stars on March 29, 2011. For the performance Brown wore {{a black and white}} suit, and was accompanied by a group of robotic dancers dressed in all-white suits adorned with LED lighting for a futuristic Tron-like affect. Prior to the performance some of the show's cast were unhappy that Brown was going to perform because of the domestic violence assault that occurred with his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009. Brown was sentenced to five years of probation, ordered to complete more than 1,400 hours of community service and was given a restraining order which required him to stay away from Rihanna. Professional dancer Cheryl Burke told Extra, [...] "As a victim of domestic violence, I don't agree with him coming on the show, but it's out of my control", while host Tom Bergeron told the On Air with Ryan Seacrest radio show that, [...] "I did tell the producers <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> their advantage to not have me interview him, because my natural tendency would be to say something.

500|$|Pilgrim {{is often}} {{noted for its}} study of theodicy, or its defense of God's {{goodness}} {{in the face of}} evil. [...] The narrator attempts to reconcile the harsh natural world, with its [...] "seemingly horrid mortality," [...] with the belief in a benevolent God. [...] Death is repeatedly mentioned as a natural, although cruel progression: [...] "Evolution", the narrator states, [...] "loves death more than it loves you or me." [...] A passage in the second chapter of the book describes a frog being [...] "sucked dry" [...] by a [...] "giant water bug" [...] as the narrator watches; this necessary cruelty shows order in life and death, no matter how difficult <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> watch. [...] The narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in the insect world: [...] "Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly... insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing after another. I never ask why of a vulture or a shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I see. More than one insect... is an assault on all human virtue, all hope of a reasonable god." [...] While she remains drawn to the ultimately repugnant and amoral natural world, she also questions her place in it. The narrator states, [...] "I had thought to live {{by the side of the}} creek in order to shape my life to its free flow. [...] But I seem to have reached a point where I must draw the line. It looks as though the creek is not buoying me up but dragging me down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Known as {{the three}} Romulean tribes, these first tribes have often been {{supposed}} to represent the major ethnic groups of early Rome: the Ramnes representing Rome's Latin population; the Tities representing the Sabines; and the Luceres probably representing the Etruscans. [...] Rome lay on the Tiber, the traditional boundary of Etruria with Latium, and {{may have had a}} substantial Etruscan population from the beginning; but certainly there was a considerable Etruscan element in the Roman population by the sixth century BC; the fifth and seventh kings of Rome were Etruscan, and many of Rome's cultural institutions were of Etruscan origin. [...] <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> this period, rather than the time of Romulus, that the institution of the Luceres belongs; and indeed the names, if not the ethnic character of all three of the Romulean tribes appear to be Etruscan. [...] Although the theory that the Romulean tribes represented the city's original ethnic components continues to be represented in modern scholarship, it has never been universally accepted, and this view is rejected by many scholars.|$|E

2500|$|I {{have always}} been {{of the opinion that}} we have no right to impose our ideals upon other nations, no matter how strange it may seem to us that they enjoy the kind of life they lead, how slow they may be in {{utilizing}} the resources of their countries, or how much opposed their ideals may be to ours ... Our intolerant attitude is most pronounced in regard to what we like to call [...] "our free institutions." [...] Modern democracy was no doubt the most wholesome and needed reaction against the abuses of absolutism and of a selfish, often corrupt, bureaucracy. That the wishes and thoughts of the people should find expression, and that the form of government should conform to these wishis is an axiom that has pervaded the whole Western world, and that is even taking root in the Far East. It is a quite different question, however, in how far the particular machinery of democratic government is identical with democratic institutions ... To claim as we often do, that our solution is the only democratic and the ideal one is a one-sided expression of Americanism. I see no reason why we should not allow the Germans, Austrians, and Russians, or whoever else <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> <b>to</b> solve their problems in their own ways, instead of demanding that they bestow upon themselves the benefactions of our regime.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{moves the}} reader {{from the idea}} of the Creator to that of an eternal salvation. Is {{there such a thing as}} an eternal salvation? He says. It may be a merit of our present age that in many ways it has known how to work the wish weary and in that way to wean the soul from wishing; <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> its {{advantage}} if it thereby has developed an honest earnestness that for the good renounces the fraudulence of wishes. We do not reproach the age for having made the idea of the power of the wish into playing with words if it thereby motivates someone to work with his own hands instead of with the borrowed energy of the wish. But the wish for heaven's salvation-is this, too, a play on words, as wishing for heavenly help has become for the frivolous, who thinks that we ought to depend on God the way we depend on people –that is, if you help yourself then God does the rest. And if the wish for heaven's salvation has become playing with words, has the aim in it been to incite people to work all the harder to gain it? This seems not at all to be the case. Instead, eternal salvation seems to have become what the thought of it has become, a loose and idle phrase, at times virtually forgotten, or arbitrarily left out of the language, or indifferently set aside as an old-fashioned turn of speech no longer used but retained only because it is so quaint. And whereas in the old days one received heaven's salvation by the grace of God, nowadays heaven's salvation often seems to have become like an old, decrepit person who in the house of the mighty sustains his life on the miserable bread of charity.

2500|$|Galápagos green turtles’ {{lifestyle}} {{is similar to}} other populations of Chelonia. The behavior of all sea turtles is difficult to track, but many tagging experiments have been performed to assess migration patterns and feeding habits of Chelonia species in the eastern Pacific. The results of this research indicates that the green sea turtles of the eastern Pacific, including the Galápagos green turtles, are highly migratory, and they feed on many different forage species, including some animal matter. Female green turtles are known to nest colonially and {{to return to the}} same nesting beach every time they reproduce. This may be a result of comfort from past nesting success or it could be a result of returning to the origin of their own hatching beach. Populations in the eastern Pacific have also been shown to return to the same foraging habitat after nesting, and these areas are shared with other nesting colonies. Analysis of genetic data shows that populations in the eastern Pacific share the same life history, but have developed variations of many details such as size and color. The populations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are shown to have complete genetic isolation from the populations in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Black turtles are recorded to spend much of their maturation stage in the coastal areas off the Baja California peninsula, in particular in the Bahia Magdalena lagoon and connecting channels. [...] This particular area is rich in mangrove trees that provide forage and protection during this crucial stage of their lives. [...] Another food source for the mature green turtles in the Pacific is marine algae, and red algae are common along with green algae and [...] eelgrasses. This has been observed off the Bahia de los Angeles. In this area, they have also been noted to consume many forms of animal matter, as well. This may be incidental or intentional in origin, but results are unclear. If incidental, it may be a result of consuming marine algae near the invertebrates or if intentional <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> provide important nutrients, minerals, or proteins not obtained from vegetation.|$|E
