The need for a <b>general</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> to characterise RP-LC columns has been rising since the 1970 s. A project to define a chromatographic procedure characterising RP-LC columns was started earlier. A procedure to measure test parameters was introduced and a classification of the columns, based on a minimal number of parameters, was obtained. This paper focuses on correlating the column classification with the selectivity obtained for a real separation. The separation of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and related compounds was performed according to the Ph. Eur. monograph on the stationary phases previously characterised chromatographically. It was examined whether the classes of columns, determined using test parameter results, contain either suitable or unsuitable supports for the aspirin separation. The system suitability test prescribed by the Ph. Eur. in order to distinguish between suitable or unsuitable columns for this separation was also evaluated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Downhole heat {{exchangers}} (DHEs) {{have the potential}} for use in direct (non-electric) applications of geothermal energy. Their benefit is that no groundwater is extracted from wells. Some targeted uses of DHEs in Hawaii are low temperature agricultural applications such as greenhouse bottom heating and soil pasteurization. The main objective {{of this study was to}} conduct a so-called thermal response test on a DHE in an existing well in the Puna District of Hawaii County, Hawaii. Thermal response tests are conducted to determine the thermal properties of an aquifer, namely the effective thermal conductivity, and also the thermal resistance of the DHE assembly. The effective thermal conductivity describes heat transport in an aquifer by combined conduction and groundwater flow, and the thermal resistance combines the effects of the conductive heat transfer through the pipe wall and convective heat transfer from groundwater within the well bore. The <b>general</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> involved injecting a constant power pulse on a fluid flowing through the DHE and recording the inlet and outlet fluid temperatures. A mathematical solution to the so-called Kelvin Line Source model, which describes heat conduction from an imaginary line into a semi-infinite medium, was used to analyze the experimental test data. The well selected for the thermal response test was an existing well located on the Malama Ki Agricultural Experiment Station in the Pohoiki area of Puna District, Hawaii County, Hawaii. The DHE was fabricated of cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) tubing that was transported and assembled on site. The overall DHE assembly consisted of two closed-loop U-tubes constructed entirely of ¾-inch (19 mm) nominal diameter PEX plastic. The resulting effective thermal conductivity (including the effects of groundwater flow) is one order of magnitude greater than without groundwater flow, and the DHE thermal resistance (including the effects of convection within the well bore) is 40 times greater than for a DHE without well bore convection. With these parameters known for a given aquifer and DHE assembly, an equation is presented to determine DHE thermal output under any given set of heating design conditions. This project has verified the Geo-Heat Center’s experience that PEX DHEs are lower in cost and easier to install than other geothermal energy extraction methods for direct heating applications.

40|$|Selection of reversed-phase liquid {{chromatography}} (RP-LC) C 18 columns with suitable selectivity {{for a given}} analysis is difficult. The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) and other official compendia provide only a general description of the stationary phase {{to be used in}} the operating procedure of an LC method. This information is often insufficient to select a suitable column from a market offering more than 600 brands. Manufacturers provide only limited information about their columns. The need for a <b>general</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> to characterize RP-LC columns has existed since the 1970 s. A project to define a suitable procedure characterizing RP-LC C 18 columns by chromatographic tests was started earlier in the Laboratory for Pharmaceutical Analysis. Different tests were collected from the literature. A procedure to measure 36 column parameters was applied, and the repeatability and reproducibility of the parameters were examined in three different laboratories. Of these 36 parameters, 24 were found to be reproducible. Subsequently, a classification of 69 RP-LC C 18 columns, based on these 24 parameters, was obtained by principal component analysis (PCA). However, the measurement of these 24 parameters was labour-intensive and time-consuming. Through additional studies and based on the found correlation, it was possible to reduce the number of column parameters from 24 to just 4. The four selected parameters were the retention factor of amylbenzene, k’amb (i. e. hydrophobicity), the relative retention factor of benzylamine/phenol determined at pH 2. 7, rk’ba/ph pH 2. 7 (i. e. silanol activity), the retention factor of 2, 2 ’-dipyridyl, k’ 2, 2 ’-dip (i. e. silanol activity and metal impurity) and the relative retention factor of triphenylene/o-terphenyl, rk’tri/o-ter (i. e. steric selectivity). These parameters can be determined using three simple, fast, repeatable and reproducible methods. The correlation between column classification, as obtained in the PCA plot, and column selectivity, as determined by the Ph. Eur. separation of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and its impurities, has been demonstrated. It was concluded that columns belonging to the same group showed similar selectivity for the separation of ASA and its impurities. Although a correlation was found, definition of column groups based on the PCA plot was difficult. Therefore, a more practical approach has been developed. This approach begins with the selection of a reference column (e. g. the column on which a method has been developed or a column mentioned in the literature) or a virtual, ideal column. Other columns are then ranked against this reference column, based on the aforementioned four column parameters. This approach has one obvious advantage; that is, the relationship between columns can be expressed using a single value (i. e. F-value). This system has been made freely available on-line on our website: [URL] This approach gave good results for 8 separations of pharmaceuticals (ASA, clindamycin hydrochloride, buflomedil hydrochloride, chloramphenicol sodium succinate, nimesulide, phenoxymethylpenicillin, dihydrostreptomycin sulphate and vancomycin). To evaluate the separations, the chromatographic response factor (CRF) was used, which is a measure of the overall separation. The relationship between the ranking of the columns and their separation performance was investigated. For all separations examined, it was observed that in 7 out of 8 separations, 100 % of these high ranked columns (F 6). Next, intrabatch variability was investigated and low variability was found. During these experiments, it was found that one of the parameters, k’ 2, 2 ’-dip, could not always be properly determined. It was sometimes observed that the 2, 2 ’-dipyridyl peak showed a poor peak shape, a high retention time or that it was not eluted at all. To solve this issue, a phosphate buffer of pH 6. 5 was added to the mobile phase and the determination of the dead volume by the retention time of uracil was simplified. Next, the influence of long term storage (about 15 months) and of use in {{liquid chromatography}} analyses, applied on 55 pairs (same batch) of different RP-LC columns, was studied. After long term storage, small changes of the column characteristics occur for most of the columns, producing slightly increased F-values. A few columns differed by a greater extent and showed considerable changes in silanol activity and hydrophobicity. Most of these columns have no end-capping and/or no base-deactivation, making these stationary phases more vulnerable towards degradation. This effect is observed less with columns with polar embedded groups and/or polar end-capping, protecting the column by blocking the silanol groups and attracting a shielding water layer. Also columns with higher coverages and bulky or long chains show more resistance towards degradation. It was concluded that changes in the stationary phases do occur and these changes are more important when the columns were used for separation instead of simply stored. Two separations (erythromycin and tetracycline), which were developed on a specific column, the XTerra RP, were also examined. The same approach was used as for the 8 separations above. Good results were obtained for erythromycin, while less good for tetracycline. The described column classification system has proven to be a helpful tool to find a suitable column in several separations, but it also has shown to be of more limited value in complex situations as the tetracycline separation. Finally, a comparison of our classification system with that of Euerby et al. was performed. Euerby et al. developed a column characterisation system, based on 6 test parameters, available as Column Selector from Advanced Chemistry Development (ACD) Labs. Comparison of the parameters led to a correlation between the parameters which claimed for the same column property. Principal component analysis showed that RP-LC C 18 columns were classified in a similar way by both systems. For 7 separations (fluoxetine, gemcitabine, erythromycin, tetracycline, tetracaine, amlodipine and bisacodyl), a ranking was build based on an F-value (K. U. Leuven method) or Column Difference Factor value (CDF, Euerby method) versus a (virtual) reference column. Both methods showed similar classification patterns. The coefficient of determination values, calculated for these rankings, were in the range 0. 64 to 0. 90. Therefore, it was concluded that the classification systems are quite similar and both can be helpful in the selection of a suitable column. From a practical point of view, it must be noted that the K. U. Leuven method only includes 4 parameters and 3 chromatographic methods compared to 6 parameters and 4 methods for the Euerby method. Hence, the time needed to determine the chromatographic properties of a column is shorter with the K. U. Leuven approach.

Schroeder inputs provide signals with a flat power spectrum over a specified frequency band. For comparison, experimental results using the traditional single-frequency inputs are also considered.

40|$|The {{characterization}} and {{categorization of}} coarse aggregates {{for use in}} portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements is a highly refined process at the Iowa Department of Transportation. Over the past 10 to 15 years, much effort has been directed at pursuing direct testing schemes to supplement or replace existing physical testing schemes. Direct testing refers {{to the process of}} directly measuring the chemical and mineralogical properties of an aggregate and then attempting to correlate those measured properties to historical performance information (i. e., field service record). This is in contrast to indirect measurement techniques, which generally attempt to extrapolate the performance of laboratory test specimens to expected field performance. The purpose of this research project was to investigate and refine the use of direct <b>testing</b> <b>methods,</b> such as X-ray analysis techniques and thermal analysis techniques, to categorize carbonate aggregates for use in portland cement concrete. The results of this study indicated that the <b>general</b> <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> that are currently used to obtain data for estimating service life tend to be very reliable and have good to excellent repeatability. Several changes in the current techniques were recommended to enhance the long-term reliability of the carbonate database. These changes can be summarized as follows: (a) Limits that are more stringent need to be set on the maximum particle size in the samples subjected to testing. This should help to improve the reliability of all three of the <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> studied during this project. (b) X-ray diffraction testing needs to be refined to incorporate the use of an internal standard. This will help to minimize the influence of sample positioning errors and it will also allow for the calculation of the concentration of the various minerals present in the samples. (c) Thermal analysis data needs to be corrected for moisture content and clay content prior to calculating the carbonate content of the sample...|$|R

Incubation conditions simulated transient waterlogging of the soil profile and involved repeated sampling and analysis of both the solution and solid phase P forms. An initial increase in P concentration occurred upto and including the fourth full cycle {{was followed by a}} sharp decline in concentration for all but one soil. Accompanying changes in the main extractable forms of P, which appeared to be cumulative, could be summarised as a general decline in the organic P fraction and an overall increase in amorphous associated inorganic forms of P. The fact that up to 60 % of the total soil P was demonstrated to change its sensitivity for a particular extractant suggests that these operationally defined P forms can experience substantial transformations. There was also a suggestion that certain changes in P forms may not be reversible. While the laboratory conditions represent an extreme situation changes in timing and frequency of intense precipitation events, as predicted in many climate change scenarios, may increase the risk of episodic soil waterlogging. The potential onset of reducing conditions even for periods of less than twenty days will influence soil P dynamics and short-term bioavailable P. Various mechanisms are involved but the robustness of sequential extraction procedures and <b>general</b> soil <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> (e. g.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} about radiation effects on electronics {{is an important}} part in spacecraft design as the radiation environment in space may adversely affect EEE components. The effects can be corrupt data in the best case, but it can also lead to non-working subsystems which can hazard a whole mission. To reduce this risk are electronic components tested and qualified for space before they are used in missions. Many companies and institutions work with this kind of questions and the Components Division within the Product Assurance & Safety Department of ESA is one of them. At the Components Division are components tested, simulations made and missions are supervised in terms of electronic components. As part of this work is the Component Technology Test Bed developed, it will serve as a test bed for radiation effects. It will fly on future ESA missions and the main objective is not only to test components but also to validate the methods used during ground tests. Different type of electronics will be tested with the CTTB and in this report is one of them studied and the methods are evaluated. The report handles the optoelectronics part and in particular optocoupler devices.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{mutation}} analysis, mutation is the systematic generation of mutated programs (i. e., mutants) from an original program.

However, surprisingly little focus {{has been given to}} the theoretical foundation of mutation-based <b>testing</b> <b>methods,</b> making it difficult to understand, organize, and describe various mutation-based <b>testing</b> <b>methods.</b> This paper aims to consider a theoretical framework for understanding mutation-based <b>testing</b> <b>methods.</b> While there is a solid <b>testing</b> framework for <b>general</b> <b>testing,</b> this is incongruent with mutation-based <b>testing</b> <b>methods,</b> because it focuses on the correctness of a program for a test, while the essence of mutation-based testing concerns the differences between programs (including mutants) for a test. In this paper, we begin the construction of our framework by defining a novel testing factor, called a test differentiator, to transform the paradigm of testing from the notion of correctness to the notion of difference. We formally define behavioral differences of programs for a set of tests as a mathematical vector, called a d-vector. We explore the multi-dimensional space represented by d-vectors, and provide a graphical model for describing the space. Based on our framework and formalization, we interpret existing mutation-based fault localization methods and mutant set minimization as applications, and identify novel implications for future work.

Results suggested that when raters of the performance test were asked to recommend specifically whether or not a subject should be allowed to actually teach chemistry in a lab or classroom, the field-specific test was a better predictor than the <b>general</b> purpose <b>test.</b> The paper contains a theoretical discussion of field-specific language testing and guidelines for the construction of oral proficiency tests in specific purpose contexts...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an additive model with second order interaction terms. Both marginal integration estimators and a combined backfitting-integration estimator are proposed for all {{components of the}} model and their derivatives. The corresponding asymptotic distributions are derived. Moreover, two test statistics for testing the presence of interactions are proposed. Asymptotics for the test functions and local power results are obtained. Since direct implementation of the test procedure based on the asymptotics would produce inaccurate results unless the number of observations is very large, a bootstrap procedure is provided, which is applicable for small or moderate sample sizes. Further, based on these <b>methods</b> a <b>general</b> <b>test</b> for additivity is developed. Estimation and <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> are shown to work well in simulation studies. Finally, our method...|$|R

40|$|Two {{new methods}} for {{improving}} the measurement precision of a <b>general</b> <b>test</b> factor are proposed and evaluated. One new method provides a multidimensional item response theory estimate obtained from conventional administrations of multiple-choice test items that span general and nuisance dimensions. The other method chooses items adaptively to maximize the precision of the general ability score. Both methods display substantial increases in precision over alternative item selection and scoring procedures. Results of a simulation study based on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery suggest {{that the use of}} these new <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> may significantly enhance the prediction of learning and performance in instances where standardized tests are currently used.

40|$|Unit {{tests are}} {{primarily}} written {{as a good}} practice to support software evolution, i. e., to help developers to identify and fix bugs, to refactor code and to serve as documentation for a unit of software under test. To achieve these benefits, unit tests ideally should cover all possible paths in a program. One unit test usually covers one specific path in one function or <b>method.</b> However, a <b>test</b> <b>method</b> is not necessary an encapsulated, independent entity. Often a <b>test</b> <b>method’s</b> coverage is a superset of another <b>test</b> <b>method’s</b> coverage set and thus defects are not well isolated, i. e., one defect causes multiple <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> to fail. In this work we present an approach to automatically migrate JUNIT test classes to JEXAMPLE. JEXAMPLE allows <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> to declare explicit dependencies to other <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> and therefore improves defect isolation. With dynamic analysis we recover the coverage set of each <b>test</b> <b>method</b> and by partially ordering the <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> by means of their coverage sets we derive implicit dependencies between <b>test</b> <b>methods.</b> With program transformation we rewrite the original JUNIT test classes as test classes with explicit dependencies between <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> that can be executed with JEXAMPLE.

40|$|Abstract- Testing is an {{important}} process that can assure the quality and the correct functionality of the multi agent systems (MAS). Multiple <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> in agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) have been introduced in recent years. Although {{the quality of the}} system is dependent {{on the quality of the}} applied <b>test</b> <b>method,</b> very little attention has been paid to evaluating these <b>testing</b> <b>methods.</b> As a result, it is difficult to select a sufficient <b>method</b> for <b>testing</b> an agent-based system. Additionally, there are no means to determine what the advantages and drawbacks of each method are. This paper proposes a framework for evaluating and comparing the <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> in AOSE. This framework addresses major divisions of a <b>testing</b> <b>method.</b> The framework is then used to evaluate some prominent <b>testing</b> <b>methods,</b> have been proposed so far.
