5|$|Evolutionary {{biology is}} partly based on paleontology, which uses {{the fossil record}} to answer {{questions}} about the mode and tempo of evolution, and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics. In the 1980s, <b>developmental</b> <b>biology</b> re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary <b>developmental</b> <b>biology.</b> Phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary <b>developmental</b> <b>biology</b> (informally, evo-devo) is a {{field of}} {{biological}} research that compares the developmental processes of different organisms to infer the ancestral relationships between them and how developmental processes evolved.|$|E

5|$|Gould made {{significant}} contributions to evolutionary <b>developmental</b> <b>biology,</b> especially in his work Ontogeny and Phylogeny. In this book he emphasized the process of heterochrony, which encompasses two distinct processes: neoteny and terminal additions. Neoteny is the process where ontogeny is slowed down and the organism does not reach the end of its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary <b>developmental</b> <b>biology</b> continues to be seen today in areas such as the evolution of feathers.|$|E
5|$|Recent work in <b>developmental</b> <b>biology</b> has {{identified}} dynamical and physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis that may underlie abrupt morphological transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change {{that have been}} found in reality to be non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of evolutionary <b>developmental</b> <b>biology,</b> particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms {{can be found in the}} multi-authored volume Origination of Organismal Form (MIT Press; 2003).|$|E

5|$|The {{embryonic}} body segments (somites) {{of different}} arthropods taxa have diverged {{from a simple}} body plan with many similar appendages which are serially homologous, {{into a variety of}} body plans with fewer segments equipped with specialised appendages.

5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary <b>developmental</b> <b>biology.</b> An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E

5|$|<b>Developmental</b> <b>biology</b> can {{identify}} homologous structures that {{arose from the}} same tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had hind legs complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|E
5|$|In <b>developmental</b> <b>biology,</b> organs that {{developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{embryogenesis}} and <b>developmental</b> <b>biology.</b> Mutants {{are created}} by adding transposons into their genomes, or specific genes are deleted by gene targeting. By studying the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, and what can go wrong in this process. These studies are particularly powerful since the basic controls of development, such as the homeobox genes, have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man.|$|E

5|$|Teleosts are {{economically}} {{important to}} humans, as {{is shown by}} their depiction in art over the centuries. The fishing industry harvests them for food, and anglers attempt to capture them for sport.

5|$|The {{unity of}} much of the {{morphogenesis}} of organisms from fertilized egg to adult began to be unraveled after the discovery of the homeobox genes, first in fruit flies, then in other insects and animals, including humans. These developments led to advances in the field of evolutionary <b>developmental</b> <b>biology</b> towards understanding how the various body plans of the animal phyla have evolved and how they are related to one another.|$|E
5|$|This {{synthesis}} cemented {{natural selection}} {{as the foundation}} of evolutionary theory, where it remains today. A second synthesis was brought about {{at the end of the}} 20th century by advances in molecular genetics, creating the field of evolutionary <b>developmental</b> <b>biology</b> ("evo-devo"), which seeks to explain the evolution of form in terms of the genetic regulatory programs which control the development of the embryo at molecular level. Natural selection is here understood to act on embryonic development to change the morphology of the adult body.|$|E

5|$|Readers of Aristotle {{have found}} the four causes that he uses in his {{biological}} explanations opaque, something not helped by many centuries of confused exegesis. For a biological system, these are however straightforward enough. The material cause is simply what a system is constructed from. The goal (final cause) and formal cause are what something is for, its function: to a modern biologist, such teleology describes adaptation {{under the pressure of}} natural selection. The efficient cause is how a system moves and develops: to a modern biologist, those are explained by <b>developmental</b> <b>biology</b> and physiology. Biologists continue to offer explanations of these same kinds.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins wrote {{several books}} {{during his time}} at UC Davis.

Stebbins discusses the origins, genetics and <b>developmental</b> <b>biology</b> of the angiosperms. He argues for the role of adaptive radiation in the diversification of the angiosperms and the usefulness of applying our current understanding of species' genetics and ecology to gain knowledge about the evolution of ancient species. He also wrote Processes of Organic Evolution, The Basis of Progressive Evolution, Chromosomal Evolution in Plants and the textbook Evolution with co-authors Dobzhansky, Francisco Ayala and James W. Valentine. His last book, Darwin to DNA, Molecules to Humanity was published in 1982.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} embryologist Gavin de Beer anticipated evolutionary <b>developmental</b> <b>biology</b> in his 1930 book Embryos and Ancestors, {{by showing}} that evolution could occur by heterochrony, {{such as in the}} retention of juvenile features in the adult. This, de Beer argued, could cause apparently sudden changes in the fossil record, since embryos fossilise poorly. As the gaps in the fossil record had been used as an argument against Darwin's gradualist evolution, de Beer's explanation supported the Darwinian position. However, despite de Beer, the modern synthesis largely ignored embryonic development to explain the form of organisms, since population genetics appeared to be an adequate explanation of how forms evolved.|$|E
