5000|$|Petro Hervaziyovych Chernyaha {{was born}} in the village of Kuhayivtsi, Chemerovetskyi {{district}} (rayon), Khmelnytskyi Oblast, Ukraine. In 1964 he finished high school with honours (gold medal) and entered the Lviv Polytechnical Institute (now university), where he studied Astronomic Geodesy. He received a special scholarship (named after Lenin) and was awarded a medal by the Ministry of Higher and Special Education of the USSR [...] "For best student scientific paper", titled [...] "Design of <b>Geodetic</b> <b>Connection</b> between Asia and America". He graduated, also with honours, in 1969 and continued his studies at the Polytechnical Institute as a post-graduate student.|$|E

Nowadays some similar techniques are carried out by interferometry with very distant radio quasars instead of optical satellite & star observations. The <b>geodetic</b> <b>connection</b> of radio telescopes is now possible up to mm...cm precision as published periodically by the IVS community. This global project group was founded in 2000 by Harald Schuh (H. Schuh) (Munich/ TU Vienna) and some dozen research projects worldwide, {{and is now a}} permanent service of IUGG and IERS.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA data {{archeology}} {{exercise was}} carried out on sea level observations recorded during the transit of Venus across the Sun observed in 1874 from Saint Paul Island (38 ° 41 ′S, 77 ° 31 E) in the southern Indian Ocean. Historical (1874) and recent (1994 - 2009) sea level observations were assembled into a consistent time series. A thorough check of the data and its precise <b>geodetic</b> <b>connection</b> to the same datum was only possible thanks to the recent installation of new technologies (GPS buoy and radar water level sensor) and leveling campaigns. The estimated rate of relative sea level change, spanning the last 135 years at Saint Paul Island, was {{not significantly different from}} zero (− 0. 1 ± 0. 3 mm yr− 1), a value which could be reconciled with estimates of global average sea level rise for the 20 th century assuming the DORIS vertical velocity estimate at Amsterdam Island (100 km distant) could be applied to correct for the land motion at the tide gauge. Considering the scarcity of long-term sea level data in the Southern Hemisphere, the exercise provides an invaluable additional observational constraint for further investigations of the spatial variability of sea level change, once vertical land rates can be determined...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to understand}} fault system deformation using numerical models and analog experiments. In southern California, the southern Big Bend of the San Andreas fault (SAF) is {{a zone of}} transpression that accommodates deformation associated with the Pacific-North American plate boundary. Using three-dimensional boundary element method (BEM) models, I test the sensitivity of fault slip rates {{to a range of}} tectonic boundary conditions constrained by Global Positioning System (GPS) studies of the region (45 – 50 mm/yr and 320 °– 325 °). I have modified fault configurations derived from the Southern California Earthquake Center Community Fault Model of the San Gorgonio knot and the eastern California shear zone (ECSZ) to better represent the disconnected nature of active faults in southern California. The models with revised fault geometry produce slip rates that better match geologic strike-slip rates, thus validating the revisions. More northerly plate velocity (325 °) produces greater transpression along the SAF system associated with greater uplift of the San Bernardino Mountains, greater reverse-slip rates along range bounding reverse thrust faults, lower strike-slip rates along the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults, and greater strike-slip rates along the eastern California shear zone (ECSZ) and Garlock fault. These results suggest that the degree of regional transpression controls the partitioning of deformation between uplift and slip along both the SAF system and the ECSZ. Along the San Bernardino strand of the SAF and across the ECSZ, geologic slip rates differ from those inverted from geodetic measurements, which may partly be due to inaccurate fault connectivity within geodetic models. I compare results from fault networks that follow mapped geologic traces and resemble those used in block model inversions, which connect the San Jacinto fault to the SAF near Cajon Pass and connect distinct faults within the ECSZ. The connection of the SAF with the San Jacinto fault decreases strike-slip rates along the SAF by up to 10 % and increases strike-slip rates along the San Jacinto fault by up to 16 %; however, slip rate changes are still within the large geologic ranges along the SAF. The insensitivity of modeled interseismic surface velocities near Cajon Pass to fault connection suggests that inverse models may utilize both an incorrect fault geometry and slip rate and still provide an excellent fit to interseismic <b>geodetic</b> data. Similarly, <b>connection</b> of faults within the ECSZ produces 36 % greater cumulative strike-slip rates but less than 17 % increase in interseismic velocity. Within the models that follow the mapped traces, off-fault deformation accounts for 40 % ± 23 % of the total strain across the ECSZ. This suggests that {{a significant portion of the}} discrepancy between the geologic and geodetically modeled slip rates in the ECSZ could be due to the geodetic inversion model assumption of zero permanent off-fault deformation. When using overconnected models to invert GPS for slip rates, the reduced off-fault deformation within the models can lead to overprediction of slip rates. Analog models of sandbox experiments performed at the Universite de Cergy-Pontoise (UCP) shed light on the amount of work required to create faults (Wgrow) in coarse sand. Casagrande shear experiments calculate a Wgrow that is consistent with that calculated in the sandbox and both values scale properly to crustal calculations. Calculations of Wgrow are higher for thicker sand pack layer experiments. Utilizing different materials within the compressional sandbox (GA 39 sand and glass beads) shows the control of material properties on Wgrow as well. Numerical simulations of the UCP sandbox experiments test whether fault growth occurs via work minimization. To the first order, faults observed in sandbox experiments match the model predicted faults that minimize work in two-dimensional BEM simulations. The BEM models and work minimization shed light on fault growth path and timing...|$|R
