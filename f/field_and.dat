5|$|Despite rising {{traffic to}} Las Vegas, WAE reduced {{service to the}} city amid the Great Depression. Once its {{financial}} situation improved, the airline bought the airfield and established a monopoly on flights. When the city attempted to purchase the <b>field</b> <b>and</b> build a more modern terminal, WAE refused. With the advent of World War II, however, WAE was pressured to sell the airfield. Nevadan Senator Pat McCarran helped obtain federal funding {{for the city to}} buy the <b>field</b> <b>and</b> construct a new terminal. He also helped establish a gunnery school by the United States Army Air Corps at the field. For the senator's contributions, the airport was named McCarran Field in 1941.|$|E

To overcome this issue, we describe a data model combining <b>fields</b> <b>and</b> agents in a single concept. This data model represents <b>fields,</b> agents <b>and</b> relations by grouping items sharing properties into a phenomenon.
