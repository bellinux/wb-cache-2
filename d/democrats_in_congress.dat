5|$|Hayes's later {{attempts}} {{to protect the}} rights of southern blacks were ineffective, as were his {{attempts to}} rebuild Republican strength in the South. He did, however, defeat Congress's efforts to curtail federal power to monitor federal elections. <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> {{passed the}} Wilson-Gorman tariff, which imposed the first peacetime income tax. The rate was 2% on income over $4000, which meant fewer than 10% of {{households}} would pay any. The {{purpose of the}} income tax was {{to make up for}} revenue that would be lost by tariff reductions.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} downturn of 1937–38, and the bitter {{split between the}} AFL and CIO labor unions led to major Republican gains in Congress in 1938. Conservative Republicans and <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> joined in the informal Conservative Coalition. By 1942–43 they shut down relief {{programs such as the}} WPA and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and blocked major liberal proposals. Roosevelt {{turned his attention to the}} war effort, and won reelection in 1940-44.|$|E
25|$|Determined to {{overcome}} the opposition of conservative <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> Roosevelt {{became involved in the}} 1938 Democratic primaries, actively campaigning for challengers who were more supportive of New Deal reform. Roosevelt failed badly, managing to defeat only one target, a conservative Democrat from New York City. In the November 1938 elections, Democrats lost six Senate seats and 71 House seats, with losses were concentrated among pro-New Deal Democrats. When Congress reconvened in 1939, Republicans under Senator Robert Taft formed a Conservative coalition with Southern Democrats, virtually ending Roosevelt's ability to enact his domestic proposals. Ironically, many of these conservative Congressmen would provide crucial support for Roosevelt's foreign policy before and during World War II.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Party {{supports}} {{the death penalty}} {{far less than the}} Republican Party. Though most <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> have never seriously moved to overturn the rarely used federal death penalty, both Russ Feingold and Dennis Kucinich have introduced such bills with little success. Democrats have led efforts to overturn state death penalty laws, particularly in New Jersey and in New Mexico. They have also sought to prevent reinstatement of the death penalty in those states which prohibit it, including Massachusetts and New York. During the Clinton administration, Democrats led the expansion of the federal death penalty. These efforts resulted in the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, signed into law by President Clinton; the law heavily limited appeals in death penalty cases.|$|E
50|$|In 1966, he {{was elected}} as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> {{representing}} Texas's 8th congressional district, which included most of northern Houston. Eckhardt was the sponsor of the War Powers Act and the Toxic Substances Act. He was reelected six times without serious difficulty. In 1980, however, he was narrowly defeated by Jack Fields, losing by only 4,900 votes. He was also a co-founder of the Texas Observer magazine.|$|R
50|$|Under Pulaski’s leadership, the California Labor Federation’s {{achievements}} {{have included}} restoring daily overtime pay, raising the minimum wage, increasing benefits for injured and unemployed workers, creating collective bargaining opportunities {{for hundreds of}} thousands of public sector workers, and passing the nation’s first comprehensive Paid Family Leave law. In 2010, the Federation led the successful campaign to ensure every California <b>democrat</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> voted <b>in</b> favor of the landmark federal health care reform legislation.|$|R
25|$|Though he ran as a Democrat, and caucused as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> Dellums {{describes}} himself as a Socialist. He was the first self-described socialist <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> since Victor L. Berger. In the 1970s, Dellums {{was a member of the}} Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC), an offshoot of the Socialist Party of America. He later became vice-chair of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which was formed by a merger between the DSOC and the New American Movement, and which works within and outside the Democratic Party. As of 2006, Dellums is no longer a vice-chair of the DSA.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress,</b> {{controlled}} by Southerners, wrote the tariff {{laws in the}} 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, and kept reducing rates so that the 1857 rates were the lowest since 1816. The Whigs and Republicans complained because they favored high tariffs to stimulate industrial growth, and Republicans called {{for an increase in}} tariffs in the 1860 election. The increases were only enacted in 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress. The tariff issue was and is sometimes cited–long after the war–by Lost Cause historians and neo-Confederate apologists. In 1860–61 none of the groups that proposed compromises to head off secession raised the tariff issue. Pamphleteers North and South rarely mentioned the tariff, and when some did, for instance, Matthew Fontaine Maury and John Lothrop Motley, they were generally writing for a foreign audience.|$|E

The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being. Hayes's strong stance against the Democratic attempts to repeal the election laws earned him the support of many in the North and boosted his unpopularity among many Republicans who had been alienated by his civil service reform efforts.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Republican Party in nearly all parts of the South, the region became known as the “Solid South”, and the Democratic Party after 1900 moved to a system of primaries to select their candidates. Victory in a primary was tantamount to election. From the late 1870s to the 1960s, only rarely was a state or national Southern politician a Republican, apart from a few Appalachian mountain districts. Republicans, however, continued to control parts of the Appalachian Mountains and compete for power in the Border States. Apart from a few states (such as the Byrd Machine in Virginia, the Crump Machine in Memphis), and a few other local organizations, the Democratic Party itself was very lightly organized. It managed primaries but party officials had little other role. To be successful a politician built his own network of friends, neighbors and allies. Reelection was the norm, and the result from 1910 to the late 20th century was that Southern <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> had accumulated seniority, and automatically took the chairmanships of all committees. By the 1940s the Supreme Court began to find disfranchisement measures like the “grandfather clause” and the white primary unconstitutional. Southern legislatures quickly passed other measures to keep blacks disfranchised, even after suffrage was extended more widely to poor whites. Because white Democrats controlled all the Southern seats in Congress they had outsize power in Congress and could sidetrack or filibuster efforts by Northerners to pass legislation against lynching, for example.|$|E

500|$|In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary {{to chair}} a Task Force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to {{replicate}} the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform. Unconvinced regarding {{the merits of the}} North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority. The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan, a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as [...] "Hillarycare" [...] and it faced opposition from even some <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress.</b> Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.|$|E
500|$|Congress {{responded to}} rampant {{discrimination}} against racial minorities in public accommodations and government services by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Act included some voting rights protections; it required registrars to equally administer literacy tests in writing to each voter {{and to accept}} applications that contained minor errors, and it created a rebuttable presumption that persons with a sixth-grade education were sufficiently literate to vote. However, despite lobbying from civil rights leaders, the Act did not prohibit most forms of voting discrimination. President Lyndon B. Johnson recognized this, and shortly after the 1964 elections in which Democrats gained overwhelming majorities in both chambers of Congress, he privately instructed Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach to draft [...] "the goddamndest, toughest voting rights act that you can". However, Johnson did not publicly push for the legislation at the time; his advisers warned him of political costs for vigorously pursuing a voting rights bill so soon after Congress had passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Johnson was concerned that championing voting rights would endanger his Great Society reforms by angering Southern <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|E
500|$|Kennedy had an {{easy time}} with his {{re-election}} to the Senate in 2000, as Republican lawyer and entrepreneur Jack E. Robinson III was sufficiently damaged by his past personal record that Republican state party officials refused to endorse him. Kennedy got 73percent of the general election vote, with Robinson splitting the rest with Libertarian Carla Howell. [...] During the long, disputed post-presidential election battle in Florida in 2000, Kennedy supported Vice President Al Gore's legal actions. After the bitter contest was over, many <b>Democrats</b> <b>in</b> <b>Congress</b> {{did not want to}} work with incoming President George W. Bush. Kennedy, however, saw Bush as genuinely interested in a major overhaul of elementary and secondary education, Bush saw Kennedy as a potential major ally in the Senate, and the two partnered together on the legislation. Kennedy accepted provisions governing mandatory student testing and teacher accountability that other Democrats and the National Education Association did not like, in return for increased funding levels for education. The No Child Left Behind Act was passed by Congress in May and June 2001 and signed into law by Bush in January 2002. [...] Kennedy soon became disenchanted with the implementation of the act, however, saying for 2003 that it was $9billion short of the $29billion authorized. Kennedy said, [...] "The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally in place, but the funds are not," [...] and accused Bush of not living up to his personal word on the matter. Other Democrats concluded that Kennedy's penchant for cross-party deals had gotten the better of him. The White House defended its spending levels given the context of two wars going on.|$|E
