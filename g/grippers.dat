25|$|One of {{the most}} common effectors is the gripper. In its {{simplest}} manifestation, it consists of just two fingers which can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects. Fingers can for example, be made of a chain with a metal wire run through it. Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand. Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand. Mechanical <b>grippers</b> can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws. Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction. Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction.|$|E

The <b>gripper</b> is positioned horizontally above the component to be manipulated and adhesive is fed to the <b>gripper</b> surface. The <b>gripper</b> and component are then moved towards each other until the liquid completely wets the surface between them. The amount of fluid between the <b>gripper</b> surface and the component can be reduced until the optimum adhesion force is reached.

2500|$|The most {{essential}} robot peripheral {{is the end}} effector, or end-of-arm-tooling (EOT). Common examples of end effectors include welding devices (such as MIG-welding guns, spot-welders, etc.), spray guns and also grinding and deburring devices (such as pneumatic disk or belt grinders, burrs, etc.), and <b>grippers</b> (devices that can grasp an object, usually electromechanical or pneumatic).

2500|$|The level 9 adit was {{the longest}} built at Rhosydd, {{measuring}} [...] from the mouth to the haulage system at the inner end. It had a gradient of 1 in 86 to aid drainage, and took eight years to complete, being completed in 1870 or 1871. During its construction, an internal incline was built downwards from floor 5, so that rock from higher levels could be lowered down to the mine exit. Trucks were moved along the adit by attaching them to an endless rope, which was driven by a [...] diameter pitchback water wheel located {{near the mouth of}} the adit. They were marshalled into rakes of about 12 wagons, with a gripper truck or megryn at both ends. A screw handle was used to attach the front megryn to the rope, both on the line of full trucks in the mine and on empty ones outside the adit. The rope was then set in motion, and when the couplings between the trucks were tight, the gripper on the back megryn was applied. When they reached the far end, the <b>grippers</b> were released, as the water wheel took some time to stop. A similar system was used on the Glasgow Subway when it first opened. For most of its length, there were only three rails in the adit, the centre one being shared by both tracks. They fanned out into double tracks at both ends, and for [...] in the middle, so that trucks moving in opposite directions could pass one another. Communication between the operators at either end was by a bell system.|$|E

40|$|During the {{placement}} of components in micro-assembly, high impact forces occur.

To prevent the <b>gripper</b> from bouncing back {{at the end of}} the placement collision a force must be exerted between <b>gripper</b> and drive unit, which can significantly increase the impact forces.

40|$|The <b>gripper</b> is {{considered}} {{an important part of}} a robot, it has been wisely used in all kinds of all industries to increase the efficiency.

50|$|They {{are based}} on {{different}} physical effects used to guarantee a stable grasping between a gripper and the object to be grasped.Industrial <b>grippers</b> can be mechanical, the most diffused in industry, but also based on suction or on the magnetic force. Vacuum cups and electromagnets dominate the automotive field and in particular metal sheet handling. Bernoulli <b>grippers</b> exploit the airflow between the gripper and the part that causes a lifting force which brings the gripper and part close each other (i.e. the Bernoulli's principle). Bernoulli <b>grippers</b> are a type of contactless <b>grippers,</b> namely the object remains confined in the force field generated by the gripper without coming into direct contact with it. Bernoulli <b>grippers</b> have been adopted in photovoltaic cell handling, silicon wafer handling, {{and also in the}} textile and leather industries.Other principles are less used at the macro scale (part size >5mm), but {{in the last ten years}} they demonstrated interesting applications in micro-handling. Some of them are ready of spreading out their original field. The other adopted principles are: Electrostatic <b>grippers</b> and van der Waals <b>grippers</b> based on electrostatic charges (i.e. van der Waals' force), capillary <b>grippers</b> and cryogenic <b>grippers,</b> based on liquid medium, and ultrasonic <b>grippers</b> and laser <b>grippers,</b> two contactless grasping principles. Electrostatic <b>grippers</b> {{are based on}} charge difference between the gripper and the part (i.e. electrostatic force) often activated by the gripper itself, while van der Waals <b>grippers</b> are based on the low force (still electrostatic) due to the atomic attraction between the molecules of the gripper and those of the object.Capillary <b>grippers</b> use the surface tension of a liquid meniscus between the gripper and the part to center, align and grasp the part, cryogenic <b>grippers</b> freeze a small amount of liquid and the resulting ice guarantees the necessary force to lift and handle the object (this principle is used also in food handling and in textile grasping). Even more complex are ultrasonic based <b>grippers,</b> where pressure standing waves are used to lift up a part and trap it at a certain level (example of levitation are both at the micro level, in screw and gasket handling, and at the macro scale, in solar cell or silicon wafer handling), and laser source that produces a pressure able to trap and move microparts in a liquid medium (mainly cells). The laser gripper are known also as laser tweezers.|$|E
