500|$|After {{a period}} of mourning, Nansen {{returned}} to London. He had been persuaded by his government to rescind his resignation until after King Edward's state visit to Norway in April 1908. His formal retirement from the diplomatic service was dated 1 May 1908, the same day on which his university professorship was changed from zoology to oceanography. This new designation reflected the general character of Nansen's more recent scientific interests. [...] In 1905 he had supplied the Swedish physicist Walfrid Ekman with the data which established the principle in oceanography known as the <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral.</b> Based on Nansen's observations of ocean currents recorded during the Fram expedition, Ekman concluded {{that the effect of}} wind on the sea's surface produced currents which [...] "formed something like a spiral staircase, down towards the depths".

Clear velocity spirals that basically correspond to theoretical <b>Ekman</b> <b>spirals</b> were identified for both mean and tidal currents. From these spirals and the corresponding Ekman equation, we estimated the time-averaged eddy viscosity () profiles. The estimate dμ was largest (2 - 3 × 10 - 3 m 2 s - 1) around 5 m from the bottom and decreased almost exponentially with height. A qualitatively similar profile of the eddy diffusivity was also inferred from the acoustic Doppler current profiler data and microstructure profiler data. The flux Richardson number was estimated as 0. 11 ± 0. 10 ∼ 0. 46 0. 17, indicating relatively large buoyancy contribution to the turbulent kinetic energy budget.

40|$|Ekman's {{theory of}} the wind-driven ocean surface {{boundary}} layer assumes a constant eddy viscosity and predicts that the current rotates with depth {{at the same rate}} as it decays in amplitude. Despite its wide acceptance, <b>Ekman</b> current <b>spirals</b> are difficult to observe. This is primarily because the spirals are small signals that are easily masked by ocean variability and cannot readily be separated from the geostrophic component. This study presents a method for estimating ageostrophic currents from shipboard acoustic Doppler current profiler data in Drake Passage and finds that observations are consistent with Ekman's theory. By taking into account the sampling distributions of wind stress and ageostrophic velocity, the authors find eddy viscosity values in the range of 0. 08 – 0. 12 m 2 s− 1 that reconcile observations with the classic theory in Drake Passage.

40|$|The {{problem is}} posed and solved for the oceanic surface {{boundary}} layer {{in the presence}} of wind stress, stable density stratification, equilibrium wind-waves, and remotely generated swell-waves. The addition of swell causes an amplification of the Lagrangian-mean current and rotation toward the swell-wave direction, a fat-tening of the <b>Ekman</b> velocity <b>spiral</b> and associated vertical Reynolds stress profile, an amplification of the inertial current response, an enhancement of turbulent variance and buoyancy entrainment rate from the pycnocline, and—for very large swell—an upscaling of the coherent Langmuir circulation patterns. Implica-tions are discussed for the parameterization of Langmuir turbulence influences on the mean current profile and the material entrainment rate in oceanic circulation models. In particular, even though the turbulent kinetic energy monotonically increases with wave amplitude inversely expressed by the turbulent Langmuir number La, the Lagrangian shear eddy viscosity profile kL(z) is a nonmonotonic function of La, first increasing with increasing wave amplitude up to approximately the wind-wave equilibrium level, then decreasing with ad-ditional swell-wave amplitude.

50|$|An entirely {{different}} class of subsurface current {{is caused by}} friction with surface currents and objects. When the wind or some other surface force compels surface currents into motion, {{some of this is}} translated into subsurface motion. The <b>Ekman</b> <b>Spiral,</b> named after Vagn Walfrid Ekman, is the standard for this transfer of energy. The <b>Ekman</b> <b>Spiral</b> works as follows: when the surface moves, the subsurface inherits some -but not all- of this motion. Due to the Coriolis Effect, however, the current moves at a 45˚ angle {{to the right of the}} first (left in the Southern Hemisphere). The current below is slower yet, and moves at a 45˚ angle to the right. This process continues in the same manner, until, at about 100 meters below the surface, the current is moving in the opposite direction of the surface current.|$|E
50|$|The {{collection}} of polar meteorology data started in 1893 with Fridtjof Nansen during his North Pole expedition. One {{of the goals}} of the expedition was to make detailed meteorological and early oceanographic measurements. The measurements made from Nansen’s ship, which was named Fram, were used by Vagn Walfrid Ekman to develop the theory of the turning of surface flow with friction (the <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral).</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral</b> is a {{structure}} of currents or winds near a horizontal boundary in which the flow direction rotates as one {{moves away from the}} boundary. It derives its name from the Swedish oceanographer Vagn Walfrid Ekman. The deflection of surface currents was first noticed by the Norwegian oceanographer Fridtjof Nansen during the Fram expedition (1893-1896) and the effect was first physically explained by Vagn Walfrid Ekman.|$|E
50|$|Surface oceanic {{currents}} {{are sometimes}} wind driven and develop their typical clockwise spirals {{in the northern}} hemisphere and counter-clockwise rotation in the southern hemisphere due to imposed wind stresses. In these wind driven currents, the <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral</b> effect results in the currents flowing {{at an angle to}} the driving winds. In addition, the areas of surface ocean currents move somewhat with the seasons; this is most notable in equatorial currents.|$|E
50|$|By solving this at z=0, {{the surface}} current {{is found to}} be (as {{expected}}) 45 degrees to the right (left) of the wind in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. This also gives the expected shape of the <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral,</b> both in magnitude and direction. Integrating these equations over the Ekman layer shows that the net Ekman transport term is 90 degrees to the right (left) of the wind in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|The Ekman layer, {{with its}} {{distinguishing}} feature the <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral,</b> is rarely {{observed in the}} ocean. The Ekman layer near {{the surface of the}} ocean extends only about 10 - 20 meters deep, and instrumentation sensitive enough to observe a velocity profile in such a shallow depth has only been available since around 1980. Also, wind waves modify the flow near the surface, and make observations close to the surface rather difficult.|$|E
50|$|The {{shearing}} of {{the wind}} is usually three-dimensional, that is, {{there is also a}} change in direction between the 'free' pressure-driven geostrophic wind and the wind close to the ground. This is related to the <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral</b> effect. The cross-isobar angle of the diverted ageostrophic flow near the surface ranges from 10° over open water, to 30° over rough hilly terrain, and can increase to 40°-50° over land at night when the wind speed is very low.|$|E
50|$|During the {{expedition}} of the Fram, Fridtjof Nansen had observed that icebergs tend to drift {{not in the}} direction of the prevailing wind but at an angle of 20°-40° to the right. Bjerknes invited Ekman, still a student, to investigate the problem and, in 1905, Ekman published his theory of the <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral</b> which explains the phenomenon in terms of the balance between frictional effects in the ocean and the Coriolis force, which arises from moving objects in a rotating environment, like planetary rotation.|$|E
50|$|The diagram above {{attempts}} {{to show the}} forces associated with the <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral</b> as applied to the Northern hemisphere. The force from above is in red (beginning with the wind blowing over the water surface), the Coriolis force (which is shown {{at right angles to}} the force from above when it should in fact be at right angles to the actual water flow) is in dark yellow, and the net resultant water movement is in pink, which then becomes the force from above for the layer below it, accounting for the gradual clockwise spiral motion as you move down.|$|E
50|$|Through {{vertical}} eddy viscosity, winds act {{directly and}} frictionally on the Ekman layer, which typically is the upper 50-100m in the ocean. The frictional surface flow (u) {{is at an}} angle {{to the right of the}} wind (45 degrees if viscosity is uniform in the vertical z-direction). This surface flow then modifies the flow slightly beneath it, which then is slightly more to the right, and finally the exponentially-weaker-with-depth flow vectors die down at around 50-100 meters, and finally form a spiral, called the <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral.</b> The angle of each successive layer as we move downward through the spiral depends on the strength and vertical distribution of the vertical eddy viscosity.|$|E
50|$|The {{horizontal}} motion of sea ice is quite difficult to model because ice is a non-Newtonian fluid.Sea ice will deform primarily at fracture points {{which in turn}} will form at the points of greatest stress and lowest strength, or where the ratio {{between the two is}} a maximum. Ice thickness, salinity and porosity will all affect the strength of the ice. The motion of the ice is driven primarily by ocean currents, though to a lesser extent by wind. Note that stresses will not be {{in the direction of the}} winds or currents, but rather will be shifted by coriolis effects—see, for instance, <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral.</b>|$|E
50|$|Surface {{currents}} flow at a 45° {{angle to}} the wind due to {{a balance between the}} Coriolis force and the drags generated by the wind and the water. If the ocean is divided vertically into thin layers, the magnitude of the velocity (the speed) decreases from a maximum at the surface until it dissipates. The direction also shifts slightly across each subsequent layer (right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere). This is called the <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral.</b> The layer of water from the surface to the point of dissipation of this spiral is known as the Ekman layer. If all flow over the Ekman layer is integrated, the net transportation is at 90° to the right (left) of the surface wind in the northern (southern) hemisphere.|$|E
5000|$|Ekman {{transport}} is {{a factor}} in coastal upwelling regimes which provide the nutrient supply for some of the largest fishing markets on the planet. Wind in these regimes blows parallel to the coast (such as along the coast of Peru, where the wind blows out of the southeast, and also in California, where it blows out of the northwest). From Ekman transport, surface water has a net movement of 90° to the left in such a location. Because the surface water flows away from the coast, the water must be replaced with water from below. It {{is important to remember that}} in shallow coastal waters, the <b>Ekman</b> <b>spiral</b> is normally not fully formed and the wind events that cause upwelling episodes are typically rather short. This leads to many variations in the extent of upwelling, but the ideas are still generally applicable.|$|E
5000|$|Coastal {{upwelling}} is {{the best}} known type of upwelling, and the most closely related to human activities as it supports {{some of the most}} productive fisheries in the world. Wind-driven currents are diverted {{to the right of the}} winds in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere due to the Coriolis effect. The result is a net movement of surface water at right angles to the direction of the wind, known as the Ekman transport (See also <b>Ekman</b> <b>Spiral).</b> When Ekman transport is occurring away from the coast, surface waters moving away are replaced by deeper, colder, and denser water. [...] Normally, this upwelling process occurs at a rate of about 5-10 meters per day, but the rate and proximity of upwelling to the coast can be changed due to the strength and distance of the wind.|$|E
