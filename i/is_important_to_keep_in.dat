25|$|When a nucleon {{such as a}} proton or neutron {{is added}} to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it {{to all the other}} nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but {{primarily}} to its immediate neighbours due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the nuclear force generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that nucleons are quantum objects. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.|$|E

2500|$|It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> {{mind the}} {{difference}} between the domain of a family of densities and the parameters of the family. [...] Different values of the parameters describe different distributions of different random variables on the same sample space (the same set of all possible values of the variable); this sample space is the domain of the family of random variables that this family of distributions describes. [...] A given set of parameters describes a single distribution within the family sharing the functional form of the density. From the perspective of a given distribution, the parameters are constants, and terms in a density function that contain only parameters, but not variables, are part of the normalization factor of a distribution (the multiplicative factor that ensures that the area under the densitythe probability of something in the domain occurring equals 1). This normalization factor is outside the kernel of the distribution.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was no real}} consensus, {{at least}} among {{surviving}} Roman texts and epitaphs, {{of what happened to}} a person after death or the existence of an afterlife. Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia claims that most people are of the opinion that after death one returns to the non-sensing state that occurred before birth but admits, however scornfully, {{that there are people who}} believe in the immortality of the soul. Seneca the Younger seems to be less consistent, arguing both sides, indicating that death brings about utter annihilation while also talking about some survival of the spirit after it escapes from the prison of the body. Tacitus at the end of Agricola takes the opposite opinion to Pliny, and claims that the wise believe the spirit does not die with the body, although he may be specifically referring to the pious [...] – which harkens to the mythological idea of Elysium. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that these are the opinions of a select few well-educated elite males and may not be characteristic of all of Roman views.|$|E

2500|$|To {{make this}} first event more approachable to understanding, Baba gives {{the metaphor of}} an Infinite ocean and a drop of that ocean. In this metaphor, Paramatma (a vedantic term, for which Meher Baba says Over-soul would be the closest western equivalent) is likened to an {{infinite}} and limitless ocean. Any drop of this ocean (the drop signifying the individuated soul) is the ocean itself, since no differentiation between drops has yet been conceived. If we liken the manifestation of the First Urge as the imagined separation of one drop from the ocean, then the infinite ocean comes to look upon itself through this drop as merely this most finite, most limited drop of the infinite and unlimited ocean. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that here Meher Baba is using metaphor and analogy to explain changes in God's imagination {{and the development of}} consciousness and that he is not describing a metaphysical ocean or literal drops in any sense.

2500|$|The long poem Omeros by Derek Walcott {{has drawn}} mixed {{criticism}} {{on whether it}} {{should or should not}} be tied to the traditional epic form. [...] Those against that idea say that the poem's story is not as important as those found in traditional epics. [...] Omeros tells the tale of fishermen in the Caribbean fighting over and lusting after a waitress instead of a typically heroic tale of battles and quests. [...] On {{the other side of the}} argument lies the point that it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that Omeros has ties to the epic genre, if only as a contrast. [...] By putting more simple characters in the forefront as opposed to warriors, Walcott revises the traditional epic form, which these critics say is something to notice as opposed to cutting off Omeros from any ties to the epic whatsoever. [...] Furthermore, these critics say that one cannot ignore the epic influence on the poem since its characters' names are taken from Homer. [...] In Omeros there are distinct elements obviously influenced by traditional epics, such as a trip to the underworld, talk of a muse, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Biosecurity, a {{management}} measure {{used to prevent}} the transmission of diseases and disease agents on the facility, <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind when designing a facility. In order to achieve {{a high level of}} biosecurity, collection facilities should be placed as far as possible from one another, as well as from farms. According to the FAO's recommendations, facilities should be [...] "at least 3 km from farms or other biological risks and 1 km from main roads and railways". Separation between collection facilities and surrounding farms can improve biosecurity as pests, such as flies and mice, have the potential to travel from farm to facility and vice versa. Other disease agents may be able to travel through the air via wind, furthering the importance of separation of farms and proper air sanitation and ventilation. Additionally, a perimeter fence is used to prevent potential threats that could cause contamination to germplasms, such as unauthorized personnel or unwanted animals, from entering the facilities. Animals may be housed in pens located inside or outside of a barn {{as long as they are}} contained within the perimeter fence. When interaction with outside objects, such as feed trucks or veterinary personnel, is necessary, complete sanitation is required to decrease the risk of contamination. There is always the possibility of disease spreading among the animals whose biological data is being collected or from animal to human. An example of a disease that can easily spread through germplasm is Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, otherwise known as PRRS. A highly contagious disease between swine, PRRS causes millions of dollars to be lost annually by producers. The disease can be spread through boar semen. Therefore, biosecurity is particularly important when genetic material will be inserted into another animal to prevent the spread of such diseases.|$|E

2500|$|Edge: A {{strip of}} metal, tuned {{normally}} to just less than 90-degrees, {{that runs the}} length of {{either side of the}} board. This sharp edge is necessary to be able to produce enough friction to ride on ice, and the radius of the edge directly affects the radius of carving turns, and in turn the responsiveness of the board. Kinking, rusting, or general dulling of the edge will significantly hinder the ability for the edge to grip the snow, so it is important that this feature is maintained. However, many riders who spend a fair amount of their time grinding park rails, and especially handrails, will actually use a detuning stone or another method to intentionally dull their edges, either entirely or only in certain areas. [...] This helps to avoid [...] "catching" [...] on any tiny burrs or other obstructions that may exist or be formed on rails, boxes, and other types of grind. [...] Catching on a rail can, more than likely, result in a potentially serious crash, particularly should it occur on a handrail or more advanced rail set-up. [...] In addition, it's relatively common for freestyle riders to [...] "detune" [...] the edges around the board's contact points. [...] This practice can help to reduce the chances of the rider catching an edge in a choppy or rutted-out jump landing or similar situation. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that drastic edge detuning can be near-impossible to fully reverse and will significantly impede board control & the ability to hold an edge in harder-packed snow. [...] One area where this can be quite detrimental is in a half-pipe, where well-sharpened edges are often crucially important for cutting through the hard, sometimes icy, walls.|$|E
