We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} choosing the edge weights of an undirected graph so as to maximize or minimize some function of the eigenvalues of the associated Laplacian matrix, subject to some constraints on the weights, such as nonnegativity, or a given total value. In many interesting cases this problem is convex, i. e., it involves minimizing a convex function (or maximizing a concave function) over a convex set. This allows us to give simple necessary and sufficient optimality conditions, derive interesting dual problems, find analytical solutions in some cases, and efficiently compute numerical solutions in all cases.

This form of binary phase-shift keying {{is a simple}} method for encoding digital serial data of arbitrary bit patterns without any long strings of continuous zeros or ones, and having the encoding clock rate embedded within the transmitted data. Manchester encoding {{is a form of}} binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) that has gained wide acceptance as the modulation scheme for low-cost radio-frequency (RF) transmission of digital data. Manchester is a simple method for encoding digital serial data of arbitrary bit patterns without having any long strings of continuous zeros or ones, and having the encoding clock rate embedded within the transmitted data. These two characteristics enable low-cost data-recovery circuits to be constructed that can decode transmitted data with variable signal strengths from transmitters with imprecise, low-cost, data-rate clocks. The encoding of digital data in Manchester format defines the binary states of " 1 " and " 0 " to be transitions rather than static values.

40|$|Compressor blades {{often have}} a small 'spike' in the surface {{pressure}} distribution {{at the leading edge}}. This may result from blade erosion, manufacture defects or compromises made in the original design process. In this thesis it is shown that these spikes will increase the loss generated by a blade only when they become large enough to initiate boundary layer transition at the leading edge through a separation bubble; this process increases profile loss by about 30 %. A criterion is presented, based on the spike diffusion, which can be used to determine whether leading <b>edge</b> <b>transition</b> will occur or not; this criterion is simple and quick to determine and has to potential to be used on a production line to reject those leading edges that would otherwise be detrimental. The spikes are also shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the flow close to the endwalls. If they cause leading <b>edge</b> <b>transition</b> in this region then they will cause a growth in the size of the three-dimensional separations that exist in the corner between the blades' suction surfaces and the endwalls. On the low speed stator tested this process increased hub loss by around 100 %. Thus to prevent spikes becoming large a new method for producing a 'spikeless' leading edge has been developed; this leading edge can be attached easily to the thickness distribution of any blade and was found to be sharp, that is with very high curvature at the leading edge point. This spikeless leading edge was also found to be the best when the effects of real manufacture deviations, measured off of a production line, were considered. Asymmetry was found to be detrimental and bluntness was only beneficial when unrealistically large deviations were considered. The best leading edge geometry is therefore sharp and symmetric.

The bolometers were made of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -. (YBCO) thin films deposited on -oriented and 10 x 10 x 1 - 0. 5 mm 3 sized single crystal MgO substrates by using DC inverted cylindrical magnetron sputtering (ICMS) technique with 200 nm thickness. The thin films were characterized in detail by employing structural (XRD, SEM, EDX, and AFM), magnetic (. -T) and electrical (R-T) measurements. We have investigated effects of temperature and modulation frequency on the magnitude and phase of the infrared response of the {{both large and small}} area bolometers. Dependence of the phase and magnitude of the response of MgO substrate YBCO <b>edge</b> <b>transition</b> bolometers to a near infrared radiation on the superconducting transition width has also been investigated in this work. We have observed that the superconductivity transition width has major effects on the response of the bolometers such as; on a dip of the phase of the response versus modulation frequency curve around 1 Hz, the rate of decrease of the magnitude of the response, and dependence of the phase of the response on temperature at mid-range modulation frequencies.
