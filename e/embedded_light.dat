50|$|It {{has been}} {{predicted}} theoretically that a 'photonic' material environment {{can control the}} rate of radiative recombination of an <b>embedded</b> <b>light</b> source. A main research goal is the achievement of a material with a complete photonic bandgap: a range of frequencies in which no electromagnetic modes exist and all propagation directions are forbidden. At the frequencies of the photonic bandgap, spontaneous emission of light is completely inhibited. Fabrication of a material with a complete photonic bandgap is a huge scientific challenge. For this reason photonic materials are being extensively studied. Many different kinds of systems in which the rate of spontaneous emission is modified by the environment are reported, including cavities, two, and three-dimensional photonic bandgap materials.|$|E

30|$|Our first {{experiment}} {{analyzes the}} ability of the Dioptase middleware to efficiently serve streams. Toward that end, a producer is deployed on the Thing and acquires data from the <b>embedded</b> <b>light</b> sensor. Every 500 milliseconds, the producer performs a new measurement and sends it (∼ 100 B/s) to each consumer connected to the component. Each consumer is deployed on a standard computer and, because the Spot and the phone have very different capabilities, the number of clients is different between the experiments. All the experiments generate raw data directly into the devices’ storages (the phone and the Spot embed two flash storages of respectively 16 GB and 4 MB). These data are retrieved and processed a posteriori. Before the beginning of the experiment, time informations are broadcasted (UDP) to synchronize the internal clock of each device; time error is less than ten milliseconds.|$|E

40|$|We have {{performed}} angle-resolved measurements of spontaneous-emission spectra from laser dyes and quantum dots in opal and inverse opal photonic crystals. Pronounced directional dependencies of the emission spectra are observed: angular ranges of strongly reduced emission adjoin with angular ranges of enhanced emission. It appears that emission from <b>embedded</b> <b>light</b> sources is affected {{both by the}} periodicity and by the structural imperfections of the crystals: the photons are Bragg diffracted by lattice planes and scattered by unavoidable structural disorder. Using a model comprising diffuse light transport and photonic band structure, we quantitatively explain the directional emission spectra. This provides detailed understanding of the transport of spontaneously emitted light in real photonic crystals, which is essential {{in the interpretation of}} quantum-optics in photonic band-gap crystals and for applications wherein directional emission and total emission power are controlled.

40|$|In {{photonic}} materials the {{refractive index}} varies on a length scale {{comparable to the}} wavelength of light; as a consequence, propagation of light is strongly modified with respect to that in homogeneous dielectric materials. In this thesis experiments are reported with light souces in crystalline and random photonic materials. It had been predicted that photonic crystals could modify the radiative decay rate of <b>embedded</b> <b>light</b> sources. However, this prediction was never verified experimentally. We {{have been able to}} prove this prediction for the first time using CdSe nanocrystals as light sources in titania inverse opal photonic crystals. Spherical CdSe nanocrystals with a diameter between 3 nm and 6 nm were made by wet-chemical synthesis. These nanocrystals show so-called 'quantum-size-effects': the colour of the emission depends on the nanocrystals' size. Nanocrystals of 3 nm size emit blue light while nanocrystals of 6 nm emit red light. We measured the rate of emission, or the radiative lifetime, of the nanocrystals as a function of emission colour and observed that blue light is emitted about three times faster than red light. The rates were found to be in good agreement with quantum-mechanical calculations on small particles. Subsequently, we embedded the nanocrystals in our photonic crystals and again measured the radiative lifetime. We observed that the lifetime of the nanocrystals varied by a factor-of-three depending on the lattice parameter of the photonic crystal. With this we have confirmed the hypothesis that photonic crystals can indeed control the radiative lifetime of <b>embedded</b> <b>light</b> sources. Porous gallium phosphide (GaP) is a random photonic material that can be made by electrochemical etching of crystalline GaP. This process has been applied for many years. We observed that during etching light is generated at the pore fronts. We were able to reveal the mechanism of light generation and attributed it to a hot-carrier process. During etching a high electric field is required. As a consequence hot carriers are generated and these hot carriers give rise to emission. Besides exploration of the emission and its mechanism we were able to use the emission as an internal light source to measure the optical properties of porous GaP during electrochemical etching. This allows one to deduce the optical characteristics of porous GaP directly and over the complete visible range in a single experiment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Chromium (Cr) and {{selenium}} (Se) are laser doped in {{silicon carbide}} (4 H-SiC p-type aluminium) to fabricate an <b>embedded</b> <b>light</b> emitting device and to tune the light emission. A near infrared Nd:YAG (1064 nm wavelength) laser source and an organometallic Cr compound (bis (ethyl benzene) -chromium) and organometallic Se compound (dimethyl selenide) {{were used to}} laser dope SiC. A p-n junction device structure was created using these dopants. The dopant profiles have been characterized using secondary ion mass spectrometry. Electrical properties were measured using Hall effect measurement. Enhanced diffusivity and solubility with complete activation of dopants was observed for laser doped Cr and Se. Cr and Se are unconventional dopants, which serve as a double donor and a double acceptor respectively, while aluminium (Al) behaves as single acceptor and nitrogen (N) as a single donor in SiC. The defect levels (donor and acceptor) created within the forbidden band gap of SiC due to Se, Cr and Al onsets the donor acceptor pair (DAP) recombination mechanism for luminescence observed in SiC. Electroluminescence studies showed an orange (677 nm) corresponding to Cr-Al and, red (698 nm) and white (380 - 900 nm) for Se-Al and pure white for Cr-Se-Al.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{in the area of}} {{sustainable}} chemical technology and is ultimately aimed at developing a novel generic approach towards efficient, clean, safe and scalable synthesis of important intermediates for pharmaceutical applications and catalysis using non-thermal activation of chemical bonds. Current study is focused on molecular activation by light, specifically addressing the class of singlet oxygen reactions. A laboratory-scale annular recirculating photoreactor and a scalable microreactor unit were designed, assembled and tested in oxygenation of α-pinene and stereoselective oxygenation of homoallylic alcohols by the photogenerated singlet oxygen. Efficiencies of light utilization and the quantum yields of the reactions for different sources of light in various lamp-reactor geometries were quantified using actinometry. It was shown that optimal thickness of the reaction layer, high intensity of light and elevated oxygen pressures in continuous gas-liquid segmented flow are crucial for both safe and efficient oxygenation. This study proved the viability of a novel concept of compact reactors with <b>embedded</b> <b>light</b> emitting diodes. Finally, a methodology of efficient oxyfunctionalization of allylic compounds was developed. Following the developed methodology, the applicability of functional nanomaterials based on pure and dye-modified porous silicon as heterogeneous photo sensitizers of singlet oxygen was studied in detail. It was demonstrated that the photosensitizing efficiency of all the samples is much lower than that of conventional dye photosensitizers. Low activity of the novel photosensitizers was attributed to quenching of the photogenerated singlet oxygen by the surface quenching groups of porous silicon, low quantum yield of photoluminescence in the case of pure porous silicon and to thermodynamically favorable quenching of the photoexcited porphyrin states due to energy/electron transfer to silicon nanocrystals in the case of dye modified porous silicon...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effect and {{exploitation}} of photonic crystals (PhCs) for light extraction in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs have come {{some way to}} meeting the requirements for several applications, but are limited in their suitability, particularly for étendue-limited applications requiring high directivity. Light extraction from LEDs presents a challenge, due to total internal reflection at {{the surface of the}} LED chip and current commercial light extraction techniques offer limited control over the direction of emission. PhC LEDs can operate in either a weak regime, where the PhC acts principally as a diffraction grating, or in strong regime where the PhC introduces a significant periodic (Bloch) component to the optical modes supported in the device. Experimental LEDs incorporating a buried photonic quasi-crystal are investigated and their weak-regime behaviour described by a simple model, with a 2 D part concerning the PhC tiling and a 1 D part considering the slab waveguiding properties of the device when the PhC is considered as an effective medium. A transfer and scattering matrix model for arbitrary slab waveguides is developed, including a model for emission from an embedded source layer. Experimental devices are shown to operate in the strong regime, possibly for the first time, comprised of large-area periodic arrays of nanorods with <b>embedded</b> <b>light</b> emitters suitable for large area fabrication and electrical contacting. Through confinement of light by index guiding or Fresnel reflection to the periodic layers, Bloch modes can be formed. Exploitation of both the strong and weak regimes in device designs for highly directional LEDs are discussed, with a comparison made between the two approaches. The strong PhC operating regime enabled by this work may facilitate significant performance improvements for practical highly directional LEDs over alternative methods...|$|E
