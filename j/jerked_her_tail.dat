Everybody loves Little Friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jenny bobbed {{her head}} rapidly and <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> <b>tail.</b> [...] "So I an told," [...] said she. [...] "I've {{never seen him}} do it, but I know others who have. They say he is no better than Sammy Jay or Blacky the Crow. But gracious, goodness! I can't sit here gossiping forever."

6000|$|Jenny Wren's eyes twinkled, and {{she laughed}} softly. [...] "Mr. Wren just has to be busy about something, bless his heart," [...] said she. [...] "He hasn't a lazy feather on him.

6000|$|She <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> hand away, and, burying it {{with its}} mate in his curly mop, {{shook his head}} back and forth. [...] "What shall I do with him, father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mine's Philadelphia. But {{everybody}} except Rene {{calls me}} Phil. I'm Squire Bucksteed's daughter--over at Marklake yonder.' She <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> little round chin towards the south behind Dallington. 'Sure-ly you know Marklake?' ...|$|R

6000|$|Liza {{put on the}} air of a conquering hero, and sauntered on, enchanted at the uproar. She {{stuck out}} <b>her</b> elbows and <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> head on one side, and said to herself as she passed through the bellowing crowd: ...|$|R
6000|$|The men had all {{got up and}} {{approached}} slowly, staring with dull surprise. Madame Levaille <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> daughter away from the door, swung her round upon a seat close to the wall. Then she turned fiercely to the men-- ...|$|R

50|$|In 2005, a baby dolphin (now named Winter) became {{entangled}} in the ropes of a crab trap. The rope cut off the supply of blood to <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> which resulted in <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> being amputated.|$|R
60|$|The Sheik {{returned}} to his tent; {{but he did not}} enter it. Instead he walked to the side where little Meriem lay close to the goat skin wall, very frightened.

6000|$|... 'That they what?' cried Catherine, {{gazing at}} him with a troubled countenance.

6000|$|... "This is what I like," [...] said Mrs. Flushing. She <b>jerked</b> <b>her</b> {{head at the}} Villa. [...] "A {{little house}} in a garden. I had one once in Ireland. One could lie in bed in the mornin' and pick roses outside the window with one's toes." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{second story}} recounts {{the tale of}} the [...] "girl-bird" [...] Gertrude McFuzz, who has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers. She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for {{something}} to make <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> grow. He tries to tell <b>her</b> that <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> is just right for her species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells her where she can find berries that will make <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> grow. The first berry makes <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> to grow to an enormous size. However, the added weight of too many feathers does not allow her to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, who hears her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather left—as before—she now has [...] "enough, because now she is smarter." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>Jerking</b> <b>her</b> roughly to {{her feet}} they forced her toward a window but she refused to walk, {{throwing}} herself instead upon the floor. They were very angry and would have resorted to cruelties to compel her obedience but dared not, since the wrath of Lu-don might fall heavily upon whoever mutilated his fair prize.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the fiddle}} lay just behind her, {{and as she}} moved <b>her</b> <b>tail,</b> she drew it between the strings of the fiddle, where it caught fast. Then she gave <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> a <b>jerk</b> and pulled the fiddle against the tree, which made a loud noise. This frightened the cat greatly, and not knowing {{what was the matter}} with <b>her</b> <b>tail,</b> she started to run as fast as she could. But still the fiddle clung to <b>her</b> <b>tail,</b> and at every step it bounded along and made such a noise that she screamed with terror. And in her fright she ran {{straight}} towards the cow, which, seeing a black streak coming at her, and hearing the racket made by the fiddle, became also frightened and made such a jump {{to get out of the}} way that she jumped right across the brook, leaping over the very spot where the moon shone in the water! ...|$|R
