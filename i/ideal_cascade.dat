40|$|The {{status of}} the theory of isotope mixture {{separation}} in cascades is presented. The problems that limit the concept of an <b>ideal</b> <b>cascade</b> in the case of separation of binary mixtures and arbitrary separation factors at cascade stages are discussed. A new type of separating cascades which have a total flow less than the flow of the corresponding <b>ideal</b> <b>cascade</b> is presented. Furthermore, these “optimum” cascades may permit mixing concentrations and still produce higher cascade separative work. In the paper, a criterion to define efficiency for the separation of multi-isotope mixtures is analyzed. The analysis is based on the concept of the match-abundance ratio cascade (MARC). The approach has demonstrated that in order to obtain the optimum parameters of a single stage in a cascade it is necessary to minimize the linear combination of the inverse values of “partial separative powers ” for all mixture components...|$|E
40|$|Whey protein isolate, {{containing}} a-Lactalbumin and ß-Lactoglobulin, {{was separated}} {{by using a}} continuous three-stage ultrafiltration cascade system. Single-stage experiments were optimized to enable good and stable cascade operation. Three different cascade configurations, a non-constrained ideal system (Configuration A), and adapted version (Configuration B), and a countercurrent cascade (Configuration C) were experimentally tested and compared. The countercurrent cascade system showed the traditional trade-off between yield and purity. Both the adapted cascade system and the non-constrained <b>ideal</b> <b>cascade</b> gave better performance in terms of recovery and purity and show potential for application, albeit for different purposes...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} fluid, stirred at high wavenumbers and damped by both viscosity and linear friction, {{is modeled}} by a statistical field theory. The fluid's long-distance behavior is studied using renormalization-group (RG) methods, as begun by Forster, Nelson, and Stephen [Phys. Rev. A 16, 732 (1977) ]. With friction, which dissipates energy at low wavenumbers, one expects a stationary inverse energy cascade for strong enough stirring. While such developed turbulence {{is beyond the}} quantitative reach of perturbation theory, a combination of exact and perturbative results suggests a coherent picture of the inverse cascade. The zero-friction fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is derived from a generalized time-reversal symmetry and implies zero anomalous dimension for the velocity even when friction is present. Thus the Kolmogorov scaling of the inverse cascade cannot be explained by any RG fixed point. The beta function for the dimensionless coupling ghat is computed through two loops; the ghat^ 3 term is positive, as already known, but the ghat^ 5 term is negative. An <b>ideal</b> <b>cascade</b> requires a linear beta function for large ghat, consistent with a Padé approximant to the Borel transform. The conjecture that the Kolmogorov spectrum arises from an RG flow through large ghat is compatible with other results, but the accurate k^- 5 / 3 scaling is not explained and the Kolmogorov constant is not estimated. The lack of scale invariance should produce intermittency in high-order structure functions, as observed in some but not all numerical simulations of the inverse cascade. When analogous RG methods are applied to the one-dimensional Burgers equation using an FDT-preserving dimensional continuation, equipartition is obtained instead of a cascade [...] in agreement with simulations.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{potential}} use of <b>ideal</b> nanofiltration <b>cascades</b> for the industrial fractionation of oligosac- charides, simulations of single, three and five stage NF cascades were carried out. Three and five stage <b>ideal</b> <b>cascades</b> show {{significant improvement in}} separation with diafiltration compared to single stage systems. The calculations do imply different membrane areas in each stage of the cascade. The ratio of the sieving coefficients of abinary mixture over the membrane {{plays an important role}} in determining the relation between yield and purity in a cascade system. A thigh sieving coefficient ratios,both yield and purity increase concurrently in a three stage system,whereas at a low ratio of the sieving coefficients, the yield and purity become inversely proportional on the retentate side. In a five stage systems,both yield and purity become inversely proportional at high and low sieving coefficient ratios. A five stage cascade system installation would be optima lfor most applications since at very low local separation factors sufficient separation and yield could be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Onsager's {{analysis}} of the hydrodynamics of fluid circulation in the boundary layer on the rotor wall of a gas centrifuge is reviewed. The description of the flow in the boundary layers {{on the top and}} bottom end caps due to Carrier and Maslen is summarized. The method developed by Wood and Morton of coupling the flow models in the rotor wall and end cap boundary layers to complete the hydrodynamic {{analysis of}} the centrifuge is presented. Mechanical and thermal methods of driving the internal gas circulation are described. The isotope enrichment which results from the superposition of the elementary separation effect due to the centrifugal field in the gas and its internal circulation is analyzed by the Onsager-Cohen theory. The performance function representing the optimized separative power of a centrifuge as a function of throughput and cut is calculated for several simplified internal flow models. The use of asymmetric <b>ideal</b> <b>cascades</b> to exploit the distinctive features of centrifuge performance functions is illustrated...|$|R

The circuit with single input and three high-impedance current outputs, <b>ideal</b> for <b>cascading,</b> realizes low-pass, band-pass, and inverting band-reject transfer functions.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} problems related to online social networks is to infer the information transmission capacity between two users by analyzing their online activities. The solution to this problem makes it possible for us to develop efficient strategies to promote a product through online social networks, aka viral marketing [10]. In general, we name a message that diffuses through networks as a contagion or cascade and those users who react on the message as infected users. In the <b>ideal</b> case, <b>cascades</b> are able to reveal the links among network users, if we can fully observe the information flow. In other words, if every user explicitly states from whom he/she receives the message when he/she reacts on it, we are aware of the connection between him/her and his/her information source. However, this is far from the truth in reality.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a direct}} {{synthesis}} approach is proposed for designing a Chebyshev filter {{that matches the}} frequency variant complex loads at both the ports. The approach {{is based on the}} power wave renormalization theory and two practical assumptions: 1) the prescribed transmission zeros are stationary and 2) the reflection zeros are located along an imaginary axis. Three conditions are derived to stipulate the characteristic polynomials of the filter's responses through the renormalization of reference load impedances. These conditions are sequentially applied to ensure that the filter is physically realizable and well matched to the complex loads. It has been shown that the optimally synthesized filtering network that consists of an <b>ideal</b> filter <b>cascaded</b> with a piece of transmission line of an optimal length at each port can match the complex loads over a given frequency band with the best effort. By incorporating with an adjustment of the junction parameters, the approach provides an analytical yet flexible way to synthesize advanced microwave circuits composed of multiple filters connected together through some generalized junctions. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through three synthesis examples...|$|R
40|$|The {{homogeneous}} turbulence {{for which}} fluctuating magnetic fields and velocity fields {{are independent of}} one spatial coordinate but still possess all three components are studied to form a generalized two-and-half dimensional geometry. The integral of the z-vector potential and the magnetic helicity are shown to be ideal invariants, and the basic dynamical variables and the equations of uniform-density incompressible magnetohydrodynamics are defined. The possibility of simultaneous inverse cascades is considered, and Kolmogoroff dimensional analysis is employed to infer omnidirectional inverse cascade spectra. Implications of a selective decay hypothesis, where a tendency exists in the initial value problem for the <b>ideal</b> invariants directly <b>cascaded</b> to higher wavenumbers to be selectively dissipated, {{and the possibility of}} a dynamo action in the considered geometry, are examined...|$|R
40|$|The ideal invariants {{present in}} the {{formalism}} of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), i. e. global quantities that are conserved {{in the absence of}} sources and dissipative effects, {{play an important role in}} various theoretical and numerical studies of MHD turbulence. The fluxes of these ideal invariants represent separate channels that transfer the information across different scales in a turbulent system. Once a statistically stationary state of turbulence is reached, the amount of any ideal invariant quantity introduced in the system by a forcing mechanism equals the amount of the same quantity removed by the dissipative effects from the system. For highly developed turbulence, these two mechanisms act predominantly at different scales that are largely separated. Since the <b>ideal</b> invariant quantities <b>cascade</b> between scales, a constant flux is generated with great implication on the state of the system. Numerically, controlling the ideal invariant fluxes levels for a turbulent MHD system is important for the analysis of fundamental MHD turbulence properties. We propose a forcing mechanism that controls the three ideal invariants of MHD turbulence: the total energy, the cross-helicity and the magnetic helicity. This forcing is implemented in the freely available TURBO solver, that is also briefly presented. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{progress}} {{regarding the}} noncanonical Hamiltonian formulation of extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD), a model with Hall drift and electron inertia, is summarized. The {{advantages of the}} Hamiltonian approach are invoked to study some general properties of XMHD turbulence, and to compare them against their ideal MHD counterparts. For instance, the helicity flux transfer rates for XMHD are computed, and Liouville's theorem for this model is also verified. The latter is used, {{in conjunction with the}} absolute equilibrium states, to arrive at the spectra for the invariants, and to determine the direction of the cascades, e. g., generalizations of the well-known <b>ideal</b> MHD inverse <b>cascade</b> of magnetic helicity. After a similar analysis is conducted for XMHD by inspecting second order structure functions and absolute equilibrium states, a couple of interesting results emerge. When cross helicity is taken to be ignorable, the inverse cascade of injected magnetic helicity also occurs in the Hall MHD range - this is shown to be consistent with previous results in the literature. In contrast, in the inertial MHD range, viz. at scales smaller than the electron skin depth, all spectral quantities are expected to undergo direct cascading. The consequences and relevance of our results in space and astrophysical plasmas are also briefly discussed. Comment: 32 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. Added references, corrected typos.

40|$|Cost {{effective}} Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks {{call for}} the use of 10 Gbit/s directly modulated lasers. However, the inherent frequency chirp of directly modulated lasers acts as a limiting factor on the performance of lightwave systems. The effective bandwidth of cascaded filters is smaller than that of any individual filter. The random misalignment between the center frequency of the light source and the filters will have a severe degradation on the system and even blind it, as it is combined with the concatenation. I report the computer simulation results of the signal quality and misalignment tolerance of directly modulated laser (DML) signals and externally modulated laser (EML) signals filtered by <b>cascaded</b> <b>ideal</b> Gaussian filters and Arrayed Waveguide Grating de-multiplexer produced by Ignis Photonyx. DML lasers with adiabatic and transient chirp characteristic at 2. 5 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s are investigated. We found that the adiabatic chirp dominated laser shows an asymmetric sensitivity response to the frequency shift, whereas the response transient chirp dominated laser is symmetric. The pass-band flattened AWG de-multiplexer shows a better detuning tolerance than the ideal Gaussian filter with the same 3 -dB bandwidth. And I report the experimental results of filtering the DML and EML signals by an AWG de-multiplexer. The response of the AWG filter appears better than the simulation results on EML signals and the results of filtering DML signals show a good match with the simulation results. The extinction ratio for the adiabatic chirp dominated laser can be improved by appropriate misalignment between the laser and the filter center frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 This thesis {{presents}} two {{new approaches}} for the broadband, time-domain modeling of lossy transmission lines. Each approach {{is based on}} an alternative derivation of delay extraction in order to separate the line's linear phase from its attenuation and dispersion. Augmentation networks represent the derived attenuation networks as rational function approximations. Final network models are implemented in a SPICE circuit simulator for transient analysis. The first approach to extract delay is based on the properties of the eigenvectors of the matrix exponential function in the solution to the telegrapher's equations. The resultant network contains an <b>ideal</b> transmission line <b>cascaded</b> with two asymmetrical delayless attenuation networks. When applied to a single line with constant line parameters, the resultant attenuation networks are inherently non-passive and to which accurate low-order broadband approximations are not possible. The effects of alternative mathematical techniques such as factorization, forcing reciprocity, and eigenvector normalization or scaling, are applied to determine if passive, low-order approximations of the augmentation networks are obtainable. The second approach utilizes a similarity transformation at each transmission line port to obtain commutable matrix exponentials in order to extract delay. The resulting model includes a cascade of one or more delayless networks, an ideal transmission line of unity characteristic impedance, and transformation networks at each port. This approach is applied to single and coupled lines at lengths ranging from 5 cm to 10 m and frequencies up to 5 GHz. The resultant time-domain models are accurate with low-order approximations for lines with constant, non-zero per-unit-length parameters. Lines with zero shunt conductance or frequency-dependent line parameters prove difficult to accurately model at low-orders with this approach...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{fundamental}} physics of cascades and spectra in 2 D Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) turbulence, and {{compare and contrast}} this system with 2 D MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) turbulence. The important similarities include basic equations, <b>ideal</b> quadratic invariants, <b>cascades</b> {{and the role of}} linear elastic waves. Surface tension induces elasticity, and the balance between surface tension energy and turbulent kinetic energy determines a length scale (Hinze scale) of the system. The Hinze scale may be thought of as the scale of emergent critical balance between fluid straining and elastic restoring forces. The scales between the Hinze scale and dissipation scale constitute the elastic range of the 2 D CHNS system. By direct numerical simulation, we find that in the elastic range, the mean square concentration spectrum H^ψ_k of the 2 D CHNS system exhibits the same power law (- 7 / 3) as the mean square magnetic potential spectrum H^A_k in the inverse cascade regime of 2 D MHD. This power law is consistent with an inverse cascade of H^ψ, which is observed. The kinetic energy spectrum of the 2 D CHNS system is E^K_k∼ k^- 3 if forced at large scale, suggestive of the direct enstrophy cascade power law of 2 D Navier-Stokes (NS) turbulence. The difference from the energy spectra of 2 D MHD turbulence implies that the back reaction of the concentration field to fluid motion is limited. We suggest this is because the surface tension back reaction is significant only in the interfacial regions. The interfacial regions fill {{only a small portion of}} the 2 D CHNS system, and their interface packing fraction is much smaller than that for 2 D MHD...|$|R
