5|$|Like Icelandic and Faroese, the {{development}} of English on the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and has since undergone substantial evolution. English is thus not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some, such as Dutch or Frisian, <b>do</b> <b>show</b> strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.|$|E
5|$|Still other chemists further {{exclude the}} group 3 {{elements}} from {{the definition of}} a transition metal. They do so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of transition metal chemistry. In this case, only groups 4–11 are regarded as transition metals. However, though the group 3 elements show few of the characteristic chemical properties of the transition metals, they <b>do</b> <b>show</b> some of their characteristic physical properties (on account of the presence in each atom of a single d electron).|$|E
5|$|Current {{official}} transit {{maps of the}} New York City Subway {{are based}} on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), but they <b>do</b> <b>show</b> major city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller. Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while being more aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} African Americans in the {{territory}} during this period was quite small but not insignificant. Newcomers continued to bring slaves with them, but there were many free blacks as well, some working as servants and some as completely independent pioneers. Information about the black immigrants during the earlier periods is sparse, but records <b>do</b> <b>show</b> {{that most of those}} at Fort Snelling were slaves. Records from 1850 indicate a population of 39 free blacks out of a total population of 6,077 citizens {{in the territory}} (which excluded Native American tribes). Before the 1840s these free persons could often expect to be treated equal to other racial groups. By the time Minnesota had achieved statehood, however, blacks had been disenfranchised and schools were segregated. Despite this, {{from the start of the}} Minnesota Territory in 1848 the leadership was predominantly antislavery thus ending the practice in this era.|$|E

Waiting list-controlled trials for peripheral joint osteoarthritis <b>do</b> <b>show</b> clinically relevant benefits, but these {{may be due to}} placebo effects. Acupuncture does not seem to produce long-term benefits. While electrostimulation techniques such as TENS have been used for twenty years to treat osteoarthritis in the knee, there is no conclusive evidence to show that it reduces pain or disability.|$|E

25|$|Despite these facts, {{studies show}} {{only a slight}} {{increase}} in immediate stressors among military brats whose parents serve in a combat zone, although no studies on the longer-term effects have ever been done. Boys and younger children <b>do</b> <b>show</b> the most risk when a parent is deployed, but rarely does this require clinical intervention. However, studies show that when a military member is deployed to a combat zone, the family cohesion is more disrupted than when service members are deployed to non-combat zones.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{inscriptions}} in Old Indic {{is found}} in northern Syria in Hittite records regarding the Hurrian-speaking Mitanni. The religious practices depicted in the Rigveda and those depicted in the Avesta, the central religious text of Zoroastrianism, show similarities. Some of the references to the Sarasvati in the Rigveda refer to the Ghaggar-Hakra River, while the Afghan river Haraxvaiti/Harauvati Helmand is sometimes quoted as the locus of the early Rigvedic river. The Rigveda does not explicitly refer to an external homeland or to a migration, but later Vedic and Puranic texts <b>do</b> <b>show</b> the movement into the Gangetic plains.|$|E
25|$|Some {{settlements}} <b>do</b> <b>show</b> a clear {{continuity of}} occupation from pre-Roman times into the provincial period, such as Cetea and Cicau. Archaeological evidence taken from pottery show a continued occupation of native Dacians {{in these and}} other areas. Architectural forms native to pre-Roman Dacia, such as the traditional sunken house and storage pits, remained during Roman times. Such housing continued to be erected well into the Roman period, even in settlements which clearly show an establishment after the Roman annexation, such as Obreja. Altogether, approximately 46 sites have been noted as existing on a spot in both the La Tène and Roman periods.|$|E

25|$|With {{global demand}} for {{biofuels}} {{on the increase}} due to the oil price increases taking place since 2003 {{and the desire to}} reduce oil dependency as well as reduce GHG emissions from transportation, there is also fear of the potential destruction of natural habitats by being converted into farmland. Environmental groups have raised concerns about this trade-off for several years, but now the debate reached a global scale due to the 2007–2008 world food price crisis. On the other hand, several studies <b>do</b> <b>show</b> that biofuel production can be significantly increased without increased acreage. Therefore, stating that the crisis in hand relies on the food scarcity.|$|E
25|$|According to the Free-radical theory, {{oxidative}} damage initiated by {{reactive oxygen species}} is {{a major contributor to}} the functional decline that is characteristic of aging. While studies in invertebrate models indicate that animals genetically engineered to lack specific antioxidant enzymes (such as SOD), in general, show a shortened lifespan (as one would expect from the theory), the converse manipulation, increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes, has yielded inconsistent effects on lifespan (though some studies in Drosophila <b>do</b> <b>show</b> that lifespan can be increased by the overexpression of MnSOD or glutathione biosynthesizing enzymes). Also contrary to this theory, deletion of mitochondrial SOD2 can extend lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.|$|E
25|$|Pestilence {{of several}} kinds raged among combatants and civilians in Germany and {{surrounding}} lands from 1618 to 1648. Many {{features of the}} war spread disease. These included troop movements, the influx of soldiers from foreign countries, and the shifting locations of battle fronts. In addition, the displacement of civilian populations and the overcrowding of refugees into cities led to both disease and famine. Information about numerous epidemics is generally found in local chronicles, such as parish registers and tax records, that are often incomplete and may be exaggerated. The chronicles <b>do</b> <b>show</b> that epidemic disease was not a condition exclusive to war time, but was present {{in many parts of}} Germany for several decades prior to 1618.|$|E
