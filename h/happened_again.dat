5|$|The ANC {{threatened}} to withdraw support for South Africa's next test match against Australia, {{which could have}} led to the cancellation the match due to safety concerns and Australia stated they would not play if the match didn't have ANC support. However, the future South African sports minister Steve Tshwete asked for the ANC to give the supporters another chance and the ANC did not withdraw their support. Instead they issued a warning that if it <b>happened</b> <b>again</b> they would oppose all future tours and the 1995 Rugby World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{first film}} has around 540 effect shots, the second 799, {{and the third}} 1,488 (2,730 in total). The total {{increases}} to 3,420 with the extended editions. 260 visual effect artists began work on the series, and the number doubled by The Two Towers. The crew, led by Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook, worked long hours, often overnight, to produce special effects within a short space of time. Jackson's active imagination was a driving force. For example, several major shots of Helm's Deep were produced within {{the last six weeks}} of post-production of The Two Towers, and the same <b>happened</b> <b>again</b> within the last six weeks on The Return of the King.|$|E

25|$|In the 80 m hurdles, Didrikson and Evelyne Hall almost dead-heated, but Didrikson was {{declared}} the winner; {{the same thing}} <b>happened</b> <b>again</b> at the Olympics. In the high jump, Didrikson and Jean Shiley tied for first, both setting a new American record. Osburn set an American record in the discus throw, winning from Jenkins and the eventual Olympic champion, Copeland; Didrikson, who was relatively unfamiliar with this event, placed fourth. Nan Gindele had set a world record in the javelin four weeks before the Trials, but failed to replicate that form at the Trials; Didrikson won with a personal best.|$|E
25|$|The new {{cellular}} resident {{quickly became}} an advantage, providing {{food for the}} eukaryotic host, which allowed it to live within it. Over time, the cyanobacterium was assimilated, {{and many of its}} genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host. From genomes that probably originally contained over 3000 genes only about 130 genes remain in the chloroplasts of contemporary plants. Some of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and imported back into the chloroplast (formerly the cyanobacterium). Separately, somewhere around 100 million years ago, it <b>happened</b> <b>again</b> and led to the amoeboid Paulinella chromatophora.|$|E

25|$|In 1870, at the {{beginning}} of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This <b>happened</b> <b>again</b> during the First World War and again very briefly during the Second World War, when it became clear that Paris would soon fall into German hands. However, on the last of these occasions the French capital was soon moved again to Vichy. In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{season of}} reality {{television}} singing competition American Idol began on January 17, 2006, and concluded on May 24, 2006. Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell returned to judge, and Ryan Seacrest returned to host. It {{is the most}} successful season to date ratings-wise, and resulted in 18 contestants (including all of the top 10 and a few semifinalists) getting record deals – nine of them with major labels. It was the first season with a male winner (Taylor Hicks) and a female runner-up (Katharine McPhee), which <b>happened</b> <b>again</b> in seasons 9, 10, 11, 13 and 15. It {{was also the first}} season of the series to be aired in high definition.|$|E
25|$|As {{stated in}} his biography, in a match in 1994, Arn {{was thrown into}} the ring ropes. The top rope broke from the turnbuckle, but {{he was able to}} land on his feet. Six months later, the same event <b>happened</b> <b>again,</b> but this time he landed full-force on to the {{concrete}} and hit his head, neck, and upper back. He never took time off to heal. As time passed, with no down time, the injuries worsened. In his biography, Anderson states that the first sign of problems was, during a match, his left arm suddenly went numb and unresponsive. Later on, they found a rib, possibly torn away from the spine during the accident, was popping in and out of joint, causing shoulder discomfort and weakness.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} later, while Gunn {{was out of}} town, Bogan again went on a rampage. When Gunn returned, and learned of this, he went looking for Bogan, and warned him that if this <b>happened</b> <b>again,</b> he would arrest Bogan. To this, Bogan replied {{that he would do}} as he pleased. Constable Gunn had a reputation, which he had shown on several {{occasions}}, as a man who would not back down nor be intimidated, and was known to have killed two men while holding that office. Gunn was a former Texas Ranger, who'd made his way up to Wyoming from Texas. Bogan hated Gunn, who had reprimanded him on several occasions by this point. However, by later witness accounts, Bogan feared Gunn, which probably led to what happened next.|$|E
25|$|On four {{occasions}} since 1990, the Middletown Times-Herald Record has run lengthy investigative {{articles on}} claims of electoral {{fraud in the}} village. A 1996 article found that Kiryas Joel residents who were students at yeshivas in Brooklyn had on many occasions apparently registered and voted in both the village and Brooklyn; a year later the paper reported that it had <b>happened</b> <b>again.</b> In 2001 absentee ballots were apparently cast by voters who did not normally reside in the village. In some cases, ballots were cast by people who seemed to reside in Antwerp, Belgium, without a set date of expected return and thus {{would not be allowed}} under New York law to vote in any election for state or local office. That article led to a county grand jury investigation in 2001, which concluded that while procedures were not followed and many mistakes were made, {{there was no evidence of}} deliberate intent to violate the law.|$|E
25|$|The brief {{conflict}} between Malacca and Lê Dynasty of Annam, began {{shortly after the}} 1471 Vietnamese invasion of Champa, then already a Muslim kingdom. The Chinese government, without knowing about the event, sent a censor Ch'en Chun to Champa in 1474 to install the Champa King, but he discovered Vietnamese soldiers had taken over Champa and were blocking his entry. He proceeded to Malacca instead and its ruler sent back tribute to China. In 1469, Malaccan envoys on their return from China was attacked by the Vietnamese who castrated the young and enslaved them. In view of Lê Dynasty's position as a protectorate to China, Malacca abstained from any act of retaliation. Instead, Malacca sent envoys to China in 1481 {{to report on the}} Vietnamese aggression and their invasion plan against Malacca, as well as to confront the Vietnamese envoys who happened to be present in the Ming court. However, the Chinese informed that since the incident was years old, they could do nothing about it, and the Emperor {{sent a letter to the}} Vietnamese ruler reproaching him for the incident. The Chinese Emperor also granted permission for Malacca to retaliate with violent force should the Vietnamese attack, an event that never <b>happened</b> <b>again</b> after that.|$|E
