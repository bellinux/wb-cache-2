5|$|McCain had {{fundraising}} {{problems in}} the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive <b>Immigration</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate.

Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third or fourth with 15percent or less support.|$|E

5|$|Ford often opposed {{governor}} Mark Sanford's political goals, arguing {{his proposed}} reforms were unwanted by the public, and he mostly opposed Sanford's fiscal policy and worked to override budget vetoes by the governor, claiming he {{was removed from}} the interests of citizens. An exception were security measures for the State House complex which Ford agreed were too costly. He also opposed Sanford's goal {{to increase the number of}} roll calls in the State Senate and voted against a 2008 <b>immigration</b> <b>reform</b> bill favored by Sanford, stating it would be an ineffective deterrent and would lead to less driving safety. The reform would have required all employers to use state driver's licenses or a database from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to check the legal status of workers. Ford co-sponsored a bill with Glenn McConnell that would limit the governor's authority to appoint and remove board members overseeing the Charleston port and increase required qualifications for board members. Ford opposed a bill giving Sanford authority over the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.|$|E

40|$|Immigrants in many {{countries}} have lower employment rates and earnings than natives. We study whether the option to naturalize improves immigrant assimilation. The empirical analysis relies on two major <b>immigration</b> <b>reforms</b> in Germany, acountry with a weak record of immigrant integration. Using discontinuities in the reforms' eligibility rules, we find few returns of citizenship for men, but substantial returns for women. Returns are also larger for more recent immigrants, but essentially zero for traditional guest workers. For immigrant women, access to citizenship accounts for 70 % of the assimilation rate, i. e. the wage return of an additional year in Germany...|$|R
