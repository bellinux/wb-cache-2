25|$|The {{glass ceiling}} metaphor {{has often been}} used to {{describe}} <b>invisible</b> <b>barriers</b> ("glass") through which women can see elite positions but cannot reach them ("ceiling"). These barriers prevent large numbers of women and ethnic minorities from obtaining and securing the most powerful, prestigious and highest-grossing jobs in the workforce.

40|$|We {{construct}} the <b>invisible</b> quantum <b>barrier</b> {{which represents the}} phenomenon of quantum reflection using the available data. We use the Abel equation to invert the data. The resulting <b>invisible</b> quantum <b>barrier</b> is double-valued in both axes. We study this <b>invisible</b> <b>barrier</b> {{in the case of}} atom and Bose-Einstein Condensate reflection from a solid silicon surface. A time-dependent, one-spatial dimension Gross-Pitaevskii equation is solved for the BEC case. We found that the BEC behaves very similarly to the single atom except for size effects, which manifest themselves in a maximum in the reflectivity at small distances from the wall. The effect of the atom-atom interaction on the BEC reflection and correspondingly on the <b>invisible</b> <b>barrier</b> is found to be appreciable at low velocities and comparable to the finite size effect. The trapping of ultracold atom or BEC between two walls is discussed. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

50|$|Social arenas {{that are}} {{inviting}} and successfully make visitors feel comfortable - like, {{but not limited}} to, parks, libraries, and plazas - help to reinforce engagement among community members. These social arenas bring together {{a variety of different}} people and allow them to communicate, experience and learn differences of one another. Just as structures can be built to reinforce solidarity and engagement, the construction of social arenas can as well develop estrangement. Take neighborhoods that are closed off by gates or are further in distance from city centers, where access is limited by travelling at high speeds to and from in a private vehicle. <b>Invisible</b> <b>barriers</b> such as price of property and proximity to stores, workplaces and civic centers work as well as agents of social stratification - usually based on things such as race, ethnicity and/or gender.|$|E
5000|$|As {{defined by}} Medical Anthropologist Dr. Paul Farmer, {{structural}} violence {{is the way}} by which social arrangements are constructed to put specific members of a population in harm's way. According to Dr. Farmer, social inequalities {{are at the heart}} of structural violence, where the prevailing societal framework imposes <b>invisible</b> <b>barriers</b> that perpetuate the suffering of certain groups of people. The term structural violence was first coined by Johan Galtung, the founder of peace and conflict studies, in 1969. The term further gained exposure when it was used by Latin American liberation theologians. These social arrangements are termed structural as they are embedded into the cultural, political and economic realms of society. The term violence highlights the fact that these structures cause injury or inequality to certain groups of peoples and constrain individual agency in the society in which they operate. [...] While structural violence exists in other parts of the world, its effects are more readily identified within Haiti.|$|E
50|$|The player {{characters}} {{can find}} the wand in Agathion, in the Reliquary, the central cavern of a complex of caves, protected by <b>invisible</b> <b>barriers.</b> The wand is still intelligent and extraordinarily powerful despite being weakened {{since the death of}} Orcus, and created the maze of caverns that stretch outward from this cavern hoping that it might be found. The wand can be found sitting upon a pedestal {{in the center of the}} cavern. Any character that makes the conscious choice to touch the circlet to the skull is destroyed along with the items, unless he concentrates on controlling the wand before touching it. Anarchocles feels an insane sense of revenge for his imprisonment, and wants to kill anyone he can, especially anyone in possession of the circlet. If the characters find the wand but are not in possession of the circlet, they can send the wand away either by using great magic, or they can accomplish the same feat if one of the characters sacrifices his own life to reactivate the wands ability to shift from one plane to another. Tenebrous is being eaten up from the inside by the power of the Last Word, so he will die if he doesnt find the Wand of Orcus in Agathion, assuming the characters destroyed the wand or sent it away.|$|E

5000|$|With {{their monthly}} updates, {{including}} supplementary content, and occasional live world events, Asherons Call offered [...] "episodic narrative content, periodic new quests, {{and events that}} visibly affect the entire world." [...] The games currency is the Pyreal. The world itself is large at over 500 sq mi. [...] Unlike many other games in the genre, there are no zones or instances on the worlds surface. This means players can cross the world on foot, without loading screens or <b>invisible</b> <b>barriers,</b> and any terrain {{that can be seen}} in the distance is a real object in the world. The world is also dotted with a system of one-way portals which expedite travel. Some of the portals also lead to intricate dungeons. Many of the dungeons are part of quests and contain unique treasures. The original magic system had specific formulae for each spell that the caster had to discover through trial and error. Magic was challenging and rare. This system of spell components was later phased out and replaced with a simpler system wherein magic casters would carry a [...] "foci" [...] for each of the magic schools they were trained in (creature, item, life and war) and a series of taper candles and scarabs. Each spell is learned from a scroll, either purchased or found as treasure. The old system was left in the game as an alternative.|$|E

Despite this there still seems to be several, more <b>invisible,</b> <b>barriers</b> that hampers business between member states. We therefore intend to examine how companies in two member states – Lithuania and Sweden – have been affected by such <b>invisible</b> <b>barriers</b> and how they are trying to cope with them. This research has been conducted using following theoretical foundation; <b>Invisible</b> <b>barriers,</b> knowledge, the Uppsala model, psychic distance and networks. Our empirical data have been gathered by holding semi structured interviews with 7 SMEs, this data have then been analyzed with the help of our theoretical foundation. We have found substantial evidence pointing towards the importance of psychic distance and lack of knowledge when explaining the barriers still in existence. Furthermore we have also discovered the duality of knowledge and networks which can be both barriers in themselves as well as ways for companies to work their way around previously mentioned barriers...|$|E
