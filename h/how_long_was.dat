500|$|Luton's cup win was the club's {{first major}} piece of {{silverware}} in its history. A jubilant Harford {{described it as}} [...] "the greatest win in my time at Luton," [...] having thought his team had lost the match when Smith scored. He commended his goalkeeper, saying: [...] "Considering all the circumstances, I think Dibble {{had to be the}} man of the match, and as for the young boy, [...] Black was sensational. He has so much talent." [...] The stand-in goalkeeper for Luton was delighted with his role in the final, but made it pertinent that he needed regular first-team football, or he would be tempted to leave the following season. Brian Stein spoke of his surprise of scoring the winner, and said: [...] "I asked the referee <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>was</b> left and he just blew the whistle." [...] Luton held a civic ceremony two days after the final, where the trophy was presented in front of the club's supporters. It was there the stem of the trophy had become noticeably damaged; Luton the following morning returned it to the competition's sponsors for repairs.|$|E
