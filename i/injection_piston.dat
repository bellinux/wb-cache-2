By using tracer LIF the fuel distribution prior to ignition has been monitored in a GDI-engine. The results obtained {{were used to}} determine the influence from various engine parameters such as nozzle type, spray angle, duration of injection, start of <b>injection,</b> <b>piston</b> shape, etc. Two fundamentally different concepts for controlling the stratification was evaluated and compared. In addition, the results were compared with CFD-modelling performed at Volvo Car Corporation. Hence, the results from the performed laser diagnostics were in direct use in the work of developing a new engine concept. Due to the strictly limited optical access of the GDI-engine an endoscopic detection system was developed and used for monitoring the distribution of gaseous fuel inside the combustion chamber. The endoscope provided an unrestricted view in areas of special interest that could not be reached by conventional through the piston detection. Raman spectroscopy has been applied to perform cycle-resolved measurements of the air/fuel-ratio in a running engine. The technique proved capable of providing quantitative data from single-shot measurements. Demonstrations of such measurements have been performed in both GDI- and HCCI-engines. In addition, a technique for making in-situ absolute calibration of fuel tracer LIF images using Raman scattering is outlined in detail. Different optical techniques have been utilized for primarily investigations of the mixture preparation and combustion in HCCI-engines. Fuel tracer LIF was used to make two-dimensional, cycle resolved, measurements of the fuel distribution. From this data the degree of homogeneity of the charge could be determined for different mixing strategies. Raman scattering provided cycle resolved absolute values of the air/fuel-ratio. Spontaneous emission from the flame was collected through various filters with an image intensified CCD-camera and with a high speed framing camera. Absorption measurements using a continuos light source revealed useful information for future diagnostics. A high-speed laser and imaging system has been adapted and used for true single-cycle resolved measurements in combustion engines. This technique provided a unique ability to study various combustion parameters with a high temporal resolution and without any averaging effects caused by cycle-to-cycle variations. The in-cylinder spray and fuel distributions were investigated in a GDI-engine by means of fuel tracer LIF. The early flame development in the same engine was visualized by high-speed imaging of OH-radicals. The highly stochastic ignition and combustion characteristics of HCCI engines were thoroughly studied. The high-speed imaging technique proved to be a crucial tool for mapping the fuel concentration distribution during the short combustion events. Both two- and three-dimensional concentration maps were generated to visualize the gradual consumption of the fuel that is unique to HCCI combustion.

Aimed at monitoring the engine running condition, the information carried by the vibration signal has to be broken down into its various contributions and then they have to be related to their respective excitation sources.

Due to big differences in price of gaseous and liquid fuels there is observed a natural tendency to use very small initial doses. At current level of introduction of gas-eous fuels to powering of traction engines {{there is a need}} to provide alternating fuelling of the engine with the Diesel only and in dual fuel system. It requires usage of original injection systems in the dual fuel engines, what largely restricts possibility of reduc-tion of the initial doses. In the paper are presented investigations concerning uniformity of the dosing by in-line piston pump of the P 56 - 01 type and two types of injectors with common rail system. The investigations have shown that the P 56 - 01 pump adjusted for nominal doses shows big non-uniformity of the dosage in area of small doses. Improved uniformity of the dosage can be attained in result of adjustment for a smaller doses, what allows reduction of the dose to about 15 - 20 % of nominal dose and improves smooth-ness of engine operation. Also in case of the injectors in common rail system, reduction of the doses is limited due to worsening of uniformity of the dosing from one cycle to another, and failure of the dosing. It results from the fact, that minimal doses in dual fuel system are smaller than the ones present in case of idling speed when the engine is run on the Diesel oil only.

Identification and analysis of noise sources are essential to evaluate the individual contribution (<b>injection,</b> combustion, <b>piston</b> slap, turbocharger, oil pump, valves) to the overall noise with the aim of selecting appropriate control strategies. Previous paper focused on the combustion related noise emission. The research activity aimed at diagnosing and controlling the combustion process via acoustic measurements. The optimal placement of the microphone was selected, where the signal was strongly correlated to the in-cylinder pressure development during the combustion process.

Therefore, during such activity, the attention was focused on the excitation forces and on their effect, the radiated noise. This work has been devoted to deeper insight into the structural response of the engine, that represents the transfer function between in-cylinder pressure and radiated noise. A small displacement common-rail diesel engine has been fully instrumented and its noise radiation has been investigated by analyzing the signals of microphones placed in selected locations around the engine. A method in the frequency domain is presented for evaluating the engine structural response function; the engine is considered as a black box in which the input is the in-cylinder pressure and the output is the noise radiation. Once the dynamic response of the engine is estimated, combustion development can be characterized via the engine noise radiation, thus allowing to get indication about possible strategies for noise emission improvement, that could be obtained through structural modification and/or combustion process control by injection strategy variation...|$|R
5000|$|A vital {{component}} of all diesel engines is a mechanical or electronic governor which regulates the idling speed and maximum {{speed of the}} engine by controlling the rate of fuel delivery. Unlike Otto-cycle engines, incoming air is not throttled and a diesel engine without a governor cannot have a stable idling speed and can easily overspeed, resulting in its destruction. Mechanically governed fuel injection systems are driven by the engine's gear train. [...] These systems {{use a combination of}} springs and weights to control fuel delivery relative to both load and speed. [...] Modern electronically controlled diesel engines control fuel delivery by use of an electronic control module (ECM) or electronic control unit (ECU). The ECM/ECU receives an engine speed signal, as well as other operating parameters such as intake manifold pressure and fuel temperature, from a sensor and controls the amount of fuel and start of injection timing through actuators to maximise power and efficiency and minimise emissions. Controlling the timing of the start of injection of fuel into the cylinder is a key to minimizing emissions, and maximizing fuel economy (efficiency), of the engine. The timing is measured in degrees of crank angle of the piston before top dead centre. For example, if the ECM/ECU initiates fuel <b>injection</b> when the <b>piston</b> is 10° before TDC, the start of injection, or timing, is said to be 10° BTDC. Optimal timing will depend on the engine design as well as its speed and load, and is usually 4° BTDC in 1,350-6,000 HP, net, [...] "medium speed" [...] locomotive, marine and stationary diesel engines.|$|R
40|$|Gas vapor {{injection}} on refrigerant {{cycle is}} always used with Scroll, Rotary or others compressors technology to improve {{efficiency of the}} system at low and high ambient temperatures. Probably this kind of compressor is more adapted than the piston technology owing to their mechanical system. In this paper, we present the challenge of vapor <b>injection</b> realized on <b>piston</b> technology compressor range non for improving the cooling capacity of the system but to maintain the compressor temperature in conformity without damage the capacity. Indeed, the principal action of gas injection is to refresh the mechanical system according to the ambient temperature for improving {{the capacity of the}} system. In this case of study, the compressor is enclosure on a room without opening at the ambient, thus the temperature of the compressor exceed 130 °C, which is the limit temperature of compressor functioning. To reduce the compressor temperature on this refrigerant cycle a gas injection is done from output of condenser to the input of the compressor thanks to the capillary tubes. Therefore, the quantity of gas injection must be sufficient to reduce the temperature, and not damage the capacity of the system. In addition, the piston technology compressor is more sensitive than the others compressors technologies because the compressor valve behavior could be damaged by the liquid phase of the refrigerant. That why the capillary tubes and the density of gas are defined by simulation and the results have been comforted by test. Thus, thanks to gas injection, we can reduce the temperature of the compressor on the refrigerant system with only a capillary tube...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} combat dry {{lubrication}} {{occurred in the}} combustion chamber of a compressed natural gas direct <b>injection</b> engine, the <b>piston</b> or piston rings have to be equipped with measures to address this boundary lubrication issue. Hence, {{the aim of the}} study is to address the issue which can minimize sliding friction in the combustion chamber between the piston ring and the cylinder liner. To solve this problem, the wear resistance level toward friction for piston ring during its interaction with the cylinder liner was enhanced using diffusion coating technique. The piston ring is made of ASSAB DF- 3 steel and several substances such as 0. 9 % carbon (C), 0. 85 % chromium (Cr), 96. 6 % ferric (Fe), 1. 2 % manganese (Mn) and 0. 55 % titanium. The chemical substance which is used for the diffusion process are the mixture of three substances i. e., chromium, ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) and aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3). The piston ring together with the chromium mixtures were heated at different periods of time. In order to improve friction and wear, the piston ring which is coated with 99. 5 % chromium dust using a diffusion coating technique yields higher hardness compared to the original piston ring due to its resistance toward wear. The hardness depends on the time maintained during heating. Furthermore, it was also shown that the modified piston ring led to better reduction in coefficient of friction as well as less weight loss due to wear. These characteristics can result in better endurance during engine operation and prevent damage due to lubrication failure...|$|R
