40|$|One {{feature of}} medical {{treatment}} for the mentally handicapped in Japan is {{the high number of}} long-term inpatient hospital stays. One of the causes for these hospital stays is the lack of residential facilities willing to accept these patients after they leave the hospital. This research analyzes the findings of a questionnaire survey among real <b>estate</b> <b>agencies.</b> After analyzing the survey results, three important matters were clarified. These concerned allaying the misgivings of real <b>estate</b> <b>agencies</b> concerning handicapped patients and improving the willingness of real <b>estate</b> <b>agencies</b> to lease housing to such patients. Firstly, it is important to create an information center for real <b>estate</b> <b>agencies</b> to provide information related to mental illness and mental health services. Secondly, it is important to clarify the role of medical institutions as friendly consulting places for real <b>estate</b> <b>agencies</b> who are renting out residential facilities for the mentally handicapped. Thirdly, it is important to construct a residential support network which can take the initiative in solving problems for patients and real <b>estate</b> <b>agencies</b> related to medical institutions, public health centers, local government offices, and other agencies...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims to {{diagnosis}} the Strategic Management {{practices in}} real <b>estate</b> <b>agencies</b> {{in the city}} of Santa Maria – Brazil. For this, a questionnaire was developed by the authors with aid from Google Docs tool and was sent through an electronic mail to all real <b>estate</b> <b>agencies,</b> from which 25 agencies responded, representing about 56. 8 % of all agencies contacted.

Bowes now found a mentor in John Kaye, one of the club's committee members, who was to play in instrumental part in his eventual career with Yorkshire. Bowes had a successful season with Kirkstall in 1927 and began receiving offers from other league clubs to turn professional, some of the offers being more for one match than he earned in a week at the <b>estate</b> <b>agency.</b> However, Kaye and his colleagues were determined to keep him at Kirkstall until they could arrange for him to play professionally at county level.|$|E

40|$|The {{relevance}} of the research is due to intense changes {{in the real estate}} market in Ukraine and as result is determined by the fact, that Ukraine is in decline of development of real <b>estate</b> <b>agencies.</b> This situation occurs due to different problems. Firstly, rapid market decline is under the general economic crisis pressure and reducing of purchasing capacity. Another one is an ability to buy, sale or rent the property without any help of a real estate agent. In such conditions real <b>estate</b> <b>agencies</b> should do their best to change situation. One of the ways to solve the problem is using traditional and additional services, business jurisdictions in complex which allow increasing the competitiveness of real <b>estate</b> <b>agencies</b> in precarious conditions of Ukraine...|$|R

25|$|Fenton had {{previously}} been under suspicion in 1985 following a series of compromised IRA operations. The IRA's Internal Security Unit (ISU) began an investigation, but Fenton diverted suspicion away from himself by providing the names of two other informers, Gerard and Catherine Mahon who were husband and wife. The Mahons were interrogated by the ISU and confessed to informing, and were found shot dead in an alleyway in the Turf Lodge area on 8 September 1985. Fenton again came under suspicion in 1988 after four IRA members were arrested at {{a house in the}} Andersonstown area of Belfast which was being used as a mortar factory. Only a few people had knowledge of the location of the factory, and the ISU began a new investigation. As a result of the new investigation the ISU concluded there was a link between compromised IRA operations and homes provided by Fenton. Fenton's professional life was also investigated, and his sudden ability to start an <b>estate</b> <b>agency</b> business in the early 1980s could not be explained. Fenton's handlers in Special Branch stopped paying Fenton when the IRA stopped using properties provided by him, {{and by the end of}} 1988 Ideal Homes was facing closure. By then Fenton was working as a taxi driver to supplement his income, and in early 1989 Ideal Homes ceased trading when the offices were closed by Fenton's landlord due to unpaid rent.|$|E
