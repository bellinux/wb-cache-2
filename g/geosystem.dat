40|$|The {{automatic}} target {{recognition and}} fine tracking demonstrate {{the high level}} of an instrument's automation since the measurements are performed completely automated. The present work gives a comparison of measurements, measuring accuracy and adjustment results between two instruments, Leica <b>Geosystems</b> TC 2003 with manual tracking and instrument Leica <b>Geosystems</b> TCRP 1201 R 300 with automatic target tracking. The measurements with Leica <b>Geosystems</b> TC 2003 were carried out in three sets of angles whereas with Leica <b>Geosystems</b> TCRP 1201 R 300, they were carried out in 16 sets of angles. All analyses of monitoring and measuring accuracy on Leica <b>Geosystems</b> TCRP 1201 R 300 were carried out in sets. The first set was obtained by taking the first three sets of angles into account, the second set by taking account of the first four sets of angles, and so on. Based on the accuracy analysis of performed measurements it could be determined that in terms of accuracy the automatic target tracking is comparable to manual measurements. Finally, a comparison and an analysis of measuring results obtained by both instruments were carried out...|$|R

40|$|Because {{functions}} of the subsurface are hidden from view, its important role in society is often taken for granted. Underground use in cities and subsurface resource extraction rapidly increase. Ensuring sustainability of the subsurface role requires balancing between exploitation and conservation, recognizing the non-renewability of abiotic resources and the long time cycles in the subsurface. This paper introduces the concept of <b>geosystem</b> services as a framework to analyze the issue of sustainable use of the subsurface in a systemic and holistic manner. Four main elements make up the framework: geosystems, services, values, and governance. Complementarity between the concepts of <b>geosystem</b> and ecosystems services is highlighted by classifying <b>geosystem</b> services in provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services. <b>Geosystem</b> services are distinguished from ecosystem services by systematically reflecting on three cross-cutting themes (i. e. space, scale and time). Applying the concept of 'geosystem services' results in improved integration in areas where trade-offs occur between 'geosystem services' stemming from the subsurface and 'ecosystem services' at surface. The <b>geosystem</b> services concept helps framing a more sustainable process of urbanization, and contributes to a spatially explicit linkage of (mineral) resource production to consumption, environmental impacts on the ecosystem and (global) governance of resources and resource efficiencies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Geotextile {{containers}} and geotextile tubes (with geomattresses and geobags called <b>geosystems)</b> offer {{the possibilities to}} construct coastal structures and bank protection structures {{without the use of}} rock and rip-rap. In situations where rock is not available close by or not desired in a structure (for example because the structure is close to a surfing or swimming area or the construction is temporarily and has to be removed), this is a decisive advantage. This has led to quite a number of structures with <b>geosystems</b> all over the world, a number that presumably will grow in the near future. However, recently also a number of structures with <b>geosystems</b> were proposed, but were abandoned in the later design stages and a different construction method was used. There were various reasons to change the construction method, such as: speed of construction, costs of containers, uncertainty with the construction method, subsoil stability etc. The paper analyses various projects and produces some guidelines in which applications a <b>geosystems</b> structure can be a strong alternative and for which construction conditions it is a less likely alternative. It also shows what research is needed to expand the applicability of <b>geosystems</b> solutions in coastal structures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{representation}} {{of goods and services}} from the subsurface, as defined by the concept of <b>geosystem</b> services, in contemporary ecosystems literature. A framework is defined consistent with and complementary to the categorisation defined under CICES. Following the Campbell Collaboration protocol, a systematic literature review is conducted on {{the representation of}} subsurface-related goods and services in ecosystem services research. The review shows that, in the period between 2000 and 2016, for every publication on subsurface services 140 articles on ecosystem services have been published. The results further indicate that valuation and governance studies on <b>geosystem</b> services are scarce. This gap stems from the exclusion of a number of abiotic goods and services from the classification as well as a lack of attention from the current scientific community to this topic. Studies to date have been performed in a limited number of English-speaking countries by researchers with backgrounds in ecology, biology, earth sciences and mining engineering.
