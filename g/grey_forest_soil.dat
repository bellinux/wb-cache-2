40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{different}} agro-ecological conditions on morpho-productive properties of buckwheat cultivar Novosadska was investigated during 2011 - 2012 at three different localities. The types of soil {{on which the}} experiments were conducted were as follows: the eutric cambisol- in Valjevo, the chernozem-in Nova Pazova and the <b>grey</b> <b>forest</b> <b>soil</b> in Nova Varoš. Agro-ecological conditions affected the growth and productivity of the buckwheat crops at all three localities. The highest yields per unit area were obtained on the chernozem-type soil (1. 65 t ha- 1), while the average yields on the less fertile soils in the hilly and mountainous regions of Serbia were 1. 31 t ha- 1 on the <b>grey</b> <b>forest</b> <b>soil</b> and 0. 80 t ha- 1 on the eutric cambisol. The results showed that buckwheat can be successfully grown on different soil types, since the experiments on all locations were carried out without fertilization, i. e. using the natural fertility of the soil.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} birch stands {{of the forest}} steppes in Cis-Urals. It is {{pointed out that the}} latter are {{represented}} both by native and derivative stands formed in the place of native coniferous forest, for the most part pine stands. Birch stands, as a rule, have vegetative origin, low density (0. 3 – 0. 5) and deposit that does not exceed 130 m 3 /ha. As a silvicultural measure aimed at derivative birch stands’ productivity increasing, it is offered to create under the canopy preliminary forest crops of Scotch pine. The advantage of such crops is tending of plantations cutting and terms of technic mature wood growing. It has been determined that in investigated regions with low density birch stands on <b>grey</b> <b>forest</b> <b>soil</b> and chernozem, Scotch pine in preliminary forest crops develops surface roots which are branching in different directions from planting sites including {{in the direction of the}} brand stems. These roots are terminated among the interplacement mass of this mass of stiffened roots. In other words, on the first step of forest growing, preliminary crops do not experience considerable root competition as concerns birch stand. Based on the research data, high safe keeping of preliminary forest crops during the initial years after planting is proved. However, delay in birch stands harvesting can result in preliminary forest crops increment reduction and, in the long run, their destruction. Thus the mean height of the preliminary pine crops at the age of 11 – 12 years constitutes only 42 – 62 % as compared with pine crops of the same age that were formed on the cutover area if agrotechnical tending is systematically carried on in the latter. The positive role of birch stands in the initial 3 – 4 years after preliminary forest crops of Scotch pine forming has been proven experimentally. Then the birch woody canopy must be removed. Replacement of derivative birch stands for native pine stands by forming preliminary forest crops will make possible significantly increase stands’ productivity in forest-steppe of Cis-Urals, along with preserving stability of their protective environmental functions...|$|E

N 2 O fluxes from these <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> were highly variable and smaller (1. 6 ± 0. 33 µg N·m– 2 ·h– 1) than those from deciduous <b>forest</b> <b>soils.</b> N 2 O emission from the cut-over black spruce <b>forest</b> <b>soil</b> was 2. 7 times greater than that from the mature black spruce <b>forest</b> <b>soil.</b> Large C/N ratios (27 to 78) and slow soil N mineralization and nitrification rates in these <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> {{may have led to}} small N 2 O fluxes. CO 2 emissions from these <b>forest</b> <b>soils,</b> ranging from 0. 20 to 2. 7 g·m– 2 ·day– 1, were mainly controlled by soil temperature...|$|R

A comparative microbial population analysis showed that coniferous <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> contained lower numbers of bacteria, fusaria, facultative anaerobes, and putative nitrogen-fixing bacteria than nursery soils, while the populations of actinomycetes, extracellular chitinase producers, fluorescent pseudomonads, and phosphate solubilizers did not differ. Higher concentrations of NH 4 -N which in the gaseous ammonia form can deleteriously affect Fusarium, were found in <b>forest</b> <b>soils.</b> The effects of volatiles purged from <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> differed fro...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{respiration}} {{rates were}} measured along {{different parts of}} a slope in (a) an evergreen forest with common brown <b>forest</b> <b>soil</b> and (b) a deciduous <b>forest</b> with immature <b>soil.</b> The effects of soil temperature, soil moisture and soil properties were estimated individually, and the magnitudes of these effects in the deciduous and evergreen forests were compared. In the evergreen forest with common brown <b>forest</b> <b>soil,</b> soil properties had the greatest effect on soil respiration rates, followed by soil moisture and soil temperature. These results {{may be explained by}} the fact that different soil properties matured within different environments. It can be argued that the low soil respiration rates in the low parts of the slope in the evergreen <b>forest</b> resulted from <b>soil</b> properties and not from wet soil conditions. In the deciduous <b>forest,</b> <b>soil</b> respiration rates were more strongly affected by soil moisture and soil temperature than by soil properties. These effects were likely due to the immaturity of the <b>forest</b> <b>soil...</b>|$|R
40|$|Nitrification occurs {{slowly in}} many acid Scots pine <b>forest</b> <b>soils.</b> We {{examined}} if bacterial community structure and interactions {{between members of}} the bacterial community in these <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> prohibit growth of ammonia-oxidising microorganisms and their nitrifying activity. Native and gamma-irradiated Scots pine <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> known to have low net nitrification rates were augmented with fresh soils or soil slurries from nitrifying Scots pine <b>forest</b> <b>soil,</b> and vice versa. Augmentation of native non-nitrifying soils with nitrifying soils induced net nitrification, although no significant changes in bacterial community structure, as measured by 16 S rRNA gene-based {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE), were observed. In sterilised soils, the inoculum, i. e. native nitrifying soil or non-nitrifying soil, determined the occurrence of net nitrification and bacterial community structure, and not the origin of the sterilised soils. Our results demonstrate that low net nitrification rates in acid Scots pine <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> cannot be (solely) explained by unfavourable abiotic soil conditions, but that still uncaptured biotic factors contribute to suppression of nitrification. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract The {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) contamination of urban, agricultural and <b>forest</b> <b>soil</b> samples was investigated from samples obtained in the surroundings of Valasske Mezirici. Valasske Mezirici is a town located in the north-east mountainous part of the Czech Republic, where a coal tar refinery is situated. 16 PAHs listed in the US EPA were investigated. Organic oxidizable carbon was also observed in the <b>forest</b> <b>soils.</b> The PAH concentrations ranged from 0. 86 - 10. 84 (with one anomalous value of 35. 14) and 7. 66 - 79. 39 mg/kg dm in the urban/agricultural and <b>forest</b> <b>soils,</b> respectively. While the PAH levels in the urban/agricultural soils are within the range typically found in industrialized areas, the <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> showed elevated PAH concentrations compared to other <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> in Western and Northern Europe. The PAH concentrations and their molecular distribution ratios were studied as functions of the sample location and the meteorological history. The soils from localities at higher altitudes above sea level have the highest PAH concentrations, and the PAH concentrations decrease with increasing distance from the town. </p...|$|R
40|$|We studied soil {{nematode}} communities {{from the}} surface of granite flatrock outcrops in the eastern Piedmont region of the United States. The thin soils that develop here experience high light intensity and extreme fluctuations in temperature and moisture and host unique plant communities. We collected soils from outcrop microsites in Virginia (VA) and North Carolina (NC) in various stages of succession (Primitive, Minimal, and Mature) and compared soil properties and nematode communities to those of adjacent <b>forest</b> <b>soils.</b> Nematodes were present in most outcrop soils, with densities comparable to <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> (P > 0. 05). Nematode communities in Mature and Minimal soils had lower species richness than <b>forest</b> <b>soils</b> (P 0. 05). <b>Forest</b> <b>soils</b> had a higher PPI value (P 0. 05). Outcrop nematode communities failed to group together in a Bray-Curtis cluster analysis, indicating higher variability in community structure than the <b>Forest</b> <b>soils,</b> which did cluster together. A high proportion of the nematodes were extracted from outcrop soils in coiled form (33 - 89 %), indicating that they used anhydrobiosis to persist in this unique environment...|$|R
