40|$|Rates of pay in {{the hotel}} and {{catering}} industry are a contentious issue. The industry is traditionally labour intensive and labour costs form a significant proportion of the total running costs of an organisation. On the other hand, the industry has a reputation for low pay, and evidence suggests that pay in the industry consistently falls behind many other industries. Information about pay in the industry is however limited. Existing sources do not provide detailed data on the rates of pay for a range of employees {{in the hotel}} and catering industry. The aim of this research therefore, is to develop a comprehensive study of pay in the industry for particular <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff,</b> and also to examine the factors that influence pay in the industry. A survey was conducted throughout Great Britain into rates of pay in the hotel sector, the restaurant sector, the industrial catering sector and the contract catering sector. Rates were found to be generally higher in the industrial catering sector, while the hotel and restaurant sectors tended to have very similar rates of pay. The traditionally female occupations in the industry, such as the room maid and the housekeeper are shown to have some of the lowest rates of pay, and some average rates of pay were below the legal minimum laid down by the Wages Council, The examination of determinants of pay in the industry demonstrates that pay for the unskilled <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> is influenced by factors such as the regional and locational situation of the hotel restaurant or unit. As there are variations of demand for labour and alternative job opportunities in different regions and locations around Great Britain, the average rate of pay for unskilled workers fluctuates. The pay <b>of</b> the skilled <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> was affected to a greater extent by factors such as the size or the price level of a unit. These factors are mainly indicative of the style of the operation and perhaps the level of skill demanded...|$|R

40|$|There are too few {{registrar}} {{posts in}} {{obstetrics and gynaecology}} to allow every consultant to have his own consultant led team.

30|$|For karyotyping, staff time {{required}} to perform the test or <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> used was the area most likely to impact upon total costs. For instance, substituting a clinical scientist with an MTO reduced the total cost to £ 95, a difference of £ 22. Other costs had limited impact upon karyotyping total costs. For aCGH, varying array (slide) costs had the greatest impact upon total cost. Changing the array to £ 25 per patient, reduced total test cost to £ 342. By comparison, equipment and staff costs had limited impact.|$|R

40|$|Against a {{background}} of concerns about future hospital medical staffing {{and the safety of}} unsupervised operations at night, this study examines which gynaecological operations now undertaken at night may be safely postponed until the following day. In {{the first phase of the}} study, the operations taking place at night in four hospitals were identified. In the second phase a nominal group technique was used to seek the extent of agreement among professionals about the appropriateness of postponing surgery to the following day in certain circumstances. There were considerable variations between hospitals in the volume of work and the <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> involved. The panel concluded that most operations now performed at night should not be postponed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Internal {{quality control}} (IQC) {{has a long}} and {{well-established}} role in clinical biochemistry laboratories. However, despite the duration of use, and the publication of several articles detailing best practice, the implementation and use of IQC vary significantly between institutions. Consequently, the North Thames Audit and Quality Assurance Group undertook a region-wide audit of current IQC practice in 2006.

5000|$|The U.S. Air Force rank of {{sergeant}} (E-4) was {{phased out}} in the 1990s. Previously, senior airmen were promoted to sergeant and granted non-commissioned officer status after 12 months time in grade; this lateral promotion is no longer conferred and senior airmen compete directly for promotion to staff sergeant. The old rank of sergeant was {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "buck sergeant". The current senior airman rank insignia {{is the same as the}} former sergeant rank insignia; formerly (from 1976 - 1995) senior airman rank insignia had a subdued central star (light blue vice silver for sergeant and above), as did airman first class and airman.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I review {{aggregate}} spatial trends in employment in health care. This is a neglected {{area in the}} study of employment change. Although much attention has been given recently to the producer services sector, in numerical terms the health-care sector is a major employer and, locally, can provide a substantial proportion of jobs within individual labour markets. I first consider regional trends in health-care employment over time, and then disaggregate these, where possible, by <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff.</b> The contribution <b>of</b> health care to total employment is then examined for standard regions and also for travel-to-work-areas (TTWAs). Possible interpretations of these changes are then discussed. Four interrelated factors are implicated: the impact of the public expenditure policies of successive governments; the effect of policies designed to redistribute resources in the NHS; local decisions on the siting and closing of NHS hospitals; and the impact of private sector growth in health care. ...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the 1990 s {{mental health}} care has shifted from a {{hospital}} to a community-based service. Government policy indicates that staff require further education {{as a result of}} the shift to community care. However, none of the United Kingdom policy documents or mental health literature prescribes what education is required. Consequently this multidisciplinary study aimed to identify what skills, if any, were required by hospital-based staff to move to a community-based working environment. Study findings suggest advantages in perceiving skills as overlapping and interconnecting. Five common core skills and skill differences between professional groups are identified. It is argued that core skills are central and common to all groups and specialist skills are those that distinguish professional groups one from another and different <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> within professional groups. While problems of multidisciplinary education are considered, nevertheless a case is made for educating staff in core skills within a multidisciplinary environment which may be beneficial in achieving community care goals...|$|R

The aims {{of this study were}} to examine mental health clinicians' attitudes about the role of mental health consumer consultants in inpatient psychiatric units, and to ascertain if participants' age, type of inpatient unit, or <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> influenced their attitudes towards consultants. The Consumer Participation and Consultant Questionnaire was used, which was adapted from the Mental Health Consumer Participation Questionnaire. A convenience sample of 47 mental health professionals from two adult inpatient psychiatric units located in a large Australian public general hospital participated in the study. The findings, overall, showed that participants supported the inclusion of consumer consultants in psychiatric units in areas that indirectly impinged on their current roles. Age, level of nurses, and place of employment did not affect their beliefs, but type of occupation was influential. Nurses were less supportive of aspects of consumer consultants' roles that overlapped with the traditional roles of the nurse.

Methods A retrospective analysis of a sample, 10. 47 % (n= 150) selected from 1432 medication incident report summaries, generated at Birmingham Children's Hospital, a specialist tertiary referral paediatric centre, during 2014 and collated through the national Datix incident reporting system software was analysed and the associated staff time required to complete each step of the incident reporting process was costed. The staff costs for various <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> were averaged across the staff actually involved, using data calculated by the Personal Social Services Research Unit. Results The analysis showed that the incident reporting process involved 262 staff on 2942 occasions (19. 16 staff episodes per incident form completed) at a cost of £ 337. 16 per incident form completed.
