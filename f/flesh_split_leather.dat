5000|$|<b>Split</b> <b>leather</b> is leather {{created from}} the fibrous {{part of the}} hide left once the top-grain of the rawhide has been {{separated}} from the hide. During the splitting operation, the top-grain and drop split are separated. The drop split can be further split (thickness allowing) into a middle <b>split</b> and a <b>flesh</b> <b>split.</b> In very thick hides, the middle split can be separated into multiple layers until the thickness prevents further <b>splitting.</b> <b>Split</b> <b>leather</b> then has an artificial layer applied {{to the surface of}} the split and is embossed with a leather grain (bycast <b>leather).</b> <b>Splits</b> are also used to create suede. The strongest suedes are usually made from grain splits (that have the grain completely removed) or from the <b>flesh</b> <b>split</b> that has been shaved to the correct thickness. Suede is [...] "fuzzy" [...] on both sides. Manufacturers use a variety of techniques to make suede from full-grain. A reversed suede is a grained leather that has been designed into the leather article with the grain facing away from the visible surface. It is not considered a true suede.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of the mechanical properties of the adhesive on the stress distribution in the polyurethane film laminated leather layers was investigated. The finite elements method {{was used for the}} 3 -D model evaluation. Laminate models consisted of three layers: <b>split</b> <b>leather,</b> adhesive film and polyurethane film. The elastic modulus of adhesive layer was varied from 40 MPa up to 110 MPa. The models were loaded in two different ways, i. e. constant strain of 3 % and constant force of 100 N. The relationships of adhesive elastic modulus and principal stress in the layers of the laminate on the loading condition of constant strain or constant force were obtained. The results showed that the increase of adhesive elastic modulus increases stress only in the adhesive layer of laminate. In the case of loading by constant force it was obtained that the increase of adhesive elastic modulus increases stresses in its layer and insignificantly decreases stresses of <b>split</b> <b>leather</b> and microporous polyurethane layers. Layers orientation also influences the deformability and stress distribution of the laminate. The highest deformability was reached as each <b>split</b> <b>leather</b> or PU film were orientated {{in the direction of the}} lowest elastic modulus...|$|R
50|$|Bicast leather (also {{known as}} bi-cast leather, bycast leather, {{sometimes}} described as <b>split</b> <b>leather)</b> is a material {{made with a}} <b>split</b> <b>leather</b> backing covered {{with a layer of}} polyurethane that is applied to the surface and then embossed. Because it is only used for the backing, the leather portion of this material is generally not visible in finished goods made from bicast. Bicast was originally made for the apparel industry for glossy shoes, and more recently was adopted by the furniture industry. The resulting product has an artificially consistent texture that is easier to clean and maintain, {{as is the case with}} most plastic materials. When used for footwear, it cannot be considered equal to conventional leather as it lacks the strength, breatheability, and durability of the natural product.|$|R

40|$|<b>Leather</b> <b>split,</b> the {{byproduct}} of leather manufacture, possesses low utility value {{because it has}} loose weave of collagen fibers and weak mechanical strengths. Herein, a practical and convenient method for increasing strengths of <b>leather</b> <b>split</b> was developed by one-step in situ polymerization. The structures and properties of polyacrylate/leather split composites were systematically investigated. The results suggested the monomers with an α-methyl and a proper straight-chain ester group, such as nBMA, can effectively modify the <b>leather</b> <b>split.</b> For <b>leather</b> <b>split</b> with a thickness of 1. 6 [*]mm, the rational processes for preparation of polyacrylate/leather split composite are that monomer and split were stirred in a drum for 4 hours for full permeation and then the split was heated in anaerobic condition at 45 °C for 30 [*]min. The tensile strength, tear strength, and elongation at break of the optimized PnBMA/split composite were 18. 72 [*]MPa, 62. 73 [*]N/mm, and 46. 02 %, respectively. With these mechanical properties, the split after modification can be well used as leather for making shoes, bags, gloves, and clothing...|$|R

For processing, a lot of water and chemical are used, generates a lot of liquid waste, which are powerful pollution in water an in soil. There will also be animal residues from such operation as cleaning, <b>fleshing,</b> <b>splitting</b> and trimming. Each of these generates solid waste which must be disposed. It is a big problem for handling the solid waste because of their volume and highly odours when they decompose in their solid form.

40|$|Laminated leather, {{obtained}} by the bonding of the microporous polyurethane film to <b>split</b> <b>leather</b> surface, was used for investigation. Such hybrid leather is resistant to water penetration, but shows high breathable properties. The effect of different nature layers on mechanical properties and viscoelastic behaviour of laminated leather was examined. It was shown that leather backing mainly determines the strength of laminated leather, while polyurethane film – deformability. The combinative strengthening is characteristic for hybrid system due to the repairing of leather surface defects by adhesive layers and dissipation of kinetic energy, which releases during the elementary act of the failure. Generalized Maxwell model, possessing a regular spectrum of relaxation times, successfully describes stress relaxation behaviour of the leather in non-linear regions. The polyurethane film increases the stress relaxation rate in the laminated leather, because rearrangement at the interface of two layers arises. It was obtained that the viscoelastic nature of polyurethane film dominates on the long-term properties of laminated leather...|$|R

40|$|The tannery {{industry}} is renowned for the {{huge amount of}} toxic solid and liquid waste generated from the cleaning, <b>fleshing,</b> <b>splitting,</b> tanning, shaving and buffing of raw materials. Biomass briquettes are a proven way of generating energy from waste. This study investigates the development and characterization of biomass briquettes from tannery solid wastes (TSWs). TSWs, which comprise hair, flesh, chrome shavings and buffing dust, were collected from a tannery in Kano, Nigeria, to formulate and characterize six briquettes. Scanning electron microscopy and proximate analysis were carried out on the samples. The six briquettes, comprising varying ratios of hair, flesh, chrome shavings and buffing dust, were molded and characterized. Thermal efficiency, durability and compressive strength, among other properties, were determined for the six briquette formulations. The briquettes developed had calorific values between 18. 632 and 24. 101 MJ/kg. Durability of the briquettes ranged from 98. 12 % to 99. 77 %. The energy values were {{within the range of}} 17. 462 – 24. 101 MJ/kg, which was comparable to other fuel sources such as sub-bituminous coal (20. 000 – 24. 730 MJ/kg).

40|$|Given the {{carcinogenic}} {{character of}} formaldehyde, {{it should be}} reliably determined in any substrate. The EN ISO 17226 Standard is the Official Method to quantify formaldehyde in leather. However, sorne misunderstandings may arise from the practica! conditions given by the Standard for the extraction of formaldehyde. Two agitation methods (magnetic agitation and reciproca! linear agitation), which fulfill {{the conditions of the}} Standard, have been used for the extraction of formaldehyde in twenty two samples of wet-blue <b>split</b> <b>leather</b> treated with resins synthesized with formaldehyde and with/without the addition of vegetable compounds. The agitation method influences the formaldehyde content and differences between the agitation methods depend on the formaldehyde resins and vegetable compounds applied. Magnetic agitation leads to formaldehyde contents that are 26 % greater than those obtained when the reciproca! linear agitation method is used. Major brands specify allowable limits for formaldehyde content, which depend on the user (adult or babies) and whether the article is i n direct contact with t he skin. A high percentage of disagreement (33. 3 %) has been observed between the agitation methods in fulfilling the allowable limits. One-third of the formaldehyde content results that fulfilled the allowable limits with the reciproca! linear agitation method failed when the magnetic method was applied.
