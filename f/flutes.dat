5|$|Although civilizations in Central America {{attained}} {{a relatively high}} level of sophistication by the eleventh century AD, they lagged behind other civilizations {{in the development of}} musical instruments. For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as <b>flutes</b> and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody. In contrast, pre-Columbian South American civilizations in areas such as modern-day Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of <b>flutes,</b> idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to making a}} balalaika and a guitar whilst still at school, his dissatisfaction with the intonation of his <b>flute</b> led him to start altering {{the position of the}} tone holes of his <b>flute</b> when he was 18 years old. He invented the tuning patch, and then built his own <b>flute</b> at 20. He has been working to improve the scale of the <b>flute</b> ever since, and his continued work, in collaboration with other British flautists and makers, has helped to improve the intonation of the modern <b>flute.</b> There are many makers who have used the William Bennett scales : Altus <b>Flute,</b> Jupiter <b>Flute,</b> Jack Moore <b>Flute,</b> Almeida <b>Flute,</b> Tom Green <b>Flute,</b> Miguel Arista <b>Flute,</b> Juan Arista <b>Flute,</b> Emmanuel <b>Flute,</b> Emerson <b>Flute,</b> Yamaha (Student model) <b>Flute,</b> Jonathan Landell <b>Flute,</b> Tom Lacy <b>Flute,</b> Andrew Oxley <b>Flute,</b> Webb & Wessel <b>Flute</b> and recently Eloy <b>Flute,</b> Gemeinhart <b>Flute</b> and Burkart <b>Flute.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 31 October 1725. He repeated it again, probably in 1730, with minor {{changes in the}} scoring, doubling the oboes by <b>flutes</b> and assigning a flute as the obbligato instrument in the alto aria.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional <b>flutes</b> and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included <b>flutes</b> crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E
5|$|At the Leipzig {{performances}} of the cantata, the first verse of the chorale was probably sung by a soprano, instead of using an instrumental rendition of the chorale tune in the first aria. The cantata was transposed from C major to E-flat major at Leipzig, where the recorders may {{have been replaced by}} transverse <b>flutes.</b>|$|E

5|$|For Visitation of 1733, Bach revised his Magnificat, {{creating}} the version better known today. In that version, transposed to D major, the laudes interpolations were abandoned. Limited differences in instrumentation include replacing the recorders by <b>flutes</b> and including {{these in the}} tutti movements. Changes in musical texture were even smaller, mellowing the harmony {{near the end of}} the Omnes generationes movement being the most noticeable.|$|E

5|$|In July 1995, Slovenian {{archaeologist}} Ivan Turk {{discovered a}} bone carving {{in the northwest}} region of Slovenia. The carving, named the Divje Babe Flute, features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined {{could have been used}} to play four notes of a diatonic scale. Researchers estimate the flute's age at between 43,400 and 67,000 years, making it the oldest known musical instrument and the only musical instrument associated with the Neanderthal culture. However, some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute's status as a musical instrument. German archaeologists have found mammoth bone and swan bone <b>flutes</b> dating back to 30,000 to 37,000 years old in the Swabian Alps. The <b>flutes</b> were made in the Upper Paleolithic age, and are more commonly accepted as being the oldest known musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|Jing ping {{bands are}} made up of a boumboum (boom pipe), syak or gwaj (scraper-rattle), tambal or tanbou (tambourine) and accordion. The double bass and banjo are also {{sometimes}} used. Bamboo <b>flutes</b> led the jing ping ensembles before the 1940s, when accordions were introduced. The Dominican flute tradition declined as a result, despite their additional use in serenades, until being revived after the National Independence Competitions.|$|E
5|$|Music {{and dance}} were popular {{entertainments}} {{for those who}} could afford them. Early instruments included <b>flutes</b> and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, drums, and imported lutes and lyres from Asia. The sistrum was a rattle-like musical instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies.|$|E
