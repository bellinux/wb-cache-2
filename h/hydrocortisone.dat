5|$|Most {{pituitary}} hormones can {{be replaced}} indirectly by administering {{the products of the}} effector glands: <b>hydrocortisone</b> (cortisol) for adrenal insufficiency, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, testosterone for male hypogonadism, and estradiol for female hypogonadism (usually with a progestogen to inhibit unwanted effects on the uterus). Growth hormone is available in synthetic form, but needs to be administered parenterally (by injection). Antidiuretic hormone {{can be replaced}} by desmopressin (DDAVP) tablets or nose spray. Generally, the lowest dose of the replacement medication is used to restore wellbeing and correct the deranged results, as excessive doses would cause side-effects or complications. Those requiring <b>hydrocortisone</b> are usually instructed to increase their dose in physically stressful events such as injury, hospitalization and dental work as these are times when the normal supplementary dose may be inadequate, putting the patient at risk of adrenal crisis.|$|E
5|$|A {{complication}} seen in untreated Addison's {{disease and}} other types of primary adrenal insufficiency is the adrenal crisis, a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and symptoms such as vomiting and fever. An adrenal crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma. The management of adrenal crises includes the application of <b>hydrocortisone</b> injections.|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require <b>hydrocortisone</b> replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|After two years, Glidden {{abandoned}} {{production of}} cortisone {{to concentrate on}} Substance S. Julian developed a multistep process for conversion of pregnenolone, available in abundance from soybean oil sterols, to cortexolone. In 1952, Glidden, which had been producing progesterone and other steroids from soybean oil, shut down its own production and began importing them from Mexico through an arrangement with Diosynth (a small Mexican company founded in 1947 by Russell Marker after leaving Syntex). Glidden's cost of production of cortexolone was relatively high, so Upjohn decided to use progesterone, available in large quantity at low cost from Syntex, to produce cortisone and <b>hydrocortisone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Treatment for acute adrenal {{insufficiency}} requires the administration of intravenous saline or dextrose solution; volumes of over two liters may be required in an adult. This {{is followed by the}} administration of <b>hydrocortisone,</b> which is pharmaceutical grade cortisol, intravenously or into a muscle. The drug dexamethasone has similar properties, but its use is not recommended unless it is required to reduce swelling in the brain around the area of hemorrhage. Some are well enough not to require immediate cortisol replacement; in this case, blood levels of cortisol are determined at 9:00AM (as cortisol levels vary over the day). A level below 550nmol/l indicates a need for replacement.|$|E
25|$|If no response, {{a morning}} Mesalazine, or <b>hydrocortisone</b> enema (Cortenema) can be given.|$|E
25|$|To prevent this, {{all persons}} taking {{replacement}} glucocorticoids {{are taught to}} increase their doses {{in the event of}} illness, surgery, severe injury, or severe exhaustion. More importantly, they are taught that vomiting warrants an injection within hours of <b>hydrocortisone</b> (e.g., SoluCortef) or other glucocorticoid. This recommendation applies to both children and adults. Because young children are more susceptible to vomiting illnesses than adults, pediatric endocrinologists usually teach parents how to give <b>hydrocortisone</b> injections.|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone is a {{synthetic}} pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisol (<b>hydrocortisone)</b> {{and is also}} known as 1-dehydro-9α-fluoro-16α-methylhydrocortisone or as 9α-fluoro-11β,17α,21-trihydroxy-16α-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione.|$|E
25|$|Cortisol is a steroid hormone, in the {{glucocorticoid}} {{class of}} hormones. When {{used as a}} medication, it is known as <b>hydrocortisone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patients often {{respond to}} topical agents alone, such as Mesalazine, or <b>hydrocortisone</b> enemas. Again, the Mesalazine is {{preferred}} for maintenance therapy.|$|E
25|$|In the CORTICUS study, <b>hydrocortisone</b> hastened the {{reversal}} of septic shock, but did not influence mortality, with an increased occurrence of septic shock relapse and hypernatremia. The latter findings tempered enthusiasm for the broad use of <b>hydrocortisone</b> in septic shock. Prior to this study, several other smaller studies showed beneficial effects of long courses of low doses of corticoid. Several factors (such as lack of statistical power due to slow recruitment) could have led a false-negative finding on mortality in the CORTICUS study; thus, more research is needed.|$|E
25|$|Steroid enemas {{can also}} be used to treat {{symptoms}} in the lower colon and rectum. <b>Hydrocortisone</b> and budesonide liquid and foam enemas are marketed for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Several anti-itch {{medications}} are commercially available, {{including those}} taken orally, such as diphenhydramine, or topically applied antihistamines and, for more severe cases, corticosteroids, such as <b>hydrocortisone</b> and triamcinolone.|$|E
25|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is suppression of adrenal testosterone production by a glucocorticoid such as <b>hydrocortisone.</b> Mineralocorticoid is only added {{in cases where}} the plasma renin activity is high.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoid potency, {{duration}} of effect, and the overlapping mineralocorticoid potency vary. Cortisol {{is the standard}} of comparison for glucocorticoid potency. <b>Hydrocortisone</b> is the name used for pharmaceutical preparations of cortisol.|$|E
25|$|Salt-wasting {{in infancy}} {{responds}} to intravenous saline, dextrose, and high dose <b>hydrocortisone,</b> but prolonged fludrocortisone replacement {{is usually not}} necessary. The hypertension is ameliorated by glucocorticoid suppression of DOC.|$|E
25|$|Treatment differs {{according}} to what rash a patient has been diagnosed with. Common rashes can be easily remedied using steroid topical creams (such as <b>hydrocortisone)</b> or non-steroidal treatments. Many of the medications are available over the counter in the United States.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrocortisone,</b> fludrocortisone, and {{prednisone}} {{were available}} by the late 1950s. By 1980 all of the relevant steroids could be measured in blood by reference laboratories for patient care. By 1990 nearly all specific genes and enzymes had been identified.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} steroid topical creams i.e. hydrocortisone; is their {{inability}} to penetrate the skin through absorption and therefore not be effective in clearing up the affected area, thus rendering the <b>hydrocortisone</b> almost completely ineffective in all except the most mild of cases.|$|E
25|$|As ill {{as these}} infants can be, they respond rapidly to {{treatment}} with <b>hydrocortisone</b> and intravenous saline and dextrose quickly restores blood volume, blood pressure, and body sodium content, and reverses the hyperkalemia. With appropriate treatment, most infants {{are out of}} danger within 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{mineralocorticoid}} {{aspect of}} severe 3β-HSD CAH {{is similar to}} those of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Like other enzymes involved in early stages of both aldosterone and cortisol synthesis, the severe form of 3β-HSD deficiency can result in life-threatening salt-wasting in early infancy. Salt-wasting is managed acutely with saline and high-dose <b>hydrocortisone,</b> and long-term fludrocortisone.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{pediatric}} endocrinologists {{have tried}} to optimize growth by measuring a child every few months to assess current rate of growth, by checking the bone age every year or two, by periodically measuring 17OHP and testosterone levels as indicators of adrenal suppression, and by using <b>hydrocortisone</b> for glucocorticoid replacement rather than longer-acting prednisone or dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|Cortisol (or <b>hydrocortisone)</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} human glucocorticoid. It is essential for life, and it regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic, and homeostatic functions. Various synthetic glucocorticoids are available; these are widely utilized in general medical practice and numerous specialties either as replacement therapy in glucocorticoid deficiency or to suppress the immune system.|$|E
25|$|Cortisone has {{marginally}} reduced glucocorticoid activity {{compared to}} cortisol (80-90%), and thus, cortisone {{can be considered}} an active metabolite of cortisol. However, 11-beta-steroid dehydrogenase can catalyze the reverse reaction as well, and, thus, cortisone is also a precursor molecule of cortisol. Cortisone is activated through hydrogenation of the 11-keto-group, and cortisol is, thus, {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>hydrocortisone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Any {{glucocorticoid}} can {{be given}} in a dose that provides approximately the same glucocorticoid effects as normal cortisol production; this {{is referred to as}} physiologic, replacement, or maintenance dosing. This is approximately 6–12mg/m²/day of <b>hydrocortisone</b> (m² refers to body surface area (BSA), and is a measure of body size; an average man's BSA is 1.9 m²).|$|E
25|$|Addison’s {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that affects the}} adrenal cortex such that it is unable to efficiently secrete hormones. The immune system specifically targets {{the cells of the}} adrenal cortex and destroys them, but Addison’s disease can also be caused by a severe infection such as tuberculosis. Some symptoms include hypoglycemia and decreased blood sodium levels and increased blood potassium levels caused by a deficiency of aldosterone. These electrolyte imbalances induce nerve and muscle issues. Other symptoms include fatigue, salt cravings, weight loss, and increased skin pigmentation. Increased skin pigmentation is caused by a deficiency of the adrenocortical hormone <b>hydrocortisone.</b> Its normal behavior would be as negative feedback at the pituitary gland, stimulating the pituitary gland to decrease secretion of corticotropin. Because <b>hydrocortisone</b> is not able to be produced in Addison’s disease, the pituitary gland continues to secrete corticotropin which binds to the receptor for melanocyte-stimulating hormone. It then causes melanocytes to produce more pigment, thus darkening the skin tone.|$|E
25|$|Though police {{searched the}} {{houseboat}} where Cunanan died, he left no suicide note and few personal belongings, surprising investigators, given {{his reputation for}} acquiring money and expensive possessions from wealthy older men. Police considered few of the findings to be of note, except multiple tubes of <b>hydrocortisone</b> cream and a fairly extensive collection of the fiction of C. S. Lewis.|$|E
25|$|In {{adults with}} septic shock and {{refractory}} hypotension despite resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasopressors, <b>hydrocortisone</b> {{is the preferred}} corticosteroid. It can be divided in several doses or administered as a continuous infusion. Fludrocortisone is optional in CIRCI, and dexamethasone is not recommended. Little evidence is available to judge when and how corticosteroid therapy should be stopped; guidelines recommend tapering corticosteroids when vasopressors are no longer needed.|$|E
25|$|CIRCI can be {{suspected}} {{in patients}} with low blood pressure despite resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasopressor drugs. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines advocate intravenous <b>hydrocortisone</b> only in adults with septic shock and refractory hypotension. The exact definition of this condition, {{the best ways to}} test for corticoid insufficiency in critically ill patients, and the therapeutic use of (usually low doses) of corticosteroids remains a subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|Steroid-induced {{osteoporosis}} (SIOP) arises due {{to use of}} glucocorticoids– {{analogous to}} Cushing's syndrome and involving mainly the axial skeleton. The synthetic glucocorticoid prescription drug prednisone is a main candidate after prolonged intake. Some professional guidelines recommend prophylaxis in patients who take the equivalent of more than 30mg <b>hydrocortisone</b> (7.5mg of prednisolone), especially when this is in excess of three months. Alternate day use may not prevent this complication.|$|E
25|$|If {{symptoms}} are well controlled with moisturizers, steroids {{may only be}} required when flares occur. Corticosteroids are effective in controlling and suppressing symptoms in most cases. Once daily use is generally enough. For mild-moderate eczema a weak steroid may be used (e.g., <b>hydrocortisone),</b> while in more severe cases a higher-potency steroid (e.g., clobetasol propionate) may be used. In severe cases, oral or injectable corticosteroids may be used. While these usually bring about rapid improvements, they have greater side effects.|$|E
25|$|Severe or fulminant colitis. Patients need to {{be hospitalized}} {{immediately}} with subsequent bowel rest, nutrition, and IV steroids. Typical starting choices are <b>hydrocortisone</b> 100mg IV q8h, prednisolone 30mg IV q12h, or methylprednisolone 16–20mg IV q8h. The last two are preferred due to less sodium retention and potassium wasting. 24-hour continuous infusion is preferred than the stated dosing. If the patient has not had any corticosteroids within the last 30 days, IV ACTH 120 units/day as continuous infusion is superior than the IV steroids mentioned above. In either case, if symptoms persist after 2–3 days, Mesalazine or <b>hydrocortisone</b> enemas daily or bid can be given. The use of antibiotics in those with severe colitis is not clear. However, there are those patients who have sub-optimal response to corticosteroids and continue to run a low grade fever with bandemia. Typically they can be treated with IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. However, in those with fulminant colitis or megacolon, with high fever, leukocytosis with high bandemia, and peritoneal signs, broad spectrum antibiotics should be given (i.e., ceftazidime, cefepime, imipeneum, meropenem, etc.). Abdominal x-ray should also be ordered. If intestinal dilation is seen, patients should be decompressed with NG tube and or rectal tube.|$|E
25|$|Ondansetron may be beneficial, however, {{there are}} some {{concerns}} regarding an association with cleft palate, {{and there is little}} high-quality data. Metoclopramide is also used and relatively well tolerated. Evidence for the use of corticosteroids is weak; {{there is some evidence that}} corticosteroid use in pregnant women may slightly increase the risk of oral facial clefts in the infant and may suppress fetal adrenal activity. However, <b>hydrocortisone</b> and prednisolone are inactivated in the placenta and may be used in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum after 12 weeks.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids are {{provided}} to all {{children and adults}} with all but the mildest and latest-onset forms of CAH. The glucocorticoids provide a reliable substitute for cortisol, thereby reducing ACTH levels. Reducing ACTH also reduces the stimulus for continued hyperplasia and overproduction of androgens. In other words, glucocorticoid replacement is the primary method of reducing the excessive adrenal androgen production in both sexes. A number of glucocorticoids are available for therapeutic use. <b>Hydrocortisone</b> or liquid prednisolone is preferred in infancy and childhood, and prednisone or dexamethasone are often more convenient for adults.|$|E
25|$|If {{high doses}} were used more than 30 days, cut dose {{immediately}} to twice replacement, and reduce by 25% each week until replacement is reached. Then change to oral <b>hydrocortisone</b> or cortisone {{as a single}} morning dose, and gradually decrease by 2.5mg each week. When the morning dose is less than replacement, the return of normal basal adrenal function may be documented by checking 0800 cortisol levels prior to the morning dose; stop drugs when 0800 cortisol is 10 μg/dl. Predicting the time to full adrenal recovery after prolonged suppressive exogenous steroids is difficult; some people may take nearly a year.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in distributive shock are {{to reverse the}} underlying cause and achieve hemodynamic stabilization. Immediate treatment involves fluid resuscitation {{and the use of}} vasoactive drugs, both vasopressors and inotropes. <b>Hydrocortisone</b> is used for patients whose hypotension does not respond to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. Opening and keeping open the microcirculation is a consideration in the treatment of distributive shock, as a result limiting the use of vasopressors has been suggested. Control of inflammation, vascular function and coagulation to correct pathological differences in blood flow and microvascular shunting has been pointed to as a potentially important adjunct goal in the treatment of distributive shock.|$|E
