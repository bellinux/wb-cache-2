40|$|Purpose of the studyto {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} the mechanism of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) on the incidence of spontaneous atrial fibrillation (AF). The relation between SVT and AF is well-known but its frequency could depend on the mechanism of SVT. Methods 1559 patients, mean age 49 ± 19 years, with SVT and without anterograde conduction over an accessory pathway (AP) were referred for electrophysiological study (EPS), performed in control state and after isoproterenol. ResultsSVT was related to atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) in 1262 patients (group I), either typical (n= 1180) (group IA) or atypical (n= 183) (<b>group</b> <b>IB).</b> In 297 patients SVT was related to atrioventric-ular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT) due to a concealed AP (group II). At the initial evaluation 47 group I patients (4 %) (44 of group IA, 4 %, 3 of <b>group</b> <b>IB,</b> 2 %), 6 of group II (2 %) had presented at least one episode of sustained AF (NS). During follow-up (mean 3 ± 2 years), 97 patients developed AF, 86 of group I (7 %) (71 of group IA, 6 %, 15 of <b>group</b> <b>IB,</b> 8 %), 11 of group II (4 %). AF risk was higher in group I than in group II (p< 0. 045); differences remain significant for group IA/IB. When patients with AF at first study were excluded AF risk was similar in all groups: 5 % of group I) (4 % of group IA; 6. 5 % of <b>group</b> <b>IB)</b> (0. 06) and 3 % of group II. Ablation of slow pathway/AP was performed in 1099 patients, 67 % of group I (69 % of group IA, 51 % of <b>group</b> <b>IB),</b> 64 % of group II (NS). AF risk was paradoxically higher in patients in whom ablation was performed in group I (6. 7 % in group I, 7 % in group IA, 13 % in <b>group</b> <b>IB),</b> compared to patients without ablation (4 % in group I, 4 % in group IA, 3 % in <b>group</b> <b>IB)</b> (p< 0. 022) and was unchanged in group II (4 % after ablation and 3 % in patients without ablation). ConclusionsAF-related SVT was rare (3 %), independent on the mechanism of SVT. The risk of subsequent AF after a follow-up of 3 years increased to 6 % and was near 5 % in patients without AF at initial evaluation; it was only higher in patients with atypical AVNRT than in patients with AVRT.

Chronic lung disease was diagnosed by clinical criteria, chest radiographs and pulmonary function tests. All patients had postmortem examinations. Patients in group I were classified into two subgroups: group Ia (without right ventricular hypertrophy) and <b>group</b> <b>Ib</b> (with right ventricular hypertrophy). Right ventricular wall thickness was 3. 3 mm ± 0. 5 in group la, 6. 0 mm ± 1. 1 in <b>group</b> <b>Ib</b> and 8. 8 mm ± 2. 4 in group II (group Ia versus Ib, p < 0. 001; group la versus II, p < 0. 001; <b>group</b> <b>Ib</b> versus II, p < 0. 001). Eleven patients (78. 6 %) in <b>group</b> <b>Ib</b> (chronic lung disease with both right ventricular hypertrophy and inferior myocardial infarction) had right ventricular myocardial infarction compared with only 3 patients (21. 9 %) in group la (chronic lung disease without right ventricular hypertrophy and with inferior myocardial infarction) (p < 0. 008).

The mean Constant scores were 87. 1 % and 85. 6 % in <b>groups</b> <b>Ib</b> and Ic, respectively. In patients with a Constant score ≥ 90 %, the mean OV was 7. 7 % and the average DS was 1. 59  cm.

Methods: We retrospectively, reviewed computed tomgraphy findings and charts of 37 patients with acute PE and right ventricular dysfunction. We divided the enrolled patients into 3 groups; group Ia (n= 8), comprised of patients with major adverse event (MAE); <b>group</b> <b>Ib</b> (n= 5), consisted of those with PE-related MAE; and group II (n= 29), those without MAE.

Nineteen patients had a severe (80 to 99 %) proximal and isolated stenosis {{of the left}} anterior descending coronary artery and 10 patients had normal coronary arteries; all had normal ventricular function under rest conditions. Myocardial contractility was assessed by means of continuous two-dimensional echocardiographic monitoring; coronary reserve was evaluated by coronary sinus thermodilution. After dipyridamole infusion, 9 of the 19 patients with left anterior descending artery stenosis had transient myocardial asynergy involving the septum or apex, or both (Group IA), whereas 10 patients showed no asynergy (<b>Group</b> <b>IB).</b> No impairment of contractility was observed in the 10 patients with normal coronary arteries (Group II). Coronary blood flow was measured under basal conditions and up to 10 minutes {{after the end of}} dipyridamole infusion. In patients in Group II, dipyridamole induced an increase in great cardiac vein flow of 167 ± 68 % (mean ± SD). The 10 patients in <b>Group</b> <b>IB</b> showed a response comparable with that of the control group (Group II) (136 ± 45 % increase in great cardiac vein flow; NS versus Group II), whereas the 9 patients in Group IA had an increase of 46 ± 30 % (p < 0. 01 versus both <b>Group</b> <b>IB</b> and Group II).
