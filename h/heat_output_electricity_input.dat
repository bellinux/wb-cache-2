40|$|We present work on {{measurement}} of the energy performance of heat pumps for hotel operations in subtropical climates. Two city hotels in Hong Kong were investigated. The first case was an application of an air-to-water heat pump to provide heating for an outdoor swimming pool during the heating season. The second case was the installation of three water-to-water heat pumps to complement an existing boiler system for hot water supply. The <b>heating</b> energy <b>output</b> and corresponding <b>electricity</b> use were measured. The heat pump energy efficiency was evaluated {{in terms of the}} coefficient of performance (COP), defined as the <b>heating</b> energy <b>output</b> to the electrical energy use. The air-to-water heat pump provided 49. 1 MWh heating while consuming 24. 6 MWh electricity during the 612 -month heating season from mid-October to April. For the water-to-water heat pumps, the estimated annual <b>heating</b> <b>output</b> and the <b>electricity</b> use were 952 and 544 MWh, respectively. It was found that the heat pumps generally operated in a COP range of 1. 5 - 2. 4, and the payback period was about two years, which was considered financially attractive.

40|$|Many {{aspects of}} present energy {{systems and the}} {{direction}} towards future energy systems are incompatible with sustainable development. Sustainable bioenergy systems contribute to combating climate change and improving energy security. Expanding bioenergy decreases carbon dioxide emissions if replacing fossil fuels, establishing energy crops, or integrating with carbon capture and storage, and increases the resilience of energy systems because {{of the range of}} viable biomass inputs (agriculture residues, forest residues, energy crops, and organic waste), the different conversion technologies, and the options for energy <b>outputs</b> (<b>heat,</b> <b>electricity,</b> and fuels for transport). What is overlooked in many studies and assessments of bioenergy is that establishing sustainable bioenergy systems promotes regional development and results in multiple benefits across environmental, social, and economic spheres. Both industrialised countries and developing countries can exploit the potential of bioenergy. However, stimulating the development and diffusion of sustainable bioenergy systems requires supportive policies and measures to overcome constraints. This paper investigates the experiences of bioenergy in Sweden. Both the national perspective and local examples of bioenergy systems are presented in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|The {{dependence}} of {{net thermal efficiency}} on the electricity infrastructure tends to be an unnecessary complication for consumers and is not applicable to hydroelectric power, so performance of heat pumps is usually expressed as the ratio of <b>heating</b> <b>output</b> or <b>heat</b> removal to <b>electricity</b> <b>input.</b> Cooling performance is typically expressed in units of BTU/hr/watt as the energy efficiency ratio (EER), while heating performance is typically reduced to dimensionless units as the coefficient of performance (COP). The conversion factor is 3.41 BTU/hr/watt. Performance is influenced by all components of the installed system, including the soil conditions, the ground-coupled heat exchanger, the heat pump appliance, and the building distribution, but is largely determined by the [...] "lift" [...] between the input temperature and the output temperature.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a discrete operation optimization model for combined heat and powers (CHPs) in deregulated energy markets to maximize owners' profits, where energy price forecasting is included. First, a single input and multi-output (SIMO) model for typical CHPs is established, considering the varying ratio between <b>heat</b> and <b>electricity</b> <b>outputs</b> at different loading levels. Then, the energy prices are forecasted with a gray forecasting model and revised in real-time {{based on the}} actual prices by using the least squares method. At last, a discrete optimization model and corresponding dynamic programming algorithm are developed to design the optimal operation strategies for CHPs in real-time. Based on the forecasted prices, the potential operating strategy which may produce the maximum profits is pre-developed. Dynamic modification is then conducted to adjust the pre-developed operating strategy after the actual prices are known. The proposed method is implemented on a 1 MW CHP on a typical day. Results show the optimized profits comply well with those derived from real-time prices after considering dynamic modification process...|$|R

30|$|We {{provide an}} {{estimation}} of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> necessary to generate the neutrally buoyant plume above the TAG hydrothermal mound, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, located at 26 °N, using a model of plume rise in a density-stratified environment with crossflow. The estimated <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> is 460 ± 40 MW. Previous studies have estimated that the <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> from high-temperature hydrothermal discharge and low-temperature diffuse flow at the TAG hydrothermal mound are 90 ± 20 MW and at least 780 MW, respectively. Consequently, the contribution of diffuse flow to make the neutrally buoyant plume is 370 ± 60 MW, which accounts for approximately 80 % of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> to the neutrally buoyant plume. As this contribution is less than 50 % of the total <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> from the diffuse flow, {{it is likely that}} more than 50 % of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> from the diffuse flow dissipates in the ambient current.|$|R

40|$|Klebsiella aerogenes {{has been}} grown in carbon-limited chemostats and the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of {{different}} steady states measured by pumping the culture through an LKB flow microcalorimeter. Initially the flow time between fermentor and microcalorimeter cell was 5 minutes {{during which time}} the steady-state conditions of the chemostat were disturbed and the measured <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> was less than that in the fermentor. To minimise this problem a specially designed fermentor was fitted into the airbath of the microcalorimeter, thus providing temperature control and reducing the flow time between fermentor and microcalorimeter to 1 minute. This design was adequate providing only one dilution rate was used in each experiment. If different dilution rates {{were used in the}} same experiment the fermentor contents could not be maintained at 37 C and inaccurate <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> were recorded. It is believed that with modifications this design may be used to accurately determine the energy changes occuring in chemostat cultures. K. aerogenes has been grown in batch culture in media limited by carbon or nitrogen. Characteristic heat output-time records were obtained for each medium. As growth proceeded the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> increased steadily until oxygen became limiting whereupon the rate of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> decreased. During the stationary phase endogenous metabolism occurred in the carbon-limited media and slow degradation of excess carbon in the nitrogen-limited media both of which gave rise to relatively large <b>heat</b> <b>outputs.</b> The total <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of nitrogen-limited cultures was greater than that of carbon-limited cultures. When glycine replaced ammonium sulphate as nitrogen source the total <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> was increased.

40|$|In {{the present}} study two {{pozzolanic}} materials are used, Metakaolin (MK) and Fly Ash (PFA), as binary and ternary partial replacement binders with Portland cement (PC) to investigate their effect on {{the rate of heat}} evolution (dQ/dt in J/gh) during hydration, and the heat of hydration, (Q(t) in J/g). For binary PC–PFA blends PC hydration is enhanced in the very early stages of hydration, but at extended periods (up to 120 h) an increase in PFA replacement level causes a systematic reduction in <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> For binary PC–MK blends the results suggest that the MK initially diminishes PC hydration but the subsequent pozzolanic reaction of MK increasingly contributes to the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> causing some blends to exceed the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of the PC control. For both systems a principal controlling factor in the PC hydration rate (and the heat evolution rate) is the water requirement of the pozzolan, but for PC–MK blends the pozzolanic reaction of the MK makes a significant contribution to the <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> However this reaction is controlled both by the availability of water and the supply of Ca 2 + ions from the hydrating PC which introduces an increasing level of complexity to the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> versus time profiles.

The heat flow data from each of these drainage areas have been assessed making it possible to compare the <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> from two independent methods: direct heat measurements and the chloride flux method. For both the Waiotapu/Reporoa Valley drainage and the Waikite drainage a discrepancy exists between the two assessments, with the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> observed at the surface (Waiotapu- 540 {+-} 110 MW; Waikite- 80 MW) nearly double of that calculated from the chloride flux (300 MW; 36 MW respectively). It appears that much of the throughput of chloride does not reach the surface within the area which was monitored and the basic assumption on which the method is based has been violated. For Waimangu the direct <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> is assessed as 510 {+-} 60 MW. However the ratio of enthalpy to chloride concentration of the source fluid is not well determined. Depending on the ratio chosen the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> could lie between 360 and 800 MW.

40|$|Rational {{composting}} {{process control}} involves the interrelated factors of <b>heat</b> <b>output,</b> temperature, ventilation, and water removal. The heat is released microbially {{at the expense}} of organic material; temperature is an effect and, because it is a determinant of microbial activity, it is also a cause of heat output; ventilation supplies oxygen and removes heat, mainly through the vaporization of water; water removal results from heat removal. These relationships were implemented in a field-scale process of static-pile configuration, using a mixture of sewage sludge and wood chips. Heat removal was matched to <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> through a temperature feedback control system, thereby maintaining biologically favorable temperatures. The observations indicate that fundamentally {{there are two kinds of}} composting systems: those that are and those that are not temperature self-limiting. The self-limiting system reaches inhibitive temperatures (> 60 °C) which debilitate the microbial community, suppressing decomposition, <b>heat</b> <b>output,</b> and water removal. In contrast, non-self-limiting temperatures (< 60 °C) support a robust community, promoting decomposition, <b>heat</b> <b>output,</b> and water removal...|$|R

ATP-content, arginine ammonification, hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate, Fe(III) -reduction) were compared over a period of 7 to 8 weeks with respect to their sensitivity to indicate modifications of the soil microflora. An agricultural soil was amended with two pesticides and HgCl 2 (Ioxynil 2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg; Thiram 5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg; HgCl 2 2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg). The results show that all methods at least slightly differ from each other, indicating that each one reflects only a part of the microbial life in the soil. Due to limited nutrient supply {{the main part of the}} soil microflora is dormant, but can be activated by addition of an anergy source. While <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> after addition of glucose (potential <b>heat</b> <b>output)</b> determines the whole microflora in the active state, <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> without glucose (actual <b>heat</b> <b>output)</b> seems to indicate mainly the active micro organisms. The ATP-determinatiom seems to indicate as well as at least a part of the dormant microorganisms. The arginine ammonification proved to be very sentitive.
