5|$|On 23 March 1992 an F-16A {{lost power}} at 5,500meters {{altitude}} (18,000ft). The pilot survived after aiming the aircraft at an unpopulated area and <b>ejecting</b> {{at an altitude}} of 1,400meters (4,500ft).|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 2013, B-1B (AF Ser. No. 85-0091) out of Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota {{crashed in}} a remote area near Broadus, Montana. All four crew members survived by <b>ejecting</b> before the {{aircraft}} crashed. A report found that the crash was due to a mechanical failure leading to a fuel leak and explosions.|$|E
5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, the Sun {{will begin to}} {{collapse}} again, evolving into a compact white dwarf star after <b>ejecting</b> its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E

50|$|The left <b>eject</b> is lit for 25,000 at {{start of}} game. Hitting this <b>eject</b> scores and {{advances}} the <b>eject</b> hole value (10,000, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, and 150,000 plus ball lock). Upon locking a ball, right <b>eject</b> lights for lock. Hitting right <b>eject</b> when lit for lock starts multiball. During multiball, completing HARLEY and DAVIDSON scores 5 million, and lights the orbit shots for 1 million each {{for the rest}} of multiball. The jackpot is not related to multiball. After the first multiball, the <b>eject</b> hole resets to 10,000 (no lights).|$|R

5|$|Between 56,000 and 32,000 {{years ago}} {{explosive}} volcanic activity occurred at Ciomadul. Both the exact dates {{of the various}} eruptions and {{of the formation of}} the St. Ana and Mohos craters are unclear, partly because dates obtained by potassium-argon dating and other dating techniques deviate from each other. Some eruptions may have reached sub-Plinian strength, <b>ejecting</b> volcanic ash as far as the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|Catalysis is {{performed}} in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen {{to accept an}} electron, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, <b>ejecting</b> {{the first half of}} the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{it may not}} be {{a logical}} deduction, but to my {{imagination}} it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo <b>ejecting</b> its foster-brothers, —ants making slaves, —the larvæ of ichneumonidæ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, —not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.|$|E

Jocelin {{supported}} Hubert de Burgh's work of <b>ejecting</b> French forces from England and regaining control of royal castles seized by Falkes de Breauté and other barons. In 1218, Jocelin was one of the itinerant justiciars for southwestern England.|$|E
5|$|Located around 4 degrees {{northeast}} of Alpha is T Pyxidis, a binary star system {{composed of a}} white dwarf with around 0.8 times the Sun's mass and a red dwarf that orbit each other every 1.8 hours. This system is located around 15,500 light-years away from Earth. A recurrent nova, it has brightened to the 7th magnitude in the years 1890, 1902, 1920, 1944, 1966 and 2011 from a baseline of around 14th magnitude. These outbursts {{are thought to be}} due to the white dwarf accreting material from its companion and <b>ejecting</b> periodically.|$|E
5|$|Over time {{intervals}} of around 30 trillion years, the Sun will undergo a close encounter with another star. As a consequence, {{the orbits of}} their planets can become disrupted, potentially <b>ejecting</b> them from the system entirely. If Earth is not destroyed by the expanding red giant Sun in 7.6 billion years and not ejected from its orbit by a stellar encounter, its ultimate fate will be that it collides with the black dwarf Sun due to the decay of its orbit via gravitational radiation, in 1020 (100 quintillion) years.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} theory {{centers on}} gas being <b>ejected</b> {{out of the}} galaxy and falling back in as the high-velocity gas we observe. Several proposed mechanisms exist to explain how material can be <b>ejected</b> from the Galactic disk, but the most prevalent explanation of the Galactic Fountain centers on compounding supernova explosions to <b>eject</b> large “bubbles” of material. Since gas is being <b>ejected</b> from the disk of the galaxy, the observed metallicity of the <b>ejected</b> gas should be {{similar to that of}} the disk. While this may be ruled out for the source of HVCs, these conclusions may point to the Galactic Fountain as the source of IVCs.|$|R

5|$|Some prey {{species are}} capable of {{fighting}} back against predators, whether with chemicals, through communal defence, or by <b>ejecting</b> noxious materials. Many animals can escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker. Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by sacrificing certain body parts: crabs can shed a claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough to permit the prey to escape.|$|E
5|$|The Ionian Revolt {{had begun}} with an {{unsuccessful}} expedition against Naxos, {{a joint venture}} between the Persian satrap Artaphernes and the Milesian tyrant Aristagoras. In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy. The other Ionian cities followed suit, <b>ejecting</b> their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies. Aristagoras then appealed to the states of mainland Greece for support, but only Athens and Eretria offered to send troops.|$|E
5|$|The fan-tailed cuckoo (Cacomantis flabelliformis) and pallid cuckoo (C.pallidus) {{have been}} {{recorded}} as brood parasites of the flame robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own. One fan-tailed cuckoo was recorded <b>ejecting</b> baby robins before being raised by its foster parents. Other nest predators recorded include the grey shrikethrush (Colluricincla harmonica), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), and eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis).|$|E

5|$|The {{second stage}} of {{catalysis}} is {{the resolution of the}} acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by <b>ejecting</b> the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.|$|E
5|$|As {{an active}} civil airfield, {{operations}} at Duxford are {{regulated by the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and {{came to rest on}} the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after <b>ejecting</b> at ground level. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} demonstrates close coevolution of {{host and}} parasite, {{for example in}} cuckoos. These birds do not make their own nests, but lay their eggs in nests of other species, <b>ejecting</b> or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong {{negative impact on the}} host's reproductive fitness. Their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts, implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition. Cuckoos are counter-adapted to host defences with features such as thickened eggshells, shorter incubation (so their young hatch first), and flat backs adapted to lift eggs out of the nest.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Identifying the {{progenitors}} of Type Ib and Type Ic supernovae requires knowing, {{among other}} things, whether SNe Ib <b>eject</b> hydrogen, and whether SNe Ic <b>eject</b> helium, {{and perhaps even}} hydrogen. Recently {{it has become clear}} that some SNe Ib do <b>eject</b> hydrogen, {{and it may be that}} all SNe Ib do. Two arguments that have been made in the past that SNe Ic <b>eject</b> helium are difficult to confirm, but I discuss other possible evidence that SNe Ic <b>eject</b> helium, as well as hydrogen. If so, these elements extend to lower ejection velocities than in SNe Ib. The spectroscopic differences between SNe Ib and SNe Ic may depend on the radial distributions of the helium and hydrogen as well as on the <b>ejected</b> masses of helium and hydrogen. We should consider the possibility that SNe Ic are more mixed up. 1...|$|R

5|$|On 24 July 1959, Vulcan B.1 XA891 crashed {{due to an}} {{electrical}} failure during an engine test. Shortly after take-off, the crew observed generator warning lights and loss of busbar voltage. The aircraft commander, Avro Chief Test Pilot Jimmy Harrison, climbed XA891 to , steering away from the airfield and populated areas while the AEO attempted to solve the problem. When {{it became clear that}} control would not be regained, Harrison instructed the rear compartment crew to exit the aircraft and the co-pilot to eject, before <b>ejecting</b> himself. All the crew survived, making them the first complete Vulcan crew to successfully escape. The aircraft crashed near Kingston upon Hull.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to all inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe rotates synchronously {{with its}} orbital motion, thus keeping one face always {{looking toward the}} planet. Its orientation is such that the long axis always points to Jupiter. At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter, the surface {{is thought to be}} {{near the edge of the}} Roche lobe, where Thebe's gravity is only slightly larger than the centrifugal force. As a result, the escape velocity in these two points is very small, thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts, and <b>ejecting</b> it into the Thebe gossamer ring.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are green, (red in Rush mode in the iOS mobile version) spiky {{circles that}} split cells larger than them into many pieces (16 or fewer, {{depending}} on the mass) and smaller cells can hide underneath a virus for protection against larger cells. Cells in 16 pieces can eat viruses without splitting, though it is usually dangerous moving in many pieces, as the cells are smaller and easier to eat.. Viruses are normally randomly generated, but players can make new viruses by feeding a virus, i.e. <b>ejecting</b> {{a small fraction of}} a player's cell's mass into the virus a few times, causing the virus to split and hence create another virus.|$|E
