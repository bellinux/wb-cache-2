She wrote, [...] "On {{of the reasons}} this ending has always been problematic <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> viewer {{is that it is}} a too-familiar script. Women are frequently told (or tell themselves) that they have [...] "misinterpreted" [...] sexual situations by missing cues ("leading men on") or by being [...] "unclear" [...] about their lack of consent. Furthermore, the episode leaves us bereft of a villain that can be nailed to the wall for forcible rape." [...] The writer went on to state that instead of placing the blame on a single person, [...] "A Trip to the Dentist" [...] blamed several people for Veronica's rape. Whitney also wrote that despite that the [...] "official resolution of the rape narrative denies a traditional 'whodunit' ending," [...] it makes a statement that she was raped by an [...] "unfeeling class of people." ...|$|E

500|$|Produced {{independently}} by Ecosse, Becoming Jane {{was given}} a limited budget of €12.7 million (£9 million or $16.5 million). Production designer Eve Stewart researched Regency literature and Austen's life, and along with Jarrold, scouted locations in Dublin and nearby counties for five weeks in January and February 2006. They ultimately opted to shoot in Dublin and the Irish counties of Meath and Wicklow instead of Hampshire, the birthplace of Austen, because it held [...] "a sense of countryside that felt more unchanged," [...] while Hampshire had unfortunately become too [...] "groomed and manicured". Jarrold also found [...] "a great variety of Georgian houses and older houses" [...] in Ireland. His production received funds from the Irish Film Board, the UK Film Council Premiere Fund, 2 Entertain, Scion Films, and Miramax Films. Film critic Andrew Sarris noted that in Ireland [...] "happily, there are still architectural traces of life more than 200 years ago to correspond with the year 1795." [...] However, Ireland did include a few disadvantages: Stewart found that [...] "the rural aspects were the most difficult as the Irish country landscape is nothing like Hampshire. There are no rolling hills so the vegetation and the landscaping was the trickiest thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> production designer." ...|$|E
500|$|The film draws {{inspiration}} from the high demand for Christmas toys such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which often led to intense searching and occasional violence amongst shoppers. Randy Kornfield wrote the film's original screenplay after witnessing his in-laws go to a Santa Monica toy store at dawn {{in order to get}} his son a Power Ranger. While admitting to missing the clamor for the Cabbage Patch Kids and Power Rangers, producer Chris Columbus experienced a similar situation in 1995 when he attempted to obtain a Buzz Lightyear action figure from the film Toy Story, released that year. As a result, he rewrote Kornfield's script, which was accepted by 20th Century Fox. Columbus was always [...] "attracted to {{the dark side of the}} happiest holiday of the year", so wrote elements of the film as a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. Brian Levant was hired to direct the film. Columbus said Levant [...] "underst the humor in the material" [...] and [...] "was very animated and excited, and he had a vision of what he wanted to do". Levant said [...] "The story that was important to me was between the father and son...it's a story about love, and a father's journey to deliver it in the form of a Turbo Man doll. The fact that I got to design a toy line and do the commercials and make pajamas and comic books was fun <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> filmmaker. But at its root, the movie's about something really sweet. It's about love and building a better family. I think that's consistent with everything I've done." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} factors other than purely the ability level of the bowler {{have an effect on}} a player's bowling average. Most {{significant}} among these are the different eras in which cricket has been played. The bowling average tables in Test and first-class cricket are headed by players who competed in the nineteenth century, a period when pitches were uncovered and some were so badly looked after that they had rocks on them. Other factors which provided an advantage to bowlers in that era was the lack of significant safety equipment; batting gloves and helmets were not worn, and batsmen had to be warier. Other variations are caused by frequent matches against stronger or weaker opposition, changes in the laws of cricket and the length of matches. The bowlers competing in the Howa Bowl, a competition played in South African during the apartheid-era, restricted to non-white players, during which time, according to Vincent Barnes: [...] "Most of the wickets we played on were underprepared. <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bowler, it was great." ...|$|E
