5000|$|The June 2013 {{release of}} the 5th {{generation}} models features a name change to AirPort Time Capsule, and a redesign with measurements 3.85 in square, and 6.6 in high. The square dimensions echo the size of both the latest AirPort Express and Apple TVs (2nd generation onwards), just with the height being significantly higher. The 2013 models feature the same [...] ports on the back as previous generations, and come in the same capacities as the 4th generation of 2 TB & 3 TB, but have introduced the newest Wi-Fi standard 802.11ac. The AirPort Extreme released {{at the same time}} is exactly the same in dimensions and I/O ports, just without the internal harddrive of the AirPort Time Capsule. 2013 models feature faster download speed, beam-forming improvements and wireless or desktop network control with iCloud integration. Airport is compatible with devices using the 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac specifications. Also improved, Airport Utility has added one click Time Capsule format from the utility's Airport Time Capsule, Edit, <b>Disks</b> <b>menu,</b> allowing easy and rapid Erase Disk and Archive Disk to start over or configure Network. Disk Erase includes up to 35 passes and device includes encrypted storage plus optional WAN sharing, making Airport extremely secure and flexible for home, class and office environments. Airport Utility is a free download.|$|R
5000|$|In {{previous}} {{versions of}} DOS XL, if you initialized a <b>disk</b> from the <b>menu,</b> the <b>disk</b> would not boot unless the file MENU.COM {{was on the}} disk. To alleviate this problem, type Q to quit the menu. Then type INIT or INITDBL from the command processor. Note: everything on the menu can be done manually from the command processor.|$|R
50|$|Atari DOS 2.0S {{consisted}} of two portions, a memory-resident portion that facilitated access to disk files by programs, and a disk-resident portion providing menu-driven utilities to format, copy, delete, rename, and otherwise manipulate files on Atari's 810 <b>disk</b> drive. The <b>menu</b> system was too large to keep memory-resident, but the necessity to reload the menu system after every program was frustrating to many users.|$|R
50|$|Reasonable Solutions is {{a company}} that, along with Software Labs and Public Brand Software played an {{important}} role in the early distribution of shareware. Reasonable Solutions sent out catalogs of disks with several DOS games on each. The disks were designed to require little or no computer skills to use. A batch file, GO.BAT, on each <b>disk</b> displayed a <b>menu</b> of games that could be run by hitting 1, 2, 3, etc., which would in turn launch other batch files (1.BAT, 2.BAT, 3.BAT, etc.) to run the games. In the early 1990s, the Internet became a prime competitor to Reasonable Solutions since it allowed shareware distribution without the cost and waiting time associated with ordering disks.|$|R
