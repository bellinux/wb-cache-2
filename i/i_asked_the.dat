According to the BBC News {{it is possible that the}} Emperor intended the creation of a quality national airline to help dispel impressions of Ethiopian poverty. In 1945, the Ethiopian government began negotiations with both Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express (later merged into TWA). On 8 September 1945, TWA signed an agreement with the American historian and foreign affairs advisor to Ethiopia John H. Spencer to establish a commercial aviation company in Ethiopia.|$|E

Claiborne arrived soon afterwards and expressed the concerns of Virginia that its territorial integrity was being threatened. He was joined in his protests by a group of London merchants who planned to build a sugar colony in the same area. Claiborne, still intent on his own project, received a royal trading commission through one of his London supporters in 1631, one which granted him the right to trade with the natives on all lands in the mid-Atlantic where there was not already a patent in effect.|$|E

However, he wished to find [...] "the big hit of the summer" [...] to add to the set. Yankovic recalled that he determined the saturation point of Iggy Azalea's [...] "Fancy" [...] by asking his daughter: [...] "I said, 'Are they talking about Iggy Azalea at school?' And she says, 'Well, not so much.' <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> same thing two weeks later and she said, 'Oh yeah, that's all they're talking about now!'" [...] Yankovic then traveled from Los Angeles to Denver, Colorado in early June 2014 to ask Azalea permission to parody her song. He noted that meeting a spoof target in person is not his usual method for obtaining permission, but was necessary in this instance to meet the album deadline. The encounter was described by TMZ as an [...] "ambush" [...] as Yankovic presented the potential parody lyrics to Azalea backstage at one of her concerts. He later clarified that the meeting was much more polite and blown out of proportion by TMZ. Yankovic recorded the Azalea parody [...] "Handy" [...] that same month, and announced that the album mastering process was complete on June 12.|$|E

I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body.

So <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{were not}} new to studio {{recording}} and Best's drumming had been found acceptable by Polydor in Hamburg, but Richards had alerted Martin to Best's unsuitability for British studio work. Martin wanted to substitute Best with an experienced studio session drummer for the recordings. This was common practice {{at the time in}} British recording studios. When Lennon, McCartney and Harrison learned that Martin and the engineers preferred replacing Best with a session drummer for their upcoming recording session on 4 September 1962, they considered using it as a pretext to permanently dismiss Best from the group. Eventually, after a very long delay, they asked Epstein to dismiss Best from the band. Epstein agonised over the decision. As he wrote in his autobiography, A Cellarful of Noise, he [...] "wasn't sure" [...] about Martin's assessment of Best's drumming and [...] "was not anxious to change the membership of the Beatles {{at a time when they}} were developing as personalities … <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Beatles to leave the group as it was". Epstein also asked Liverpool DJ Bob Wooler, who knew the Beatles intimately, for advice to which Wooler replied that it was not a good idea as Best was very popular with the fans. Ultimately, Epstein decided that [...] "If the group was to remain happy, Pete Best must go". Epstein summoned Best to his office and dismissed him on Thursday 16 August, ten weeks and one day after the first recording session. Epstein asked Best to continue to play with the band until Ringo joined on Saturday 18 August. Best played his last two gigs with the Beatles on 15 August at the Cavern Club, Liverpool. He was due to play his last show on 16 August at the Riverpark Ballroom, Chester, but never turned up; Johnny Hutchinson of the Big Three was rushed in as a substitute. Best had been with the group for two years and four days.|$|E

2500|$|While I {{was hearing}} the boys’ confessions {{on the evening}} of the 5th [...] I was {{suddenly}} terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind’s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire.

I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish.
