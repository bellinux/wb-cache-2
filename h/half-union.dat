5000|$|Various patterns, {{including}} the <b>Half-union,</b> the [...] "Sailor Head" [...] Twenty Cent Piece, several 1877 half dollars, Amazonian Quarter and Amazonian Three Dollar Coin.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} a pattern coin for {{proposed}} coinage is the <b>half-union,</b> a gold pattern coin with a face value of 50 U.S. dollars that was minted in 1877 and weighed 2.5 oz. The U.S. Mint deemed {{the idea of a}} 2.5-ounce gold coin infeasible, and only two were ever minted.|$|E
50|$|However, the <b>half-union</b> {{denomination}} did resurface in {{the form}} of a $50 commemorative coin released in 1915 to commemorate San Francisco, the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins. Some of the coins were octagonal, others round, making it the first and only time the United States Mint has ever released a coin that was not round.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Half-Union</b> (also {{known as}} J-1548) was a United States coin minted as a pattern, or a coin not {{approved}} for release, {{with a face}} value of fifty U.S. Dollars. It is often thought of {{as one of the}} most significant and well-known patterns in the history of the U.S. Mint. The basic design slightly modified the similar $20 [...] "Liberty Head" [...] Double Eagle, which was designed by James B. Longacre and minted from 1849 to 1907.|$|E
50|$|Famed {{designer}} George T. Morgan {{thought of}} an early possible design for a $100 full Union coin, should the <b>Half-Union</b> ever be a success. When the mint found {{the design of a}} 2.5 ounce solid gold coin completely infeasible, the idea of a complete Union was discarded altogether and was forgotten about, often only thought of as a possibility. However, around 2005, Morgan's original sketches were discovered and published so the Numismatic world could see what could have been. Private mints have since struck fantasy pieces of Morgan's design for collectors, in both silver and gold.|$|E
