40|$|<b>Depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> is a {{commonly}} used injectable contraceptive {{that has been}} associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition. This study compares effects of <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> on immune parameters from several upper reproductive tract compartments relevant to HIV- 1 susceptibility in repetitive samples from 15 <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> users and 27 women not on hormonal contraceptives. Compared with samples from unexposed women in the mid-luteal phase, <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> use was associated with: increased endocervical concentrations of MCP 1 and IFNalpha 2; decreased endocervical concentrations of IL 1 beta and IL 6; increased proportions of endometrial CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells expressing the activation marker HLADR; increased density of endometrial macrophages; and decreased density of endometrial regulatory T cells. Unlike previous reports with samples from the vagina, we did not observe increased expression of the HIV co-receptor CCR 5 on CD 4 + T cells in the endocervix or endometrium. Our results indicate important differences in anatomic compartments regarding mechanisms by which <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> could be associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition, including increased recruitment of macrophages to the endometrium, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the endocervix possibly leading to enhanced susceptibility to viral infection, and activation of endometrial T cells...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the effect of combined vitamin C and E on serum leptin, visceral fat mass, and visceral fat oxidative stress in rats treated by <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (DMPA). Method: Twenty-five female Wistar rats, were divided into the following groups (n =  5 rats each) : control (untreated) group (C); <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (DMPA) group; DMPA group received vitamin C (at dose 0. 2  mg/g; 0. 4  mg/g; 0. 8  mg/g) and vitamin E (0. 04  IU/g). The treatment with combined vitamin C and E was performed for four weeks. Analysis of leptin serum level was done by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technically. Visceral fat mass was measured by Ohauss scales. Analysis of malondialdehyde (MDA) level in visceral fat was done by spectrophotometer. Results: The level of serum leptin and visceral fat mass was not significantly different between groups (P >  0. 05). The lowest and highest dose of combined vitamin C and E in DMPA group significantly increased the visceral fat mass compared with control group (P <  0. 05).

Among women who were using condoms prior to receiving DMPA, nearly half said they never or rarely did so after initiating DMPA use; only 18 % of all women in the study used condoms consistently while relying on DMPA. Factors associated with consistent condom use were being black (odds ratio of 2. 0), being unmarried (odds ratio of 2. 2), having a history of STD infection (odds ratio of 1. 8), having previously used condoms (odds ratio of 2. 7) and having no interest in future childbearing (odds ratio of 1. 8).

This article describes the new checklists and their development. Several rounds of expert review produced checklists that were correct, comprehensible and consistent with the eligibility requirements. Nevertheless, field-testing of the checklists revealed that approximately half (48 %) of the respondents felt that one or more questions still needed greater comprehensibility.

40|$|Contraceptive progestogens have {{a series}} of effects on the {{endometrium}} that depend on the existence of oestrogen priming and therefore on the time of administration, the route through which the hormone is released to the body (systemic or locally in utero) and the available daily dose. The effects of a contraceptive progestogen can be divided into two main categories: changes in the endometrial structure and vascularization and alterations of the menstrual bleeding pattern. Whereas orally administered progestogens usually cause endometrial decidualization and an important stromal reaction, the i. m., or local, intrauterine delivery is more apt to cause atrophia. Finally, all progestogens, when given alone at contraceptive doses (and irrespective of their mechanism of action), cause some disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns.

Methods Data from successive Demographic and Health Surveys undertaken in nine African countries were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to explain changes {{in the proportion of}} short birth intervals in four countries with relatively high use of reversible contraception. Findings The overall odds ratio for the trend was 0. 90 (95 % CI 0. 84 to 0. 95) and this was unaffected by adjusting for the other variables. The odds of a short birth interval were reduced by exclusive breastfeeding (OR 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 58 to 0. 78) and increased by use of injectable contraception (OR 1. 23, 95 % CI 1. 11 to 1. 38).

Research priorities were chosen and epidemiological studies inaugurated, involving a total of 47 countries — mostly from the developing world. Important progress has been made, especially in helping to define the beneficial and possible adverse effects of oral contraceptives on the risk of neoplasia; in showing that the injectable contraceptive <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> protects against endometrial cancer and does not increase the overall risk of breast cancer; in clarifying which groups of women are susceptible to the rare cardiovascular complications of oral contraceptives (myocardial infarction, stroke, and venous thromboembolism); and in establishing the long-term effectiveness and safety of intrauterine devices. The research has already made a significant impact on family planning policies and practice. Critical appraisal of this venture, which has been modestly funded, confirms the value of mission-oriented research.

Low estrogen and certain progestins {{have been shown}} to impact endothelial function even in young healthy women. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate how DMPA affects endothelial function and serum biomarkers of cardiovascular risk before and after acute oral, vaginal, and transdermal estradiol treatments. Seven young women participated on 3 study days during a normal 12 -week DMPA cycle, during weeks 3, 6, and 9. An additional 8 young women participated on 6 separate days during a 12 -week DMPA cycle, 3 times on DMPA only and 3 times when using DMPA plus acute estradiol treatments. Wall tracking of high-resolution ultrasound images of the brachial artery were used during endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and nitroglycerin administration to test endothelial function. Serum samples were analyzed for cardiovascular indexes at each study visit. All of the estradiol treatments increased endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation compared with DMPA only (P 0. 001). Endothe-lium-dependent flow-mediated dilation was not different among DMPA-only treatment days. Endothelium-independent vasodilation and cholesterol levels were unchanged across DMPA-only and DMPA plus estradiol cycles.

40|$|The {{contraception}} {{of women}} with intellectual disability (ID) {{is a major concern}} for caregivers. However, the prevalence of contraception and the frequency of use of different methods (e. g. sterilization) remain generally unknown. Moreover, indications specific to women with ID are controversial. The present authors conducted a population-based study among 97 % of the women with ID aged between 18 and 46 years attending government-funded facilities in Brussels and the nearby province of Walloon Brabant in Belgium. Out of 397 subjects, 40. 8 % did not use any contraceptive method, 22. 2 % were sterilized, 18. 4 % used an oral contraceptive agent, 17. 6 % used <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> and 1 % used an intrauterine device. These figures differ widely from those of the general Belgian population. Binary logistic regression for `contraceptive utilization' showed the strong influence of institutional factors such as sleeping environment (i. e. institutional or parental), sexual relationship policy and contraception policy. Having or having had a boyfriend is also correlated with a stronger probability of contraceptive use. Other factors have a smaller influence (e. g. a milder level of ID). Very few factors, none of which are medical, are correlated with an increased use of a specific method. The present results are discussed {{in the light of the}} general medical application of contraception and the commonly assumed specific indications for women with ID...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to analyze the effects of green tea {{infusion}} on the toxicity of ovaries of female rats treated with the contraceptive <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (DMPA). Material and Methods: A total of twenty-four female rats were randomly divided into four groups, incuding the control group (no treatment), the DMPA-treated group and the group treated with DMPA and infusion of green tea at various doses (165 and 330 mg/gram of body weight per day). The number of granulosa cells, the number of ovarian follicles and the size of ovarian follicles were subjected to histopathological analysis. Results: The number of granulosa cells did not differ significantly among the study groups. The number of ovarian follicles was significantly higher in the DMPA-treated group than that of the control group. Of doses of 165 and 330 mg/g of body weight of green tea administration, only the low dose decreased the number of ovarian follicles significantly relative to the DMPA-treated group, although it has not yet reached the levels comparable to those of the control group. The size of ovarian follicles did not differ significantly among the study groups. Conclusion: DMPA led to an increased number of ovarian follicles, which was restored by infusion of low doses of green tea. Thus, green tea constitutes an herb that can be combined with administration of DMPA and useful in inhibiting the adverse effects of contraceptives.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundUse of {{contraception}} lowers a woman's risk of experiencing an ectopic pregnancy. In {{the case of}} method failure, however, progestin-only contraceptives {{may be more likely}} to result in ectopic pregnancies than some other methods such as combined hormonal and barrier contraceptives. ObjectiveTo describe ectopic pregnancy risk associated with use of implants and progestin-only injectable contraceptives through a systematic review of published studies. Data SourcesWe searched electronic databases for articles in any language published through May 2015 describing studies of progestin-only injectables and implants. We also searched bibliographies and review articles for additional studies. Study Selection and ExtractionStudies that reported any pregnancies were included in the review. Independent data extraction was performed by two authors based on predefined data fields, and where possible, we calculated the proportion of pregnancies that were ectopic and the ectopic pregnancy incidence rate per 1000 woman–years. ResultsFifty-three studies of implants and 28 studies of injectables were identified; 79 % reported pregnancy location. The proportion of ectopic pregnancy ranged from 0 to 100 % with an incidence of 0 – 2. 9 per 1000 woman–years in studies of marketed levonorgestrel implants. Studies of etonogestrel implants and the injectables, <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> and norethisterone enanthate, reported few ectopic pregnancies. ConclusionProgestin-only contraceptive implants and injectables protect against ectopic pregnancy by being highly effective in preventing pregnancy overall; however, the absolute risk of ectopic pregnancy varies by type of progestin. Risk of ectopic pregnancy should not be a deterrent for use or provision of these methods...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhether use {{of various}} types of {{hormonal}} contraception (HC) affect risk of HIV acquisition is a critical question for women's health. For this systematic review, we identified 22 studies published by January 15, 2014 which met inclusion criteria; we classified thirteen studies as having severe methodological limitations, and nine studies as “informative but with important limitations”. Overall, data do not support an association between use of oral contraceptives and increased risk of HIV acquisition. Uncertainty persists regarding whether an association exists between <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (DMPA) use and risk of HIV acquisition. Most studies suggested no significantly increased HIV risk with norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN) use, but when assessed in the same study, point estimates for NET-EN tended to be larger than for DMPA, though 95 % confidence intervals overlapped substantially. No data have suggested significantly increased risk of HIV acquisition with use of implants, though data were limited. No data {{are available on the}} relationship between use of contraceptive patches, rings, or hormonal intrauterine devices and risk of HIV acquisition. Women choosing progestin-only injectable contraceptives such as DMPA or NET-EN should be informed of the current uncertainty regarding whether use of these methods increases risk of HIV acquisition, and like all women at risk of HIV, should be empowered to access and use condoms and other HIV preventative measures. Programs, practitioners, and women urgently need guidance on how to maximize health with respect to avoiding both unintended pregnancy and HIV given inconclusive or limited data for certain HC methods...|$|E
40|$|Cross-sectional {{studies on}} the effects of <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (DMPA) on bone mineral density (BMD) have been controversial. The present {{longitudinal}} cohort study on 59 Chinese women over a period of 3 years has shown that their annual rate of bone loss at 3 sites (0. 44 % in lumbar spine, 0. 40 % in neck of femur, 1. 05 % in Ward's triangle) was substantially less than the projected values (1. 1 % in lumbar spine, 2. 3 % in neck of femur, 3. 5 % in Ward's triangle) in a cross-sectional study that had demonstrated a significant reduction in BMD in DMPA users than the non-user population. The trochanter BMD measurement did not show the projected annual bone loss of 2. 4 %. The rate of bone loss is probably non-linear, with a rapid loss in the first 5 years and a leveling off afterwards. The duration of DMPA use was not significantly correlated with the rate of bone loss. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that age and body mass index were significant variables in modeling the rate of bone loss in the lumbar spine and neck of femur, but not in the trochanter and Ward's triangle areas. The Z scores also suggested a retardation in bone loss with time and potentially due to the effect of progesterone in decreasing bone turnover that is similar to the situation in postmenopausal women. The present data provide another aspect of reassurance to the long-term use of DMPA. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|By 1981, 11 % {{of married}} women in Costa Rica ages 20 - 49 years had used <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (DMPA) and 58 % had used oral {{contraceptives}} (OCs). Since 1977, the Costa Rican Ministry of Health {{has maintained a}} nationwide cancer registry. These circumstances provided {{an opportunity for a}} population-based, case-control study of DMPA, OCs, and breast cancer in Costa Rica. Cases were 171 women ages 25 - 58 years with breast cancer diagnosed between 1982 and 1984; controls were 826 women randomly chosen during a nationwide household survey. Cases and controls were interviewed {{with the use of a}} standard questionnaire covering their reproductive and contraceptive histories. Logistic regression methods were used to adjust for confounding factors. While few cases or controls had ever used DMPA, DMPA users had an elevated relative risk (RR) estimate of breast cancer of 2. 6 (95 % confidence limits= 1. 4 - 4. 7) compared with never users. However, no dose-response relationship was found; even the group of women who had used DMPA for less than 1 year had an elevated RR estimate (RR = 2. 3; 95 % confidence limits= 1. 0 - 5. 1). In contrast, OC users had no elevation in RR compared with never users (RR= 1. 2; 95 % confidence limits= 0. 8 - 1. 8). The results of the DMPA analysis are inconclusive. Before decisions are made on whether to continue providing this effective contraceptive method, other ongoing studies will need to confirm of refute these findings.

40|$|Purpose: to {{determine}} weight variation {{in women with}} different Body Mass Index (BMI) in use of trimestral injections of <b>depot-medroxyprogesterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (DMPA), and compare it to women users of a non-hormonal method. METHODS: retrospective study with the chart review of 226 DMPA users and 603 controls, users of DIU TCu 380 A. Women were distributed in categories, according to their initial BMI, as having normal weight (< 25 kg/m 2, overweight (25 to 29, 9 kg/m 2) and being obese (≥ 30 kg/m 2, and were followed-up for six years, with yearly measurements of weight and BMI. The statistic test ANOVA {{was used to measure}} the weight variation among the groups in each BMI category every year. RESULTS: the average age {{at the onset of the}} method employed was higher in the study group than in the controls, in all the BMI categories: 31. 6 ±SD 7. 1 X 27. 4 ±SD 5. 5 in the normal weight category (p< 0. 0001); 37. 3 ±SD 6. 8 × 29. 2 ±SD 6. 0 in the overweight category (p< 0. 0001); and 35. 3 ±SD 6. 4 × 29. 7 ±SD 5. 8 among obese women (p< 0. 0001). DMPA users showed weight increase as compared to the controls in the overweight category (p= 0. 0082); and the weight increase along the observation period was also higher among the DMPA users than among the controls, for the normal weight (p< 0. 0001) and overweight (p= 0. 0008) categories. In the obese group, there was no BMI variation between the groups, nor along the period during which they were using the method. Conclusions: there was no change in weight gain among DMPA users from the obese category. Prospective studies should be done with metabolic tests to establish the determining factors of weight gain in normal and overweight women...|$|E
