The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for example, by the suggested acquisition of Crete in 1841, failed in their objective, and only succeeded in embroiling him in conflict with the Great Powers.|$|E

This did not specifically state that young people would remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required to continue their education full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E

At the time, at least 3 to 5in (76 to 127mm) of precipitation was expected, with locally accumulations of up to 8in (203mm). In response, the Government of Cape Verde issued a tropical storm warning for the southern portion of the archipelago, which included Maio, Sao Tiago, Fogo, and Brava. The tropical storm warning remained in effect after Julia intensified into a tropical storm; it was finally discontinued early on September 14.|$|E

As soon as Belushi left the set, O'Donoghue went over to him and gave the actor a congratulatory hug. On reflection, after the live performance, O'Donoghue stated that Belushi had performed a perfect parody of Shatner as Kirk. Belushi felt it was one of his most satisfying performances.|$|E

Early on May8, the watch was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning between {{the mouth of the}} South Santee River in South Carolina, and Surf City, North Carolina.

5|$|The {{action would}} prove {{controversial}} in the United States as several officers' reports suggested that Lieutenant Maley, commander of Experiment, had shown cowardice during the engagement. Lieutenant Porter stated that Maley {{had tried to}} insist on surrendering to the picaroons <b>immediately</b> <b>upon</b> their arrival. It was alleged that Maley thought the situation was hopeless due to {{the sheer number of}} pro-French Haitians who were attacking the convoy, and he had attempted to strike the colors.|$|E
5|$|Wainwright {{charged to}} the attack, but the {{submarine}} submerged almost <b>immediately.</b> <b>Upon</b> reaching {{the spot where}} the submarine had been, the warship located an oil slick and began dropping depth charges which failed to achieve positive results.

After she shepherded the oiler to safety, she returned to the area of her attack and patrolled throughout the night, but the submarine had apparently retired from the neighborhood.|$|E
