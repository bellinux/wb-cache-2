The unexpected lakes in desert attracted research interests on exploring the hydrological process under this particular landscape; however, a very few literatures exist on the diurnal and spatial variation of the <b>drying</b> <b>front</b> in this area, which is the main issue in the desert hydrological process to characterize the movement of water in soil. In {{order to understand the}} <b>drying</b> <b>front</b> in the Badain Jaran Desert, a field campaign was conducted by the observations of soil physical parameters and micrometeorological parameters. With the field data, the performance of a vadose zone soil water balance model, the HYDRUS, was verified and calibrated.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Parque Nacional Marino Las Baulas (PMLB) in Playa Grande, Costa Rica, looking at abiotic factors affecting the emergence success of leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) hatchlings. The proportion of leatherback turtle hatchlings that emerge decreases as sand temperatures and depth of the <b>dry</b> <b>front</b> above the nest increase throughout the nesting season. Ambient and sand temperature along with little to no rainfall impacted the depth of <b>dry</b> <b>front</b> in all seasons. The depth of the <b>dry</b> <b>front</b> in 2008 - 2009 and 2011 - 2012, and depth of <b>dry</b> <b>front</b> and temperature in 2012 - 2013 explained most of the variability in emergence rate for leatherbacks on this beach. ^ Depth of the <b>dry</b> <b>front</b> significantly affected the number of hatchlings that failed to emerge in all years and high temperature reduced emergence rate in 2008 - 2009 and 2012 - 2013, but was not significant in 2011 - 2012. Depth of the <b>dry</b> <b>front</b> and temperature significantly increased throughout the season. Likewise, emergence rate was significantly reduced, {{with the number of}} hatchlings (dead and live) that failed to emerge increasing. Additionally, the number of dead hatchlings found in the <b>dry</b> <b>front</b> significantly increased as the season progressed during the 2012 - 2013 season. By identifying factors that influence emergence rate we could potentially implement conservation strategies to improve environmental conditions within the nest to increase hatchling production and reproductive success. ^ These results led me to question what abiotic factors during development may be impacting hatchling survival and fitness. The second chapter of this thesis was designed to address this question by analysing the effect of temperature and substrate water content on green turtle (Chelonia mydas) eggs incubated in artificial laboratory conditions. The study investigated the water regulation of developing and non-developing green turtle eggs, measuring alterations of their total egg mass caused by the incubation conditions they were exposed to. The results indicated that non-developing eggs {{may play a role in}} modifying the hydric microenvironment of sea turtle nests. Incubation temperatures of 26 °C and 29 °C significantly impacted the emergence size of hatchlings produced and the duration of the incubation period of the eggs. Incubation temperature also had a significant effect on survival rate of hatchlings, with all fatalities occurring when hatchlings were still utilizing their yolk reserves. There was a significant increase in the instances of abnormalities of pigmented embryos and hatchlings with increasing temperatures, the greatest number of abnormalities being produced by the highest incubation temperature (32 °C). Substrate water content during incubation did not have an impact on the number of deformed embryos or hatchlings produced. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{emergence rate}} of leatherback turtle hatchlings from in situ clutches {{over the course}} of three nesting seasons (October-December) during 2008 - 9, 2011 - 12 and 2012 - 13 at Playa Grande, Parque Nacional Marino Las Baulas, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. We focused on hatchlings, which emerged from their eggshell yet failed to emerge from the nest during the two-day period between the first hatchlings emerging and the nest excavation being performed. We measured the distance from the head of the hatchling {{to the surface of the}} sand to determine whether measured variables had an impact on where in the sand column above the nest hatchlings were found at the time of excavation. These variables included: temperature in the week prior to emergence, depth of dry sand above the nest (<b>dry</b> <b>front),</b> hatching success of the individual clutch, number of eggs in the clutch, and total depth of nest. Emergence rate (hatchlings that emerge from a nest related to total number of eggs that hatched) of hatchlings significantly declines as the season progressed in all years of this study. The depth of the <b>dry</b> <b>front</b> significantly increased during the course of all three seasons, and the temperatures in the centre of each clutch also increased through the season; this indicates that the nest environment may become less suitable for emergence as the season advances. This conclusion was supported by results from 2008 - 9 and 2011 - 12 seasons where the depth of the <b>dry</b> <b>front</b> had the strongest correlation with emergence rate respectively, and in 2012 - 13 both <b>dry</b> <b>front</b> depth and temperature were significantly correlated to emergence rate. There was also a significant effect of weeks into the hatching season on the number of dead hatchlings found in the <b>dry</b> <b>front</b> which also supports this conclusion. Seasonal progression had an impact on the number of hatchlings found in the nests during excavations, and the proportion of these hatchlings that were still alive. The depth of the <b>dry</b> <b>front</b> was significantly correlated to number of hatchlings failing to emerge in all years investigated; this suggests that water content of the sand or sand consistency may be contributing factors to lowering leatherback hatchling emergence rate. By identifying factors responsible for reduced emergence rate we could potentially implement conservation strategies to alter environmental conditions within the nest, therefore increasing hatchling production.

Advisor: Lorraine Francis. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 79 pages. Latex coatings are used throughout industry to improve properties at a surface. Understanding film formation in latex coatings {{is important to}} control coating properties. Advances in emulsion polymerization have allowed complex latex coatings {{to be made by}} combining two or more immiscible polymers into a single latex particle. The polymers phase separate within the particle, which can then form unique coating microstructures. The goal of this project is to study the film formation of complex latex coatings, using cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) in conjunction with other tools. Block copolymer latexes were synthesized at Arkema Inc. and their film formation properties were studied using cryo-SEM and AFM. The coatings complete the three stages of film formation: consolidation, compaction and coalescence. The two immiscible polymers phase separate on a scale of a few nanometers in fully formed films. The film formation of polymer latex blends was also characterized. Here, microstructure formation was studied along side with stress development and cracking. Coatings of polymer blends were shown to hold a residual tensile stress after drying completed, although lateral <b>drying</b> <b>fronts</b> convoluted results. Cryo-SEM showed cracks to form with water still present between the particles, and deformation to occur after cracking and after most of the water had evaporated.

We used mesoscale (mm−dm) fluorescence imaging to measure mobilization of 1. 9 μm diameter carboxylate-latex microspheres during drainage in quartz sand. Experiments were performed at ionic strengths of 2 − 50 mM and drainage rates of 1. 0 − 0. 2 mL min− 1.

Peak mobile particle concentration at the <b>drying</b> <b>front</b> varied nonmonotonically, and the mobilization efficiency decreased with distance traveled by the <b>drying</b> <b>front,</b> at high ionic strengths. These findings constitute evidence for particle redeposition from the <b>drying</b> <b>front</b> as drainage progresses, which we propose is {{a key factor in}} the observed variations with ionic strength and drainage rate in the total number of particles removed during drainage.

40|$|Details {{are given}} of the {{refinement}} of a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model, {{based on a}} total variation diminishing finite volume method, for predicting rapid flood flows on initially dry beds. A Roe approximate Riemann solver, with the monotone upstream scheme for conservation laws (MUSCL) scheme and the procedure of predictor–corrector in time stepping, {{has been used in}} this model. The scheme is second-order accurate in both time and space and is free from spurious oscillations. The model deploys unstructured triangular grids. A wetting and drying approach, originally developed for a regular grid finite difference model, has been refined to suit the triangular grid finite volume model. The model was first verified against analytical solutions and experimental data of dam-break flows on initially dry beds, with favourable agreement being obtained between the model predictions and measurements. The model was then employed to simulate flood propagations in a large flood detention basin in China and in an urban region in the UK.

40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) {{was used to}} measure moisture profiles during non-isothermal drying of fired-clay brick. Drying was induced by a temperature gradient resulting from one-sided heating. A saturated fired-clay brick sample which was closed and isolated on all sides except for the front surface was heated with a halogen lamp of variable intensity. By measuring the moisture profiles in time it was possible to identify two distinct drying stages. In the first drying stage homogeneous drying is observed. When the critical moisture content is reached a <b>drying</b> <b>front</b> enters the sample. The characteristic time t 0 after which this <b>drying</b> <b>front</b> develops depends on the applied heat flux. The total amount of energy needed for evaporation of the moisture in the first drying stage is found to be independent of the heat flux from the lamp. As a result the total amount of moisture as a function of time can be scaled to one master curve using the time t 0. The data from these measurements provided an interesting view on drying processes, not only under isothermal conditions but also under influence of a thermal gradient.

The two regions are separated by a transition layer (or, <b>drying</b> <b>front).</b> In this paper, we consider the asymptotic analysis of a recent multiphase model in order to gain a better understanding of its salient features. The model consists of a PDE system governing the thermal, moisture, and gas pressure profiles throughout the interior of the bean.

From these asymptotic results, we have a better qualitative understanding of the <b>drying</b> <b>front</b> (which is hard to resolve precisely in numerical simulations), and hence, of the various mechanisms at play including heating, evaporation, and pressure changes.

Very stable emulsions, characterized by a high critical pressure, tend to develop steep pressure profiles, which favours front-dominated coalescence, while unstable emulsions with low critical pressures develop shallow pressure gradients, favouring nucleation-and-growth dominated coalescence.

Nonlinearities between surface water content and evaporative flux were quantified considering diffusion from discrete pores across air boundary layer. Globally, evaporation consumes about 25 % of solar energy input and is a key hydrologic driver with 60 % of terrestrial precipitation returning to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration. Quantifying evaporation is important for assessing changes in hydrologic reservoirs and surface energy balance and for many industrial and engineering applications. Evaporation dynamics from porous media reflect interactions between internal liquid and vapor transport, energy input for phase change, and mass transfer across air boundary layer. We reviewed recent advances on resolving interactions between soil intrinsic properties and evaporation dynamics with emphasis on the roles of capillarity and wettability affecting liquid phase continuity and capillary driving forces that sustain Stage I evaporation. We show that soil water characteristics contain information for predicting the <b>drying</b> <b>front</b> depth and mass loss at the end of Stage I and thus derive predictions for regional-scale evaporative water losses from soil textural maps. We discuss the formation of secondary <b>drying</b> <b>front</b> at the onset of Stage II evaporation and subsequent diffusion-controlled dynamics. An important aspect for remote sensing and modeling involves nonlinear interactions between wet evaporating surfaces and air boundary layer above (evaporation rate is not proportional to surface water content).

This combination makes WSDGM capable of performing a robust tracking of wet/dry fronts and, together with an unsplit centered discretization of the bed slope source term, of exactly maintaining the static condition on non-flat topographies (C-property). Moreover, a numerical procedure performing a correction of the numerical fluxes in the computational cells with water depth smaller than a fixed tolerance enables a drastic reduction of the mass error {{in the presence of}} wetting and <b>drying</b> <b>fronts.</b> The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme were assessed by comparing numerical results with the analytical and reference solutions of a set of test cases. Finally, to check the numerical model to field-scale applications, the results of two hypothetical dam-break events are reported...|$|R

50|$|The DD50 has {{continuously}} variable transmission, auto-choke, both a self-starter and kick starter, and auto-lubrication to simplify operation. Along with a speedometer, the front console has a fuel level gauge, and low oil (two-stroke oil) indicator. The fuel tank holds up to 6.1 L of fuel. The DD50 weighs 80 kg <b>dry.</b> The <b>front</b> brake is a hydraulic disc, while the rear is a drum. The under-seat luggage compartment {{is suitable for}} helmet storage.|$|R
