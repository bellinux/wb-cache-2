At least the latter two features are clear adaptations to aid these owls in capturing fish. Diurnal raptors who feed largely on fish have similar, if not identical, rough texture under their toes, which helps these birds grasp slippery fish. Unlike diurnal raptors who capture fish such as the osprey (Pandion haliaetus) as compared to most terrestrial raptors, the fish owls have large, powerful, and curved talons and a longitudinal sharp keel sitting under the middle claw with all having sharp cutting edges that are very much like those of eagle owls. Also, unlike fish-eating diurnal raptors will not submerge any part of their body while hunting, preferring only to put their feet into the water, although fish owls will hunt on foot, wading into the shallows. Unlike most owls, the feathers of fish owls are not soft to the touch and they lack the comb and hair-like fringes to the primaries, which allow other owls to fly silently in order to ambush their prey. Due to the lack of these feather-specializations, fish owl wing beats make sounds.

Tawny fish owls are around the same size as the brown fish owl in terms of linear dimensions. The tawny is 48 to 61 cm long from bill to tail. However, studies have revealed the tawny is surprisingly rather heavier on average than the brown fish owl and, less surprising, is considerably heavier than an eagle owl of comparable length. Six adult tawny fish owls were found to weigh an average of 2415 g, with a reported range of 2050 to 2650 g, and are thus one of the heaviest living owl species. Only the Blakiston's fish owl and a majority of races of Eurasian eagle owl (B. bubo) are heavier on average. The maximum (not average) weight of Verreaux's eagle owls (B. lacteus) and snowy owls (B. scandiacus) are also higher but those species have far larger sample sizes of body mass. In terms of standard measurements, the wing chord is 410 to 477 mm, the tail is 215 to 227 mm, the tarsus is 60 to 67 mm and the bill is 48 to 52 mm. Compared to the brown fish owl, the tawny averages of similar tail length, is larger in size by average wing length and bill size and slightly smaller in tarsal length.|$|E

As a result of these loads, strong eutrophication occurs in the Inner Bay, which is temporally anaerobic. The ecologically sensitive approach of the local authorities during the last decade has given rise to a wide variety of monitoring and research studies on this bay. On the other hand, the municipality of Izmir started to operate wastewater treatment facilities since January 2000. The Institute of Marine Sciences and Technology – Izmir (IMST) with its research vessel R/V K Piri Reis has been conducting an intensive monitoring program since 1988 and especially during the recent few years. These investigations provide an opportunity for the evaluation of the performance of the wastewater treatment plant in terms of the change in the optical properties of Izmir Bay water in a positive manner. The turbidity values measured in these monitoring studies indicate that the values have changed drastically after January 2000. Their spatial variation indicates that the values decrease from the Inner Bay towards the Aegean Sea. The turbidity (light transmission) values are measured with an automatic CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) system during each cruise.

40|$|A timely {{low-cost}} method {{providing information}} on {{water quality and}} trophic state to various users of reservoir or dam water is a must. Conventional methods involved tedious and expensive in situ and laboratory studies. Satellite-borne sensors have the capability of providing repetitive, low-cost, multispectra, timely and reliable information over areas. This paper shows {{the development of a}} new method for assessing the trophic state in inland water bodies such as dams. The method is based on matching the atmospheric corrected reflectance values obtained from Landsat- 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image data with the defined spectral signature ranges obtained from ground spectro-radiometric measurements in order to assess the trophic state conditions. The proposed method has been applied to Landsat TM and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) satellite images of the Kourris and Asprokremmos Dams in Cyprus, acquired during the winter, spring, summer and autumn period. The reflectance values for the images acquired on 3 June 1985, 11 September 1998, 11 May 2000 and 31 January 2001 for the Asprokremmos Dam were found to be 4. 5, 3. 5, 3. 7 and 11. 2 %, and those for the Kourris Dam were found to be 5, 3. 5, 3. 1 and 5. 2 %, respectively. Reflectance values between 3 and 7 % correspond to a eutrophic state and values > 7 % to a hypertrophic state. The results obtained from the proposed method were found to comply with those found using the trophic state index (TSI) approach. For example, the trophic state for the Landsat TM images of Asprokremmos Dam acquired on 11 May 2000 and 31 January 2001, was determined to be TSI= 68 and 79, respectively, using the available secchi <b>disc</b> <b>depths</b> (SDDs) and the Carlson TSI.

Data sets of nine parameters from 12 monitoring sites during 2010 – 2013 were obtained for analysis. Cluster analysis (CA) was applied to classify the 12 sampling sites into three groups (Groups A, B and C) and the 12 monitoring months into two clusters (April-July, and the remaining months). Discriminant analysis (DA) identified Secchi <b>disc</b> <b>depth,</b> dissolved oxygen, permanganate index and total phosphorus as the significant variables for distinguishing variations of different years, with 79. 9 % correct assignments. Dissolved oxygen, pH and chlorophyll-a were determined to discriminate between the two sampling periods classified by CA, with 87. 8 % correct assignments.

Methods: A retrospective radiological analysis was performed in 50 patients who had undergone single level total disc replacement surgery. Records were reviewed to obtain demographic data. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs were assessed to determine C 2 - 7 Cobb’s angle and segmental angle and to investigate postoperative kyphotic deformity.

40|$|The {{visual system}} relies {{on both the}} {{integration}} and interocular inhibitory processes to achieve single vision from different images in the two eyes. It is generally assumed that the integration process first searches for matching local features between the two eyes. If the matching fails, an interocular inhibitory process is triggered to suppress the image representation of one eye, leading to visual perception that is essentially contributed by the other eye. Here, using a stimulus comprising of binocularly corresponding features (vertical gratings) but incompatible surface border information, we found evidence to the contrary. In one half-image, a circular patch of vertical grating was phase-shifted relative to the surrounding vertical grating to create a circular, monocular boundary contour (MBC), while the other half-image had a similar vertical grating. The two half-images had a binocular disparity at the circular grating patch area, leading to the percept of a <b>disc</b> in <b>depth.</b> Concurrent with the stereo percept, threshold for detecting a Gabor probe on the half-image without the MBC was higher than that on the corresponding area with the grating disc, indicating binocular suppression. These findings reveal that when we perceive depth, which requires the integration process to obtain binocular disparity from the two eyes, one eye's image could simultaneously be suppressed from visual awareness by the interocular inhibitory process. Our study also presents a provocative example of where the brain selectively binds some, but not all, features of the images from the two eyes for visual perception...|$|R

We show that the combination of these effects can lead to disc mass underestimates by up to factors of 2 - 3 at millimeter wavelengths and up to an order of magnitude or larger at submillimeter wavelengths. The optically thin portions of protostellar discs are generally cooler in the Class I stage than the Class 0 stage since Class I discs are typically larger and more optically thick, and thus more shielded. The observed disc mass distribution closely resembles the intrinsic distribution if this effect is taken into account, especially at millimeter wavelengths where optical depth effects are minimized. Approximately 50 %- 70 % of protostellar discs observed to date with this method are consistent with the masses of the gravitationally unstable discs formed in the simulations, suggesting that at least some protostellar discs are likely sufficiently massive to fragment. We emphasize key future work needed to confirm these results, including assembling larger, less biased samples, and using molecular line observations to distinguish between rotationally supported, Keplerian discs and magnetically supported pseudodiscs.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 62, based on 24 reviews. Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani {{wrote that the}} album's [...] "strength" [...] is [...] "its individual songs ... a testament to Beyoncé as one of today's most reliable singles artists", but felt that [...] "the real disparity is her inability to reconcile the adult-contemporary schmaltz of I Am with the more modern, edgy sounds of Sasha Fierce." [...] Adam Mattera of The Observer felt that both <b>discs</b> lack <b>depth,</b> observing that the first is [...] "too busy chasing radio formats to expose any genuine soul", and criticizing the second disc's [...] "succession of independent woman anthems such as 'Single Ladies' and 'Diva', which will no doubt inspire drag queens the world over but leave most others bemused." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman called its double-disc [...] "gimmick" [...] "flimsy" [...] and favored its second disc's [...] "decent, if easily forgettable, upbeat pop."

40|$|A collisional {{avalanche}} is {{set off by}} {{the breakup}} of a large planetesimal, releasing small unbound grains that enter a debris disc located further away from the star, triggering there a collisional chain reaction that can potentially create detectable transient structures. We explore this mechanism, using {{for the first time}} a code coupling dynamical and collisional evolutions, and investigate if avalanches could explain the short-term luminosity variations observed in some extremely bright discs. We consider two set-ups: a cold disc case, with a dust release at 10 au and an outer disc extending from 50 to 120 au, and a warm disc case with the release at 1 au and a 5 - 12 au outer disc. We find that avalanches could leave detectable structures on resolved images, for both cold and warm disc cases, in <b>discs</b> with optical <b>depth</b> τ of a few 10 ^- 3, provided that large dust masses (≳ 10 ^ 20 - 5 × 10 ^ 22 g) are initially released.

40|$|Since 1974, bucket {{water samples}} have been {{collected}} at the NIOZ-Texel sampling jetty, located at the northern side of the Marsdiep tidal inlet between the North Sea and the Wadden Sea (53 ° 00 ′ 06 ″N, 4 ° 47 ′ 21 ″E). Sampling resolution has occurred {{at an average of}} approximately 40 times per annum. The first parameters measured were phytoplankton species densities, Secchi <b>disc</b> <b>depth,</b> suspended particulate matter, dissolved nutrients, chlorophyll a, and primary production. The NIOZ Jetty was chosen as sampling location for logistical reasons including ease of access (no boat necessary) and close vicinity to the NIOZ buildings. Sampling was, and continues to be, performed at high water (± 10 min) as predicted for Den Helder to keep variation in parameter values as the result of tidal currents as limited as possible. Hence it is Dutch coastal water, which enters the Wadden Sea that is sampled, the phytoplankton in which forms an important subsidy to the food available for suspension feeders. Data of phytoplankton series (e. g. SST, salinity, TSM, chlorophyll-a) are also used to calibrate and validate automated measurements as performed by physical oceanographers at NIOZ...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVOS: Avaliar a correlação entre os parâmetros do Topógrafo de Disco Óptico (TOPSS) e índices da perimetria computadorizada. MÉTODOS: Cento e doze pacientes com {{glaucoma}} primário de ângulo aberto e 88 indivíduos normais foram incluídos no estudo. Todos os indivíduos foram submetidos ao exame oftalmológico completo, perimetria computadorizada (Humphrey 24 - 2, Full Threshold), avaliando-se Mean Deviation (MD) e Correct Pattern Standard Deviation (CPSD) e exame com TOPSS (average disc diameter, total disc area, cup area, cup shape, cup volume, average cup depth, average <b>disc</b> <b>depth,</b> neuroretinal rim (NRR) volume, NRR area, cup/disc area ratio, horizontal cup/disc ratio e vertical cup/disc ratio). A comparação entre os grupos foi realizada utilizando-se o Teste U de Mann-Whitney ou o Teste T de Student Independente. A correlação entre cada parâmetro do TOPSS e os índices do campo visual foi verificada utilizando-se a correlação de Spearman. RESULTADOS: Os parâmetros do TOPSS que apresentaram as correlações mais significativas com os índices de campo visual foram: Cup Area (MD: r = - 0, 538, p PURPOSE: To {{evaluate the}} correlation between the parameters derived from the topographic scanning system (TOPSS) and visual field indices. METHODS: One-hundred and twelve primary open-angle glaucoma patients and 88 normal controls were enrolled in the study. All individuals underwent a thorough ophthalmic examination, including visual field (Humphrey 24 - 2, Full Threshold mode), evaluating Mean Deviation (MD) and correct pattern standard deviation (CPSD) and TOPSS (average disc diameter, total disc area, cup area, cup shape, cup volume, average cup depth, average <b>disc</b> <b>depth,</b> neuroretinal rim (NRR) volume, NRR area, cup/disc area ratio, horizontal cup/disc ratio e vertical cup/disc ratio). The comparison between groups was done using the Mann-Whitney Test or the independent Student's t test. The correlation between the visual field indices and TOPSS parameters was performed with the Spearman's correlation. RESULTS: The TOPSS parameters with better correlation were: cup area (MD: r= - 0. 538, p< 0. 001; CPSD: r= 0. 512, p< 0. 001), vertical C/D ratio (MD: r= - 0. 506, p< 0. 001; CPSD: r= 0. 483, p< 0. 001) e cup/disc area ratio (MD: r= - 0. 458, p< 0. 001; CPSD: r= 0. 453, p< 0. 001). However, there was considerable variability between groups with different levels of visual field loss. CONCLUSIONS: The TOPSS variables presented, in general, substantial correlation with visual field indices. Although some of these parameters showed highly significant correlations, considerable variability of the structural parameters for the same level of functional damage may limit the usefulness of TOPSS isolated parameters in the diagnosis of glaucoma...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} {{the possibility of using}} the limnological characteristics of non-perennial reservoirs in Sri Lanka for the future management of culture-based fisheries. Forty-five reservoirs were randomly selected to study their limnology, out of which 32 were stocked with fish fingerlings of Chinese and Indian carps, tilapia and freshwater prawn at stocking densities ranging from 218 – 4372 fingerlings ha− 1. Of these, 23 reservoirs were harvested {{at the end of the}} culture period (6 – 10 months). Thirteen limnological parameters were measured during the water retention period of each of the 45 reservoirs between November 2001 and January 2004. The mean values of the limnological parameters were used to ordinate the reservoirs through principal component analysis. Ordination showed a productivity gradient among reservoirs where Secchi <b>disc</b> <b>depth,</b> total phosphorus, chlorophyll-a, inorganic turbidity and organic turbidity were identified as key factors. The total fish yield of culture-based fisheries was positively correlated to the scores of the first principal component axis. This study reveals that it is possible to classify non-perennial reservoirs in Sri Lanka based on the above limnological parameters in order to develop culture-based fisheries and that they could be applicable in comparable water bodies elsewhere in the tropics. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The flux {{of neutral}} atoms of the {{interstellar}} medium (ISM) surrounding stars and their environment affects the motion of dust particles in debris discs, causing a significant dynamical evolution. Large values of eccentricity and inclination can be excited, and strong correlations settle in among the orbital angles. This dynamical behaviour, in particular for bound dust grains, can potentially cause significant asymmetries in dusty discs around solar-type stars, which might be detected by observations. However, the amount of orbital change {{as a result of}} this non-gravitational perturbation is strongly limited by the collisional lifetime of dust particles. We show that, for large values of the <b>disc's</b> optical <b>depth,</b> the influence of the ISM flow on the disc shape is almost negligible. This is because the grains are collisionally destroyed before they can accumulate enough orbital changes as a result of the ISM perturbations. However, for values smaller than 10 - 3, peculiar asymmetric patterns appear in the density profile of the disc when we consider grains of 1 - 10 μm grains, just above the blow-out threshold. The extent and relevance of these asymmetries grow for lower values of the optical depth. An additional sink mechanism, which might prevent the formation of large clumps and warping in the discs, is related to the fast inward migration as a result of the drag component of the forces. When a significant eccentricity is enlarged by the ISM perturbations, the drag forces (Poynting-Robertson drag and, in particular, ISM drag) drive the disc particles on fast migrating tracks, leading them into the star on a short time-scale. It is then expected that discs with small optical depth expand inside the parent body ring all the way towards the star, while discs with large optical depth would not significantly extend inside...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 In the U. S., the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is {{responsible}} for setting annual dose limits. For cases of hot particle contamination these limits are set at depths in skin of 7 mg/cm², 300 mg/cm², and 1000 mg/cm². However, at such shallow depths, the lack of charged particle equilibrium (CPE) precludes the use of traditional fluence-to-dose conversion methods. In this work, an enhanced photon dosimetry model is constructed based on simulations of photon point sources using MCNP 5 (Monte Carlo N Particle version 5) transport code. An empirical relationship between KERMA and absorbed dose was established, and used to develop a correction factor, f[subscript CPE], accounting {{for the lack of}} charged particle equilibrium (CPE) at shallow depths. This correction factor, in conjunction with traditional point-kernel fluence-to-dose conversion, provides a more accurate prediction of photon dose. The photon model is implemented such that empirical mathematical formulations, rather than look-up tables, drive the estimation of integrated dose over a disk up to 10 cm². In addition to fCPE, the creation of a secondary off-axis correction (s[subscript C]) was necessary in order to accurately calculate the integrated dose to a <b>disc</b> at shallow <b>depths.</b> When calculating the integrated dose to a disc of 10 cm² at a depth of 0. 007 cm for photon energies of 0. 662, 0. 835, and 1. 333 MeV the new model is within 2. 0...|$|R
40|$|The {{low mass}} X-ray binary (LMXB) {{associated}} with the M 31 globular cluster Bo 158 is known to exhibit inten-sity dips on a 2. 78 hr period. This is due to obscura-tion of the X-ray source on the orbital period by material on {{the outer edge of}} the accretion <b>disc.</b> However, the <b>depth</b> of dipping varied from 10 % to 83 % in three archival XMM-Newton observations of Bo 158. Previ-ous work suggested that the dip depth was anticorrelated with the X-ray luminosity. However, we present results from three new XMM-Newton observations that suggest that the evolution of dipping is instead due to precession of the accretion disc. Such precession is expected in neu-tron star LMXBs with mass ratios 0. 3 (i. e. with or-bital periods 4 hr), such as the Galactic dipping LMXB 4 U 1916 053. We simulated the accretion disc of Bo 158 using cutting-edge 3 D smoothed particle hydrody-namics (SPH), and using the observed parameters. Our results show disc variability on two time-scales. The disc precesses in a prograde direction on a period of 81 3 hr. Also, a radiatively-driven disc warp is present in the inner disc, which undergoes retrograde precesson on a 31 hr period. From the system geometry, we conclude that the dipping evolution is driven by the disc precession. Hence we predict that the dipping behaviour repeats on a 81 hr cycle...|$|R
