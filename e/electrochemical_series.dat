5|$|Silver is {{a rather}} unreactive metal. This is because its filled 4d shell is not very {{effective}} in shielding the electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus to the outermost 5s electron, and hence silver is {{near the bottom of}} the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>series</b> (E0(Ag+/Ag) = +0.799V). In group 11, silver has the lowest first ionization energy (showing the instability of the 5s orbital), but has higher second and third ionization energies than copper and gold (showing the stability of the 4d orbitals), so that the chemistry of silver is predominantly that of the +1 oxidation state, reflecting the increasingly limited range of oxidation states along the transition series as the d-orbitals fill and stabilize. Unlike copper, for which the larger hydration energy of Cu2+ as compared to Cu+ is the reason why the former is the more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking the stable filled d-subshell of the latter, silver is large enough that this factor has a much smaller effect, and furthermore the second ionisation energy of silver is greater than that for copper. Hence, Ag+ is the stable species in aqueous solution and solids, with Ag2+ being much less stable as it oxidizes water.|$|E
5|$|The coinage metals were {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p6s1; group 11: d10s1). However, the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties. This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals. Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia, as well as having more covalent character in their compounds. Finally, the alkali metals {{are at the top}} of the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>series,</b> whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom. The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character. Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au−) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its 5d106s1 configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d106s2 configuration of mercury.|$|E

Some work has also been done on titanium (IV) doped iron (III) oxide. Cyclic voltammetry shows that TTF and its derivative dibenzo TTF can be reversibly oxidized to its radical cation and dication in non-aqueous solution. The equilibrium potentials for two one-electron oxidation steps in acetonitrile/tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) were measured and found to be E(0,+.) = 0. 302 V and E(+.,++) = 0. 770 V for TTF and E(0,+.) = 0. 540 V and E(+.,++) = 0. 900 V for dibenzo TTF. Unlike cyanine dyes, oxonols are irreversibly oxidized and equilibrium potentials were measured by extrapolation of potential-sweep rate curves. Also using cyclic voltammetry, the rates of electron-transfer were calculated for TTF and dibenzo TTF {{as well as an}} <b>electrochemical</b> reduction <b>series</b> for some charge-transfer compounds relative to hydrogen reduction potential. The complex TTF/oxonol dye was prepared electrochemically at the optimum conditions. Its solubility and sensitivity towards pH changes were measured. Cyclic voltammetry shows that the complex is irreversibly oxidized and at lower voltages compared to its constituents TTF and oxonol dye. Electrical measurements show that the complex is a semiconductor and the energy gap is 0. 516 eV. First ionization potentials measured by photoelectron spectroscopy for TTF, dibenzo TTF and TTF-oxonol dye complex give approximately the same value which suggests that, the solution chemistry of these conpounds is different from their gaseous state behaviour. MNDOcalculations were used for geometry optimization, charge-density distribution, heats of formation and ionization potentials. Coupling constants and g-factors were calculated for TTF, its dibenzo derivative and its dye complexes using esr spectroscopy. Charge-transfer couplexes, particularly TTF/TCNQ show some degree of response towards polluting gases such as sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide as determined by their conductivity changes when the gases were passed over the surface. They may therefore be used as gas sensors if certain modifications in structure or electrode design could be made.

After the above study, the mathematic model was tested for {{the separation of the}} amino acids derivatives using monolithic reversed-phase columns. The results showed that the theory of dual-mode gradient involving combined gradients of the mobile phase composition with flow rate can be used successfully with high flow rates. Finally, we used the column temperature as an additional factor in the optimization of the chromatographic separation of the amino acid derivatives. This study allowed the selection of the best combination of the column temperature with the optimal profile of the simultaneous variation of the mobile-phase composition and the flow rate that was expected to give maximal resolution in the shorter run time for the solutes under consideration. The main conclusion of this PhD is that the combination of the two gradient elution mode, that is, the concentration of the organic modifier and the flow rate in different but constant temperatures, can contribute in the field of the optimization of the separations with HPLC. The algorithms developed in this PhD can help the chromatographers to use and optimize multi-mode gradient elution conditions in order to separate complex samples with the maximal resolution in as short time as possible. ...|$|R

During the research of the latter group, a direct through-space charge-transfer interaction between the p-type and n-type oligomers was uniquely revealed by a significant enhancement of the first hyperpolarizability values, which proved that hyper-Rayleigh scattering is a good tool to monitor the through-space transfer for this type of conjugated oligomer. Further extending the idea of higher dimensionalities and the theory of a free electron on a helix, led this work to the investigation of helicenes. Helicenes are seen as the best compromise between a long planar conjugation path and chiral out-of-plane molecules. However, by showing low values of the first hyperpolarizability and being hard to oxidize, the helicenes do not fulfill the expectations. As a consequence, the helicenes are abandoned as model compound for high second-order nonlinear optical responses. In a following step, more alternative geometries were explored, such as the (DA) n oligomeric system (D = 3, 4 -ethyleendioxythiophene, A = pyridine), which fulfills the noncentrosymmetry requirements in nonlinear optics in an alternative way. For every extra DA-unit, a higher value of the first hyperpolarizability is observed. Depolarization measurements of this series reveal that the compounds are forming a helical conformation, which is very interesting. After abandoning the helicenes, the helical conformation remains and is successful as a way of increasing the first hyperpolarizability. When dissolving the (a) chiral polyphenanthrene (Pa) in different solvents or solvent mixtures, different geometries can be obtained. The polymer adopts in a good or poor solvent respectively a disordered (random coil) conformation or a one-handed helical structure. The solvent conditions can be tuned and it is observed that the coil-helix transition is not a single-step process. The formation of achiral structure(s) with torsion angle precedes the helix conformation. For the coiled conformation, an unexpectedly high (higher than the apparent Kuzyk limit) value of the first hyperpolarizability is observed and thus helix formation nor intrinsic chirality are required. In a next part, more attention is paid to the free electron of the theory of Maki. In the same <b>series,</b> <b>electrochemical</b> switching is investigated together with protic and light switching. In this way, a three-way orthogonal switch for second-order nonlinear optics is for the first time investigated. The protic and light switch are based on the more traditional change in D-pi-A structures, while unfortunately the electrochemical switch was not effective enough to turn the first hyperpolarizability on and off. This shows that structures with a higher dimensionality are not necessarily more effective for switching than the one-dimensional D-pi-A structures being altered between noncentrosymmetry (D-pi-A) and centrosymmetry (A-pi-A or D-pi-D). By reaching, for polymer Pa in the best solvent conditions, a high beta-value that breaks the apparent Kuzyk limit, this work clearly demonstrates that the objective to go beyond the D-pi-A paradigm to obtain high second-order NLO responses is realized.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a {{methodology}} for the nanocharacterization of complex <b>electrochemical</b> systems. A <b>series</b> of powerful techniques have been adapted and applied to studies of two scientifically important electrochemical systems; namely polymer membrane solid-state ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) and electrochemically generated tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) charge-transfer materials. These studies have mainly encompassed the use of neutron reflectometry (NR), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), small angle neutron scattering (SANS), synchrotron radiation / Fourier transform-infrared microspectroscopy (SR / FT-IRM), synchrotron radiation / X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SR / XPS) and synchrotron radiation / grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (SR / GIXRD). Significantly, an NR technique has been specially developed to enable simultaneous EIS measurements through the development and refinement of a novel electrochemical / reflectometry cell. Furthermore, {{the development of a}} versatile electrochemical cell that is capable of allowing SR / GIXRD measurements to be made in practically any conceivable electrochemical problem has also been of great significance. The investigation of polymer membrane solid-state ISEs focused on the problem of water layer formation at the buried polymer interface after prolonged exposure to an analyte. Initially, a rigorous surface and materials characterization scheme was developed and applied to plasticized poly(vinylchloride) (PVC) coated wire electrodes (CWEs) that are known to be adversely affected by water layer formation. It was determined that water and the associated ions from the sample analyte were transported through the PVC membrane. This resulted in the formation of a water layer (approximately 120 Å thick) at the substrate / ion-selective membrane interface. The results of the study suggested that this event occurred after 3 to 20 hours of constant exposure to solution. Moreover, the water layer at the buried interface was found to contain traces of plasticizer, whilst nanodroplets of water were also found in the membrane. The former is evidence for the exudation of plasticizer from the PVC membrane into the water layer at the buried interface. Further investigations on a solid-state ISE utilizing a hydrophobic poly(methylmethacrylate) / poly(decylmethacrylate) (PMMA / PDMA) copolymer as the ion-selective membrane revealed that water was transported through the membrane at a far slower rate than that of plasticized PVC ISEs. In fact, a regular ISE of this type severely restricted water accumulation at the buried interface, with such an event occurring after 460 hours. In addition, water was restricted to accumulation as droplets at the buried interface, as opposed to continuous water layers. A negligible amount of water was found in the bulk of this hydrophobic polymer membrane. Given CWEs are susceptible to forming water at the buried interface, it is customary to employ solid-contact (SC) underlayers. The primary function of the SC is to provide an appropriate mechanism for ion-to-electron transduction. Certain SCs are also theorized to discourage the formation of water layers. The results of this thesis revealed that a hydrophobic poly(3 -octylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl) (POT) SC can prevent the formation of a water layer in SC ISEs altogether. This is not only achieved through the hydrophobic nature of POT, but also through the fact that the underlayer of POT is able to cover any imperfections at the buried interface, which water can use as a site for accumulation. By contrast, a hydrophilic polymer SC, known as poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) : poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), was found to scavenge available traces of water at the buried interface. Instead of forming a well defined water layer or even water-droplets at the buried interface, the PEDOT:PSS SC system was found to soak up all traces of water transported through the ion-selective membrane to the buried interface. Water was detected in the PEDOT:PSS vii underlayer in a miscible state and not as a separate phase as observed with the CWE systems. The mechanism for ion-to-electron transduction in electroactive polymer SCs was also investigated. The study was performed in order to address the extent to which charger-transfer events occur throughout the underlying polymer SC. By studying the electrochemical doping of POT with [3, 5 -bis(triflouro-methyl) phenyl]borate (TFPBˉ) ions it was shown that the ion-to-electron transduction process is surface confined. This outcome demonstrates that the performance of various SCs does not depend on the thickness of the polymer film. In fact, it is proposed that the sparing use of the SC material may possibly achieve better charge-transfer performance. Such a hypothesis is based on the reduced electron path through the SC, hence reducing the probability that electrons are hindered by impurities and film imperfections. The suggestion of surface confined charge-transfer events also supports previous notions that the effectiveness of SCs is based on the capacitive nature of the material. The final part of the thesis deals with the characterization of the structure and morphology of TCNQ-based charge-transfer materials. Due to the lack of prior research on the electrochemical syntheses and structures of these materials, Cd(TCNQ) 2 and Zn(TCNQ) 2 were studied. By using SR / GIXRD together with synchrotron powder diffraction, the electrochemically synthesized Cd(TCNQ) 2 was found to be crystallographically similar to the powder sample. Subtle differences between the two materials were evident; however, {{it was found that the}} major phase of non-hydrated Cd(TCNQ) 2 phase was present in both samples. Notably, this phase was found to have a tetragonal unit cell, with cell parameters: a = 16. 78 Å and c = 8. 83 Å. Finally, a potential-dependant voltammetric study was carried out on a Zn(TCNQ) 2 system. This was done in order to investigate the effects of electrodepositing Zn(TCNQ) 2 under different electrochemical conditions. It was found that the material electrocrystallized prior to, or at, the peak potential for reduction of TCNQ to TCNQˉ comprised two layers. The upper layer was shown to consist of a densely packed and highly amorphous layer of Zn(TCNQ) 2, while the lower layer was a crystalline phase of Zn(TCNQ) 2. The material deposited at a potential after the peak suggested that only the crystalline phase of Zn(TCNQ) 2 was present. This finding is significant for two reasons. First, in electrochemistry, it demonstrates that the in situ SR / GIXRD technique can be used to interrogate electrode reaction products under different voltammetric conditions. Next, it is important in the manufacture of electrocrystallized materials, where it demonstrates that complete control of the morphology and major phases is possible and that SR / GIXRD is a useful research tool to study the process...|$|R
