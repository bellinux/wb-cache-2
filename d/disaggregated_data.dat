40|$|Constructing the {{universal}} choice set in spatial choice models {{developed at the}} level of elemental alternatives (atomistic models) is challenging because <b>disaggregate</b> <b>data</b> on the attributes of nonchosen alternatives are often not available. Even when the <b>disaggregate</b> <b>data</b> on nonchosen alternatives are available, matching two data sources will inevitably be error prone given that they might be collected at different times and they might have different coding for categorical variables. An important practical question in the estimation of such atomistic models, therefore, is how to construct {{the universal}} choice set in the absence of <b>disaggregate</b> <b>data</b> on the attributes of the nonchosen alternatives. This paper presents a novel approach for spatial imputation of attributes of nonchosen alternatives for estimation and application of atomistic spatial choice models in the absence of <b>disaggregate</b> <b>data.</b> The proposed approach uses the iterative proportional fitting algorithm to impute the attributes of nonchosen alternatives from aggregated data on elemental alternatives.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of highly <b>disaggregate</b> <b>data</b> (e. g., at five-second intervals) {{raises the question}} of the optimal data interval to estimate advertising carryover. The literature assumes that (1) the optimal data interval is the interpurchase time, (2) too <b>disaggregate</b> <b>data</b> causes a disaggregation bias, and (3) recovery of true parameters requires assumption of the underlying advertising process. In contrast, we show that (1) the optimal data interval is what we call unit exposure time, (2) too <b>disaggregate</b> <b>data</b> does not cause any disaggregation bias, and (3) recovery of true parameters does not require assumption of the advertising process but only data at the unit exposure time. These results hold for any linear dynamicmodel linking sales with current and past advertising.

40|$|AbstractConfidentiality {{constraints}} often {{preclude the}} release of <b>disaggregate</b> <b>data</b> about individuals, which limits the types and accuracy {{of the results of}} geographical health analyses that could be done. Access to individually geocoded (<b>disaggregate)</b> <b>data</b> often involves lengthy and cumbersome procedures through review boards and committees for approval (and sometimes is not possible). Moreover, current data confidentiality-preserving solutions compatible with fine-level spatial analyses either lack flexibility or yield less than optimal results (because of confidentiality-preserving changes they introduce to <b>disaggregate</b> <b>data),</b> or both. In this paper, we present a simulation case study to illustrate how some analyses cannot be (or will suffer if) done on aggregate data. We then quickly review some existing data confidentiality-preserving techniques, and move on to explore a solution based on software agents with the potential of providing flexible, controlled (software-only) access to unmodified confidential <b>disaggregate</b> <b>data</b> and returning only results that do not expose any person-identifiable details. The solution is thus appropriate for micro-scale geographical analyses where no person-identifiable details are required in the final results (i. e., only aggregate results are needed). Our proposed software agent technique also enables post-coordinated analyses to be designed and carried out on the confidential database(s), as needed, compared to a more conventional solution based on the Web Services model that would only support a rigid, pre-coordinated (pre-determined) and rather limited set of analyses. The paper also provides an exploratory discussion of mobility, security, and trust issues associated with software agents, as well as possible directions/solutions to address these issues, including the use of virtual organizations. Successful partnerships between stakeholder organizations, proper collaboration agreements, clear policies, and unambiguous interpretations of laws and regulations are also much needed to support and ensure the success of any technological solution...|$|R
