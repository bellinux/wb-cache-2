5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now low <b>frequency</b> <b>filtering</b> is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E

25|$|Once {{a single}} loop-based {{arrangement}} has been generated, a producer may then focus on developing how the summing of the overdubbed parts will unfold in time, {{and what the}} final structure of the piece will be. Some producers achieve this by adding or removing layers of material at appropriate points in the mix. Quite often, this is achieved by physically manipulating a mixer, sequencer, effects, dynamic processing, equalization, and filtering while recording to a multi-track device. Other producers achieve similar results by using the automation features of computer-based digital audio workstations. Techno can consist of little more than cleverly programmed rhythmic sequences and looped motifs combined with signal processing of one variety or another, <b>frequency</b> <b>filtering</b> being a commonly used process. A more idiosyncratic approach to production {{is evident in the}} music of artists such as Twerk and Autechre, where aspects of algorithmic composition are employed in the generation of material.|$|E
500|$|A new {{technology}} emerging in mechanical filtering is microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). [...] MEMS {{are very small}} micromachines with component sizes measured in micrometres (μm), but not as small as nanomachines. [...] These filters can be designed to operate at much higher frequencies than can be achieved with traditional mechanical filters. [...] These systems are mostly fabricated from silicon (Si), silicon nitride (Si3N4), or polymers. A common component used for radio <b>frequency</b> <b>filtering</b> (and MEMS applications generally), is the cantilever resonator. Cantilevers are simple mechanical components to manufacture by much the same methods used by the semiconductor industry; masking, photolithography and etching, with a final undercutting etch to separate the cantilever from the substrate. The technology has great promise since cantilevers can be produced in large numbers on a single substrate—much as large numbers of transistors are currently contained on a single silicon chip.|$|E

2500|$|Zobel {{networks}} are rarely used for traditional <b>frequency</b> <b>filtering.</b> [...] Other filter types are significantly more efficient for this purpose. [...] Where Zobels {{come into their}} own is in frequency equalisation applications, particularly on transmission lines. [...] The difficulty with transmission lines is that the impedance of the line varies in a complex way across the band and is tedious to measure. [...] For most filter types, this variation in impedance will cause {{a significant difference in}} response to the theoretical, and is mathematically difficult to compensate for, even assuming that the impedance is known precisely. [...] If Zobel {{networks are}} used however, it is only necessary to measure the line response into a fixed resistive load and then design an equaliser to compensate it. [...] It is entirely unnecessary to know anything at all about the line impedance as the Zobel network will present exactly the same impedance to line as the measuring instruments. [...] Its response will therefore be precisely as theoretically predicted. [...] This is a tremendous advantage where high quality lines with flat frequency responses are desired.|$|E
