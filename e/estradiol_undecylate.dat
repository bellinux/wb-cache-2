25|$|Estradiol, estrone, and estriol {{have all}} been {{approved}} as pharmaceutical drugs and are used medically. Estetrol is currently under development for medical indications, but {{has not yet been}} approved in any country. A variety of synthetic estrogen esters, such as estradiol valerate, estradiol cypionate, estradiol acetate, <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate,</b> polyestradiol phosphate, and estradiol benzoate, are used clinically. The aforementioned compounds behave as prodrugs to estradiol, and are longer-lasting in comparison. Esters of estrone and estriol also exist and are employed in clinical medicine.|$|E
25|$|High dose {{estrogen}} {{therapy with}} estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol, ethinylestradiol, and <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> {{has been used}} in the past to treat prostate cancer in men. It is effective because estrogens are functional antiandrogens, capable of suppressing testosterone levels to castrate concentrations and decreasing free testosterone levels by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production. High dose estrogen therapy is associated with poor tolerability and safety, namely severe gynecomastia and cardiovascular complications such as thrombosis, and for this reason, has largely been replaced by newer antiandrogens such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. It is still sometimes used in the treatment of prostate cancer however, and newer estrogens with atypical profiles such as GTx-758 that have improved tolerability profiles are being studied for possible application in prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of prostate cancer. The estrogens that {{have been used}} include diethylstilbestrol, fosfestrol (diethylstilbestrol diphosphate), ethinylestradiol, ethinylestradiol sulfonate, polyestradiol phosphate, and <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate,</b> as well as the combined estrogenic and nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic agent estramustine phosphate. Newer estrogens with improved tolerability and safety like GTx-758 have also been studied. Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer because they are functional antiandrogens. They both suppress testosterone concentrations to castrate levels via their antigonadotropic activity and they reduce the percentage of free and bioavailable testosterone by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin production and levels. Estrogens {{have been found to be}} equivalent in effectiveness to androgen deprivation therapy with castration and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. However, they significantly increase cardiovascular mortality, and for this reason, are now little used in prostate cancer. Although the most commonly employed estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, it is notable that certain estrogens, namely polyestradiol phosphate, have been found not to do so; this is attributed to different degrees of effect of the various estrogens on hepatic protein synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Esters of {{estradiol}} like <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> {{are readily}} hydrolyzed prodrugs of estradiol, but have an extended duration when administered in oil via intramuscular injection {{due to a}} depot effect afforded by their fatty acid ester moiety. As prodrugs of estradiol, <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> and other estradiol esters are estrogens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> was developed, {{along with}} {{estradiol}} valerate, in 1954.|$|E
50|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> {{in humans}} {{have been studied}} and reported.|$|E
50|$|<b>Estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> {{has been}} used at very high dosages in the {{treatment}} of prostate cancer. At these high dosages, it has been associated with a considerable incidence of cardiovascular complications. In a 6-month study of 25 patients administered 100 mg/month intramuscular <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> for the treatment of prostate cancer, it was reported that 8 cases of severe cardiovascular complications, including 2 deaths, occurred.|$|E

5000|$|Injectables: {{estradiol}} valerate (Progynon Depot, Delestrogen), estradiol cypionate (Depo-Estradiol), <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> (Progynon Depot 100), polyestradiol phosphate (Estradurin) ...|$|E
50|$|The medical uses of {{estradiol}} cypionate are {{the same}} as those of estradiol and other estrogens. Examples of indications for the drug include hormone replacement therapy and hormonal contraception. In regards to the latter, estradiol cypionate is available as a combined injectable contraceptive in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Along with estradiol valerate, <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate,</b> and estradiol benzoate, <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> is or has been used as an intramuscular estrogen in hormone replacement therapy for transgender women.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> was {{formerly}} {{often used in}} very high doses (100 mg intramuscular injection every 3 weeks or once per month) to treat prostate cancer, but has since largely been superseded for this indication by newer agents with fewer adverse effects (e.g., gynecomastia and cardiovascular complications) like [...] analogues and non-steroidal antiandrogens. Along with estradiol valerate, estradiol cypionate, and estradiol benzoate, <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> is or {{has been used as}} an intramuscular estrogen in hormone replacement therapy for transgender women.|$|E
50|$|A phase III {{clinical}} trial comparing high-dose intramuscular cyproterone acetate (300 mg/week) and high-dose intramuscular <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> (100 mg/month) {{in the treatment}} of prostate cancer found that <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> suppressed testosterone levels into the castrate range (<50 ng/dL) within at least 3 months whereas testosterone levels with cyproterone acetate were significantly higher and above the castrate range even after 6 months of treatment. With <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate,</b> testosterone levels fell from 416 ng/dL to 38 ng/mL after 3 months and to 29.6 ng/dL after 6 months, whereas with cyproterone acetate, testosterone levels fell from 434 ng/dL to 107 ng/mL at 3 months and to 102 ng/mL at 6 months. In accordance, whereas estrogens are well-established as able to suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range at sufficiently high dosages, progestogens like cyproterone acetate are able to decrease testosterone levels only up to an apparent maximum of around 70 to 80%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Estradiol</b> <b>undecylate,</b> in {{combination}} with norethisterone acetate (at doses of 5 mg and 50 mg, respectively), was studied as a combined injectable contraceptive, but ultimately was not marketed for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> is a {{relatively}} long-chain ester of estradiol. Its ester chain contains 11 carbon atoms. For comparison, the ester chains of estradiol acetate, estradiol valerate, and estradiol enanthate have 2, 5, and 7 carbon atoms, respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> is an estrane (C18) steroid and the C17β undecylate (or undecanoate) {{fatty acid}} ester of {{estradiol}}. It {{is also known}} as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol 17β-undecanoate. A few related estradiol esters include estradiol decanoate, estradiol diundecylate, and estradiol diundecylenate.|$|E
50|$|Oral {{estradiol}} valerate (Progynova) and other esters of estradiol {{that are used}} intramuscularly like estradiol benzoate, estradiol enanthate, and <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> all are not marketed in the U.S. Polyestradiol phosphate (Estradurin) was marketed in the U.S. previously but is no longer available.|$|E
50|$|<b>Estradiol</b> <b>undecylate</b> (INN, USAN) (brand name Progynon Depot 100, others), or {{estradiol}} undecanoate, is a synthetic, steroidal {{estrogen and}} an estrogen ester - specifically, the 17β-undecanoate ester of estradiol - which is or has been marketed in Europe, including in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Monaco. It {{acts as a}} prodrug of estradiol, and hence, {{is considered to be}} a natural, bioidentical form of estrogen.|$|E
50|$|Examples of GnRH {{agonists}} include leuprorelin (leuprolide) and goserelin, {{while an}} example of a GnRH antagonist is cetrorelix. Estrogens that are or that have been used as antigonadotropins include estradiol, estradiol esters like estradiol valerate, <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate,</b> and polyestradiol phosphate, conjugated equine estrogens, ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol (no longer widely used), and bifluranol. Progestogens that are used as antigonadotropins include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and oxendolone.|$|E

5000|$|Progynon {{was also}} the name that Butenandt {{originally}} gave estrone (which he had isolated in 1929) in his first publication on the substance (and later referred to as folliculine, with the name estrone not finally being adopted until 1935). Aside from Progynon and Progynon 2, the Progynon name has also been used {{in a variety of}} other estrogenic products marketed by Schering, including Progynon-B (estradiol benzoate), Progynon-DH (estradiol; [...] "dihydroxyestrin"), Progynon-DP (estradiol dipropionate), Progynon-C (ethinylestradiol), Progynova (estradiol valerate), and Progynon Depot (estradiol valerate, <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate).</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} C17β and/or C3 ester prodrugs of {{estradiol}}, such as estradiol acetate, estradiol benzoate, estradiol cypionate, estradiol dipropionate, estradiol enanthate, <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate,</b> estradiol valerate, and polyestradiol phosphate (an estradiol ester in polymeric form), among many others, {{have been developed}} and introduced for medical use as estrogens. Estramustine phosphate is also an estradiol ester, but with a nitrogen mustard moiety attached, and is used as an alkylating antineoplastic agent {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer. Cloxestradiol acetate and promestriene are ether prodrugs of estradiol that have been introduced for medical use as estrogens as well, although they are little known and rarely used.|$|E

50|$|Although {{infrequently}} used {{in modern}} times and although synthetic estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol have been more commonly used, estradiol {{is used in the}} treatment of prostate cancer and is similarly effective to other therapies such as androgen deprivation therapy with castration and antiandrogens. It is used {{in the form of the}} long-lasting injected estradiol prodrugs polyestradiol phosphate and <b>estradiol</b> <b>undecylate,</b> and has also more recently been assessed in the form of transdermal estradiol patches. Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer by suppressing testosterone levels into the castrate range, increasing levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and thereby decreasing the fraction of free testosterone, and possibly also via direct cytotoxic effects on prostate cancer cells. Parenteral estradiol is largely free of the cardiovascular side effects of the high oral dosages of synthetic estrogens that were used previously. In addition, estrogens may have advantages relative to castration in terms of hot flashes, sexual interest and function, osteoporosis, and cognitive function and may offer significant benefits in terms of quality of life. However, side effects such as gynecomastia and feminization in general may be difficult to tolerate or unacceptable for many men.|$|E
