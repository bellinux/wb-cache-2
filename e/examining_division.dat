The {{oral proceedings}} are held before the Opposition Division itself. They are held in Munich, the Hague or Berlin, and are public unless very particular circumstances apply. This contrasts with oral proceedings held before an <b>Examining</b> <b>Division,</b> which are not public. The list of public oral proceedings in opposition before the EPO is available on its web site. The right to oral proceedings is a specific and codified part of the procedural right to be heard. A decision is often taken at the end of the oral proceedings.|$|E

The intention is to make it possible to determine, {{on the basis of the}} documents mentioned in the search report, whether and to what extent the invention is patentable (...). Knowledge of the prior art forms the basis for examination of the application by the <b>examining</b> <b>divisions.</b> It is also important for applicants, giving them a basis for deciding whether to continue prosecuting their applications and have them examined. Lastly, it is also important for the public and especially for competitors, enabling them to gain an idea of the scope of any protection that might be granted." ...|$|R

40|$|Links between cell {{division}} and other cellular processes are poorly understood. It {{is difficult to}} simultaneously <b>examine</b> <b>division</b> and function in most cell types. Most of the research probing aspects of {{cell division}} has experimented with stationary or immobilized cells or distinctly asymmetrical cells. Here we took an alternative approach by <b>examining</b> cell <b>division</b> events within motile groups of cells growing on solid medium by time-lapse microscopy. A total of 558 cell divisions were identified among approximately 12, 000 cells. We found an interconnection of division, motility, and polarity in the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. For every division event, motile cells stop moving to divide. Progeny cells of binary fission subsequently move in opposing directions. This behavior involves M. xanthus Frz proteins that regulate M. xanthus motility reversals but is independent of type IV pilus ‚ÄúS motility. ‚Äù The inheritance of opposing polarity is correlated with {{the distribution of the}} G protein RomR within these dividing cells. The constriction at the point of division limits the intracellular distribution of RomR. Thus, the asymmetric distribution of RomR at the parent cell poles becomes mirrored at new poles initiated at the site of division...|$|R

40|$|Europe‚Äôs {{sovereign}} debt {{crisis and the}} accompanying national bank crises in the European Union brought bank regulation and supervision {{to the top of}} the EU policy agenda. In a few short years, we have witnessed a ‚Äògreat leap forward‚Äô for European integration marked by over a dozen pieces of EU legislation shaping the operation of banks, rules on bank capital, reconfigured supervisory agencies, and Banking Union. The significance of these measures lies however, in the fact that they constitute the most dramatic transfer of policy-making powers to the European level since the start of Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. This volume addresses the three main political battles behind the adoption of these new regulatory and supervisory policies. First, it <b>examines</b> <b>divisions</b> among states, both according to their domestic institutional structures, including distinct financial systems, as well as their creditor or debtor status in the crisis. Second, it studies the battle over national versus supranational jurisdiction. Third, it explores the conflictual process of policy learning and the activation of epistemic communities who claim competence to address the crisis...|$|R
