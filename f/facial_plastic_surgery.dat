"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature" [...] was {{originally}} published, in slightly edited form, as [...] "Yet Another Example of the Porousness of Certain Borders (VIII)" [...] in McSweeney's #1 (1998). According to Paul Giles, the title [...] "directly echoes" [...] Richard Rorty's celebrated book, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature. In the story, an unnamed narrator recounts {{the story of}} his mother's botched <b>facial</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery,</b> which left her with a look of constant terror on her face, and the litigation surrounding that surgery. The narrator also mentions throughout the story his own entanglement in litigation related to his black-widow spider farm.|$|E

40|$|The task of {{successfully}} matching face images obtained {{before and}} after <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> is a challenging problem. The {{degree to which a}} face is altered depends on the type and number of <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeries</b> performed, {{and it is difficult to}} model such variations. Existing approaches use learning based methods that are either computationally expensive or rely on a set of training images. In this work, a fusion approach is proposed that combines information from the face and ocular regions to enhance recognition performance in the identification mode. The proposed approach provides the highest reported recognition performance on a publicly accessible <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> database, with a rank-one accuracy of 87. 4 %. Compared to existing approaches, the proposed approach is not learning based and reduces computational requirements. Furthermore, a systematic study of the matching accuracies corresponding to various types of surgeries is presented. For example, restoring damaged skin due to burn injuries or accidents. <b>Facial</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeries</b> have become increasingly popular in the recent past, especially for aesthetic improvement purposes. A report from the American Society of <b>Plastic</b> <b>Surgery</b> states that a total of 13. 8 million cosmetic and reconstructive <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeries</b> were performed just in the year 20112. Three of the top five surgeries in this set relate to the modification of facial features 3. Some of the major <b>facial</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeries</b> include: rhinoplasty (nose surgery), blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery), brow lift (eyebrow surgery), otoplasty (ear surgery), and rhytidectomy (face lift surgery) (see Figure 1). A detailed, but nonexhaustive list of <b>facial</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>surgeries</b> is provided in [13]. 1...|$|R

25|$|In Germany, rhinoplastic {{technique}} was refined by surgeons {{such as the}} Berlin University professor of surgery Karl Ferdinand von Gräfe (1787–1840), who published Rhinoplastik (Rebuilding the Nose, 1818) wherein he described fifty-five (55) historical <b>plastic</b> <b>surgery</b> procedures (Indian rhinoplasty, Italian rhinoplasty, etc.), and his technically innovative free-graft nasal reconstruction (with a tissue-flap harvested from the patient’s arm), and surgical approaches to eyelid, cleft lip, and cleft palate corrections. Dr. von Gräfe’s protégé, the medical and surgical polymath Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1794–1847), who {{was among the first}} surgeons to anaesthetize the patient before performing the nose surgery, published Die Operative Chirurgie (Operative Surgery, 1845), which became a foundational medical and plastic surgical text. (see strabismus, torticollis) Moreover, the Prussian Jacques Joseph (1865–1934) published Nasenplastik und sonstige Gesichtsplastik (Rhinoplasty and other <b>Facial</b> <b>Plastic</b> <b>Surgeries,</b> 1928), which described refined surgical techniques for performing nose-reduction rhinoplasty via internal incisions.|$|R
