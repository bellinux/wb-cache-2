The oil filter housing was cast into the block with a removable cover and replaceable paper element. It did not use an EGR valve. The Ecotec line is manufactured in Tonawanda, New York and Kaiserslautern, Germany, and was also manufactured for Saturn in Spring Hill, Tennessee until Saturn's discontinuation.

50|$|A major {{redesign}} of the H engine came in 1990 {{in the form}} of the new B234 for the Saab 9000. The B234 featured an increase in stroke from 78 mm to 90 mm, increasing the displacement to 2.3 liters. With this increased stroke also came a new engine block with increased deck height to make sufficient room for the increased stroke length without being forced to use shorter connecting rods, and <b>in-block</b> counter-rotating balance shafts for reduced vibration (NVH). There are two generations of B234 engine, one made from 1990-1993, the other from 1994 to 1998. The later motors had a revised oil sump system, head, timing cover, and different bell housing pattern. Unlike the previous B202, the block was no longer angled, but straight, something that made it unsuitable for the 900 model with its gearbox under the engine, built into the engine oil sump. The longer stroke B234 was last produced in 1998, that being the last year for the 9000 model. The B234 was selected as one of Ward's 10 Best Engines for 1995 and 1996.|$|E
50|$|In 1950 Lancia had {{introduced}} its first all-new postwar model, the Lancia Aurelia, {{a small but}} expensive luxury car with sophisticated engineering features like the first ever V6 engine, inboard rear brakes and a transaxle gearbox. Alongside it Lancia was still producing the Lancia Ardea, a pre-war design that although once innovative {{was in need of}} replacement.The new small Lancia was designed under engineer Vittorio Jano. Initially an updated version of the Ardea's 17° V4 engine was considered, but a clean-sheet design was ultimately chosen. At little over 10°, the new V4 had the narrowest angle of any V4 engine, and used solutions unprecedented at Lancia, like dual <b>in-block</b> camshafts in place of overhead ones. As the Ardea resembled a scaled-down Aprilia, the Appia mimicked the Aurelia's appearance, substituting its exotic parts with more cost-effective ones, such as a solid axle and a four-speed gearbox in block with the engine. For its mechanical features—sliding pillar front suspension, V4 engine, rear-wheel drive, absence of a centre pillar—the Appia can be considered the last in a line of Lancias which stretched back to the 1922 Lambda. Following a custom started in the postwar years, the new model was named after a Roman consular road, the Appian Way.|$|E
5000|$|... / - The {{sources of}} the main issues with the 6.0L were the <b>in-block</b> oil cooler, and the EGR cooler materials. The oil cooler {{is located in the}} valley of the engine block, {{underneath}} the cartridge oil filter set up. The sealed outer portion of the oil cooler is submerged in engine oil, with coolant flowing through the center passages. Over time, the oil cooler will develop small cracks in the aluminum tubes from the constant heating and cooling of the engine. This situation usually results in oil pushing it's way into the cooling system. The sludge created from the mixture of oil and coolant creates a high pressure environment in the EGR cooler (due to the viscosity change in the coolant), leading to cracking of the EGR cooler's coolant passages. Once the EGR cooler cracks, it begins to leak coolant into the intake system and is then routed into the engine's cylinders to be burnt. The burning of coolant in the cylinders then causes a steam buildup, thus increasing cylinder pressures and the stretching of the head bolts; which leads to head gasket failure. The early EGR coolers (2003-2004.5) were also susceptible to pre-mature failure without oil cooler issues, also resulting in head gasket failure.|$|E

The engine, displacing 425 cubic inches and {{belonging to the}} FE family of Ford engines, {{was known as the}} [...] "427 SOHC"; it was also known as the Cammer. It was basically a set of SOHC hemi heads that bolted onto Ford's FE engine block. The 1964 engine was designed in 90 days of intensive engineering effort for use in racing. The 427 SOHC used the side oiler engine block modified slightly to deal with the missing <b>in-block</b> cam among other OHC issues. Because of their power levels, and the fact that Chrysler had showed Bill France that a DOHC 426 Hemi was in the works, it was banned from NASCAR races, though allowed in certain drag racing classes. After the NASCAR ban, Ford continued to produce the SOHC, selling it over the counter to racers and others who used it to power many altered-wheelbase A/FX Mustangs and supercharged Top Fuel dragsters. Connie Kalitta, Pete Robinson, and [...] "Snake" [...] Prudhomme all used the engine in their Top Fuel racers. In 1967 Connie Kalitta's SOHC-powered [...] "Bounty Hunter" [...] won Top Fuel honors at AHRA, NHRA and NASCAR winter meets, becoming the only [...] "triple crown" [...] winner in drag racing history. Dynamometer results of the day showed the SOHC Hemi producing almost 700 hp (522 kW) in crate form (100 hp per liter). The overhead cams meant that it was not as rpm-limited as the Chrysler Hemis were with their pushrods and heavy and complex valvetrains.|$|E

30|$|The most {{frequent}} conservative surgical techniques {{in the treatment}} of RVE are those aiming for simple lesional resection after separating the endometriosic nodule from the rectal wall [57], layer-to-layer excision shaving of the lesion without resecting the entire thickness of the intestinal wall [63], and discoidal resection with complete excision of the affected area of the intestinal wall by the endometriosic nodule [35].

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{dynamical}} consistency is introduced {{to define a}} high level transition function for an arbitrary partition of the state space of a finite input-state machine M.

40|$|Based {{upon the}} COCOLOG (Conditional Observer and Controller Logic) logic control formalism, {{we present a}} framework, called a system of Markovian fragments, which permits {{efficient}} updating of the axiom sets of a COCOLOG system. The key idea is that one should only retain those axioms and theorems concerning the most recent state estimate of the controlled machine. This information is sufficient to evaluate the truth of conditional control formulas which only depend upon the current state estimate of the controlled machine. As a result, a Markovian fragment system is demonstrated to have virtually the same control power as a full COCOLOG system. Further, it is shown that a Markovian fragmented system has a complexity of logical deduction which is time-dependent while a full COCOLOG system has a complexity which increases monotonically with time. In order to formulate the analysis and synthesis of hierarchical systems, a hierarchical structure based upon the notion of dynamical consistency is presented. The underlying motivation for this notion is that high level dynamics should be consistent with low level dynamics. The major part of this investigation is carried out for the so-called <b>in-block</b> controllable partition lattices, which are the lattices of partitions for which each block element constitutes a controllable submachine. We show that most controllable finite state machines {{have at least one}} non-trivial <b>in-block</b> controllable partition machine.

A consequence of this construction is that a state-to-state reachability problem can be decomposed into reachability problems at different levels of abstraction. In terms of this theory, a hierarchical control system is a set of control systems associated with a chain from the top element to the bottom element of the <b>in-block</b> controllable partition lattice of a controlled machine. As an extension of regular COCOLOG, we give the HICOLOG formulation of hierarchical logic control. The basic contribution is the construction of a system wherein a high level logic controller makes its control decisions with respect to the information available to it and communicates its commands as control objectives to the associated low level logic control systems; this is continued down the chain of systems in a given hierarchical lattice. Information flows up the hierarchy in the form of abstract statements concerning the system state. The notion of dynamical consistency is extended to hybrid systems so as to define the set of dynamically consistent hybrid partition machines associated with a continuous system ${ cal S}$.
