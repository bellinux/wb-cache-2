500|$|During the 1892 campaign, Tillman {{called for}} the defeat in the Democratic primary for the {{legislature}} {{of most of the}} men elected as his supporters, urging the selection of more loyal men. Tillman urged the voters, [...] "turn out this cattle, these driftwood legislators, and send me a legislature that will <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> and I'll show you reform." [...] South Carolinians dutifully voted out their representatives as Tillman requested. Although no primary for governor was permitted, the delegates to the nominating convention were elected by the Democratic voters, and Tillman won an overwhelming victory over Sheppard, who took only four of thirty-five counties. The convention was mostly Tillmanite, and gave the governor an easy triumph. The Conservatives had agreed not to bolt the party, and Tillman won uncontested re-election.|$|E
500|$|Fazekas said that, [...] "Whitney is used {{to people}} {{treating}} her {{with a certain amount}} of deference, because she’s a famous actress, and she’s met her match in Peggy." [...] She added that in the series, [...] "You see the makings of a villain, but she doesn't start off evil. She starts off manipulative and not the nicest person you've ever met, but she's not a bad guy when you first meet her." [...] Fazekas additionally noted how the sexist themes of the times were handled, by showing [...] "that the only way Whitney Frost felt she could exert power in the world was through her husband, because she had been told her whole life, 'Nobody cares how smart you are, they care about how pretty you are.'" [...] On Frost's relationship with Chadwick, Everett called him [...] "her best friend. And like many friends and family, you end up , but he’s always there ... he knows I can <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> I can do, especially in the science world. So he’s really the only one who gets me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{impeachment}} {{trial in the}} Illinois State Senate began on January 26, 2009. [...] Blagojevich boycotted attending his own hearings, referring to them as a kangaroo court. Neither the governor nor his lawyer was present in Springfield, Illinois {{on the first day}} of the trial. Blagojevich spent the day in New York City making media appearances on a myriad of shows including Good Morning America and The View. In his absence, a [...] "not guilty" [...] plea was automatically entered on his behalf. On the same day, in a cable television news interview with Geraldo Rivera, Blagojevich derided the whole process. Lead attorney Ed Genson announced that he was withdrawing from representing Blagojevich, saying [...] "I never require a client to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> but I do require them to at least listen." [...] Blagojevich was in New York again the next day continuing an apparent attempt to upstage the hearings with eleven media appointments at places such as The Early Show, and the Associated Press. Blagojevich insisted that unlike Richard Nixon who did not want his tapes heard during Watergate, he wanted his tapes heard in order to reveal the whole truth, which he felt would vindicate him.|$|E

The chances are that she won't have the courage to take up her plan of life again, and that she'll consider any other that's pressed home upon her. And I take it for a good sign that she's sent that fellow adrift. If her mind had n't been set on some one else, she'd have taken him, in this broken-up state of hers. Besides, she has formed the habit of <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> and there's a great deal in mere continuity of habit.

Now a man does not care to let his own flesh and blood incur the danger of such anguish as that, and I shall <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to prevent it.
