The pattern of spread was studied and {{analyzed}} using STCLASS computer software. The pattern of spread was non-random and the initially infected vines served as source and focus of secondary spread. Key words: Black pepper, Phytophthora foot rot, pattern of spread, spatio-temporal <b>distance</b> <b>class</b> Black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) {{is one of}} the ex-port oriented spice crops of India. Crop losses due to Phytophthora foot rot are {{recognized as one of the}} major causes for the low productivity in India (Sarma and Anandaraj 1997). The fungus infects all parts of the vine and expression of symptoms depends upon the site of infection and extent of damage (Anandaraj, 1997). Infection on the collar is fatal. This occurs ei-ther through the runner shoots or roots. Root infection which culminate in foot rot takes a longer incubation time and often shows declining symptoms. The occur-rence of this disease was monitored over a period of time and the pattern of spread was studied using STCLASS (Spatio temporal <b>distance</b> <b>class)</b> computer software (Nelson 1995 a, 1995 b).

The original publication is available at [URL] on ground-dwelling arthropod densities is important for efficient management in agro-ecosystems. A method of using paired pitfall traps with different inter-trap distances, called the two-circle method (TCM), was proposed recently for accurate and efficient estimation of arthropod densities. Using the numbers of individuals caught in paired traps and the inter-trap distances between the paired traps as input, the TCM can simultaneously estimate the effective trapping radius and the population density by fitting a nonlinear model. However, the previous fitting procedure (using the nonlinear least squares approach) provides the estimates and standard errors of only these two variables, and often suffers from its hypersensitivity to the initial values assigned in the nonlinear regression. To estimate the confidence intervals of these estimates and to assess {{the effects of the}} number of replications per <b>distance</b> <b>class</b> and the number of distance classes on the accuracy of density estimates, we provide a new procedure for fitting the model by using the optimization function. Evaluation based on simulated and field data suggests that the TCM could provide a reliable estimate of density by using at least 15 paired traps per <b>distance</b> <b>class</b> and at least 4 distance classes.

P. quinquefolius has been harvested {{for more than}} 250 years and is now considered threatened or rare throughout its range. Plants within four protected and four unprotected populations were significantly clumped based on Ripley’s univariate analysis. Analysis with Ripley’s bivariate test determined that juvenile plants were significantly clumped with adult plants at the shortest <b>distance</b> <b>classes</b> in all populations. Although plants were highly clumped, we found that significant fine-scale genetic structure was restricted to the shortest <b>distance</b> <b>classes</b> based on estimates of coancestry (fij). In most cases, estimates of fij were more significant among juveniles than among adults, especially at the shortest <b>distance</b> <b>classes.</b> The spatial structure of ginseng seems to result from the establishment and persistence of plants in favorable microhabitats coupled with limited seed dispersal around maternal individuals.

Despite its effectiveness in reducing buffer requirements,wormhole-switching technique is susceptible to deadlock. In wormhole switching, the resources are virtual channel and their corresponding buffers. Here, cyclic dependency on flit buffers occurs among several packets. As a result, the network is clogged with packets without making any progress. To prevent this catastrophic problem, we mainly adopt deadlock-avoidance policy in NoCsim.
