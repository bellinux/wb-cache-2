Additional veteran troops came from {{the remains of the}} former Army of England. The new mililary doctrine emphasised the offensive, mobility and the bayonet, over linear firepower.

To the east of Castel Ceriolo took position Jean-Charles Monnier's division, supported by the Guard, which formed the reserve. Victor was the one who would bear the brunt of the Austrian attack.|$|E

25|$|Hussein's poetry was {{influenced}} by the 11th-century Arab skeptic al-Ma'arri and the early 20th-century Lebanese American poet Elia Abu Madi. Marmorstein wrote: The choice of these two mentors is clearly relevant to the experience of those Palestinian Muslims who found themselves reduced from majority to minority status. For the scepticism and pessimism of Abu'l-'Ala al-Ma'arri reflect an age of social decay and political anarchy in Islam while Iliya Abu Madi who emigrated in 1911 to the U.S.A., represents the capacity of Arabic literature both to survive <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> be enriched by a non-Arab environment.|$|E

Seven seats are currently reserved for members elected on a separate Māori roll.

The specific training, competence and registration for these skills varies, and may be specified by state or national legislation or by industry codes of practice.|$|E
25|$|The Court did not {{explicitly}} decide {{whether a particular}} Congress (105th, 106th, etc.) {{had the power to}} expel an individual from a future Congress without that future Congress from being required, after the re-election, the re-swearing in, and the re-seating of a formerly expelled member, to expel the member all over again. The Court, in effect, decided that states were not prohibited from putting on their congressional district ballots and the voters were not prohibited from electing an individual who had been expelled from a previous or current Congress. Once the Congress had satisfied itself that a candidate member had been presented to it, from a congressional district, in accordance with the congressional district's state constitution and laws but was not in conflict with the congressional qualifications set down in the US Constitution, the US Congress had an affirmative constitutional duty to administer the oath to, to swear <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> enroll the candidate member as a member of Congress.|$|E

The worst cardinals, providing, of course, the material for the worst Popes, {{have been for the}} most part cardinal nephews, the temptation to the creation of such having been rendered too great to be resisted by the exorbitant greatness of the power, dignity, and wealth attributed {{to the members of the}} Sacred College.

500|$|Via a {{quitclaim}} from Carolco dated March 28, 1995, MGM acquired 21st Century's {{film library}} and assets, and received [...] "...all rights <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> all drafts and {{versions of the}} screenplay(s) for Spider-Man written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom & John Brancato, Menahem Golan, Jon [...] Michael Paul, Ethan Wiley, Leslie Stevens, Frank Laloggia, Neil Ruttenberg, Barney Cohen, Shepard Goldman and any and all other writers." [...] MGM also sued 21st Century, Viacom, and Marvel Comics, alleging fraud in the original deal between Cannon and Marvel. In 1998, Marvel emerged from bankruptcy with a reorganization plan that merged the company with Toy Biz. The courts determined that the original contract of Marvel's rights to Golan had expired, returning the rights to Marvel, but the matter was still not completely resolved. In 1999, Marvel licensed Spider-Man rights to Columbia, a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment. MGM disputed the legality, claiming it had the Spider-Man rights via Cannon, 21st Century, and Carolco.|$|E
