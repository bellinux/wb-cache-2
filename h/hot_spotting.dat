Like other handcrews, IHCs are primarily tasked with constructing, firing out, and holding handline, through the use of chainsaws, hand tools, ignition devices, and water delivery equipment. Hotshot crews can engage in all phases of wildfire response, from initial attack to mop-up. They are also trained in specialized operations, such as <b>hot</b> <b>spotting,</b> spot fire attack, tree felling, and structure protection.|$|E
50|$|Semi-specular {{high gain}} screen {{materials}} are suited to ceiling-mounted projector setups since the greatest {{intensity of light}} will be reflected downward toward the audience at an angle equal and opposite to the angle of incidence. However, for a viewer seated {{to one side of}} the audience the opposite side of the screen is much darkened for the same reason. Some structured screen materials are semi-specularly reflective in the vertical plane while more perfectly diffusely reflective in the horizontal plane to avoid this. Glass-bead screens exhibit a phenomenon of retroreflection; the light is reflected more intensely back to its source than in any other direction. They work best for setups where the image source is placed in the same direction from the screen as the audience. With retroreflective screens, the screen center might be brighter than the screen periphery, a kind of <b>hot</b> <b>spotting.</b> This differs from semi-specular screens where the hot spot's location varies depending on the viewer's position in the audience. Retroreflective screens are seen as desirable due to the high image intensity they can produce with a given luminous flux from a projector.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Design and {{estimate}} {{the impacts of}} a prevention program for part 1 violent crimes in micro-place crime <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Methods: A longitudinal study of crime <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> using 21 years of crime offense report data on part 1 violent crimes from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Based on kernel density smoothing for a definition of micro-place crime <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> we replicate past work {{on the existence of}} “chronic” <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> but then with such <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> accounted for introduce “temporary” <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Results: Chronic <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> are good targets for prevention. They are easily identified and they tend to persist. Temporary <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> however, predominantly last only one month. Thus the common practice of identifying <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> using a short time window of crime data and assuming that the resulting <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> will persist is ineffective for temporary <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Instead it is necessary to forecast the emergence of temporary <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> to prevent their crimes. Over time chronic <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> while still important, have accounted for less crime while temporary <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> have grown, accounting for a larger share. Chronic <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> are relatively easy targets for police whereas temporary <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> require forecasting methods not commonly in use by police. Conclusions: The paper estimates approximately a 10 to 20 percent reduction in part 1 violent crimes in Pittsburgh if the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> enforcement program proposed in this paper were implemented...|$|R

5000|$|Frequently quoted gain {{levels of}} various {{materials}} range from 0.8 of light grey matte screens to 2.5 {{of the more}} highly reflective glass bead screens, some manufacturers claiming even higher numbers for their products. Very high gain levels could be attained simply by using a mirror surface, although the audience would then just see {{a reflection of the}} projector, defeating the purpose of using a screen. Many screens with higher gain are simply semi-glossy, and so exhibit more mirror-like properties, namely a bright [...] "hot spot" [...] in the screen—an enlarged (and greatly blurred) reflection of the projector’s lens. Opinions differ as to when this [...] "hot spotting" [...] begins to be distracting, but most viewers do not notice differences as large as 30% in the image luminosity, unless presented with a test image and asked to look for variations in brightness. This is possible because humans have greater sensitivity to contrast in smaller details, but less so in luminosity variations as great as half of the screen. Other screens with higher gain are semi-retroreflective. Unlike mirrors, retroreflective surfaces reflect light back toward the source. <b>Hot</b> <b>spotting</b> is less of a problem with retroreflective high gain screens. Unfortunately, at the perpendicular direction used for gain measurement, mirror reflection and retroreflection are indistinguishable, and this has sown confusion about the behavior of high gain screens.|$|E

In present day systems, bypass diodes are used to mitigate <b>hot</b> <b>spotting,</b> but it does not prevent <b>hot</b> <b>spotting</b> or the damage it causes. This paper presents an active hot spot detection method to detect <b>hot</b> <b>spotting</b> within a series of PV cells, using ac parameter characterization. A PV cell is comprised of series and parallel resistances and parallel capacitance, which are affected by voltage bias, illumination, and temperature. Experimental results have shown that when a PV string is under a maximum power point tracking control, <b>hot</b> <b>spotting</b> in a single cell results in a capacitance increase and dc impedance increase. The capacitance change is detectable by measuring the ac impedance magnitude in the 10 - 70 kHz frequency range. An impedance value change due to <b>hot</b> <b>spotting</b> can be detected by monitoring one high-frequency measurement in the capacitive region and one low-frequency measurement in the dc impedance region. Alternatively, the dc impedance can also be calculated using dc operating point measurements.

Furthermore, it explores the temporal patterns of identified MCC <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> to determine if they exhibit distinct spatio-temporal patterns. Getis Ord (GI*) <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> analysis was used to identify locations of statistically significant <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of each of the four crime and disorder classifications.

40|$|Abstract Background Meiotic {{recombination}} {{events have}} been found to concentrate in 1 – 2. 5 kilo base regions, but these recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> do not share a consensus sequence and why they occur at specific sites is not fully understood. Some previous evidence suggests that poly-purine/poly-pyrimidine (poly-pu/py) tracts (PPTs), a class of sequence with distinctive biochemical properties, could be involved in recombination, but no general association of PPTs with meiotic recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> has previously been reported. Results We used computational methods to investigate in detail the relationship between PPTs and <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> We show statistical associations of PPT frequency with <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of meiotic recombination initiating lesions, double-strand breaks, in the genome of the yeast S. cerevisiae and with experimentally well characterized human meiotic recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Supporting a possible role of poly-pu/py-rich sequences in <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> recombination, we also found that all three single nucleotide polymorphisms previously shown to be associated with human <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> activity changes occur within sequence contexts of 14 bp or longer that are 85 % or more poly-pu/py and at least 70 % G/C. These polymorphisms are all close to the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> mid points. Comparing the sequences of experimentally characterized human <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> with the orthologous regions of the chimpanzee genome previously shown not to contain <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> we found that in all five cases in which comparisons for the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> central regions are possible with publicly available sequence data, there are differences near the human <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> mid points within sequences 14 bp or longer consisting of more than 80 % poly-pu/py and at least 50 % G/C.

For this reason, simulations of single cavities in such cases are not realistic; the complete, linked configuration must be considered.

40|$|Cast iron {{brake discs}} are {{commonly}} used in the automotive industry, and efforts are being made {{to gain a better}} understanding of the thermal and mechanical phenomena occurring at braking. The high thermomechanical loading at braking arises from interaction between the brake disc and the brake pads. Frictional heating generates elevated temperatures with a non-uniform spatial distribution often in the form of banding or <b>hot</b> <b>spotting.</b> These phenomena contribute to material fatigue and wear and possibly also to cracking. The use of advanced calibrated material models is one important step towards a reliable analysis of the mechanical behaviour and the life of brake discs. In the present study, a material model of the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman type is adopted, which accounts for asymmetric yielding in tension and compression, kinematic hardening effects, viscoplastic response and temperature dependence. The material model is calibrated using specimens tested in uniaxial cyclic loading for six different temperatures ranging from room temperature to 650 °C. A special testing protocol is followed which is intended to activate the different features of the material model. Validation of the model is performed by using tensile tests and thermomechanical experiments. An application example is given where a 10 ° sector of a brake disc is analysed using the commercial finitie element code Abaqus under a uniformly applied heat flux on the two friction surfaces.

Holographic interferometry is used {{in an attempt to}} observe the disc mode shape during judder and although the classical fringe pattern was not obtained for the disc some useful and complementary information was forthcoming. Disc run-out measurements show that the disc takes up a permanent and increasing deformation with a two-diameter mode formation. This deformation is seen to give a brake pressure fluctuation that results in judder – the pressure being detected using a pressure transducer fitted at the calliper and the mechanical judder with an accelerometer mounted on the calliper body. The two signals allow the degree of phase shift to be estimated. A “strobing” effect, resulting from the combination of speed and video recording frequency, shows two hot-spots moving with the disc. Subsequent holographic results confirm the positions with the appearance of thermal fringes “just off” the disc surface. The images also show a classical two-diameter mode order of vibration on the disc centre. The holographic recordings also indicate pressure waves being emitted from the trailing end of the pads with the mode shape of the pads confirming high amplitude bending; the existence of the pressure waves inferring the pads lose contact with the disc surface.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} analysis of REDD supply schedules {{were carried out}} in a global total land-use context. The Global Model cluster combines geographically explicit biophysical models with economic modeling. The model cluster covers all land-use types and thus allows for fully integrated analysis of competitive interactions between different land uses and land use change types. Combining the different models allows for geographic explicit analysis of REDD policies in a global context. The geographic explicit analysis of REDD policy options is carried out using the G 4 M (former DIMA) model (e. g. Rokitiansky et al., 2007; Kindermann et al., 2006, 2008 b). G 4 M is driven by exogenous market price assumptions for land and commodities without taking market feedbacks into account. The partial equilibrium model GLOBIOM generates endogenous prices. GLOBIOM has global geographic coverage and accounts for all land uses and thus allows for REDD policy analysis in a wider land use and global change context. When the two models are coupled the G 4 M model serves a double purpose. First it informs GLOBIOM on basic biophysical forest growth information and engineering costing of various forest management options. Second, results from GLOBIOM, such as endogenous commodity and land prices and trade, are used as exogenous drivers for the geographically explicit modeling using G 4 M. In the latter G 4 M becomes a "sophisticated" downscaling algorithm for GLOBIOM results facilitating "visual validation" of results and geographic REDD <b>hot</b> <b>spotting.</b> In the following the two models are described. In the description of G 4 M we provide {{a detailed description of}} the improved carbon accounting and calibration methods departing from (Kindermann et al., 2006). Changes in the calibration methodology have necessarily created considerable differences in baseline emissions and thus REDD costs as published in (Kindermann et al., 2006). Baselines in (Kindermann et al., 2006) are determined mainly by future GDP and population development assuming low institutional barriers for expansion of the agricultural and forestry sectors whereas the latter is mainly driven by the continuation of historical emissions and the continuation of institutional barriers of agricultural and forestry sector development. The version of G 4 M presented in this document was calibrated to the global emissions estimates provided by the IPCC while the one in (Kindermann et al., 2006) was calibrated to the estimates provided by global analysis using remote sensing methods. Differences in the results of these two model versions of G 4 M provide valuable insights on the impact of changes in methodologies on REDD costs.

The number of microvessels was counted manually in a subjectively selected <b>hot</b> <b>spot,</b> {{and also in the}} same complete tumour sections by interactive and automated image processing methods. An algorithm identified the <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> from microvessel maps of the whole tumour section. RESULTS: No significant difference in manual microvessel counts was found between two observers within the same <b>hot</b> <b>spot,</b> and counts were significantly correlated. However, when the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> was reselected, significantly different results were found between repeated counts by the same observer. Counting all microvessels manually within the entire tumour section resulted in significantly different <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> than manual counts in selected <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> by the same observer. Within the entire tumour section {{no significant differences were found}} between the <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of the manual and automated methods using an automated microscope. The <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> was found using an eight connective path search algorithm, was located at or near the border of the tumour, and (depending on the size of the <b>hot</b> <b>spot)</b> did not always contain the field with the largest number of microvessels. CONCLUSIONS: The automated counting of microvessels is preferable to the manual method because of the reduction in measurement time when the complete tumour is scanned, the greater accuracy and objectivity of <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> selection, and the possibility of visual inspection and relocation of each measurement field afterwards...|$|R
