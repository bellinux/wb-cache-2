5|$|In {{order for}} the heated water to form a geyser, a {{plumbing}} system made of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and sometimes cavities is required. This includes a reservoir to hold the water while <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> heated. Geysers are generally aligned along faults. Constrictions in the system {{are essential to the}} building up of pressure before an eruption.|$|E
5|$|Serpens is {{the only}} one of the 88 modern constellations to be split into two {{disconnected}} regions in the sky: Serpens Caput (the head) and Serpens Cauda (the tail). The constellation is also unusual in that it depends on another constellation for context; specifically, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> held by the Serpent Bearer Ophiuchus.|$|E

50|$|The passive {{forms of}} {{certain of the}} {{combinations}} involving the progressive aspect are quite rare; these include the present perfect progressive (<b>it</b> has <b>been</b> <b>being</b> written), past perfect progressive (<b>it</b> had <b>been</b> <b>being</b> written), future progressive (<b>it</b> will <b>be</b> <b>being</b> written), future perfect progressive (<b>it</b> will have <b>been</b> <b>being</b> written), conditional progressive (<b>it</b> would <b>be</b> <b>being</b> written) and conditional perfect progressive (<b>it</b> would have <b>been</b> <b>being</b> written). Because of the awkwardness of these constructions, they may be paraphrased, for example using the expression {{in the process of}} (<b>it</b> has <b>been</b> in the process of <b>being</b> written, <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> {{in the process of being}} written, and similar).|$|R

5|$|This bird {{can be seen}} to perch in both {{shrubbery}} {{and even}} trees, something characteristic of the forest rails. The grey-necked wood rail rarely flies, although when it is flushed out, it will generally move to a branch close to the ground.

5|$|A {{number of}} filmmakers have {{proposed}} films based on Cassidy's life, and {{have worked with}} her family to greater or lesser degrees, but to date these projects have not progressed past the early development stages. In late 2007, AIR Productions acquired the rights to produce a film based on Cassidy's life. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> produced by Amy Redford (daughter of actor/director Robert Redford), Irwin Shapiro and Rick Singer. In an interview a year earlier, Cassidy's parents suggested Kirsten Dunst or Emily Watson as possible actresses who could play their daughter.|$|E
5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E
5|$|After the Order was {{expelled}} from Malta in 1798, the auberge was used {{for a number of}} purposes, housing a military headquarters, an officers' mess, a museum, a school of arts, a courthouse, the General Post Office and various government departments. Until recently, it housed the Malta Tourism Authority, and there are undergoing works of restoration. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> converted to host the National Museum of Fine Arts, which is known by the name MUŻA.|$|E

5|$|In the past, Denver {{has been}} home to several other {{airports}} that are no longer operational. Stapleton International Airport was closed in 1995 when it was replaced by DIA. Lowry Air Force Base was a military flight training facility that ceased flight operations in 1966, with the base finally being closed in 1994. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> used for residential purposes. Buckley Air Force Base, a former Air National Guard base, is the only military facility in the Denver area.|$|E
5|$|Non-inhibitory {{extracellular}} serpins also {{perform a}} wide array of important roles. Thyroxine-binding globulin and transcortin transport the hormones thyroxine and cortisol, respectively. The non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in egg white. Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus. Heat shock serpin 47 is a chaperone, essential for proper folding of collagen. It acts by stabilising collagen's triple helix whilst <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> processed in the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E

5|$|The black morph is {{less common}} than the spotted form but, at about {{six percent of}} the population, it is several orders of {{magnitude}} above the mutation rate. Hence, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> supported by selection. Some evidence indicates the melanism allele is dominant. The black form may {{be an example of}} heterozygote advantage; breeding in captivity is not yet conclusive on this. Melanistic jaguars (or “black” jaguars) occur primarily in parts of South America, and are virtually unknown in wild populations residing in the subtropical and temperate regions of North America; they have never been documented north of Mexico’s Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal erosion}} and {{salinization}} affecting {{the west of}} Senegal are also a source of concern on the island; signs of erosion have been observed in Carabane since 1849. The house of the government representative on the island has burned down twice; each time it was rebuilt, {{the site of the}} building had to be moved further and further inland. The island's erosion is evident when one considers that the original location of the house eventually became flooded, even at low tide. During the dry season the river has a tide-dominated delta, with tidewater reaching 200km upstream, while <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> concentrated 50% by evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD is {{not itself}} currently {{used as a}} treatment for any disease. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> studied for its potential use in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease. Evidence on the benefit of NAD in neurodegeneration is mixed; some studies in mice have produced promising results whereas a placebo-controlled clinical trial in humans failed to show any effect.|$|E

5|$|The draught section {{drivability}} test, which evaluates disposition: adaptability, reliability, and calmness, {{consists of}} four parts, and 0–5 points are given for each. To pass the test, the horse must score at least one point for {{each part of the}} test, and its combined score for the test must be at least 10 points. The first part examines the behaviour of the horse while <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> harnessed and loaded, then unloaded and unharnessed, and the remaining three parts evaluate the way the horse behaves when being driven. These parts often include regulation of the speed of the horse's walk, halts, turns around obstacles, and backing with a load around a corner.|$|E
5|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Metarhizium acridum {{is found}} in Africa, Australia and Brazil where it has caused epizootics in grasshoppers. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> investigated for possible use as a microbial insecticide for locust control. The microsporidian fungus Nosema locustae, once {{considered to be a}} protozoan, can be lethal to grasshoppers. It has to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a bait-based commercial microbial pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> {{prepared}} for a show. He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins to sing with a camera crew starting to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown as he continues. Various personnel walk around him and adjust the set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on the boxes. The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman. On 22 November, the clip was premiered on Network Ten's Video Hits – which had Tate as executive producer.|$|E
