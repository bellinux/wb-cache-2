5|$|The Church holds three daily prayer {{meetings}} {{during the}} week, with two meetings on Sundays and one regular consecration. On Sunday mornings, congregants {{meet at the}} temple for Sunday School, which begins with prayers and hymns. After that, the preacherusually a ministerpresides over a talk during which he reads <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> and presents the material to be covered throughout the week. During the talk, {{it is common for}} members of either sex to read a cited verse <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b> At the end of the talk, more hymns and prayers are recited and voluntary offerings are given. Sunday evening services begin with hymns and prayers, after which members of the congregation of both sexes recite <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> or sing hymns. A shorter talk is held with the aim of deepening the Sunday School's talk.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Ohio, Hensley {{returned to his}} personal ministry and held services in the area. Because he was illiterate, Bertha would read passages <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> during services, after which Hensley would deliver a sermon on a theme drawn from the verses. He also frequently preached {{on the topic of}} faith healing during this period. He remained in Ohio for several years, divorcing Amanda in 1926.|$|E

5|$|Although {{considered}} an original character, Simba {{was inspired by}} the character Bambi from Disney's Bambi (1942), as well as the stories of Moses and Joseph <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b> Additionally, several similarities have been drawn between Simba and Prince Hamlet from William Shakespeare's tragedy of the same name. In 1997, The Lion King was adapted into Broadway musical, with actors Scott Irby-Ranniar and Jason Raize originating the roles of the cub and adult Simbas, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Aramaic was {{the primary}} {{language}} of Syria and Mesopotomia, with several dialects. Syriac was in use around Antioch, {{one of the three}} largest cities of the Empire, and particularly by Christians. Syriac literature is known from the latter 2nd century, spreading from the Christian community in Edessa. Early Syriac literature was produced in a largely Greek intellectual milieu until the 4th century, but was distinctive for its use of rich symbolism and verse forms, and influenced Greek writers such as Eusebius, Basil and Theodoret. Among the earliest Syriac literature was the Diatessaron of Tatian, and translations of sections <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with Mesopotamia and Egypt, professional musicians {{did not exist}} in Israel between 2000 and 1000 BC. While the history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia and Egypt relies on artistic representations, the culture in Israel produced few such representations. Scholars must therefore rely on information gleaned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> and the Talmud. The Hebrew texts mention two prominent instruments associated with Jubal: the ugab (pipes) and kinnor (lyre). Other instruments of the period included the tof (frame drum), pa'amon (small bells or jingles), shofar, and the trumpet-like hasosra.|$|E

5|$|Later, Means and Black {{listen to}} McKenna reading a passage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b> Afterwards, McKenna reveals {{that she knows}} {{a great deal about}} the Polaroid Man who kidnapped Black weeks earlier. Means {{receives}} a vision herself during the conversation, and becomes convinced that McKenna is a prophet of some sort. Black thinks the girl is acting out, but Means reveals that she is reciting passages from the non-canonical Gnostic Gospels, which supposed that Mary Magdalene was the only disciple to fully understand the teachings of Jesus Christ. Means believes the girls are not seeing visions of Saint Mary, but of Mary Magdalene.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826, {{and soon}} {{thereafter}} his parents acquired a farm {{of their own}} to the north-west at Vaalbank, near Colesberg, in the remote north-east of the Cape Colony. His mother {{died when he was}} eight; Casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife, Heiletje (née du Plessis). Beyond reading and writing, which he learned from relatives, Kruger's only education was three months under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and Calvinist religious instruction from his father. In adulthood Kruger would claim to have never read any book apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Punic was {{spoken at}} the highest level of society: the emperor Septimius Severus (reigned 193–211) was born in Leptis Magna and spoke Punic as well as Latin and Greek, while his sister {{supposedly}} had little command of Latin at all. Augustine, who was from North Africa, several times mentions Punic; he observed that it was related to Hebrew and Syriac, and his knowledge of Punic helped him figure out transliterated Semitic words <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b>|$|E

5|$|The main {{temple in}} Houston, Texas, was {{inspired}} by Greco-Roman architecture. It is the largest temple constructed by La Luz del Mundo in the United States as of 2011. The temple's pillars resemble the Parthenon, according to religious historian Timothy Wyatt. The {{front of the building}} is decorated with carved scenes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> and three panes of stained glass also depict biblical scenes. The temple can hold 4,500 people. The interior has marble floors, glass chandeliers, and wood paneling.|$|E
5|$|Thrive (stylized as THRIVE) is {{the sixth}} studio album by American {{contemporary}} Christian music band Casting Crowns. Released on January 28, 2014 through Beach Street and Reunion Records, {{the album was}} produced by Mark A. Miller. Musically, the album, whose concept was inspired by Psalms 1 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible,</b> has a rock and contemporary Christian sound with influences from folk and bluegrass. The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics for its lyrics and musical diversity, but some critics felt that some songs were too similar {{to the work of}} other artists or to their own previous work.|$|E
5|$|Born {{near the}} eastern edge of the Cape Colony, Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s. He had almost no {{education}} apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> and, through his interpretations of scripture, believed the Earth was flat. A protégé of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected Commandant-General, a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas François Burgers.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} edition, {{published}} in 1539, Calvin dropped this format {{in favour of}} systematically presenting the main doctrines <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b> In the process, the book was enlarged from six chapters to seventeen. He concurrently worked on another book, the Commentary on Romans, {{which was published in}} March 1540. The book was a model for his later commentaries: it included his own Latin translation from the Greek rather than the Latin Vulgate, an exegesis, and an exposition. In the dedicatory letter, Calvin praised the work of his predecessors Philipp Melanchthon, Heinrich Bullinger, and Martin Bucer, but he also took care to distinguish his own work from theirs and to criticise some of their shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|In April 1876 he {{returned}} to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate. When the proprietor moved to Isleworth in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him. The arrangement did not work out and he left to become a Methodist minister's assistant. His parents had meanwhile moved to Etten; in 1876 {{he returned}} home at Christmas {{for six months and}} took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht. He was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating passages <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> into English, French and German. He immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious and monastic. According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz, Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.|$|E
5|$|In November 1909, Kenyatta {{left home}} and {{enrolled}} as a pupil at the Church of Scotland Mission (CSM) at Thogoto. He informed the British missionaries based {{there that he}} wished to learn from them. These missionaries were zealous Christians who believed that bringing Christianity to the indigenous peoples of Eastern Africa was part of Britain's civilising mission. While there, Kenyatta stayed at the small boarding school, where he learnt stories <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible,</b> and was taught {{to read and write}} in English. He also performed chores for the mission, among them washing the dishes and weeding the gardens. Several months after arriving, Kenyatta was taken ill with tuberculosis. Kenyatta was soon joined at the mission dormitory by his brother Kongo. Many of their generation were increasingly resenting the patronising way in which most of the British missionaries treated them.|$|E

5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b> Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E
5|$|The {{honor of}} {{becoming}} an altar server, was, in the past, a privilege only available to boys but has since become coed. Altar servers wear long, white, plain robes and assist the priest in his duties during the Mass. At Mt. St. Peter Church, there are four altar servers at every Mass. One is the book bearer and {{is in charge of}} bringing the Bible to the priest at the times during which the priest reads <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> during the Mass. The cross bearer holds a large, wooded crucifix and commences the procession in which the priest enters the church. Also present in the procession are the acolytes, and the book bearer. He or she also leads the procession out of the church {{at the end of the}} Mass. The last two altar servers are acolytes and are in charge of lighting the candles in the church prior to the beginning of the Mass and extinguishing them after Mass.|$|E
5|$|The {{music played}} at coronations has been {{primarily}} classical and religiously inspired. Much of the choral music uses texts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> {{which have been}} used at coronations since King Edgar's coronation at Bath in 973 and are known as coronation anthems. In the coronations following the Reformation, court musicians, often the Master of the King's Music, were commissioned to compose new settings for the traditional texts. The most frequently used piece is Zadok the Priest by George Frideric Handel; one of four anthems commissioned from him for GeorgeII's coronation in 1727. It has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece. Previous settings of the same text were composed by Henry Lawes for the 1661 coronation of CharlesII and Thomas Tomkins for CharlesI in 1621.|$|E
