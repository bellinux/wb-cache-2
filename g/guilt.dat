5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} of <b>guilt</b> and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with <b>guilt</b> when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E
5|$|Several further {{instances}} {{have been}} expounded by critics. Taum notes that Yah's <b>guilt</b> over her {{past as a}} prostitute leads her to the (unfounded) fear that Tono would leave her if their relationship were known; her <b>guilt</b> ultimately causes their separation, while Tono feels nostalgic for the past, in which he felt happier. Balfas notes that a factor driving Tono from Tini is the latter's former relationship with Hartono; due to her <b>guilt</b> over the affair, she is unable to express her love for the doctor. Siregar writes that such a theme is reflected in dialogue between Tono and Hartono, from which he suggests the novel derives its title. Balfas writes {{that there is no}} solution to the human problems presented in the novel.|$|E
5|$|Susan {{begins to}} {{withdraw}} from her friends and family out of <b>guilt</b> for having helped cover up Alejandro's death. She bonds with Carlos over their mutual <b>guilt.</b> When Mike begins suspecting Susan and Carlos are having an affair, they agree {{to tell him the}} truth about the cover-up. Soon after, Susan begins taking an art class with renowned painter, Andre Zeller (Miguel Ferrer), and discovers that her <b>guilt</b> has given her a renewed artistic ability. In a series of paintings, Susan depicts the scene of Alejandro's death and subsequent burial, arousing the suspicion of Detective Chuck Vance (Jonathan Cake), Bree's embittered ex-boyfriend assigned to investigate Alejandro's disappearance. She briefly considers moving to New York to explore new career opportunities, but ultimately decides against it. In an effort to ease her <b>guilt,</b> Susan visits Alejandro's wife and stepdaughter, Claudia (Justina Machado) and Marisa (Daniela Bobadilla), respectively, and write them a check to help their financial misfortune, which only arouses Claudia's suspicions. Claudia confronts Susan and Gabrielle about Alejandro's disappearance, but agrees to stop prying after learning that he had been sexually abusing Marisa.|$|E

5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of <b>guilt,</b> and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that <b>guilt.</b> In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E

Pike and Warren already seem convinced of Gadge's <b>guilt,</b> but Clarke remains sceptical.|$|E
5|$|In Kesselring's memoirs, he {{said that}} in Wolfsberg he was {{approached}} by a former SS major who had an escape plan prepared. According to Kesselring, he declined the offer {{on the grounds that it}} would be seen as a confession of <b>guilt.</b> Other senior Nazi figures did manage to escape from Wolfsberg to South America or Syria.|$|E

5|$|John Koller {{explains}} {{the role of}} intent in Jainism with {{the example of a}} monk, who unknowingly offered poisoned food to his brethren. According to the Jain view, the monk is guilty of a violent act if the other monks die because they eat the poisoned food; but according to the Buddhist view he would not be guilty. The crucial difference between the two views is that the Buddhist view excuses the act, categorising it as non-intentional, since he was not aware that the food was poisoned; whereas the Jain view holds the monk to have been responsible, due to his ignorance and carelessness. Jains argue that the monk's very ignorance and carelessness constitute an intent to do violence and hence entail his <b>guilt.</b> So the absence of intent does not absolve a person from the karmic consequences of <b>guilt</b> either, according to the Jain analysis.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Susan's <b>guilt</b> {{over the}} {{cover-up}} causes her {{to withdraw from}} her friends and family. Her husband, Mike Delfino (James Denton), suspects that she is unhappy in their marriage.

5|$|One of {{the chief}} {{measures}} by which Ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by the ordeal of tangena. A poison was extracted from the nut of the native tangena (Tanghinia venenifera) shrub and ingested, with the outcome determining innocence or <b>guilt.</b> If nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal, the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison's effects, while {{among members of the}} slave class (andevo), the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves. The accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin: if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared, but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated <b>guilt.</b> According to 19th-century Malagasy historian Raombana, {{in the eyes of the}} greater populace, the tangena ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith, even to the point of accepting a verdict of <b>guilt</b> in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery.|$|E

5|$|Slate critic Troy Patterson {{describes}} her as intellectually comparable to contemporary protagonists Adrian Monk and Gregory House {{due to her}} genius powers of intuition, which enable her to judge <b>guilt</b> and veracity by scales in her gut. However, Patterson compares her emotionally to Roy Lichtenstein's romantic subjects such as Drowning Girl despite her angelic swagger and chutzpah.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the accused}} Pendle witches, such as Alizon Device, seem to have {{genuinely}} believed in their <b>guilt,</b> but others protested their innocence to the end. Jennet Preston {{was the first to}} be tried, at York Assizes.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{consensus is}} that responsibility or <b>guilt</b> for the war was not attached to the article. Rather, the clause was a prerequisite to allow a legal basis to be laid out for the reparation payments that were to be made. Historians have also highlighted the unintended damage created by the clause, which caused anger and resentment amongst the German population.|$|E

5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with {{a wider range of}} themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, <b>guilt,</b> class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
5|$|Anne Whittle (Chattox) {{was accused}} {{of the murder of}} Robert Nutter. She pleaded not guilty, but the {{confession}} she had made to Roger Nowell was read out in court, and evidence against her was presented by James Robinson, who had lived with the Chattox family 20 years earlier. He claimed to remember that Nutter had accused Chattox of turning his beer sour, and that she was commonly believed to be a witch. Chattox broke down and admitted her <b>guilt,</b> calling on God for forgiveness and the judges to be merciful to her daughter, Anne Redferne.|$|E
5|$|Areas under Nri influence, called Odinani Nri, {{were open}} to Ndi Nri {{traveling}} within them to perform rituals and ensure bountiful harvest or restore harmony in local affairs.

5|$|As an anointed queen, Mary {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the power of any court to try her and refused to attend the inquiry at York personally (she sent representatives), but Elizabeth forbade her attendance anyway. As evidence against Mary, Moray presented the so-called casket letters—eight unsigned letters purportedly from Mary to Bothwell, two marriage contracts, and a love sonnet or sonnets {{said to have been}} found in a silver-gilt casket just less than one foot (30cm) long, decorated with the monogram of King Francis II. Mary denied writing them, arguing that her handwriting was not difficult to imitate, and insisted they were forgeries. They are widely believed to be crucial as to whether Mary shares the <b>guilt</b> for Darnley's murder. The chair of the commission of inquiry, the Duke of Norfolk, described them as horrible letters and diverse fond ballads, and sent copies to Elizabeth, saying that if they were genuine they might prove Mary's <b>guilt.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} patient, {{the partner}} of an injured person {{frequently}} needs support and counseling.
