40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a general and {{interactive}} approach to annotation learning 1 in NLP. Broadly, the main contribution of this work is to use machine learning in the scenarios {{where there is no}} pre-annotated data available for the target annotations that we aim to learn, but an analyst is willing to interactively teach the system with examples and guide the learning process with the knowledge he/she has. The data, however, might have some prior annotations that can be used as features for learning the new annotations. Second contribution of this work is that the approach is general enough that it can be applied to a broad range of annotation learning tasks in natural language processing. Deep linguistic features that combine several annotations such as part of speech, dependency relations and parse trees {{have been found to be}} helpful in several NLP tasks. However, these features are often handcrafted by the domainexperts after careful inspection of the labeled data and are hence domain and application specific. We propose a general approach to derive these features automatically from the annotation graph built from tokens and prior annotations present on the text. Automatic and <b>interactive</b> feature <b>engineering</b> <b>techniques</b> are used to filter out the redundant features. The user is asked the labels for instances that would help it learn the target concept faster an...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{software}} of {{a predetermined}} quality in a predictable way requires a {{deep understanding of}} the effects of software <b>engineering</b> <b>techniques</b> (such as requirements analysis techniques) in different project and organizational contexts. As a consequence, the development or improvement of software <b>engineering</b> <b>techniques</b> should include the determination of their effects in varying contexts.
