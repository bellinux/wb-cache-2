Douglas sued Ransome for libel, {{and the case}} went to the High Court in April 1913. Ransome’s counsel (Campbell) had the unabridged De Profundis read to the High Court. While the full text [...] "was so inconsistent as to be quite unreliable as evidence of anything except Wildes fluctuating state of mind while in prison .... the <b>endless</b> <b>text,</b> read out by Campbell’s junior, bored the jury and further irritated the judge. They rebelled, and the reading was broken off; but the unalterable impression that it left in everybody’s mind was that Bosie was, in Laboucheres words, a young scoundrel {{and that he had}} ruined his great friend." [...] Douglas testified that he had received the letter from Ross, but after reading Rosss cover note threw it in the fire unread. He later claimed that he had never received the package at all. Observers reported that Douglas could not bear it when he learned that the letter was addressed to him and heard its full contents. Once during the reading he simply disappeared, and was roundly rebuked by the judge. Parts of the text were published subsequently in the London papers. Ross quickly brought out another edition: The Suppressed Portion of [...] "De Profundis", to claim the copyright on Wildes work. It contained about half of the complete text.|$|E
40|$|It is a Pam Brown moment when, {{flicking}} {{through her}} "Dear Deliria", McCooey reads of 'historic butter sculptures' and hears {{at the same}} time David Bowie on the stereo singing 'yak-butter statues'. It's a Pam Brown moment because her poetry is one of incidents and coincidence. In its interest in both the quotidian and in critique, Brown's poetry illustrates the <b>endless</b> interplay between <b>texts</b> and contexts, between art and life. These latter categories are most vivid in Brown's poems when they are collapsing into each other - like drunk friends at a party...|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} an exegetical trend during {{the last several decades}} to draw <b>endless</b> {{parallels}} to <b>text</b> from the ancient Near East and beyond in an attempt to validate the writings in the Book of Mormon and Pearl of Great Price. The pioneer and leader in this effort has been the great LDS scholar Hugh Nibley. In recent years the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) has continued this legacy. The number of parallels that Nibley has been able to uncover from amazingly disparate and arcane sources is truly staggering. Unfortunately, {{there seems to be a}} neglect of any methodological reflection or articulation in this endeavor.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The many <b>endless</b> {{rivers of}} <b>text</b> now {{available}} present {{a serious challenge}} in the task of gleaning, analyzing and discovering useful information. In this paper, we describe a methodology for visualizing text streams in real-time modeled as a dynamic graph and its derived map. The approach automatically groups similar messages into “countries, ” with keyword summaries, using semantic analysis, graph clustering and map generation techniques. It handles the need for visual stability across time by dynamic graph layout and Procrustes projection techniques, enhanced with a novel stable component packing algorithm. The result provides a continuous, succinct view of evolving topics of interest. To make these ideas concrete, we describe their application to an online service called TwitterScope. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{scale of}} streaming texts presents a fundamental challenge to analyzing, visualizing and discovering useful information among the <b>endless</b> rivers of <b>text</b> available in social media. In this paper, we present an online visual search engine that efficiently handles querying and retrieval of text streams {{of interest for}} understanding streaming tweet data. With regards to the user-specified search query, the retrieved tweets are automatically categorized and summarized with semantic analysis and clustering methods. To visualize the search results, we present CompactMap, a dynamic visualization that packs tweet clusters within the display space for efficient space utilization. It also achieves a temporal coherent layout by dynamically matching the remaining clusters across time, incrementally discarding outdated clusters and incorporating newcoming clusters, thus preserving the user’s mental map. We show the effectiveness and usefulness of our system through case studies in event tracking and topic evolution monitoring in real-time. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{adaptations of}} Flaubert for {{television}} and cinema have triggered critical comment, those in radio have passed unnoticed. However, Diana Griffiths's 2006 adaptation of Madame Bovary for Radio 4 makes clear the natural affinity between radio and this novel. The intimacy of radio is pronounced. It creates its {{pictures in the}} confines of its listener's skull, allowing, with an ease theatre, television, and cinema do not have, unfettered, seemingly natural access to the thoughts and inner monologues of its characters. It is thus perfectly placed to reproduce the intimacy of Flaubert's novel and its relentless dissection of the hidden recesses of its heroine's desires, dreams, and dissatisfactions. Griffiths's adaptation also reproduces the intimacy of Flaubert's style indirect libre as John Hurt's numerous voiceovers filter themselves through the consciousness of Griffiths's characters, adopting their vocabulary and stance on life. Moreover, adapting the endlessly shifting spaces of Flaubert's novel, Griffiths translates nineteenth century Normandy into the space of modern British radio. In so doing she pushes her audience to consider the question of national space in the adaptive process, a space all too often overlooked by adaptation theorists but which may usefully be read using the insights of translation theorists such as Antoine Berman. Griffiths's piece, though, not only explores the interior space of characters' minds and probes the exterior spaces their bodies inhabit, so too, like Flaubert, does it consider the space of its own artistry. Griffiths's adaptation points to the aspects of the Flaubertian text which it cannot adapt, giving a paradoxical place to that which is no longer there. As Emma is unable to access the ontology of either her being or her desires {{as a result of the}} obfuscating and <b>endless</b> veils of <b>texts</b> from which she has adapted them, so Griffiths's adaptation plays with its inability to access Flaubert's novel in any complete sense. Both novel and radio adaptation find artistic life in the reproduction of earlier sources. Playing self-reflexively on their own use of the déjà connu, both works ask their audience to recognize in their adaptive fictions the earlier sources which bring creative life but which can never fully be grasped...|$|R
