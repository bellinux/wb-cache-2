40|$|This {{research}} adopts Bayesian multilevel models using annual state panel data {{to investigate}} the change in welfare caseloads spanning the period from 1977 to 2003, with {{particular attention to the}} impact of state welfare reforms on caseloads in the post-TANF era. This paper starts with generating TANF policy indices by state and by year on a two-dimensional policy space—namely, that the first dimension captures the <b>eligibility</b> <b>policy</b> and the second dimension summarizes the flexibility policy. These two indices are used as a proxy for state TANF programs in my following data analysis. Three major findings in this paper are as follows: first, while the <b>eligibility</b> <b>policy</b> is negatively associated with caseloads, the flexibility policy is positively associated with caseloads. Second, although both economic and policy factors can explain substantive shares of the caseload decline in the mid 1990 s, these two factors cannot explain any share of the caseload decline in the most recent years. Third, the raises of minimum wages and EITC rates by the federal government also help reduce welfare caseloads...|$|E

40|$|Beginning {{in the mid}} 1980 s and {{extending}} through the early to mid 1990 s, {{a substantial number of}} women and children gained eligibility for Medicaid through a series of income-based expansions. Using natality data from the National Center for Health Statistics, we estimate fertility responses to these eligibility expansions. We measure changes in state Medicaid <b>eligibility</b> <b>policy</b> by simulating the fraction of a standard population that would qualify for benefits. From 1985 to 1996, the fraction of women aged 15 to 44 who were eligible for Medicaid coverage for a pregnancy increased on average by 24 percentage points.

40|$|We {{exploit the}} {{existence}} of substantial variation in state policies toward public health insurance for children between 1990 and 2002 to estimate {{the economic and political}} determinants of state eligibility levels. Controlling for state and year effects, eligibility levels are not significantly associated with either the percentage of uninsured children in the state or the <b>eligibility</b> <b>policy</b> of neighboring states; further, variation in eligibility levels within state is negatively associated with both the federal matching rate and state fiscal capacity. We also observe that state political preferences, measured by the Democrats ’ share of seats in the lower chamber of the state legislature, are a relatively important a determinant of state eligibility levels. However, other political factors, such as party control of state government, voter turnout, legislative term limits and campaign finance regulations do not influence state eligibility levels...|$|E

The results indicate that performance prediction can be improved by using detailed high school information; that prediction of performance needs to be supported by operational processes; and fully understanding the outcome of the advising system depends on recording its results.

40|$|The core {{purpose of}} this review is to {{evaluate}} <b>eligibility</b> <b>policy</b> and operations and to develop recommendations in both areas for the KHPA Board. This review describes and assesses Medicaid eligibility rules and eligibility policies, {{as well as the}} critical components of the eligibility determination process: Operations, Automated Systems and Program Integrity. Since the Medicaid program targets low-income populations, the report also includes information that describes poverty in Kansas, and state and federal minimum wage levels (Appendix C and D). Future reviews will focus on enrollment, with an evaluation of historic changes in enrollment and performance and outcomes for the Medicaid enrollment process. To participate in the Kansas Health Policy Authority’s (KHPA) public health insurance programs, a person must be determined to be eligible. Staff at the KHPA or Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) review a consumer’s application for medical coverage and decide if the person is eligible based on certain criteria. Public health insurance coverage is available through three primary programs; Medicaid, SCHIP (or HealthWave 21) and MediKan, as well as several smaller targeted programs. These programs provide a payment source for services to meet the health care needs of the poor elderly, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, children, ver...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{investigates the}} factors that {{underlie}} large variation in Medic-aid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) policies among states. Both eli-gibility and provider payment policies are examined for low-income children and parents. I find that state variation {{in the cost of}} providing health care, due to variation in the intensity of health care use, is a key determinant of <b>eligibility</b> <b>policies,</b> and I also find tentative evidence of an effect for payment policies. Because rising health care spending increases the cost of providing health insurance coverage, state policy mak-ers in high-spending states enact less generous Medicaid and CHIP policies. Results also indicate that the political environments of states are very important in determining their <b>eligibility</b> <b>policies,</b> but fewer political variables influence payment policies. In addition to including variables not yet examined in the context of Medicaid policy, this study uses an innovative measure of state-level health care spending and carefully con-structed dependent variables that lend credibility to causal interpretations of relationships...|$|R
40|$|Plagued by {{criticism}} for its athletes being deemed too young and fragile, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) increased its minimum age <b>eligibility</b> <b>policy</b> for Olympic gymnasts from 15 to 16 in 1997 {{in an attempt}} to shift media perceptions of the sport in a more positive direction, lengthen gymnasts' careers, and prevent injuries and burnout. Utilising framing theory, this study sought to determine how US-based newspapers portrayed Olympic gymnasts' age and physical appearance over the course of eight Olympic Games, how these portrayals changed over time, and whether coverage changed after the FIG's minimum age rule increase. US newspaper articles from every Olympics from 1984 through 2012 were analysed using qualitative document analysis methodology. Results revealed changes over time coinciding with the minimum age rule implementation. Portrayals of age shifted, with younger gymnasts being described as children and kids in the earlier years of the study and as teens or women in the later years, although language used in quotes by national sport organisations was found to perpetuate the stereotype of gymnasts as children. Regarding physical appearance, height and weight were focused on in the earlier years and excluded from coverage in the later years, although these aspects re-emerged in 2008 due to the intense scrutiny surrounding the Chinese women's team, who were involved in an age falsification controversy. The results illustrated the powerful framing function of the media, how those outside the media can influence frames, and how controversial issues can impact media portrayals. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{the effects}} of {{students}} playing sports in high school vary but results are mostly positive. This qualitative case study examined the perceptions of 15 teachers at a small rural Iowa high school to assess how they viewed the effects of sports participation on student athletes in the classroom and why the setting experienced a decline in participation numbers. The framework that drove this study was based on Pajares 2 ̆ 7 s concept that teacher expectations may influence students and their academic performance and behaviors. The data included individual interviews from 15 teachers and teacher/coaches who had a minimum of 5 years teaching experience and had student athletes in their classrooms. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed for emergent themes. Findings revealed that increased academic performance, learned leadership traits, and teamwork were the perceived benefits to sports participation. Missed class time and stressful time requirements on student athletes were the perceived detriments. Findings also indicated that a need for more cohesiveness better and communication between teachers and teacher/coaches, and a need for higher eligibility standards for student athletes to participate in athletics. These findings were used to develop a policy recommendation project that will update and overhaul the district 2 ̆ 7 s current athletic <b>eligibility</b> <b>policy.</b> This project will enable more students to participate in athletics and remain eligible for sports participation and additional tutoring. Social change could result from increased participation in athletics, improved academic performance, and greater cohesion among teachers at the school...|$|E
