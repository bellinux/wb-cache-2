60|$|Donovan {{went to the}} <b>hind</b> <b>wheel</b> {{and looked}} up at James Williams.|$|E
60|$|Holly stepped {{upon the}} hub of a <b>hind</b> <b>wheel</b> of the grub wagon and hung the hat upon a limb of a live-oak. Scarcely had his foot touched the ground when the crash of a dozen six-shooters split the air, and the hat {{fell to the ground}} riddled with bullets.|$|E
60|$|Half-way {{down the}} grade I felt, sir, a thrilling and creaking, Then a lurch to one side, as we {{hung on the}} bank of the ca√±on; Then, looking up the road, I saw, in the {{distance}} behind me, The off <b>hind</b> <b>wheel</b> of the coach just loosed from its axle, and following.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he heard}} the cry--a seamew's call--repeated thrice at intervals, and five minutes later {{something}} loomed {{out of the darkness}} quite close to the <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> of the cart.|$|R
50|$|One of his stunt cars was Maude the Motor Mule. Repp {{could pull}} a lever, causing a heavy weight beneath {{the car to}} move forward or {{backward}} - shifting the car's center of gravity and making it rear up on its <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> or front wheels.|$|R
6000|$|... "She's full of fight, {{and she can}} do it. See {{that hard}} {{formation}} {{right there on the}} inside wall. It couldn't have come at a better spot. If I don't make her <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> climb half way up it, we'll start walking about a second thereafter." ...|$|R
60|$|Kurt {{stepped aside}} {{and took a}} quick shot at the tire of Nash's left <b>hind</b> <b>wheel.</b> He missed. His heart sank {{and he was like}} ice as he risked another. The little {{high-power}} bullet struck and blew the tire off the wheel. Nash's car lurched, skidded into the bank not thirty yards away.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had just}} {{completed}} this reflection when, turning a corner, he came on a large van standing stockstill {{at the top of}} an incline. The driver was leaning idly against the <b>hind</b> <b>wheel</b> filling a pipe. Mr. Lavender glanced at the near horse, and seeing that he was not distressed, he thus addressed the man: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Half-way {{down the}} grade I felt, sir, a thrilling and creaking, [...] Then a lurch to one side, as we {{hung on the}} bank of the canyon; [...] Then, looking up the road, I saw, in the {{distance}} behind me, [...] The off <b>hind</b> <b>wheel</b> of the coach, just loosed from its axle, and [...] following.|$|E
60|$|The ground fliers of Marentina contain just {{sufficient}} buoyancy {{in their}} automobile-like wheels {{to give the}} cars traction for steering purposes; and though the <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> are geared to the engine, and aid in driving the machine, the bulk of this work is carried by a small propeller at the stern.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Set 'em {{out near}} the <b>hind</b> <b>wheels,</b> child, that's the best place,' said their friend, superintending the {{arrangements}} from above. 'Now hand up the teapot {{for a little}} more hot water, and a pinch of fresh tea, and then both of you eat and drink as much as you can, and don't spare anything; that's all I ask of you.' ...|$|R
60|$|But it was {{all over}} in a second. The horse bolted {{straight}} ahead. Barney swerved the roadster to the turn. It caught the animal full in the side. There was a sickening lurch as the <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> slid over the embankment, and then the man shoved the girl from the running board to the road, and horse, man and roadster went over into the ravine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said I to myself, [...] "she {{is doing}} that because she likes it, and it is none of my business." [...] I gazed over the fields {{on the other side}} of the road, but as I passed her I could not help giving a glance at her machine. The air was gone from the tire of the <b>hind</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, my dear Watson. The {{more deeply}} sunk {{impression}} is, of course, the <b>hind</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{upon which the}} weight rests. You perceive several places where it has passed across and obliterated the more shallow mark of the front one. It was undoubtedly heading away from the school. It {{may or may not}} be connected with our inquiry, but we will follow it backwards before we go any farther." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A threadbare and venerable device, but useful upon occasion. I {{walked into}} the doctor's yard this morning, and shot my syringe full of aniseed over the <b>hind</b> <b>wheel.</b> A draghound will follow aniseed from here to John o'Groat's, and our friend, Armstrong, would have to drive through the Cam before he would shake Pompey off his trail. Oh, the cunning rascal! This is how {{he gave me the}} slip the other night." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Bowen's horses were, perhaps, pampered {{beyond the}} {{habitual}} resignation of Florentine horses to {{all manner of}} natural phenomena; they reared at sight of the sable crew, and backing violently uphill, set the carriage across the road, with its <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> {{a few feet from}} the brink of the wall. The coachman sprang from his seat, the ladies and the child remained in theirs as if paralysed.|$|R
60|$|The gray {{roadster}} swerved {{toward the}} embankment as the <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> skidded {{on the loose}} surface gravel. They were at the turn. The horse was just abreast the bumper. There was one chance in a thousand of making the turn were the running beast out of the way. There was still a chance if he turned ahead of them. If he did not turn--Barney hated {{to think of what}} must follow.|$|R
6000|$|Somewhat doggedly, but {{anxious to}} get out of her predicament, Miss Calthea took her {{position}} at the wheel and put one foot upon an almost horizontal spoke. Ida did the same, and then giving the word, both women raised themselves from the ground; Mrs. Cristie gave a great pull, and shouted, [...] "Back!" [...] and as the <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> began slowly to revolve, the astonished horse, involuntarily obeying the double impulse thus given him, backed a step or two.|$|R
6000|$|I was here, accordingly, {{thrown out}} at {{the sign of the}} [...] "Crow" [...] (by which tavern the coach {{happened}} to be passing), without meeting with any farther accident than the breaking of both my arms, under the left <b>hind</b> <b>wheel</b> of the vehicle. I must besides do the driver the justice to state that he did not forget to throw after me the largest of my trunks, which, unfortunately falling on my head, fractured my skull in a manner at once interesting and extraordinary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now jump in, Mrs. Cristie," [...] said Ida, [...] "and when I {{give the}} word {{you pull the}} reins with all your might, and shout 'Back!' at him. Miss Rose, you go to that <b>hind</b> <b>wheel,</b> and I will go to this one. Now put one foot on a spoke, so, and take hold of the wheel, and when I say 'Now!' we will both raise {{ourselves}} up and put our whole weight on the spoke, and Mrs. Cristie will pull on him at the same instant." ...|$|E
60|$|That ended it. All knew Lime. Everybody {{had heard}} {{how he could}} lift {{one end of the}} {{separator}} and toss a two-bushel sack filled with wheat over the <b>hind</b> <b>wheel</b> of a wagon, and the terror of his kick was not unknown to them. They all felt sure that the Yohes would not return, and all went back into the house and attempted to go on with the games. But it was impossible; such exciting events must be discussed, and the story was told and retold by each one.|$|E
6000|$|In {{some places}} the <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> are taken off, and sledge runners are fitted to the hind axletree. This is an {{excellent}} plan; it has the further advantage that the wagon settles down into a more horizontal position than before. I have seen timber carried on a wagon down a steep hill by separating the front <b>wheels</b> from the <b>hind</b> ones, lashing a trail (see [...] "Travail" [...] below) or two short poles to the fore axletree, and resting {{one end of the}} timber on the hind axletree, and the other end on the trail.|$|R
60|$|At last it was done--no easy task, for the numbed {{hands of}} the Kaffirs could {{scarcely}} loosen the frozen reims. The wagons were outspanned {{side by side with}} a space between them, and into this space the mob of thirty-six oxen was driven and there secured by reims tied crosswise from the front and <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> of the wagons. Then the White Man crept back to his bed, and the shivering natives, fortified with gin, or squareface, as it is called locally, took refuge on the second wagon, drawing a tent-sail over them.|$|R
60|$|The mercy was, {{that the}} violent shock from the coach did not tear off our wheel; for {{if this had}} been done, J----, and {{probably}} I also, must have fallen under the <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> of the coach, and in all likelihood been killed. We have since learned that the coachman had only just come upon the road, which is in a great many places very dangerous, and that he was wholly unpractised in driving four-in-hand. Pray excuse this long and minute account. I should have written to you next day, but I waited, hoping to be able to add that my indisposition was gone, as I now trust it is.|$|R
6000|$|One of {{the heavy}} waggons, which had been delayed behind the others by some trifling accident, came lumbering up just as Hans spoke. There was a softish sandy spot in advance of it, into {{which one of the}} front wheels plunged. The tilt caught on part of the waggon to which Ruyter belonged. To prevent damage the active Hottentot sprang forward. In doing so he tripped and fell. At the same instant a {{tremendous}} crack of the whip and a shout produced a wrench at the waggon, the <b>hind</b> <b>wheel</b> of which went over Ruyter's head and crushed it into the ground! ...|$|E
60|$|Brackton's {{ramshackle}} establishment stood {{down at the}} end of {{the village}} street. There was not a sawed board in all that structure, and some of the pine logs showed how they had been dropped from the bluff. Brackton, a little old gray man, with scant beard, and eyes like those of a bird, came briskly out to meet an incoming freighter. The wagon was minus a <b>hind</b> <b>wheel,</b> but the teamster had come in on three wheels and a pole. The sweaty, dust-caked, weary, thin-ribbed mustangs, and the gray-and-red-stained wagon, and the huge jumble of dusty packs, showed something of what the journey had been.|$|E
60|$|The moon {{came out}} and shone high as Yuba Bill once more took the reins in his hands. The wind, which {{instantly}} attacked them {{as they reached the}} level, seemed to make the driver's theory plausible, and for half a mile the roadbed was swept clean, and frozen hard. Further on a tongue of snow, extending from a boulder to the right, reached across their path to the height of two or three feet. But Yuba Bill dashed through a part of it, and by skillful maneuvering circumvented the rest. But even as the obstacle was passed, the coach dropped with an ominous lurch on one side, and the off fore wheel flew off in the darkness. Bill threw the horses back on their haunches; but, before their momentum could be checked, the near <b>hind</b> <b>wheel</b> slipped away, the vehicle rocked violently, plunged backwards and forwards, and stopped.|$|E
60|$|Slowly {{turning the}} horse toward the yard gate, which Plez stood holding open, her whole soul was {{absorbed in the}} act of guiding the {{equipage}} through the gateway. Quickly glancing from side to side, and then at the horse's back, which ought to occupy a medium position between the two gateposts, she safely steered the front wheels through the dangerous pass, although a grin of delight covered the face of Plez as he noticed that the hub of one of the <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> almost grazed a post. Then the observant boy ran on to open the other gate, and with many jerks and clucks, Miss Annie induced the sorrel to break into a gentle trot.|$|R
6000|$|As May came near, {{her brother}} made her {{available}} {{by putting the}} lamp into her hand, bidding her hold it so as to light those who were endeavouring to release the horse, which had cleared {{the portion of the}} bridge before the break-down under the brougham, and now lay on the road, its struggles quelled by a servant at its head. Nearly the whole of the <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> and most of the door had disappeared on one side, and, though more was visible on the other, it was impossible to open the door, as a mass of rubbish lay on it. Annaple was on this side, and her voice was heard calling to May in fits of the laughter which is perhaps near akin to screams-- ...|$|R
60|$|The {{sentence}} of death finally passed upon Pierre, the son of Jean Adet, miller of Vertou, could not, however, be executed, {{for the simple reason}} that Pierre had disappeared and that the most rigorous search instituted in the neighbourhood and for miles around failed to bring him to justice. One of the outriders who had been in attendance on Mademoiselle on that fateful night declared that when Jean-Marie finally whipped up his horses at the approach of the party of soldiers, Adet fell backwards from the step of the carriage and was run over by the <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> and instantly killed. But his body was never found among the score or so which were left lying there in the mud of the road until the women and old men came to seek their loved ones among the dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{had good}} taste, that Englishman," [...] went on Swart Piet. [...] "Well, now our account is squared; he has sown and I shall harvest. Follow me, you black fellows, for we had best be off," [...] and, stooping down he lifted Suzanne {{in his arms}} and walked away with her as though she were a child. For a while they {{followed}} the windings of the stream, keeping under cover of the reeds and bushes that grew upon its banks. Then they struck out to the right, taking advantage of a cloud which dimmed the face of the moon for a time, for they wished to reach the kloof without being seen from the waggon. Nor, indeed, were they seen, for the driver and voorlooper were seated by the cooking-fire on its further side, smoking, and dozing as they smoked. Only the great thoroughbred horse winded them and snorted, pulling at the riem with which he was tied to the <b>hind</b> <b>wheel</b> of the waggon.|$|E
6000|$|At that supreme {{moment it}} came across {{him that he}} would have done wiser to dismount. He gave a frantic 'whoop' and tried to get round, then, as he seemed falling over, he pulled the handles {{straight}} again and to the left by an instinctive motion, and shot behind her <b>hind</b> <b>wheel,</b> missing her by a hair's breadth. The pavement kerb awaited him. He tried to recover, and found himself jumped up on the pavement and riding squarely at a neat wooden paling. He struck this with a terrific impact and shot forward off his saddle into a clumsy entanglement. Then he began to tumble over sideways, and completed the entire figure in a sitting position on the gravel, with his feet between the fork and the stay of the machine. The concussion on the gravel shook his entire being. He remained in that position, wishing that he had broken his neck, wishing even more heartily that he had never been born. The glory of life had departed. Bloomin' Dook, indeed! These unwomanly women! ...|$|E
60|$|We shot {{over the}} brow and flew madly {{down the hill}} with the great red coach roaring and thundering before us. Already we were in her dust, {{so that we could}} see nothing but the dim scarlet blur in the heart of it, rocking and rolling, with its outline {{hardening}} at every stride. We could hear the crack of the whip in front of us, and the shrill voice of Lady Lade as she screamed to the horses. My uncle was very quiet, but when I glanced up at him I saw that his lips were set and his eyes shining, with just a little flush upon each pale cheek. There was no need to urge on the mares, for they were already flying at a pace which could neither be stopped nor controlled. Our leader's head came abreast of the off <b>hind</b> <b>wheel,</b> then of the off front one--then for a hundred yards we did not gain an inch, and then with a spurt the bay leader was neck to neck with the black wheeler, and our fore wheel within an inch of their hind one.|$|E
60|$|Davies took a {{rifle and}} strolled back with so ominous an air that the lone cavalryman put spurs to {{his horse and}} fled. Mrs. Morgan was helped out and sent plodding and tottering unaided {{on her way to}} the end of the sand stretch. Miss Drexel and Juanita joined Charley in {{spreading}} the coats and robes on the sand and in gathering and spreading small branches, brush, and armfuls of a dry, brittle shrub. But all three ceased from their exertions to watch Wemple as he shot the car backward down the V and up. The car seemed first to stand on one end, then on the other, and to reel drunkenly and to threaten to turn over into the sump-hole when its right front wheel fell into the air where the road had ceased to be. But the <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> bit and climbed the grade and out.|$|R
60|$|A valley full {{of wheat}} and cherry-trees succeeded, and halting at a house, we bought ten-pound weight of luscious black {{cherries}} for {{something less than}} a rupee, and got a drink of icy-cold water for nothing, while the untended team browsed sagaciously by the road-side. Once we found a way-side camp of horse-dealers lounging by a pool, ready for a sale or a swap, and once two sun-tanned youngsters shot down a hill on Indian ponies, their full creels banging from the high-pommelled saddle. They had been fishing, and were our brethren, therefore. We shouted aloud in chorus to scare a wild cat; we squabbled over the reasons that had led a snake to cross a road; we heaved bits of bark at a venturesome chipmunk, who was really the little gray squirrel of India, and had come to call on me; we lost our way, and got the wagon so beautifully fixed on a khud-bound road {{that we had to}} tie the two <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> to get it down.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next morning}} our fort was plann'd and mark'd out, the {{circumference}} measuring {{four hundred and}} fifty-five feet, which would require as many palisades {{to be made of}} trees, one with another, of a foot diameter each. Our axes, of which we had seventy, were immediately set to work to cut down trees, and, our men being dexterous in the use of them, great despatch was made. Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to look at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine; in six minutes they had it upon the ground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter. Each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long, pointed at one end. While these were preparing, our other men dug a trench all round, of three feet deep, in which the palisades were to be planted; and, our waggons, the bodies being taken off, and the fore and <b>hind</b> <b>wheels</b> separated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch,[105] we had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the palisades from the woods to the spot. When they were set up, our carpenters built a stage ...|$|R
