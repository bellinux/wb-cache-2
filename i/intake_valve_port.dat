5000|$|The {{engine was}} a modern unit, with a {{water-cooled}} inline design with forged crankshaft, alloy cross-flow head and five main bearings. An unusual feature on early models was {{the absence of}} a spin-on paper oil filter. Instead, the engine featured a form of centrifugal oil filter in the hollow rear crankshaft pulley, although all later versions used the more traditional disposable cartridge filters. One of its major innovations was the use of a swirl vortex on the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> <b>port</b> which gave very good combustion, and thus both power and economy for this time. This engine proved cheap to build, and several models of different sizes and market segments used this displacement, which survived until 1982, as the ever-present entry level for the Simca 1100.|$|E

40|$|Air {{motion in}} a {{cylinder}} of a {{spark ignition engine}} affects the air-fuel mixing behavior, combustion quality {{and the production of}} the exhaust gas emission. With upcoming stringent market regulations for petrol engines, it is necessary to enhance air-fuel mixing for proper combustion. Air-fuel mixing in an engine combustion chamber is studied by assessing the induced air flow swirl motion. Swirl is a rotational motion of a bulk mass within cylinder. Swirl is generated by shaping and contouring the <b>intake</b> manifold, <b>valve</b> <b>ports</b> and even the piston face. Swirl enhances air-fuel mixing and helps to spread flame-front during combustion. The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze the impact of the asymmetric <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> lift configurations towards in-cylinder air flow swirl behavior. The study is done on 4 cylinders, 1. 3 L engine. The engine has 2 <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> in every cylinder. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used as a tool to assess the swirl motion in the case study models. At the end of this paper, the characteristics of the swirl flow motion on every case study models is studied by measuring the swirl ratio value inside the combustion chamber. Also, the pattern of the swirling flow inside the combustion chamber is studied by analyzing the velocity vector and turbulent kinetic energy plots...|$|R

5000|$|The {{cylinder}} heads were another fundamental {{change of the}} Magnum engine, being designed to meet stricter requirements in both power and emissions by increasing efficiency. These heads were cast iron units with new wedge-shaped combustion chambers and high-swirl valve shrouding. Combustion chamber design was most important in these new heads: LA engine {{cylinder heads}} were given a full-relief open-chamber design, but the Magnum was engineered with a double-quench closed-chamber type. The higher-flowing intake ports stepped up intake flow dramatically {{in comparison to the}} original LA heads, and the exhaust ports improved cylinder evacuation as well. The shape and porting of the chambers allowed for more complete atomization of the air/fuel mixture, as well as contributing to more complete combustion; these virtues allowed for much greater efficiency of the engine as a whole. The <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>valves</b> were located at the top of each combustion chamber. The valves themselves had shorter, 5/16" [...] diameter stems, to allow for the more aggressive camshaft. <b>Intake</b> <b>valves</b> had a <b>port</b> diameter of 1.92", while exhaust valves were 1.65". with 60cc combustion chambers.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 7 th March 2018. Flow {{coefficients}} of <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> and <b>port</b> combinations were determined experimentally for a compressed nitrogen engine under steady-state and dynamic flow conditions for inlet pressures up to 3. 2 MPa. Variable valve timing was {{combined with an}} indexed parked piston cylinder unit for testing valve flows at different cylinder volumes whilst maintaining realistic in-cylinder transient pressure profiles by simply using a fixed area outlet orifice. A one-dimensional modelling approach describing three-dimensional valve flow characteristics has been developed {{by the use of}} variable flow coefficients that take into account the propagation of flow jets and their boundaries as a function of downstream/upstream pressure ratios. The results obtained for the dynamic flow cases were compared with steadystate results for the cylinder to inlet port pressure ratios ranges from 0. 18 to 0. 83. The deviation of flow coefficients for both cases is discussed using pulsatile flow theory. The key findings include: 1. For a given valve lift, the steady-state flow coefficients fall by up to 21 percent with increasing cylinder/manifold pressure ratios within the measured range given above; 2. Transient flow coefficients deviated from those measured for the steady-state flow as the valve lift increases beyond a critical value of approximately 0. 5 mm. The deviation can be due to the insufficient time of the development of steady state boundary layers, which can be quantified by the instantaneous Womersley number defined by using the transient hydraulic diameter. We show {{that it is possible to}} predict deviations of the transient valve flow from the steady-state measurements alone...|$|R

30|$|In a port-fuel-injected engine, {{the fuel}} is {{generally}} injected at {{the backside of}} a closed <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> {{to take advantage of}} the warm <b>valve</b> and <b>port</b> surfaces for vaporization [22, 23, 24]. However, a large part of the injected spray is deposited on the intake manifold surfaces and forms a layer of liquid film on the <b>valve</b> and <b>port</b> surfaces. The film needs to be re-atomized by the shearing airflow as the <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> open. If these fuel layers are not well atomized, they enter the cylinder as drops and ligaments [25, 26, 27]. These phenomena occur in varying degrees and depend upon the engine design, injector location and engine operation. Previous experiments on the same engine fuelled by gasoline and BU 20 demonstrated that the injector sprayed the fuel towards the plate between the <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> and on the <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> stems [28, 29, 30]. The droplet impingement induced fuel layer formation on the intake manifold walls. The fuel layers were drawn by gravity to the valve head and gap, where they remained as film due to surface tension. The stripping of the squeezed fuel film created fuel deposits on the optical window. When the injection occurred in open-valve condition, part of the droplets was carried directly into the combustion chamber by the gas flow. These droplets, sucked in the combustion chamber, stuck on the cylinder walls. In both injection conditions, the fuel deposits on the combustion chamber walls created fuel-rich zones on the piston surfaces that influenced the composition of the mixture charge and, hence, the combustion process. During the normal combustion process, only a fraction of the fuel deposits was completely burned. Thus, more fuel should be injected to reach the selected air-fuel ratio measured at the exhaust [23].|$|R

5000|$|Early <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closing (EIVC)Another way to {{decrease}} the pumping losses associated with low engine speed, high vacuum conditions is by closing the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> earlier than normal. This involves closing the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> midway through the intake stroke.

40|$|Increasing {{concerns}} over energy security and stricter legislation on automotive exhaust emission limits have triggered greater efforts in utilizing alternatives to petroleum-based fuels. Compressed natural gas (CNG) {{is one of}} the promising candidates in terms of emissions and price. In this paper, methane, the major constituent of natural gas (NG), in used to fuel a Ricardo E 6 engine and run in a port injection operation with open-valve and close-valve injection. The compression ratio is set at 10. 5 : 1. Methane at 30 bar was supplied to the injector and injection length was adjusted to achieve the desired air fuel ratio (AFR). The minimum advance for best torque (MBT) was determined for 1100 rpm speed by measuring the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) for combustion at spark advance between 14 °CA and 35 °CA BTDC. The result is clearly demonstrated that the performance of the open <b>valve</b> <b>port</b> injection (OVPI) is superior to the one of the close <b>valve</b> <b>port</b> injection (CVPI) with better IMEP, fuel conversion efficiency, indicated power and volumetric efficiency. The observation indicates that OVPI shows steadiness of peak pressures shifts toward top dead centre (TDC) as spark ignitions were advanced compared to CVPI. In terms of combustion characteristics, the OVPI operation yields shorter ignition delay and overall burning duration even at the same phasing angle. Therefore, the open valve operation is preferable for NG port injection {{due to the fact that}} injections take place while <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> is open. It accelerates the charge flow into the cylinder causing higher volumetric efficiency and avoiding the back pressure that happen when high pressure methane is injected while <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closes...|$|R

In the last decade, gasoline engines equipped with indirect injection systems, wherein a fuel injector delivers the fuel at some point before the <b>intake</b> <b>valve,</b> have mostly fallen out of favor to direct injection. However, certain manufacturers such as Volkswagen and Toyota have developed a 'dual injection' system, combining direct injectors with port (indirect) injectors, combining the benefits of both types of fuel injection.
