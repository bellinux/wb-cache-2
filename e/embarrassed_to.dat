5|$|The government's {{financial}} woes also continued. Hawes was <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> {{admit that}} {{neither he nor}} anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from Columbus to Memphis, Tennessee during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky. Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was too <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> leave the water.|$|E
5|$|One {{scene that}} von Stroheim re-shot at the studio's insistence {{depicted}} a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is too <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> examine {{the teeth of}} a young woman and Potter has to take over. A thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the audience would see a resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it. Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director wanted to have a knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gibson Gowland's head. Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to allow such a dangerous stunt. A special-effect shot was used instead.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the overall}} Vietnamese {{military}} performance {{was not as}} successful as Định's guerrilla activities. On June 5, 1862, Định broke with the Nguyễn army after the court's plenipotentiary Phan Thanh Giản and another official, Lam Duy Hiep, signed the Treaty of Saigon. This agreement ceded the three southern provinces of Gia Định, Định Tường and Biên Hòa to France; they became the colony of Cochinchina. The treaty was accompanied by financial payments to France, religious concessions to missionaries and commercial opportunities for European merchants. Militarily, {{the withdrawal of the}} Nguyễn army deprived the resistance of the logistical support that could be provided by a regular force. It also permitted the French to concentrate their efforts against a single antagonist. Politically, the treaty provided, for those Vietnamese who needed one, a legal basis to collaborate with the French on Cochinchinese soil. As a result, the colonial forces found it easier to recruit militia and administrative personnel among Vietnamese who had been too afraid or too <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> serve the French openly before the 1862 treaty. Định then allied himself with Võ Duy Dương to form the Movement of Popular Self Defense (Phong Trao Nhan Dan Tu Ve), creating an operations base in Đồng Tháp.|$|E

25|$|Western society {{tends to}} {{perceive}} breasts in sexual terms instead of for their biological purpose. This view led many {{to object to}} breastfeeding because of the implicit association between infant feeding and sex. Many women feel <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> breast-feed in public. These negative cultural connotations may reduce breastfeeding duration.|$|E

25|$|Hayworth {{resented the}} fact that the studio had failed to train her to sing or even to {{encourage}} her to learn how to sing. Although she appeared to sing in many of her films, she was usually dubbed. Because the public did not know her secret, she was <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> be asked to sing by troops at USO shows.|$|E
25|$|Louis {{was under}} no {{delusion}} {{about the state}} of his boxing skills, yet he was too <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> quit after the Walcott fight. Determined to win and retire with his title intact, Louis signed on for a rematch. On June 25, 1948, about 42,000 people came to Yankee Stadium to see the aging champion, who weighed 213½, the heaviest of his career to date. Walcott knocked Louis down in the third round, but Louis survived to knock out Walcott in the eleventh.|$|E
25|$|Weekes {{took his}} sole Test wicket in this series. In the First Test at Sabina Park, Kingston, with Australia {{requiring}} just 20 runs {{in their second}} innings to win the Test, Weekes opened the bowling and had Arthur Morris caught by Glendon Gibbs. The Australians were surprised {{at the level of}} racism evident throughout the West Indies at the time, and were <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> find that Weekes, Worrall and Walcott had not been invited to a cocktail party at the home of a white West Indian player.|$|E

25|$|There {{are areas}} {{of his life}} and daily routine that Keats does not describe. He {{mentions}} little about his childhood or his financial straits and is seemingly <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> discuss them. There is a total absence of any reference to his parents. In his last year, as his health deteriorated, his concerns often gave way to despair and morbid obsessions. The publications of letters to Fanny Brawne in 1870 focused on this period and emphasised this tragic aspect, giving rise to widespread criticism at the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Ghanaian women deliver {{at home with}} a traditional birth attendant and are referred to the hospital in cases of complicated labor. Although most deliveries are attended by a traditional birth attendant, most women prefer to deliver with a health professional. Barriers to obtaining professional health care include high costs, inadequate transportation, long distances to health care facilities, and poor road conditions. Some women were also too <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> go to a hospital because they did not have nice clothes and preferred to deliver at home where no one could see that they were poor.|$|E
25|$|Many {{respondents}} who {{never used the}} library cited embarrassment or {{lack of knowledge about}} available information as reasons. Even those that did frequent the library often said that they were too <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> ask for help; many expected shocked reactions or outright homophobia from librarians. Some common complaints about library collections from those who did use them were that information was negative, outdated or difficult to find. Whitt concluded that more staff training was needed to address these perceptions. She also found that those {{respondents who}} regularly used a college or university library had a more positive experience finding needed information than those who used only the public library.|$|E

25|$|A failed two-year {{relationship}} with Australian model Helena Vestergaard, {{who was only}} 19 when they began dating in 2012 (he was 50), served as {{a major influence on}} his songwriting for the band's 2016 album, The Getaway which often has Kiedis questioning their relationship and the age difference between the two. “Lyrically, I’m <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> say, but a two-year relationship that completely fell apart like a nuclear bomb just left me feeling pretty raw and available to the emotional universe for writing. So even though the relationship {{was a bit of a}} disaster, I feel that in some way I did get something out of it, which was about half the songs on this record,” Kiedis said.|$|E
25|$|Two Confederate blunders aided Rosecrans. Breckinridge, on {{the east}} side of the river, did not realize that Crittenden's early morning attack had been withdrawn. He refused to send two brigades as {{reinforcements}} across the river to aid the main attack on the left. When Bragg ordered him to attack to his front—so that some use could be made of his corps—Breckinridge moved forward and was <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> find out that there were no Union troops opposing him. At about that time, Bragg received a false report that a strong Union force was moving south along the Lebanon Turnpike in his direction. He canceled his orders that Breckinridge send reinforcements across the river, which diluted the effectiveness of the main attack.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Maria Pavlovna {{visited her}} son Lennart {{and his family}} in Mainau. They bonded over their shared {{interest}} in photography and she got along with his wife, even though the grand duchess had been disappointed when her son renounced his royal status in order to marry a commoner in 1932. Maria Pavlovna, who had little maternal feelings, took no interest in her two grand daughters: Birgitta, then four years old and Marie Louise age two. She asked Lennart to call her by her name as she felt <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> have such a grown up son. Thanks to Lennart, the King of Sweden, who sympathized with Maria Pavlovna, arranged a Swedish diplomatic passport for her to replace her old Nansen passport. This gave her a broader freedom of movement.|$|E

25|$|As {{the play}} begins, Valentine is {{preparing}} to leave Verona for Milan so as to broaden his horizons. He begs his best friend, Proteus, to come with him, but Proteus {{is in love with}} Julia, and refuses to leave. Disappointed, Valentine bids Proteus farewell and goes on alone. Meanwhile, Julia is discussing Proteus with her maid, Lucetta, who tells Julia that she thinks Proteus is fond of her. Julia, however, acts coyly, <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> admit that she likes him. Lucetta then produces a letter; she will not say who gave it to her, but teases Julia that it was Valentine's servant, Speed, who brought it from Proteus. Julia, still unwilling to reveal her love in front of Lucetta, angrily tears up the letter. She sends Lucetta away, but then, realising her own rashness, she picks up the fragments of the letter and kisses them, trying to piece them back together.|$|E
25|$|Yonakor {{grew up in}} the Dorchester {{neighborhood}} of Boston, Massachusetts, the youngest son of immigrants from lithuania. At the age of 10, he came down with a leg infection after cutting himself while ice skating. He was too <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> tell his mother about the injury and hoped it would go away, but it worsened {{to the point where he}} could no longer walk. Doctors drained fluid from his body by puncturing his toe, and Yonakor spent a year as an invalid; doctors told him he may never walk again. Starting out by crawling, however, Yonakor gradually regained his strength and his health. He went on to play three seasons of football at Mechanic Arts High School, and spent one year at Marianapolis Preparatory School in Thompson, Connecticut at the prompting of Frank Leahy, then the head football coach at Boston College. Yonakor was set to go to Boston College, but chose the University of Notre Dame instead when Leahy became head football coach there in 1941.|$|E
500|$|The first Tchaikovsky opera {{to survive}} intact, The Oprichnik, premiered in 1874. During its composition, he lost Ostrovsky's part-finished {{libretto}}. [...] Tchaikovsky, too <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> ask for another copy, {{decided to write}} the libretto himself, modelling his dramatic technique on that of Eugène Scribe. Cui wrote a [...] "characteristically savage press attack" [...] on the opera. Mussorgsky, writing to Vladimir Stasov, disapproved of the opera as pandering to the public. Nevertheless, The Oprichnik continues to be performed {{from time to time}} in Russia.|$|E
