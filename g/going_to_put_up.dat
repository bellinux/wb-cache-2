500|$|The {{next morning}} gay leaders convened in a {{committee}} {{room in the}} Civic Center. Supervisor Harry Britt, who had replaced Milk, along with the more militant gays of the Harvey Milk Democratic Club, {{made it clear that}} nobody was to apologize for the riots. Britt informed a press conference, [...] "Harvey Milk's people do not have anything to apologize for. Now the society {{is going to have to}} deal with us not as nice little fairies who have hairdressing salons, but as people capable of violence. We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with Dan Whites anymore." [...] Reporters were surprised that a public official would condone the violent acts of the previous night, expecting an apology from Britt. Subsequent attempts to find a gay leader who would give an apologetic statement proved unsuccessful.|$|E

[...] Vince Horiuchi of The Salt Lake Tribune suggested that this film should have been made 30 years ago by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell, while instead [...] "the Hansel and Gretel we’re left with runs out of its magic potion far too early to let us enjoy its wicked possibilities." [...] A more positive comparison to Raimi and Campbell's Army of Darkness was made by Pete Vonder Haar of the Houston Press, who gave it three out of five [...] "witch hazels" [...] and wrote: [...] "I'm not sure if witches are the next vampires/zombies, or if the hinted-at franchise potential has any legs, but this was a perfectly vulgar way to spend 90 minutes." [...] Tim Grierson of Screen International wrote that Hansel and Gretel [...] "works best as an unapologetic B-movie action flick" [...] and [...] "feels like a first film in a franchise that’s meant to set up the main characters and conflicts, which can then be fleshed out in sequels" [...] but [...] "the problem is that there isn't enough here to warrant a return trip to this semi-magical land." [...] Richard Corliss of TIME agreed with this sentiment, stating that [...] "one might be enough — too much, for some tastes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jim Sullivan, {{the local}} Official IRA commander, {{feared that the}} troops would launch a bigger raid and {{instructed}} his men to move weapons out of the area. At about 6pm, Provisional IRA volunteers attacked the troops with improvised hand grenades. A number of soldiers suffered leg injuries. As more troops arrived, [...] "the Officials realized {{that they would have}} to fight" [...] and Sullivan ordered his men to confront the troops. An Official IRA source later said, [...] "The way we looked at it, we were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> our hands and let them take the weaponry. We didn't want the confrontation, but we couldn't surrender". One source said that 60–70 Official IRA volunteers were involved, while another said 80–90. Each was armed with a rifle and at least one revolver. They exchanged fire with the troops and attacked them with grenades. Hundreds of local youths also pelted the troops with stones and petrol bombs. Journalist Simon Winchester later wrote:To anyone who experienced the battle, it was perfectly obvious that hundreds and hundreds of bullets were being fired by both sides – and yet the Army had the gall, when asked by reporters later in the weekend, to say that its soldiers fired only 15 shots in sum. The official figures were to be published later: soldiers in the Falls that weekend fired no less than 1,457 rounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} SK Hwy 35 from the Canada–United States border to Weyburn forms the initial {{segment of the}} CanAm Highway. [...] The terrain is mixed prairie featuring rolling moraines and valleys. [...] North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA super corridors are a concept of huge transportation corridors connecting Mexico, United States, and Canada. [...] The CanAm highway was a concept begun in the 1920s. This area has been subject to criticism as the entry way to Canada of this route.

SK Hwy 35 achieved a dishonorable mention in the Canadian contest entitled 'Highways from Hell'.

'Truckers from my constituency tell me that the U.S. Customs officials say they are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with the mud that is coming across on the trucks.

'Highways 6 and 39 are very important to Saskatchewan – serving as tourism links and major north-south trade corridors to the U.S.,' Sonntag said. [...] "Highway 35 from Wadena South is always an adventure. I have found my driving skills have improved immensely {{especially when it comes to}} emergency braking and swerving to avoid the many areas of broken pavement. This past spring the Dept. of Highways could have saved thousands in signage costs if they only had put up warning signs where the road was smooth and unbroken."

5000|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} to be as inoffensive as possible to prove the point that not all video games were corrupting influences. Penn Jillette commented in his radio show that the overly realistic nature of the game was in response to Janet Renos comments in support of the moral panic about violent video games at the time (see Video game controversies).
