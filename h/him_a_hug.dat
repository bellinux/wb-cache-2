5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the school}} year, Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The {{competition}} is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>hug</b> and tells him to return next year. The film ends with a freeze-frame shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air.|$|E
25|$|Van Barneveld {{began the}} 2013 World Championship by {{throwing}} the sixth highest {{average in the}} history of the tournament in his first round 3–0 defeat of Michael Smith. In a match that lasted only 18 minutes he averaged 108.31 as he never looked in danger of exiting the tournament at the first hurdle for the second successive year. He beat Brendan Dolan 4–1, Gary Anderson 4–0 and Simon Whitlock 5–1 to reach the semi-finals where he faced Phil Taylor. Before the match Van Barneveld commented that he wasn't scared of Taylor and wanted to face him rather than Taylor's quarter-final opponent Andy Hamilton. Van Barneveld was 1–5 down in the match and almost staged a superb fightback as he won three successive sets to trail only 4–5. However, Taylor won the next set by three legs to one to take the match. The pair were involved in an angry confrontation after the match. Taylor reacted angrily when Van Barneveld pulled him back after their handshake, with both men being escorted away separately by security staff. Van Barneveld stated later that he was only trying to congratulate Taylor in a sportsmanlike way and give <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>hug.</b> Taylor apologised for his behaviour a day later.|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, 2010, Armando Galarraga was {{pitching}} a perfect {{game against the}} Cleveland Indians with 2 outs {{in the top of}} the ninth inning when first base umpire Jim Joyce made a controversial call, ruling Jason Donald safe at first. Video replay showed he was out. A tearful Joyce later said [...] "I just cost that kid a perfect game. I thought he beat the throw. I was convinced he beat the throw, until I saw the replay." [...] Later Galarraga told reporters Joyce apologized to him directly and gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>hug.</b> The next day, with Joyce umpiring home plate, Galarraga brought out the Tigers lineup card and the two hugged again. Despite large fan support for overturning the call, commissioner Bud Selig let the call stand, but said he would look into expanding instant replay for the future.|$|E

2500|$|In November of the 2008–2009 season, O'Neal {{told reporters}} that he {{believed}} the entire feud has been {{the fault of the}} Lakers head coach Phil Jackson. O'Neal later retracted the statement and apologized, interrupting one of Jackson's pre-game interviews to give <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>hug</b> and a kiss on the cheek. On January 29, 2009, in an interview with Stephen A. Smith, O'Neal claimed that the feud between him and Bryant was simply a marketing ploy, saying [...] "We helped you hype it up. I know what I'm doing, brother. I'm the smartest player in the world." [...] On Bryant, O'Neal claimed that he [...] "always did love Kobe." [...] On Jackson, O'Neal claimed he is [...] "the greatest coach ever. And he's done a lot for me. Phil's my guy. It's all marketing, baby." [...] O'Neal also added that had he stayed with the Lakers, he and Bryant would have won another three or four titles. [...] "We're still the greatest little-man, big-man 1-2 punch ever created {{in the history of the}} game", O'Neal said. At the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, O'Neal, Bryant, and Jackson were all reunited on the West squad. O'Neal and Bryant were both named co-MVPs for the game and were shown laughing and hugging during the game. O'Neal told Bryant to keep the MVP trophy, but Bryant instead gave it to O'Neal's son. For O'Neal, Bryant's gesture marked a turning point in their relationship. Bryant and the Lakers would go to face the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals. Shaq showed support for Kobe, on his Twitter page saying: [...] "thats right i am saying it today and today only, i want kobe bryant to get number 4, spread da word [...] ".|$|E
