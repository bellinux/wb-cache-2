40|$|This chapter reports an {{exploratory}} {{study conducted by}} the authors on the role of note-taking, drafting, mapping, and outlining in learning strategies for argumentative writing and speaking. Previous research has highlighted the epistemic function of <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> in content learning. Further investigation is needed, however, in order to explore the role of writing in supporting strategic learning in argumentative discourse. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the positive influence on the quality of written and oral argumentation of an intervention about strategic <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> for argumentation. In particular, we expected that students who attended four workshops on <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> would show greater improvement in their argumentative performances than students who were involved in curricular activities about written and oral argumentation. The participants were 124 secondary students attending either 11 th or 12 th grade, and were assigned either to the writing to argue group or to the argumentative discourse group. Participants were administered pre- and post-intervention tests to analyze their performances in argumentative speaking and writing, using several indices of quality. Multivariate analyses of variance revealed a significant effect of the intervention about <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> for argumentation on the quality of persuasive essay writing, and a moderate effect on the quality of debate speaking. Instruction in <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> for argumentation thus has the potential to influence the learning of strategies for argumentative writing and speaking, especially when strategic <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> support the use of cognitive and metacognitive strategies...|$|R

Other authors have investigated this relationship by exerting some time pressure. In this paper, I report on an attempt to do the opposite, i. e., to enforce a longer reflection time. To ensure that subjects do not just wait but actually think for five minutes, they had to perform a five minutes focused <b>free</b> <b>writing</b> task. <b>Free</b> <b>writing</b> is a standard method adopted from creative writing courses; subjects are asked to write up everything that currently runs through their minds, without pausing. Enforced reflection significantly decreases the number chosen in beauty contest experiments, thus increasing the winning probability, and it increases the amount given in the solidarity game. For women, this increase is economically and statistically significant. The average amount offered in the ultimatum game is not higher for those who had performed the <b>free</b> <b>writing</b> task.

40|$|The {{three years}} of Doctoral Program were devoted to the {{exploration}} of the role of note-taking, drafting, mapping, and outlining in learning strategies for argumentative writing and speaking in secondary school students. The successful performance in argumentative discourse tasks is expected {{at the end of the}} secondary school all over the world. In spite of these expectations, though, what researchers have been observing for decades are the difficulties encountered by students in performing academic writing and speaking tasks. Moreover, further investigation is needed in order to explore the role of writing in supporting strategic learning in argumentative discourse. Therefore, under the supervision of professor Lerida Cisotto, the doctoral student designed a series of exploratory studies and developed an intervention about writing strategies for argumentation, with the aim to improve the argumentative discourse processes and products of the students involved. The aim of the two studies reported here was to investigate the positive influence on the quality of written and oral argumentation of an intervention about strategic <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> for argumentation. In particular, students who attended four workshops on <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> were expected to show greater improvement in their argumentative performances than students who were involved in curricular activities about written and oral argumentation. The participants were 124 secondary students attending either 11 th or 12 th grade, and were assigned either to the Writing for argumentative discourse group or to the Practising for argumentative discourse group. Participants were administered pre- and post-intervention tests to analyze their performances in argumentative speaking and writing, using several indices of quality. Multivariate analyses of variance revealed a significant effect of the intervention about <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> for argumentation on the quality of persuasive essay writing, and a moderate effect on the quality of debate speaking. The actual use of strategic <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> during argumentative <b>writing</b> and speaking has also been explored. Findings indicate that instruction in <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> for argumentation has the potential to influence the learning of strategies for argumentative writing and speaking, especially when strategic <b>writing</b> <b>tools</b> support the use of metacognitive and self-regulation strategies...|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} article (Smith, 2001), the author investigated {{the relationship between}} the lexical richness of <b>free</b> <b>writing</b> and the holistic score ratings awarded to the <b>free</b> <b>writing</b> samples. The present study aims to investigate {{the relationship between the}} lexical richness of <b>free</b> <b>writing</b> and the English proficiency levels of the subjects who produced the <b>free</b> <b>writing</b> samples. The subject population and the lexical richness data are identical to those which appeared in the author's previous study. Both studies were designed to complement and extend Laufer and Nation's pioneering work (1995) in these fields of research, particularly with respect to the choice of subject population. Whereas Laufer and Nation's study assembled subject populations with low intermediate and intermediate levels of English proficiency, the author's two studies gathered subjects whose English proficiencies lie in the intermediate-advanced-native speaker ranges. The present study was designed to provide some complementary analysis of the relationship between English proficiency and the data yielded by the Lexical Frequency Profile (LFP), Laufer and Nation's tool for measuring lexical richness in <b>free</b> <b>writing.</b> Laufer and Nation argue in their 1995 article that, since it is widely assumed that a richer vocabulary knowledge is an inherent part of higher levels of general proficiency, one measure of the validity of the LFP is its ability to discriminate among writers of broadly different L 2 English proficiency levels. Their analysis shows that the LFP discriminates clearly among three groups of L 2 English writers at low intermediate to intermediate levels of general proficiency. This study investigates to what extent the LFP continues to discriminate among English proficiency levels within a subject population which has higher levels of proficiency than those reported in the Laufer and Nation article. The main finding of the study is that the LFP discriminates significantly between the low proficiency group and the high proficiency group, but does not discriminate significantly between the middle proficiency group and the high proficiency group. This suggests that, within the context of <b>free</b> <b>writing,</b> some qualifications need to be made to the assumed association between a richer vocabulary knowledge and higher levels of general proficiency...|$|R
