40|$|AbstractThere is a {{need for}} rules {{allowing}} three-dimensional structure information to be derived from protein sequences. In this work, consideration of an elementary protein <b>folding</b> <b>step</b> allows protein sub-sequences which optimize folding to be derived for any given protein sequence. Classical mechanics applied to this system and the energy conservation law during the elementary <b>folding</b> <b>step</b> yields an equation whose solutions are taken over the field of rational numbers. This formalism is applied to beta-sheets containing two edge strands and at least two central strands. The number of protein sub-sequences optimized for folding per amino acid in beta-strands is shown in particular to predict edge strands from protein sequences. Topological information on beta-strands and loops connecting them is derived for protein sequences with a prediction accuracy of 75 %. The statistical significance of the finding is given. Applications in protein structure prediction are envisioned such as for the quality assessment of protein structure models...|$|E

40|$|Essentially all {{proteins}} {{known to}} fold kinetically in a two-state manner have their N- and C-terminal secondary structural elements in contact, and the terminal elements often dock {{as part of}} the experimentally measurable initial <b>folding</b> <b>step.</b> Conversely, all N–C no-contact proteins studied so far fold by non-two-state kinetics. By comparison, about half of the single domain proteins in the Protein Data Bank have their N- and C-terminal elements in contact, more than expected on a random probability basis but not nearly enough to account for the bias in protein folding. Possible reasons for this bias relate to the mechanisms for initial protein folding, native state stability, and final turnover...|$|E

Most of the experimental work has focused on whether the protein folds via an intermediate, but the evidence is mostly limited to relatively slow kinetic observations with a few structural probes.

We find that each probe yields different kinetics and compare these observations with a Markov State Model constructed from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and find a complex network of states that yield different kinetics for different observables.

40|$|Substrate {{sequences}} surrounding catalytic RNAs but {{not involved}} in specific, conserved interactions can severely interfere with in vitro ribozyme activity. Using model group II intron precursor transcripts with truncated or randomized exon sequences, we show that unspecific sequences within the 5 ' exon are particularly prone to inhibit both the forward and the reverse first splicing step (branching). Using in vitro selection, we selected efficient 5 ' exons for the reverse branching reaction. Precursor RNAs carrying these selected 5 ' exons reacted more homogeneously and faster than usual model precursor transcripts. This suggests that unfavorable structures induced by the 5 ' exon can introduce a <b>folding</b> <b>step</b> that limits the rate of in vitro self-splicing.

Structures of mutant chaperone-subunit complexes revealed a final folding transition (condensation of the subunit hydrophobic core) on the release of organelle subunit from the chaperone-subunit pre-assembly complex and incorporation into the final fibre structure. However, in view of the large interface between chaperone and subunit in the pre-assembly complex and the reported stability of this complex, it is difficult to understand how final folding could release sufficient energy to drive assembly. In the present paper, we show the X-ray structure for a native chaperone-fibre complex that, together with thermodynamic data, shows that the final <b>folding</b> <b>step</b> is indeed an essential component of the assembly process. We show that completion of the hydrophobic core and incorporation into the fibre results in an exceptionally stable module, whereas the chaperone-subunit preassembly complex is greatly destabilized by the high-energy conformation of the bound subunit.

The behavior of the first band basically depends on the geometry of the outer folded SIR. The second band, however, is strongly influenced by the presence of the inner stub.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that in eukaryotic cells molecules of one protein can be located in several subcellular locations, a phenomenon termed dual targeting, dual localization or dual distribution. The differently localized identical or nearly identical proteins are termed echoforms. Our conventional definition of dual targeted proteins refers to situations in {{which one of the}} echoforms is translocated through/into a membrane. Thus, dual targeted proteins are recognized by at least one organelle's receptors and translocation machineries within the lipid bilayer. In this review we attempt to evaluate mechanisms and situations in which protein folding is the major determinant of dual targeting and of the relative distribution levels of echoforms in the subcellular compartments of the eukaryotic cell. We show that the decisive <b>folding</b> <b>step</b> can occur prior, during or after translocation through the bilayer of a biological membrane. This phenomenon involves folding catalysts in the cell such as chaperones, proteases and modification enzymes, and targeting processes such as signal recognition, translocation through membranes, trapping, retrotranslocation and reverse translocation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Atomic-level {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{are widely used}} for the characterization of the structural dynamics of proteins; however, they are limited to shorter time scales than the duration {{of most of the}} relevant biological processes. Properly designed coarse-grained models that trade atomic resolution for efficient sampling allow access to much longer time-scales. In-depth understanding of the structural dynamics, however, must involve atomic details. In this study, we tested a method for the rapid reconstruction of all-atom models from α carbon atom positions in the application to convert a coarse-grained folding trajectory of a well described model system: the B domain of protein A. The results show that the method and the spatial resolution of the resulting coarse-grained models enable computationally inexpensive reconstruction of realistic all-atom models. Additionally, by means of structural clustering, we determined the most persistent ensembles of the key <b>folding</b> <b>step,</b> the transition state. Importantly, the analysis of the overall structural topologies suggests a dominant folding pathway. This, together with the all-atom characterization of the obtaine...|$|E
40|$|The {{renaturation}} of the bifunctional enzyme aspartokinase II-homoserine dehydrogenase II {{has been}} studied by using the reappearance of its two activities. The same kinetics of renaturation are obtained for the dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 3) and the kinase activity (EC 2. 7. 2. 4). The mechanism of refolding of the enzyme apparently involves two steps, a <b>folding</b> <b>step</b> occurring within a monomer and a subsequent dimerization step. The reappearance of the two activities depends on this dimerization step, suggesting that monomeric species are inactive. A proteolytic fragment possessing full dehydrogenase activity is shown {{to be able to}} renature, as judged by the recovery of its activity. In this case also, the refolding depends on the formation of dimeric species. However, the refolding of this fragment is much faster than that of the dehydrogenase region in the intact enzyme. These results suggest that, although the dehydrogenase region can refold by itself when isolated as a fragment, refolding of this same region in the whole protein involves interactions with the remainder of the protein...|$|E
