In contrast non-state visits are variously described as audiences, someone being received by the Pope, or simply a visit.

That night, May and Clarkson removed chairs, interior trim and panels, along with the windows and other components, until their cars were reduced to being basic shells, while Hammond, who had grown attached to his car, was reluctant to do so, and instead chose to remove only the spare tyre it carried and an unspecified part. Prior to them leaving, the trio received an <b>informal</b> <b>visit</b> by Seretse Ian Khama, the then-Vice President of the country, who was impressed with the trio's plans to drive across the pans, but not so with their cars. Crossing the pans on the first of two days travel, the trio progress was steady, until both Clarkson and May discovered that their cars were digging into the Pan's surface, forcing them to call for assistance from the film crew and support team in getting them out and cleaning out their wheels of [...] "prehistoric gunk", before stripping their cars of further components including the doors and the boot lid. Despite further issues with the surface, it eventually became firmer, allowing them to reach one of the Pan's islands and their next campsite. On the second day, the trio learned that they would encounter a dust storm, which presented a major issue for May and Clarkson, as exposed to it, they were forced to re-dress themselves to avoid choking; much to their annoyance, Hammond had no need to take such measures. After overcoming the storms, despite suffering from it, Clarkson then found himself breaking down twice and having to repair his Lancia.

While not originally conceived as a research project, the systematic collection of participant feedback and recording of changes to practice as a result of the visits reflect an action research approach. The article considers the challenges presented by this deceptively simplistic formula. It reviews the inter- and intra-institutional and cross-sector collaborative process required to initiate and sustain the programme and evaluate the feedback received. It outlines ways in which insights arising from the programme are feeding into practice around vocational progression to HE including continuing professional development and enhanced collaboration...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact of a {{regulated}} society such as the Netherlands on the lives of refugees in general and on those of Iranian women refugees in particular. Two periods are distinguished in regard to Dutch asylum policies: the 1980 s and post- 1990. For the 1980 s when refugee reception was less restricted, I use empirical material collected between 1995 and 2000. The women I interviewed during this period were leftist activists involved in the Iranian revolution of 1979 and had to leave Iran because of their political backgrounds. The material used for the post- 1990 or more restricted period, is mainly from secondary sources, supplemented by occasional, <b>informal</b> <b>visits</b> to asylum seeker centres. The paper argues that a strict refugee policy - especially the policy that was put in place during the 1990 s - has a direct effect on the affected refugees by making them dependents of the state. These restricted policies reinforce the image of refugees as problems in society and have an effect, albeit less direct, on the lives of the refugees who arrived prior to the 1990 s and who are now Dutch citizens. © The Author [2005].

More than that, a Greek Catholic priest came regularly to his house to teach his sons French, and a leading Maronite literary figure of the day, Abdallah al-Bustani, tutored his daughter Anbara in Arabic language and literature.
