5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E

25|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{justified}} in {{assuming that the}} scope of the generalization 'All ravens are black' can be restricted to ravens, then this means that we have some outside information which we can rely on concerning the factual situation. The paradox arises from the fact that this information, which colors our spontaneous view of the situation, is not incorporated in the usual treatments of the inductive situation.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Aix-les-Bains is {{directly}} related to the Lac du Bourget and especially to its hot springs which made it a spa among the most renowned in the world.

25|$|I {{hope the}} discussions {{outlined}} {{in these pages}} {{have shown that the}} data of anthropology teach us a greater tolerance of forms of civilization different from our own, that we should learn to look on foreign races with greater sympathy and with a conviction that, as all races have contributed in the past to cultural progress in one way or another, so they will be capable of advancing the interests of mankind <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> only willing to give them a fair opportunity.|$|E
25|$|The dialogue, {{somewhat}} unusually, {{does not}} set {{itself as a}} re-telling of the day's events.

25|$|In {{environmental}} terms, reuse {{ought to}} be more common than recycling and energy recovery, with both the financial and environmental costs of simple refurbishment of some products being a fraction of original manufacturing costs. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to be serious about living in a Circular Economy we need to recognise the value of our waste and ensure resources are kept in the economy for longer, slow down the use of valuable raw materials and ensure that products are reused and materials are recycled rather than landfilled.|$|E

25|$|Vicarious trauma affects workers being 'witnesses' {{to their}} clients' trauma. It {{is more likely}} to occur in {{situations}} where trauma related work is the norm rather than the exception. Listening with empathy to the clients generates feeling, and 'seeing oneself' in clients' trauma may compound the risk for developing trauma symptoms. May also result <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> witness to situations that happen in the course of our work (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent video tapes, etc). Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of seeking protective factors and pre-preparation of preventive strategies.|$|E
