40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was two-fold: firstly to perform a {{critical}} analysis of the VAT amendments, relevant to municipalities as introduced by the Small Business Amnesty and Amendment of <b>Taxation</b> <b>Laws</b> Act No. 9 of 2006 with effect from 1 July 2006. Secondly, to perform exploratory practical research by means of a custom-designed questionnaire. The aim of the questionnaire was to assess whether or not the potential problems, as identified by the critical analysis, may be prevalent in practice. Six municipalities, mostly metropolitan (metros) provided their responses to this questionnaire. The study has indicated that the VAT amendments and transitional provisions were generally well received by municipalities. However, there appears to be an indication that the training on the VAT amendments received by municipalities may not have been effective. This may be an area for consideration <b>for</b> future <b>taxation</b> <b>laws</b> amendment and implementation process. Moreover, the initial cost, effort and time required by the taxpayers to implement the VAT amendments has shown to be onerous. Further research is needed to establish whether or not the VAT amendments will continue to be beneficial to the municipalities in the upcoming fiscal-years.

Similar penalties applied under relevant legislation in respect of earlier years, for example ss 163 A and 163 B of the IT AA 36.

The penalty is known as the failure to lodge penalty.

50|$|The Swedish Riksdag {{is made up}} of 349 MPs, and all {{are elected}} through {{proportional}} representation on multi-member party lists that are either regional (most major parties) or national (Sweden Democrats). Each of the 29 constituencies has a set number of parliamentarians that is divided through constituency results to ensure regional representation. Then the other MPs are elected through a proportional balancing to ensure that the numbers of elected MPs for the various parties accurately represent the votes of the electorate. The Swedish constitution (1974:152) 1 Ch. 4 § says that the Riksdag is responsible <b>for</b> <b>taxation</b> and making <b>laws,</b> and 1 Ch. 6 § says that the government is held responsible to the Riksdag. In other words, this means that Sweden has parliamentarism in a constitutional monarchy—ensuring that the government is appointed by the people's representatives and the Prime Minister is therefore indirectly elected.|$|R

40|$|A common {{feature of}} {{taxation}} compliance policies is {{the existence of}} a formal penalty regime <b>for</b> <b>taxation</b> offences. This article investigates whether the level of non-compliance with <b>taxation</b> <b>laws</b> by taxpayers from selected Anglo-Saxon countries including Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom may have been affected by either the introduction of new criminal taxation offences or the imposition of heavier sanctions <b>for</b> existing criminal <b>taxation</b> offences. By examining taxpayer compliance theory and the Annual Reports of Revenue Authorities and other Regulatory Agencies, the study reveals that the level of taxpayer noncompliance in these selected Anglo–Saxon countries is neither directly nor solely affected by the presence or increase in criminal taxation penalties alone. Consequently, it is submitted that the imposition and increase in criminal taxation penalties should perhaps be considered as only one part of an overall effective tax compliance policy...|$|R
