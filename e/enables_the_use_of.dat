5|$|Fabry-Pérot etalons {{are widely}} used in telecommunications, lasers and {{spectroscopy}} to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In telecommunications, wavelength-division multiplexing, the technology that <b>enables</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> multiple wavelengths of light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering devices that are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the single one of interest.|$|E

25|$|Protective films can {{be applied}} to the inner surface of copper alloy tubes to {{increase}} corrosion resistance. For certain applications, the film is composed of iron. In power plant condensers, duplex tubes consisting of an inner titanium layer with outer copper-nickel alloys are employed. This <b>enables</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> copper’s beneficial mechanical and chemical properties (e.g., stress corrosion cracking, ammonia attack) along with titanium’s excellent corrosion resistance. A duplex tube with inner aluminium brass or copper-nickel and outer stainless or mild steel can be used for cooling in the oil refining and petrochemical industries.|$|E
25|$|The Galil {{is fed from}} a curved, steel box {{magazine}} with a 35-round capacity (SAR and AR versions), a 50-round capacity (ARM model) or a special color-coded 12-round magazine blocked for use exclusively with ballistite (blank) cartridges, used to launch rifle grenades. The magazine is inserted front end first {{in a similar manner}} to the AK family. An optional magazine adaptor <b>enables</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> M16 type STANAG magazines. Some who have used the Galil ARM with the 50-round magazine have noted {{that it is difficult to}} engage targets at elevated heights while firing on the ground in the prone position due to the magazine's extended length.|$|E
25|$|In certain situations, the Galois group acts {{on other}} {{mathematical}} objects, for example a group. Such a group is then {{also referred to}} as a Galois module. This <b>enables</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> group cohomology for the Galois group Gal(F), also known as Galois cohomology, which in the first place measures the failure of exactness of taking Gal(F)-invariants, but offers deeper insights (and questions) as well. For example, the Galois group G of a field extension L / F acts on L×, the nonzero elements of L. This Galois module plays a significant role in many arithmetic dualities, such as Poitou-Tate duality. The Brauer group of F, originally conceived to classify division algebras over F, can be recast as a cohomology group, namely H2(Gal (F), ×).|$|E

25|$|The core idea of ReadyBoost {{is that a}} {{flash memory}} (e.g. a USB flash drive or an SSD) have a much faster seek time than a typical {{magnetic}} hard disk (less than 1ms), allowing it to satisfy requests faster than reading files from the hard disk. It also leverages the inherent advantage of two parallel sources from which to read data, whereas Windows 7 <b>enables</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> up to eight flash drives at once, allowing up to nine parallel sources. USB 2.0 flash drives are slower for sequential reads and writes than modern desktop hard drives. Desktop hard drives can sustain anywhere from 2 to 10 times the transfer speed of USB 2.0 flash drives but are equal to or slower than USB 3.0 and Firewire (IEEE 1394) for sequential data. USB 2.0 and faster flash drives have faster random access times: typically around 1ms, compared to 12ms for mainstream desktop hard drives.|$|E
500|$|To {{address these}} {{business}} concerns, an aspect weaver <b>enables</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> widely adopted languages like Java with aspect-oriented programming through minor adaptations such as AspectJ which work with existing tools. Instead of developing {{an entirely new}} language, the aspect weaver interprets the extensions defined by AspectJ and builds [...] "woven" [...] Java code which can then be used by any existing Java compiler. This ensures that any existing object oriented code will still be valid aspect-oriented code and that development will feel like {{a natural extension of}} the object-oriented language. The AspectC++ programming language extends C++ through the use of an aspect weaver, offering the additional efficiency over AspectJ that is necessary for embedded systems while still retaining the benefits of aspect-oriented programming.|$|E

O-27 track is spaced at the same width as regular O gauge track, but is slightly shorter in height and has thinner rails than traditional O gauge track.

The handguards were also changed and the bipod removed. The SG 551 cannot be used with a bayonet or fire rifle grenades. The SG 551 comes in several specialized variants designed for use with security and special forces. Among those variants are the SG 551-1P police carbine (designed to engage point targets out to 300 m; equipped with a Hensoldt 6x42 BL telescopic sight and detachable cheek riser), the SG 551 SWAT carbine (coated with a corrosion-resistant finish and equipped with an optical sight mount used with {{a wide array of}} sights, and can also accept mission-critical accessories such as a bipod, laser pointer or tactical light) and the SG 551 LB carbine with an extended [...] barrel that <b>enables</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> rifle grenades and a bayonet.|$|E

2500|$|Hillsong is {{affiliated}} with Australian Christian Churches (the Assemblies of God in Australia), which belongs within the Pentecostal tradition of Christianity. The church's beliefs are Evangelical and Pentecostal in that it holds the Bible as the truth and authoritative in matters of faith. They believe that Jesus Christ is God Incarnate, and the only begotten Son of the Father, who reconciled humanity to God through his death and resurrection. The church believes forgiveness for the wrong we've done and being part of God's family can only be achieved through repenting of our wrongdoing, believing in Jesus as your Lord and saviour, and submitting to his will for our lives. They believe {{that in order to}} live a fruitful Christian life a person should, among other things, seek the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and that the Holy Spirit <b>enables</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> spiritual gifts, which includes, and is not limited to, speaking in tongues.|$|E
