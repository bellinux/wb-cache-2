25|$|Some {{species of}} birds have gone extinct in recent times, {{including}} the pink-headed duck (Rhodonessa caryophyllacea) and the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>quail</b> (Ophrysia superciliosa). A species of warbler, Acrocephalus orinus, known earlier from a single specimen collected by Allan Octavian Hume from near Rampur in Himachal Pradesh was rediscovered after 139 years in Thailand. Similarly, the Jerdon's courser (Rhinoptilus bitorquatus), named after the zoologist Thomas C. Jerdon who discovered it in 1848, was rediscovered in 1986 by Bharat Bhushan, an ornithologist at the Bombay Natural History Society after being thought to be extinct.|$|E

5000|$|Andrew Sugden, {{reviewing}} Extinct Birds in the London Review of Books, {{notes that}} Fuller set out [...] "to find {{at least one}} drawing, painting or lithograph: many by the great 19th-century illustrator J.G. Keulemans, a couple (great auk and <b>Himalayan</b> mountain <b>quail)</b> by Edward Lear. He also embellishes the historical account where possible with portraits of the sailors, explorers and naturalists who recorded (and sometimes helped to extinguish) a species and biographical snippets about them - all of which provides an important context for the extinctions themselves. Most of these species vanished, of course, before we had film of sufficient speed for wildlife photography", he found little to say {{about some of the}} species, [...] "the lives and deaths of many species having passed almost unnoticed (which makes it all the more remarkable that Fuller was able to unearth so many pictures)", and contrasts this 18th century situation with what happens now, when there is often a mass of data on vanishing species.|$|R
50|$|Sidney Dillon Ripley (1952) records a local bird name sano kalo titra ("small black/dusky partridge") {{from the}} Dailekh {{district}} of Nepal. The only bird {{from the general}} area that seems to fit such a description would be a male <b>Himalayan</b> <b>quail.</b>|$|E
50|$|The book's covers are {{illustrated}} by montages of South Asian birds, painted by Anderton. Volume 1 features crimson-backed flameback, stork-billed kingfisher, Indian eagle-owl, black-and-orange flycatcher and <b>Himalayan</b> <b>quail</b> on its front cover. Volume 2 features six laughingthrush species: variegated, Bhutan, grey-sided, blue-winged, black-chinned and Assam. The back covers of both volumes feature {{a painting of}} Serendib and Nicobar scops-owls.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>quail</b> (Ophrysia superciliosa) or {{mountain}} quail is {{a medium-sized}} quail {{belonging to the}} pheasant family. It was last reported in 1876 and is feared extinct. This species was known from only 2 locations (and 12 specimens) in the western Himalayas in Uttarakhand, north-west India. The last verifiable record was in 1876 near the hill station of Mussoorie.|$|E
5000|$|All {{records of}} the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>quail</b> are in the {{altitude}} range of 1,650 to 2,400 m. They were seen in patches of tall grass ("high jungle grass", [...] "tall seed-grass", see terai) and brushwood on steep hillsides, particularly on the crests of south- or east-facing slopes. It probably bred around September. The June specimen is a yearling male in moult.|$|E
50|$|About 315 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} in this ecoregion from tiny warblers to large pheasants such as the western tragopan (Tragopan melanocephalus), satyr tragopan (Tragopan satyra), koklass pheasant (Pucrasia macrolopha), Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus) and cheer pheasant (Catreus wallichi). Near-endemic birds of the forests include the white-cheeked tit, white-throated tit, spectacled finch, Kashmir flycatcher, Tytler's leaf-warbler, orange bullfinch, and Kashmir nuthatch, while the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>quail</b> {{which used to be}} found here is now thought to be extinct.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>Quail</b> has {{not been}} {{reliably}} recorded in the wild after 1876. The locations where they were historically found have been greatly altered by human activity and the current habitats in these locations may not represent their normal habitat requirements. A 2015 study examined the rate of extinction and suggested that the species might still be extant and using the habitat preference of monal suggest {{that there might be}} some locations around Mussoorie where intensive surveys could be attempted.|$|E
