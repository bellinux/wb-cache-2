50|$|Seen {{from the}} {{striking}} train side, the great wheel with the winding barrel turns clockwise, the <b>hoop</b> <b>wheel</b> anti-clockwise, the count wheel clockwise, and the fly clockwise.|$|E
50|$|One {{peculiarity}} of this {{clock is}} that the count wheel only appears to have 11 notches, but the clock strikes 12 times each complete turn. This is because the first strike (when the clock strikes one) is executed whilst the lever is still within the first, wider, notch. The locking piece is lifted out of the hoop of the <b>hoop</b> <b>wheel,</b> which then turns once, {{which leads to the}} great wheel turning 1/8 and striking once. Then the locking piece falls back into the <b>hoop</b> <b>wheel.</b> The fly will continue to turn until it stops gently on his own as it has a ratchet mechanism, which protects the bird cage on the fly arbor.|$|E
50|$|Great {{wheel to}} fly: 64 teeth driving an 8 pin birdcage; second (<b>hoop)</b> <b>wheel</b> 64 teeth driving an 8 leaf pinion on the fly. So each {{turn of the}} great wheel makes the fly turn 64 times, or 8 turns of the fly per strike of the clock (as the great wheel has 8 {{striking}} pins).|$|E
50|$|The pump {{is driven}} by an {{undershot}} paddle wheel. The wheel comprised three cast iron hoops mounted on a solid oak axle, with 30 blades mounted on the cast iron <b>hoops.</b> The <b>wheel</b> is 18 ft in diameter with a width of 12 ft. The paddles are 22 inch m deep.|$|R

50|$|In 1968, dancer Mary Staton used {{a set of}} Chase's giant wooden circles for her choreography. The dancers rocked {{upside down}} in {{enormous}} wooden arcs, and spread-eagled like spokes inside wooden <b>hoops,</b> <b>wheeled</b> across {{the stage of the}} Seattle Opera House. In collaboration with Boeing, Chase produced Circles, a computer film based on the spinning hoops. King Screen made a film of the dance and sculpture collaboration. Chase requested and received footage edited out of the King Screen film, and from the cut footage, made her own film, Circles II, with the help of film professionals Bob Brown and Frank Olvey. Using color separations that showed the dancers and sculpture as color forms, Chase used time lapse so that trails of light followed the wake of dancers' arms and legs. The film was acclaimed at the 1973 American Film Festival in New York with critic Roger Greenspun comparing it to Matisse's Dance painting. At about the same time Circles II was in production, Chase created prototypes of kinetic sculptures for children, made of shaped urethane foam encased in tough, bright-colored fiberglass cloth. The shapes were designed for kids to help them with equilibrium and body awareness.|$|R
50|$|The {{imagery of}} the twining serpent is {{connected}} to the <b>hoop</b> or <b>wheel</b> through the ouroboros, a ring formed by a snake holding the tip of its tail in its mouth. The 4th-century AD Latin commentator Servius notes that the image of a snake biting its tail represents the cyclical nature of the year. In his 5th-century work on hieroglyphics, Horapollo makes a further distinction between a serpent that hides its tail under the rest of its body, which represents Aion, and the ouroboros that represents the kosmos, which is the serpent devouring its tail.|$|R
50|$|The Lennon Bros Circus showcases a {{wide variety}} of circus arts such as tumblers, flying trapeze, hula <b>hoops,</b> acrobats, double <b>wheel</b> of death, aerialists and clowns. Animals include Liberty horses, monkey, camel, llamas, goat, geese, lions and canines.The circus employs a staff of 35 people, ranging in age from 3 years to 65 years, and is proud to employ a troupe of Australian and International performers. The circus is moved on 14 trucks, 2 semi {{trailers}} and 14 caravans.|$|R
50|$|Much of O'Fallons Bluff {{was removed}} when Interstate 80 was constructed, though {{remnants}} of wagon-wheel ruts from the Oregon and California trails still remain. These trail ruts parallel to Interstate 80 ranging from {{only a few}} feet (or meters) to about a mile (a little over a kilometer) from it. The remaining ruts that run up and over O'Fallon's Bluff are marked by iron <b>hoops</b> representing wagon <b>wheels</b> and can be seen close to Interstate 80.|$|R
50|$|The grave lay {{within a}} {{triangular}} ditched enclosure c 6.5-7 m wide, but {{the northern and}} eastern ditches have been removed by machine. The remains were of a young male adult lying on his right side with his knees drawn up to his body. Pig bones had been placed {{on top of the}} body. The iron tyres and nave <b>hoops</b> of both <b>wheels</b> survived, as did several spokes from the wheel. The axle of the chariot was 1.81 m in length.|$|R
5000|$|There was a dirt {{side and}} planked {{side to the}} road; the East Side was dirt and the West Side planked 3" [...] thick by 8' long. Loaded wagons had {{the right of way}} on the planked side, the other side being {{reserved}} for empty wagons, single horses and for passing. Bicycles used the plank side on Sunday for racing. Due to wear and tear by horses' shoes and iron <b>hoops</b> on wagon <b>wheels,</b> a gang was constantly busy just making repairs.|$|R
50|$|The {{new design}} was {{unveiled}} at the Heathrow Hotel in late September 1975. The car was initially kept under a tarp with <b>hoops</b> over the <b>wheels</b> {{that make it}} look conventional, leading to astonishment when the tarp was pulled off. Some in the audience were convinced the design was a publicity stunt. The car first took to the track at Silverstone on 8 October 1975, and after more tests, Tyrrell decided to build two more examples with a slightly longer wheelbase to race in the 1976 season.|$|R
500|$|The first [...] "mechanical mascot" [...] at Georgia Tech was a 1914 Ford Model T {{owned by}} Dean Floyd Field. Field drove {{the car to}} and from class every day from 1916 until 1928. [...] Field cared {{so much for the}} car that he even nicknamed it [...] "Nellie". The vehicle was {{distinguished}} by its metallic black paint job and a large black box fastened to the rear end by a buggy <b>wheel</b> <b>hoop.</b> The black box's contents were never revealed to the student body and the box became part of the mystique of the Old Ford.|$|R
50|$|Circus alumni {{have gone}} on to perform in a variety of venues {{including}} the Shrine Circuses, the Circus Kingdom, Roberts Brothers Circus, Kelly Brothers Circus, the Great American Circus, and the Circus Alleluia. They have also performed at Disney World, Sea World, Busch Gardens, Universal Studios, Great America, and at Club Med Resorts. Members and alumni have also competed several times internationally in the Rhoenradturnen (Wheel Gymnastics) World Championships. In February 2017, five members competed in two acts at the first annual VivaFest, a circus competition in Las Vegas, Nevada. Lyric <b>Hoop</b> and Cyr <b>Wheel</b> received fourth place and Dance Trapeze received fifth. There were 37 acts in the Gamma Phi's category.|$|R
40|$|The Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) was {{developed}} for NASA s Apollo program so astronauts could cover a greater range on the lunar surface, carry more science instruments, and return more soil and rock samples than by foot. Because of the unique lunar environment, the creation of flexible wheels was the most challenging and time consuming aspect of the LRV development. Wheels developed for previous lunar systems were not sufficient for use with this manned vehicle; therefore, several new designs were created and tested. Based on criteria set by NASA, the choices were narrowed down to two: the wire mesh wheel developed by General Motors (GM), and the <b>hoop</b> spring <b>wheel</b> developed by the Bendix Corporation. Each of these underwent intensive mechanical, material, and terramechanical analyses, and in the end, the wire mesh wheel was chosen for the LRV. Though the wire mesh wheel {{was determined to be}} the best choice for its particular application, it may be insufficient towards achieving the objectives of future lunar missions that could require higher tractive capability, increased weight capacity, or extended life. Therefore lessons learned from the original LRV wheel development and suggestions for future Moon wheel projects are offered...|$|R
40|$|Comprised of {{historical}} and empirical research, this dissertation addresses conceptions of health, movement, and behavioral norms in public spaces. While dance and rhythmic activities {{are vital to}} social cohesion, communication, and cultural reproduction in human societies worldwide, they {{have been subject to}} many forms of suppression [...] as is the case of American Indians on reservations in the 20 th century. The Ghost Dance among the Lakota in 1890, along with other examples, together reveal the role of dance and music in offering resilience and hope for renewal. The experiences of women in America in the late- 19 th through mid- 20 th centuries is also discussed: The interactions of race and gender pertinent to women's experiences in public, American Indian assimilation, dance, city parks movement, physical education, and physical culture are highlighted. The historical context is complemented by contemporary observations of municipal parks in the San Francisco East Bay. Municipal parks with similar design features are found in cities and towns throughout the United States. As public commons, they reveal a great deal about social values, norms, and power. This study utilizes an environmental justice framework and a modified System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities method to evaluate park conditions and usage. Forty-seven parks, most less than seven acres in size, located in census tracts reporting populations at or above the California averages for Asian, African American, or American Indian residents in the cities of Richmond, Berkeley, and Oakland, California were visited at various times throughout the day and week. Observations confirmed previous studies that found predominantly sedentary uses with limited variety. Among adult and teen park users, there were fewer women than men, which also corresponded with previous studies in other cities. Most parks had low levels of use considering the population density of the surrounding neighborhood. Access to sanitary infrastructure and drinking water was limited, as was equipment for adults. Facilities for competitive sports were common, while alternative outdoor facilities for group rhythmic, creative, or coordinated movement were rare. It is recommended that municipalities could address environmental inequalities and increase park usage by providing free or very low-cost programming that incorporates creativity, expression, and cooperation. Access to equipment such as <b>hoops,</b> <b>wheels,</b> musical instruments, ropes, and spaces for community dances or presentations should be explored as additional ways to increase active park use. Enhancing sanitation infrastructure, negotiating sound policies, and facilitating active transportation to and from parks are other suggested ways to increase use of urban municipal parks...|$|R
50|$|O'Fallons Bluff is {{a section}} of bluffs about 20 mi long that run along {{the south side of}} the Platte river near Sutherland in Lincoln County, Nebraska. The Oregon and California trails ran up and over these bluffs. They were {{characterized}} by American pioneers heading west to Oregon and California as sparse in vegetation with a number of violent incidents involving Native Americans. In the early 1860s, a Pony Express station was located about 5 mi west of where the wagon trails went up the bluff. During construction of Interstate 80, the steep part of the bluffs were cut away but wagon ruts remained, which are marked by iron <b>hoops</b> signifying wagon <b>wheels.</b> It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.|$|R
50|$|The Habsburg Monarchy, {{which then}} ruled the Banat, was {{interested}} in developing extractive metallurgy in the province, and began building furnaces for iron ore smelting in Reșița in 1769, those at Bocşa proving inadequate for its industrial needs. The works trace their origins to July 3, 1771, when the first furnaces and forges were inaugurated, making it the oldest industrial factory in present-day Romania. At first, metalworking {{was the focus of}} activity, but machinery manufacturing gradually gained prominence, becoming the main occupation {{in the last quarter of}} the 19th century. For decades, the two complemented each other within the same integrated factory. Until 1855, the works belonged to the Treasury of what had become the Austrian Empire, which exercised control through the Banat Mining Directorate in Oraviţa. By 1815, they were producing cast iron pieces coming directly from the furnaces, rods forged from iron, <b>hoops</b> for cart <b>wheels,</b> tools, nails and utensils for agricultural and home use.|$|R
