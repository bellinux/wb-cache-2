25|$|One early {{version of}} {{electronic}} paper consists of a sheet of very small transparent capsules, each about 40 micrometers across. <b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> an oily solution containing black dye (the electronic ink), with numerous white titanium dioxide particles suspended within. The particles are slightly negatively charged, and each one is naturally white.|$|E
50|$|The spawn of Turbinella laevigata has 240 eggs {{in every}} capsule; <b>each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> {{a high number}} of nurse eggs.|$|E
50|$|This miter lays egg {{capsules}} {{attached to}} rock surfaces. They are yellow or transparent, and about 8mm high. In laboratory conditions, females {{have been observed}} depositing over 90 egg capsules in 4 days, and 173 in 17 days. <b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> hundreds of 0.2mm eggs. Veliger larvae hatch from the capsule after ~24 days, depending on temperature.|$|E
60|$|Excluding {{the capsule}} with 136 seeds, 25 {{percent of the}} flowers yielded <b>capsules,</b> and <b>each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contained,</b> on an average, 54.6 seeds; or, {{excluding}} capsules with less than 20 seeds, the average is 77.5.|$|R
2500|$|The {{distinctive}} compound {{fruit is}} hard, dry, and globose, in diameter, composed of numerous (40-60) <b>capsules.</b> [...] <b>Each</b> <b>capsule,</b> <b>containing</b> {{one to two}} small seeds, has a pair of terminal spikes (for a total of 80-120 spikes). When the fruit opens and the seeds are released, <b>each</b> <b>capsule</b> {{is associated with a}} small hole (40-60 of these) in the compound fruit.|$|R
50|$|Aspens are dioecious, with {{separate}} {{male and female}} clones. The flowers are catkins 4 - 6 cm long, produced in early spring before the leaves; The fruit is a 10 cm pendulous string of 6 mm <b>capsules,</b> <b>each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>containing</b> about ten minute seeds embedded in cottony fluff, which aids wind dispersal of the seeds when they are mature in early summer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> 5-6 {{grams of}} ground coffee and makes one serving of coffee. Depending {{on the length}} of the pour, the capsule can produce a 40 ml espresso shot, or a 110 ml lungo (long) pour. The capsule body and {{perforated}} top are both made of aluminum. To assuage concerns on potential aluminum health effects, most of the capsule interior is lined with food-grade lacquer.|$|E
50|$|Eucalyptus salmonophloia {{flowers in}} spring between August to December with white to cream blossoms. It {{produces}} simple axillary conflorescences with seven {{to more than}} eleven flowered umbellasters and terete or angular peduncles. Buds then form that are ovoid or globose with calyptrate calyx which sheds early. Seed capsules usually remain in place until the following summer or longer, <b>each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> about 600 viable seeds per gram.|$|E
50|$|Iperespresso {{capsules}} {{are manufactured}} exclusively by Illy. The cost per serving is 10% higher than illy E.S.E pods, and twice higher than Illy ground or whole bean coffee. Illy use 100% Arabica beans, purchased directly from company-trained farmers. Illy became the world’s first company {{to earn the}} Responsible Supply Chain Process certification from Det Norske Veritas (DNV). <b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> approximately 7 grams of coffee.|$|E
30|$|A {{pilot study}} with 15 {{patients}} with advanced colorectal cancer used standardized oral curcumin extract (<b>each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contained</b> 20 mg of curcuminoids (18 mg of curcumin and 2 mg of desmethoxycurcumin) suspended in 200 mg of essential oils derived from Curcuma spp.) daily up to 4 months. This study showed no toxicity but {{no evidence of}} detectable systemic bioavailability was provided either (Sharma et al. 2001). A curcuminoid formulation (<b>each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contained</b> 500 mg: 450 mg of curcumin, 40 mg of desmethoxycurcumin and 10 mg of bisdesmethoxycurcumin) administered orally for up to 4 months and allowing a rapid dose escalation that equated to curcumin doses between 450 and 3, 600 mg daily showed that the later daily dose (3, 600 mg) resulted in detectable levels of the compound and its conjugates in plasma. It was also present in urine (0.1 - 1.3 μM curcumin; 19 – 45 nM curcumin sulfate; 210 – 510 nM curcumin glucuronide). However, it was not detectable in patients who received doses less than 3, 600 mg daily (Sharma et al. 2004). Finally high doses (12 g/day) of curcumin in phase I preclinical trial reinforces the low systemic bioavailability (Lao et al. 2006).|$|R
60|$|After {{the heights}} of the crossed and self-fertilised plants had been taken, they were {{sometimes}} cut down close to the ground, and {{an equal number of}} both weighed. This method of comparison gives very striking results, and I wish that it had been oftener followed. Finally a record was often kept of any marked difference in the rate of germination of the crossed and self-fertilised seeds,--of the relative periods of flowering of the plants raised from them,--and of their productiveness, that is, of the number of seed-capsules which they produced and of the average number of seeds which <b>each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contained.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{attractive}} small, deep crimson-pink {{flowers are}} produced in early summer. Each has five sepals, with a corolla of five fused petals, and ten stamens fused to the corolla. They are pollinated by bumble bees and solitary bees. <b>Each</b> mature <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> about 180 seeds.|$|R
50|$|The flowers {{have six}} distinct, basifixed stamens with {{filaments}} {{shorter than the}} tepals. Each stigma has three distinct lobes, and the ovaries are superior, with three chambers. The tulip's seed is a capsule with a leathery covering and an ellipsoid to globe shape. <b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> numerous flat, disc-shaped seeds in two rows per chamber. These light to dark brown seeds have very thin seed coats and endosperm that does not normally fill the entire seed.|$|E
50|$|Dolichandra unguis-cati has semipersistent foliage. Stems are woody and {{can reach}} 20 meters. Thin and small aerial roots {{are used for}} climbing. Leaves are dark green, {{opposite}} and bifoliate. Leaflets have a length of 3 to 4 cm. The plant produces flowers during the wet season. Flowers are yellow, have a diameter of 4 to 5 cm and can grow alone or in groups of 2 or 3. Long primary roots extend beneath the soil surface, producing large tubers 40-50 centimetres long. Fruits are brown flattened capsules from 25 to 95 cm long. <b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> 100 to 200 seeds.|$|E
50|$|Populus trichocarpa is {{normally}} dioecious; {{male and female}} catkins are borne on separate trees. The species reaches flowering age at about 10 years. Flowers may appear in early March to late May in Washington and Oregon, and sometimes as late as mid-June in northern and interior British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana. Staminate catkins contain 30 to 60 stamens, elongate to 2 to 3 cm, and are deciduous. Pistillate catkins at maturity are 8 to 20 cm long with rotund-ovate, three carpellate subsessile fruits 5 to 8 mm long. <b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> many minute seeds with long, white cottony hairs.|$|E
40|$|RISTIYANTI M. MARWOTO. 1986. The egg {{development}} on. Amerianna carinata (H. Adams). Berita Biologi 3 (4) : 178 - 180. An {{attempt was}} made to observe the egg development on 14 of A. carinata snails collected from a pond near the palace at the Bogor Botanical Gardens. It was found that after being incubated for 2 - 4 days, many of the snails laid 7 <b>capsules,</b> <b>each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>containing</b> 3 to 27 eggs. The diameter of the capsule was between 4 - 7 mm, while the egg was about 0, 3 mm. The embryos completed their development within 7 days and it was then followed by the egg batched in 1 to 2 days...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{study on}} 50 hyperlipidaemic adult patients, an extract of the fruit of Vaccinium arctostaphylos {{was found to have}} {{beneficial}} effects on serum lipid profile and oxidative stress. [...] <b>Each</b> medicinal <b>capsule</b> <b>contained</b> 45 ± 2 mg of anthocyanins. The authors suggest that the effects {{may be due to the}} anthocyanin content of the fruit.|$|R
40|$|In view {{of certain}} {{difficulties}} {{involved in the}} administration of poliomyelitis vaccine in liquid form on sugar or in syrup in mass campaigns, trials have been conducted with a new single-dose preparation of live attenuated poliovaccine (Sabin strain) in an emulsion in a gelatin <b>capsule.</b> <b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contained</b> a standard dose of vaccine which was shown to be stable in this form. It has been demonstrated that the capsule vaccine was as effective as liquid vaccine both in children and in adults. The capsules were acceptable to adults and children over the age of 5 years, but between 6 % and 7 % of 4 - 5 -year-old children refused the vaccine in this form owing to difficulty in swallowing the capsules...|$|R
5000|$|Mating and {{egg laying}} occur {{during the spring}} and fall migration. Internally fertilized eggs are {{surrounded}} by a transparent mass of albumen, a gel-like material, and are laid in protective flat, rounded egg capsules joined to form a paper-like chain of egg cases, commonly called a [...] "Mermaid's Necklace". On average <b>each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> 0-99 eggs, with most strings having 40-160 capsules. After laying their egg cases, female knobbed whelk will bury one end of the egg case into the substrate, thus providing an anchor for the developing fertilized eggs and preventing the string of egg cases from washing ashore where it would dehydrate. Fertilized eggs emerge as juvenile knobbed whelks approximately 4 mm in length.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers are}} {{arranged}} in spikes {{on the ends of}} branches which continue to grow after flowering, sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The spikes contain 5 to 18 groups of flowers in threes and are up to 40 mm in diameter and 20-50 mm long. The petals are about 3 mm long and fall off as the flower ages. The stamens are white, cream-coloured or greenish and {{are arranged in}} 5 bundles around the flower, with 5 to 10 stamens per bundle. Flowering occurs from spring to early autumn, September to March in Australia. Flowering is followed by fruit which are woody, broadly cylindrical capsules, 2.5-4 mm long and clustered, spike-like along the branches. <b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> many tiny seeds which are released annually.|$|E
50|$|Itraconazole is {{produced}} as blue 22 mm capsules with tiny 1.5 mm blue pellets inside. <b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> 100 mg {{and is usually}} taken twice a day at twelve-hour intervals. The Sporanox brand of itraconazole has been developed and marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutica, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. The three-layer structure of these blue capsules is complex because itraconazole is insoluble and is sensitive to pH. The complicated procedure not only requires a specialized machine to create it, but also the method used has manufacturing problems. Also, the pill is quite large, {{making it difficult for}} many patients to swallow. Parts of the processes of creating Sporanox were discovered by the Korean Patent Laid-open No. 10-2001-2590. The tiny blue pellets contained in the capsule are manufactured in Beerse, Belgium.|$|E
50|$|R. tetragona is {{strictly}} hermaphroditic having a complete reproductive system in itself. Each mature proglottid has {{a set of}} male and female reproductive organ and genital pores on one side. Testes are located {{on both sides of the}} ovary and behind vitellarium. <b>Each</b> egg <b>capsule</b> <b>contained</b> 4-12 eggs and many calcareous corpuscles, each of which is surrounded by a membrane. The male reproductive system matures first. As the two reproductive systems matured, the proglottids became gravid after fertilization.|$|R
60|$|In {{the summer}} of 1867 the trial was repeated; thirty flowers were crossed with pollen from a {{distinct}} plant and produced twenty-seven <b>capsules,</b> <b>each</b> <b>containing</b> five seeds. Thirty-two flowers were fertilised with their own pollen, and produced only six <b>capsules,</b> <b>each</b> with five seeds. So that the crossed and self-fertilised <b>capsules</b> <b>contained</b> {{the same number of}} seeds, though many more capsules were produced by the cross-fertilised than by the self-fertilised flowers, in the ratio of 100 to 21.|$|R
500|$|Flowers are pentamerous with (usually) five stamen, a five-lobed calyx {{tube and}} a five-petalled corolla, the latter bright yellow and an [...] wide. The flowers are almost sessile, with very short pedicels (2mm, 0.08in). The five stamens are of two types, {{with the three}} upper stamens being shorter, their {{filaments}} covered by yellow or whitish hairs, and having smaller anthers, while the lower two stamens have glabrous filaments and larger anthers. The plant produces small, ovoid (6mm, 0.24in) capsules that split open by way of two valves, <b>each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>containing</b> large numbers of minute, brown seeds less than 1 mm (0.04in) in size, marked with longitudinal ridges. A white-flowered form, V.thapsus f. candicans, is known to occur. Flowering lasts [...] up to three months from early to late summer (June to August in northern Europe), with flowering starting {{at the bottom of}} the spike and progressing irregularly upward; each flower opens for part of a day and only a few open at the same time around the stem.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} {{bisexual}} {{with all three}} petals being blue, though the smaller lower petal is white towards the centre. The centre-most stamen has a white connective (i.e. the portion connecting {{the two halves of}} the anther). There are 3 cruciform staminodes present, each with yellow antherodes, these often showing a maroon spot at their centres. The fruit is a capsule, each having 3 locules and 2 valves and measuring 6 to 8 mm, though they may be rarely as small as 5 mm. <b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> 5 dark brown seeds that measure 2.4 to 4.3 mm long, and rarely up to 4.6 mm, by 2 to 2.3 mm wide, though rarely they can be as narrow as 1.6 mm. They are smooth to faintly alveolate (i.e. with a honeycombed surface) with a mealy texture. The chromosome number is 2n = ca. 86.|$|E
50|$|This used tiny microcapsules {{filled with}} {{electrically}} charged white particles suspended in a colored oil. In early versions, the underlying circuitry controlled whether the white particles {{were at the}} top of the capsule (so it looked white to the viewer) or at the bottom of the capsule (so the viewer saw the color of the oil). This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known electrophoretic display technology, but microcapsules meant the display could be made on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.One early version of electronic paper consists of a sheet of very small transparent capsules, each about 40 micrometers across. <b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> an oily solution containing black dye (the electronic ink), with numerous white titanium dioxide particles suspended within. The particles are slightly negatively charged, and each one is naturally white.The screen holds microcapsules in a layer of liquid polymer, sandwiched between two arrays of electrodes, the upper of which is transparent. The two arrays are aligned to divide the sheet into pixels, and each pixel corresponds to a pair of electrodes situated on either side of the sheet. The sheet is laminated with transparent plastic for protection, resulting in an overall thickness of 80 micrometers, or twice that of ordinary paper.The network of electrodes connects to display circuitry, which turns the electronic ink 'on' and 'off' at specific pixels by applying a voltage to specific electrode pairs. A negative charge to the surface electrode repels the particles to the bottom of local capsules, forcing the black dye to the surface and turning the pixel black. Reversing the voltage has the opposite effect. It forces the particles to the surface, turning the pixel white. A more recent implementation of this concept requires only one layer of electrodes beneath the microcapsules.|$|E
50|$|Large clammyweed is a {{small to}} large sticky but unscented annual herb of 10-60 cm. It has {{branched}} or unbranched, green or purple stems with seated glands and glandular hairs. The 0.3-1.5 mm long, green or purple leaf stalks are often at an angle with the leaf blade. The leaf blade consists of three narrow, 0.9-3.5 cm long and only 1-2 mm wide, somewhat fleshy leaflets, {{the right and left}} halfs more or less folded towards each other (or conduplicate) with entire margins, a pointed top with a needle-like tip, the underside of the leaf with many, and the upper side with few glands. The bilaterally symmetrical flowers are set in gland-covered racemes that are initially 1-3 cm long but that keep growing to 6-8 cm when fruits are ripe. Each individual flower is subtended by a bracts consisting of one or three entire bractlets, which have an oval shape and are 7-15 mm long. The stalk of the individual flower is 1−2⅓ cm (0.4-0.9 in) long. The four deciduous, eventually deflected, green to purple coloured, hairless sepals are lanceolate to inverted egg-shaped, 2½-3½ mm (0.1-0.14 in) long and ¾-1¼ mm (0.03-0.05 in) wide, with entire margins and a pointy tip. The four petals are mostly creamy white, oblong-ovate, consist of a more yellowish straight and narrow claw and a wide plate. The forward directed lower (abaxial) pair is 3-5 mm long and 2½-3 mm (0.10-0.12 in) wide the upper ⅔ deeply incised to create nine or ten finger-like lobes, often themselves bilobed at the tip (also described as a lacerate margin). The upper ((adaxial) pair is 6-11 mm long and 3½-5 mm (0.12-0.20 in) wide, less deeply incised with four to six finger-like lobes. The tube-shaped nectaries are yellow, but become purple when drying and are 1-5½ mm (0.02-0.12 in) long. There are six to fifteen stamens that reach beyond the petals, consist of purple 1-1⅓ cm (0.4-0.5 in) filaments topped by purple, 1-1½ mm (0.04-0.06 in) long anthers, which do not coil when the pollen is released. The 5-8 mm long ovary sits {{on the end of a}} gynophore that grows to a length of 3-14 mm when the fruit is ripe, and is topped with a 2½-4½ mm (0.10-0.18 in) long style that persists and ends in a green stigma. The fruit is a capsules of 2-6 cm long and ¼-½ cm (0.1-0.2 in) in diameter, with a netted surface with or without some glandular hairs. <b>Each</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>contains</b> twelve to forty, globular to ovate, dark reddish brown seeds of 1½-1¾ mm (0.06-0.07 in), with a nobbly surface.|$|E
