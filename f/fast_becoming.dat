5|$|Johnson was {{the second}} son of Rebecca Turner Johnson and John Johnson, a Baptist yeoman who lived in Everton, Liverpool. Religious Dissent marked Johnson from the {{beginning}} of his life, as two of his mother's relatives were prominent Baptist ministers and his father was a deacon. Liverpool, at the time of Johnson's youth, was <b>fast</b> <b>becoming</b> a bustling urban centre {{and was one of the}} most important commercial ports in England. These two characteristics of his home—Dissent and commercialism—remained central elements in Johnson's character throughout his life.|$|E

However, Germany was <b>fast</b> <b>becoming</b> an industrialized state with increased rural exodus to the cities.

According to the Saudi Real Estate Companion, most large companies in the country establish either sole headquarters or a large office in the city.

25|$|Walsall {{town centre}} is <b>fast</b> <b>becoming</b> {{the most popular}} {{shopping}} destination in the Black Country. This {{is due to the}} ample supply of free or extremely cheap parking available within the town centre.

25|$|In {{another attempt}} to {{champion}} the rights of Dissenters, Priestley defended their constitutional rights against the attacks of William Blackstone, an eminent legal theorist. Blackstone's Commentaries, <b>fast</b> <b>becoming</b> the standard reference for legal interpretation, stated that dissent from the Church of England was a crime and argued that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects. Furious, Priestley lashed out with his Remarks on Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries (1769), correcting Blackstone's grammar, his history and his interpretation of the law. Blackstone, chastened, replied in a pamphlet and altered his Commentaries in subsequent editions; he rephrased the offending passages but still described Dissent as a crime.|$|E
5000|$|The {{third and}} final {{practice}} session {{saw some of the}} fastest lap times of the weekend thus far; this was a by-product of dust being cleaned from the circuit and drivers becoming familiar with the circuit layout. Vettel finished <b>fastest,</b> <b>becoming</b> the first person to set a time faster than 1:25.00, and comfortably inside the projected lap times claimed by Pirelli. Button was second, ahead of Mark Webber and Lewis Hamilton. The new front wing of the Ferrari cars attracted significant attention, with commentators observing it to [...] "flutter", rapidly vibrating and sparking off the circuit surface, particularly under braking into Turn 4. This phenomenon attracted the attention of the FIA's technical delegates, and the problem was noticed to have stopped when the team replaced the front wing on Felipe Massa's car.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{begins with}} what is almost a legendary source for discussions of {{literature}} and politics, the moment when Socrates in Plato's dialogue The Republic decides that most poets should be banished from the well-ordered state. One answer to these questions comes from understanding the conception of politics that pervades Enzensberger's "Poetry and Politics" and provides the necessary counterpoint to his notion of the resistant poem. This chapter might overeagerly want to conflate these two remarks and find in them evidence of another, affirmative relation between literature and politics.

The city is expanding quickly along the Old Mahabalipuram Road and the Grand Southern Trunk Road (GST Road) in the south and towards Ambattur, Koyambedu and Sriperumbdur in the west.

25|$|Louis XIV and his ministers {{had hoped}} for a quick {{resolution}} similar to that secured from the War of the Reunions, but by 1688 the situation was drastically different.

25|$|Conservatories {{were popular}} {{throughout}} California’s early history. Structures of various {{shapes and sizes}} were built in Victorian California, ranging from an attached and glassed-in wing for a residence, to a great domed or compartmentalized, detached glasshouse. Examples of wealthy Californians who built conservatories in their private estates include: A.K.P. (Albion Keith Paris) Harmon, for his Oakland Lake Merritt Estate (which later became Lakeside Park); Frederick Delger; Frank M. Smith; Darius Ogden Mills (Millbrae); and Luther Burbank, for his own experiments with plant germination (Santa Rosa). This is not surprising, as agriculture was <b>fast</b> <b>becoming</b> {{an important part of}} the state’s economy and horticulture an important aspect of the gentleman’s education.

25|$|Whilst the {{proliferation}} of freesheet newspapers continues to escalate, {{the impact on the}} environment is <b>fast</b> <b>becoming</b> a major concern to many environmentalists. Over 44 million editions are being produced every day worldwide; it takes 12 established trees to make one tonne of newsprint, which is enough to print 14,000 editions of an average-size tabloid. That means a daily usage of newsprint of a little over 3,142 tonnes. Which, in turn, means the felling of 37,714 trees. On average around 70% of paper used by the newspaper industry is claimed to be recycled. So after recycled paper usage, over 11,314 trees are being felled daily to feed the freesheet print presses in over 58 countries. Also, whilst the increased use of recycled paper is welcomed by many, the extensive bleaching (especially use of chlorine) and other chemical processes to make reclaimed paper blank again for reuse are not lessening the concerns of environmentalists.|$|E

Fraser failed to add to his {{overnight}} score and was run out for 12 soon after the resumption. Emburey and Graham Dilley added 30 for the ninth wicket, much to the frustration of the Australians before Emburey fell for a well made 26 to a sharp chance taken by David Boon off Lawson. If the ninth wicket stand of 30 had frustrated the Australian bowlers the 10th wicket partnership of 27 between Dilley and Paul Jarvis was just annoying, and made an Australian victory all but impossible.

The other aspects of the Merovingian military, mostly Roman in origin or innovations of powerful kings, disappeared from the scene by the 8th century.|$|E
25|$|Organ {{donation}} is <b>fast</b> <b>becoming</b> {{an important}} bioethical issue {{from a social}} perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, {{the fact remains that}} demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend often referred to as transplant tourism. The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice {{on the one hand and}} a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure. These studies looked only at people who sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.|$|E
