5|$|Due to {{long-term}} environmental programs and commitments, UCF was named an exemplary green {{institution in the}} 2010 Princeton Review's Guide to 286 Green Colleges, and the university has had its initiatives showcased by the U.S. Department of Energy. UCF has pledged to become climate-neutral under the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment by 2050 at the latest, and to increase its recycling rate to 75% by 2020, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 42% by 2030. Committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, all new construction must be designed and certified by the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Design</b> (LEED). The UCF College of Medicine on the Health Sciences Campus is the only LEED Silver medical school in Florida.|$|E
5|$|He {{lived in}} Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, in the {{restored}} Bailey House, designed by Richard Neutra. After his home {{was destroyed by}} a fire in 2007, Simon redesigned it to be environmentally friendly; much of the interior is constructed from recycled materials while solar panels provide virtually its entire power needs. The building has a Leadership in Energy and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Design</b> Gold certificate. He had an extensive art collection; he owned paintings by Thomas Hart Benton, John Singer Sargent {{and one of the}} original casts of Auguste Rodin's The Thinker. He also had a sculpture by Robert Graham and works by Alberto Vargas, Gil Elvgren, Ed Ruscha and Richard Estes.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{called for}} a four-story {{structure}} covered with zinc panels on the exterior {{with a total of}} , including a three story tall atrium. Plans for zinc on the exterior were later changed to stainless steel due to costs. Designed by Mayne and the DLR Group, the building was to be built using concrete and steel with a goal of earning Leadership in Energy and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Design</b> (LEED) certification for sustainability, with large amounts of natural lighting designed to help secure that distinction. On the outside many security measures were incorporated into the design. The building was to include six courtrooms, administrative offices, and space for the offices of the U.S. Marshals Service. Despite security concerns as a federal building, the architect and judge Michael Robert Hogan sought to have an open feel to the structure. Hogan, the chief judge of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, was the primary government official tasked with working with the architect to design the courthouse.|$|E
40|$|Significance of colour schemes in {{appraisal}} of the urban aesthetic has been traditionally recognised by design professionals. However, the proven psychological and emotional impacts of urban colour remain overlooked in design thinking. This paper argues that health-conscious approach to <b>environmental</b> colour <b>design</b> requires consideration of phenomenological human needs in addition to aesthetic and stylistic preferences of a designer. A body of knowledge accumulated in environmental colour psychology provides a foundation for {{a shift in the}} <b>environmental</b> colour <b>design.</b> Though, some architectural critics suggest that design professionals have little understanding of how different aspects of colour psychology can be integrated in design process. Lack of an explicit design methodology {{has been described as a}} main constraint to applicability of the related knowledge in design process. Understanding the notion of environmental colour is essential in developing health-conscious approach to <b>environmental</b> colour <b>design.</b> Therefore, this paper is primarily focused on conceptualisation of environmental colour and experiential <b>environmental</b> colour <b>design.</b> Additionally, a role of <b>environmental</b> colour <b>design</b> in the delivery of health-enhancing environments and balanced sensorial experiences is briefly discussed...|$|R

It first earned a Silver Leadership in Energy and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Design</b> (LEED) certification under the United States Green Building Council LEED for New Construction program in 2004 and later Platinum Certification under LEED-EB (LEED for Existing Buildings) in 2007. The library's flooring is made of recycled rubber tires and there are charging stations for electric vehicles in the parking lot. In 2007, a rooftop garden was established atop the library, in addition to existing solar panels. The garden collects runoff and is maintained {{without the use of}} gasoline-powered lawn mowers and chemical pesticides or fertilizers.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{buildings}} in the new World Trade Center complex, One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, {{which was one of}} the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power. The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World Trade Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Design</b> (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.|$|E

25|$|Skyscrapers can be artificially lighted and {{the energy}} {{requirements}} can be covered by renewable energy or other electricity generation of low greenhouse gas emissions. Heating and cooling of skyscrapers can be efficient, because of centralized HVAC systems, heat radiation blocking windows and small surface area of the building. There is Leadership in Energy and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Design</b> (LEED) certification for skyscrapers. For example, the Empire State Building received a gold Leadership in Energy and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Design</b> rating in September 2011 and the Empire State Building is the tallest LEED certified building in the United States, proving that skyscrapers can be environmentally friendly.

40|$|There are {{opportunities}} for <b>environmental</b> graphic <b>design</b> solutions that can enable urban residents to grasp information faster, reach destinations sooner and foster memorable experiences. In the daily negotiation of city living {{there may also}} be {{opportunities for}} educating residents about meaningful community-related topics. Graphic design can {{play a key role in}} addressing these goals. <b>Environmental</b> graphic <b>design</b> and wayfinding can help make urban experiences easier and more interesting. Incorporating the strategies of layering and sequencing within <b>environmental</b> graphic <b>design</b> solutions can strengthen the overall design and the particular messages being conveyed. One socially important topic city residents need to be made more aware of is the significance and challenges of homeless animals living within the urban environment. Services such as animal shelters and animal rescue groups are non-profit organizations that continue to face challenges in supporting needy animals despite government assistance. Public participation in solving these issues could help these organizations grow and function more smoothly. Through effective design planning and the use of <b>environmental</b> graphic <b>design</b> solutions, designers could experiment with message-making strategies that visually communicate more effectively to the public and yield more tangible positive results. This exploration investigates the roles of physical and informational layering, sequencing and visual hierarchy, and how these design strategies can help convey sensitive social messages effectively. This thesis also studies how specific urban spaces can contribute to <b>environmental</b> graphic <b>design</b> projects. It joins a larger continuum of design work that focuses on how space and certain physical contexts can be used strategically to host social messages and seeks to make those messages memorable through successful visual and verbal problem solving...|$|R
