5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> inhibitors are {{molecules}} that reduce or abolish <b>enzyme</b> activity, while <b>enzyme</b> activators are {{molecules that}} increase the catalytic rate of enzymes. These interactions can be either reversible (i.e., removal of the inhibitor restores <b>enzyme</b> activity) or irreversible (i.e., the inhibitor permanently inactivates the <b>enzyme).</b>|$|E
5|$|Activity-based {{proteomics}} – {{a branch}} of proteomics that uses covalent <b>enzyme</b> inhibitors as reporters to monitor <b>enzyme</b> activity.|$|E
5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on the <b>enzyme,</b> {{distinct}} from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause {{a change in the}} conformation or dynamics of the <b>enzyme</b> that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the <b>enzyme.</b> In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the <b>enzyme</b> according to the flux {{through the rest of the}} pathway.|$|E
50|$|The binding of <b>enzymes</b> {{with their}} cofactors {{has been used}} as a route to produce {{modified}} <b>enzymes,</b> electrically contacted <b>enzymes,</b> and even photoswitchable <b>enzymes.</b>|$|R

50|$|The PDE1 isozyme family {{belongs to}} a Class I <b>enzymes,</b> which {{includes}} all vertebrate PDEs and some yeast <b>enzymes.</b> Class I <b>enzymes</b> all have a catalytic core of at least 250 amino acids whereas Class II <b>enzymes</b> lack such a common feature.|$|R
5|$|Although {{far less}} common than other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12. These proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2, an <b>enzyme</b> {{that occurs in}} humans and other mammals that does not use the corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-corrin cobalt <b>enzyme</b> is nitrile hydratase, an <b>enzyme</b> in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E
5|$|An <b>enzyme</b> {{inhibitor}} is {{a molecule}} that binds to an <b>enzyme</b> and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are <b>enzyme</b> inhibitors. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; <b>enzyme</b> activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while <b>enzyme</b> substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the <b>enzyme.</b>|$|E
5|$|ENZO (<b>Enzyme</b> Kinetics) is a {{graphical}} interface {{tool for}} building kinetic models of <b>enzyme</b> catalyzed reactions. ENZO automatically generates the corresponding differential equations from a stipulated <b>enzyme</b> reaction scheme. These differential equations are processed by a numerical solver and a regression algorithm which fits the coefficients of differential equations to experimentally observed time course curves.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{biological}} networks {{show some}} characteristics of scale-free networks. Scale-free networks can evolve through preferential attachment where new nodes are preferentially attached to well connected nodes. In networks which have evolved through preferential attachment older nodes {{should have a}} higher average connectivity than younger nodes. Here we have investigated preferential attachment {{in the context of}} metabolic networks. Results The connectivities of the <b>enzymes</b> in the metabolic network of Escherichia coli were determined and representatives for these <b>enzymes</b> were located in 11 eukaryotes, 17 archaea and 46 bacteria. E. coli <b>enzymes</b> which have representatives in eukaryotes have a higher average connectivity while <b>enzymes</b> which are represented only in the prokaryotes, and especially the <b>enzymes</b> only present in βγ-proteobacteria, have lower connectivities than expected by chance. Interestingly, the <b>enzymes</b> which have been proposed as candidates for horizontal gene transfer have a higher average connectivity than the other <b>enzymes.</b> Furthermore, It was found that new edges are added to the highly connected <b>enzymes</b> at a faster rate than to <b>enzymes</b> with low connectivities which is consistent with preferential attachment. Conclusion Here, we have found indications of preferential attachment in the metabolic network of E. coli. A possible biological explanation for preferential attachment growth of metabolic networks is that novel <b>enzymes</b> created through gene duplication maintain some of the compounds involved in the original reaction, throughout its future evolution. In addition, we found that <b>enzymes</b> which are candidates for horizontal gene transfer have a higher average connectivity than other <b>enzymes.</b> This indicates that while new <b>enzymes</b> are attached preferentially to highly connected <b>enzymes,</b> these highly connected <b>enzymes</b> have sometimes been introduced into the E. coli genome by horizontal gene transfer. We speculate that E. coli has adjusted its metabolic network to a changing environment by replacing the relatively central <b>enzymes</b> for better adapted orthologs from other prokaryotic species. </p...|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of iron-sulfur cluster-containing <b>enzymes</b> cleave SAM-e reductively to produce a 5′-deoxyadenosyl 5′-radical as an intermediate, and are called radical SAM <b>enzymes.</b> Most <b>enzymes</b> with this {{capability}} share a region of sequence homology that includes the motif CxxxCxxC or a close variant. The radical intermediate allows <b>enzymes</b> to perform {{a wide variety of}} unusual chemical reactions. Examples of radical SAM <b>enzymes</b> include spore photoproduct lyase, activases of pyruvate formate lyase and anaerobic sulfatases, lysine 2,3-aminomutase, and various <b>enzymes</b> of cofactor biosynthesis, peptide modification, metalloprotein cluster formation, tRNA modification, lipid metabolism, etc. Some radical SAM-e <b>enzymes</b> use a second SAM-e as a methyl donor. Radical SAM <b>enzymes</b> are much more abundant in anaerobic bacteria than in aerobic organisms. They can be found in all domains of life and are largely unexplored. A recent bioinformatics study concluded that this family of <b>enzymes</b> includes at least 114,000 sequences including 65 unique reactions.|$|R
5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> inhibitors {{are found}} in nature and are also {{designed}} and produced as part of pharmacology and biochemistry. Natural poisons are often <b>enzyme</b> inhibitors that have evolved to defend a plant or animal against predators. These natural toxins include {{some of the most}} poisonous compounds known. Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be insecticides such as malathion, herbicides such as glyphosate, or disinfectants such as triclosan. Other artificial <b>enzyme</b> inhibitors block acetylcholinesterase, an <b>enzyme</b> which breaks down acetylcholine, and are used as nerve agents in chemical warfare.|$|E
5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> {{kinetics}} is {{the investigation}} of how enzymes bind substrates {{and turn them into}} products. The rate data used in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from <b>enzyme</b> assays. In 1913 Leonor Michaelis and Maud Leonora Menten proposed a quantitative theory of <b>enzyme</b> kinetics, which is referred to as Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The major contribution of Michaelis and Menten was to think of <b>enzyme</b> reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the <b>enzyme,</b> forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis-Menten complex in their honor. The <b>enzyme</b> then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. This work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely used today.|$|E
5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> {{kinetics}} is {{the study}} of the chemical reactions that are catalysed by enzymes. In <b>enzyme</b> kinetics, the reaction rate is measured and the effects of varying the conditions of the reaction are investigated. Studying an enzyme's kinetics in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this <b>enzyme,</b> its role in metabolism, how its activity is controlled, and how a drug or an agonist might inhibit the <b>enzyme.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Enzymes</b> {{utilizing}} pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate dependent {{mechanism for}} catalysis are observed in all cellular forms of living organisms. PLP-dependent <b>enzymes</b> catalyze {{a wide variety}} of reactions involving amino acid substrates and their analogs. Structurally, these ubiquitous <b>enzymes</b> have been classified into four major fold types. We have carried out investigations on the structure and function of fold type I <b>enzymes</b> serine hydroxymethyl transferase and acetylornithine amino transferase, fold type n <b>enzymes</b> catabolic threonine deaminase, D-serine deaminase, D-cysteine desulfhydrase and diaminopropionate ammonia lyase. This review summarizes the major findings of investigations on fold type II <b>enzymes</b> in the context of similar studies on other PLP-dependent <b>enzymes.</b> Fold type II <b>enzymes</b> participate in pathways of both degradation and synthesis of amino acids. Polypeptide folds of these <b>enzymes,</b> features of their active sites, nature of interactions between the cofactor and the polypeptide, oligomeric structure, catalytic activities with various ligands, origin of specificity and plausible regulation of activity are briefly described. Analysis of the available crystal structures of fold type II <b>enzymes</b> revealed five different classes. The dimeric interfaces found in these <b>enzymes</b> vary across the classes and probably have functional significance...|$|R
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the IMPDH/GMPR {{family of}} <b>enzymes</b> includes IMP dehydrogenase and GMP reductase. These <b>enzymes</b> {{are involved in}} purine metabolism. These <b>enzymes</b> adopt a TIM barrel structure.|$|R
5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> {{production}} (transcription and {{translation of}} <b>enzyme</b> genes) {{can be enhanced}} or diminished by a cell in response {{to changes in the}} cell's environment. This form of gene regulation is called <b>enzyme</b> induction. For example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial beta-lactam ring within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions. <b>Enzyme</b> levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of <b>enzyme</b> degradation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Enzyme</b> rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in the}} saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free <b>enzyme</b> is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the <b>enzyme,</b> all the <b>enzyme</b> active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of <b>enzyme.</b>|$|E

30|$|Since {{commercial}} processes require high temperatures, thermostable <b>enzymes</b> {{are necessary}} for industrial use. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for thermophilic and thermostable producers of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic <b>enzymes,</b> particularly those that are resistant to product inhibition and highly stable (Arora et al. 2014; Mallerman et al. 2015). Recently, thermophilic fungal <b>enzymes</b> have become the subject of increased interest due {{to their ability to}} produce highly efficient, thermostable extracellular <b>enzymes</b> for plant biomass degradation at elevated temperatures. Degradation of lignocellulose by fungi is achieved by producing extracellular hydrolytic and oxidative ligninolytic <b>enzymes.</b> The hydrolytic <b>enzymes</b> cellulase and hemicellulase degrade polysaccharides into simple sugars, whereas ligninolytic ligninase <b>enzymes</b> degrade lignin and open phenyl rings (Sánchez 2009).|$|R
5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are <b>enzyme</b> inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery and improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal <b>enzyme</b> inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the <b>enzyme).</b> A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>enzyme</b> {{kinetics}} studies {{concentrate on}} this initial, approximately linear part of <b>enzyme</b> reactions. However, {{it is also}} possible to measure the complete reaction curve and fit this data to a non-linear rate equation. This way of measuring <b>enzyme</b> reactions is called progress-curve analysis. This approach is useful as an alternative to rapid kinetics when the initial rate is too fast to measure accurately.|$|E

30|$|Streptomycetes {{produce a}} wide variety of <b>enzymes,</b> such as peptidases, lipases, and glucohydrolases. Such <b>enzymes</b> have {{industrial}} applications. To date, we have discovered several <b>enzymes</b> from Streptomyces cinnamoneus TH- 2 (formerly named S. septatus) by screening enzymatic activity. This strain produces extracellular <b>enzymes</b> including phospholipase D, aminopeptidases, and metalloendopeptidases (Arima et al. 2004; Hatanaka et al. 2002, 2005).

5|$|Some <b>enzymes</b> {{are used}} commercially, for example, in the {{synthesis}} of antibiotics.

5|$|Reversible {{inhibition}} can {{be described}} quantitatively {{in terms of the}} inhibitor's binding to the <b>enzyme</b> and to the enzyme-substrate complex, and its effects on the kinetic constants of the <b>enzyme.</b> In the classic Michaelis-Menten scheme below, an <b>enzyme</b> (E) binds to its substrate (S) to form the enzyme–substrate complex ES. Upon catalysis, this complex breaks down to release product P and free <b>enzyme.</b> The inhibitor (I) can bind to either E or ES with the dissociation constants Ki or Ki', respectively.|$|E
5|$|Several enzymes {{can work}} {{together}} in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways. In a metabolic pathway, one <b>enzyme</b> takes the product of another <b>enzyme</b> as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another <b>enzyme.</b> Sometimes more than one <b>enzyme</b> can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one <b>enzyme</b> but an inducible high activity from a second <b>enzyme.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of <b>enzyme</b> {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical <b>enzyme</b> {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just one type of <b>enzyme</b> out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal.
