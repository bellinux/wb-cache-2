50|$|Although {{some debate}} {{continues}} regarding {{the reliability of}} such tests, {{it has been suggested}} that psychoacoustic tuning curves (PTCs) and threshold-equalising noise (TEN) results may be useful in detecting dead regions, rather than PTA. PTCs are similar to neural tuning curves. They illustrate the level of a masker (dB SPL) tone at threshold, as a function of deviation from center <b>frequency</b> (<b>Hz).</b> They are measured by presenting a fixed low intensity pure tone while also presenting a narrow-band masker, with a varying center frequency. The masker level is varied, so that the level of masker needed to just mask the test signal is found for the masker at each center frequency. The tip of the PTC is where the masker level needed to just mask the test signal is the lowest. For normal hearing people this is when the masker center frequency is closest to the frequency of the test signal (See Figure 9).|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} elicit a stretch reflex in the muscles, the major {{contributing}} factor {{to the training}} results {{that can be achieved}} with vibrating platforms, the up-down movement is the most important. The platform is vibrated upwards to work directlyagainst gravity and therefore is called [...] "hyper-gravity". High Energy Lineal Machines can overload the muscles up to 6 times(6G), high energy pivotal Machines up to 30g in the upward phase; meaning the person on the platform is weight training using their own body mass. Nevertheless, the internal forces in the joints during vibration training stay in the range of walking (1.2 times body weight). The training <b>frequency</b> (<b>Hz)</b> is another of the important factors involved. The human body is designed to absorb vertical vibrations better due to the effects of gravity; however, many machines vibrate in more than one direction: sideways (x), front and back (y) and up and down (z). The z-axis has the largest amplitude and is the most defining component in generating and inducing muscle contractions.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact on}} {{stability}} {{and control of}} small general aviation aircraft, resulting from ice accumulation on the elevator horn balance, is investigated using an experimental data set. The purpose {{is to determine the}} linear and non-linear coupling mechanisms between the ice-induced unsteady flow field and the structural response of the elevator horn balance. The linear and quadratic relations between the two unsteady systems are obtained by employing higher-order statistical signal processing based on a non-orthogonal, second-order, single-input/single-output Volterra model. In this way the frequency- and angle of attack ranges, for which lock-in occurs, are identified for different ice configurations on the leading edges of the elevator horn balances and its deflection angle.
