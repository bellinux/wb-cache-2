50|$|Grain {{boundaries}} are the preferential site for segregation of impurities, which may form {{a thin layer}} with a different composition from the bulk. For example, {{a thin layer of}} silica, which also contains impurity cations, is often present in silicon nitride. These grain boundary phases are thermodynamically stable and can be considered as quasi-two-dimensional phase, which may undergo to transition, similar to those of bulk phases. In this case structure and chemistry abrupt changes are possible at a critical value of a thermodynamic parameter like temperature or pressure. This may strongly affect the macroscopic properties of the material, for example the electrical resistance or creep rates. Grain boundaries can be analyzed using equilibrium thermodynamics but cannot be considered as phases, because they do not satisfy Gibbs'definition: they are inhomogeneous, may have a gradient of structure, composition or properties. For this reasons they are defined as complexion: an interfacial material or stata that is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its abutting phases, with a finite and stable thickness (that is typically 2-20 Å). A complexion need the abutting phase to exist and its composition and structure need to be different from the abutting phase. Contrary to bulk phases, complexions also depend on the abutting phase. For example, silica rich amorphous layer present in Si3N3, is about 10 Å thick, but for special boundaries this <b>equilibrium</b> <b>thickness</b> is zero. Complexion can be grouped in 6 categories, according to their thickness: monolayer, bilayer, trilayer, nanolayer (with <b>equilibrium</b> <b>thickness</b> between 1 and 2 nm) and wetting. In the first cases the thickness of the layer will be constant; if extra material is present it will segregate at multiple grain junction, while in the last case there is no <b>equilibrium</b> <b>thickness</b> and this is determined by the amount of secondary phase present in the material. One example of grain boundary complexion transition is the passage from dry boundary to biltilayer in Au-doped Si, which is produced by the increase of Au.|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{question as to}} whether thin intergranular films can adopt an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>thickness</b> in polycrystalline ceramics is addressed. Two continuum approaches are presented, one based on interfacial energies and the other on the force balance normal to the boundary. These indicate that there will exist a stable thickness for the intergranular film and that it will be of the order of 1 nm. The origin of an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>thickness</b> is shown {{to be the result of}} two competing interactions, an attractive van der Waals-disperson interaction between the grains on either side of the boundary acting to thin the film and a repulsive term, due to the structure of the intergranular liquid, opposing this attraction. As both of these interactions are of short range (<lo nm), it is a natural consequence that the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>thickness</b> is of the order of 1 nm, a value commensurate with that observed experimentally in a wide range of ceramics. Two further consequences of importance are indicated. The first is that thin intergranular liquid phases can support a normal stress. The second is that the dielectric constants of the adjacent grains play an important role in determining the thicknesses of the intergranular phase. This leads to the conclusion, consistent with observations, that the thickness of the intergranular phase in polyphase ceramics is expected to be different at boundaries between dissimilar phases than that between like phases.

The data obtained in the present work were used to calculate the surface forces acting between the two oil phases.

For the kinetic component of misfit accommodation, the model uses a dynamic frictional force.

40|$|An imaging {{ellipsometer}} is used {{to study}} the drainage of an aqueous film trapped between a hydrophilic silica equilateral prism surface and a heptane or butylacetate droplet. The interfacial droplet profile on approach to the hydrophilic silica surface is such that the droplet is dimpled at its center with {{the periphery of the}} droplet (the barrier ring) being the region of closest approach to the hydrophilic silica surface. The time it takes for these drops to either achieve an <b>equilibrium</b> film <b>thickness</b> at the barrier ring or to coalesce with the macroscopic hydrophilic silica surface was experimentally determined; drainage time increases whilst <b>equilibrium</b> film <b>thickness</b> decreases with increasing salt concentration in the continuous phase. The increase in drainage time is attributed to hindered drainage of the aqueous film due probably to an increase in the aqueous film viscosity, which should translate into a decrease in the film elasticity. Compression of the double layer may also qualitatively explain the observed decrease in <b>equilibrium</b> film <b>thickness</b> at the barrier ring as the salt concentration increases. When aluminum chloride is used as the electrolyte the <b>equilibrium</b> film <b>thickness</b> is relatively constant (around 90 ? 10 nm) for the range of concentrations studied. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the aluminum ion has a valence of three and may screen electrostatic interactions between the oil droplet and the hydrophilic silica surface at relatively lower aluminum chloride concentrations...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the equilibrium states and more particularly the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>thickness</b> of large lenses of a liquid {{spread over the}} surface of a denser liquid. Both liquids are supposed to be nonvolatile and immiscible. Taking into account the effect of intermolecular forces in addition to the sign of the spreading parameters leads to four possible states. The three first are similar to the states of equilibrium of a liquid spread on a solid surface: total wetting where the floating liquid spreads until it reaches an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>thickness</b> on the order of the molecular size, partial wetting where the floating liquid forms a lens of macroscopic thickness in equilibrium with a "dry" bath, and pseudopartial wetting where the floating liquid spreads as a lens of macroscopic thickness in equilibrium with a thin film covering the bath. The last regime, called pseudototal wetting, consists of a macroscopic lens of the floating liquid covered with a thin film of the bath. These four regimes are described through a free-energy minimization, and their equilibrium thicknesses are predicted. A comparison of this model with experimental results available in the literature and dedicated experiments for the pseudototal wetting state are reported...|$|E

While crystallization of longer methylene sequences occurs before shorter sequences in metallocene PE, forcing shorter methylene sequences into the amorphous phase, all methylene sequences are of the same length in ADMET polyethylene, allowing crystallites of <b>equilibrium</b> lamellar <b>thickness</b> to form from the transient hexagonal mesophase [50].|$|R

40|$|The {{evaporation}} {{rate of water}} ice {{on the surface of}} a planet with an atmosphere involves an equilibrium between solar heating and radiative and evaporative cooling of the ice layer. The thickness of the ice is governed principally by the solar flux which penetrates the ice layer and then is conducted back to the surface.

In the absence of wind, eddy diffusion is caused by the lower density of water vapor in comparison to the density of the Martian atmosphere.

40|$|The {{thin film}} {{pressure}} balance (TFPB) technique {{was used to}} measure the kinetics of thinning of single foam films and disjoining pressures in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and electrolyte (NaCl). The results were analyzed in view of the Reynolds equation to determine the role of surface forces in film thinning. It was found that film thinning is controlled by surface forces at thicknesses below approximately 200 nm. It was found also that hydrophobic force plays an important role particularly at low SDS and NaCl concentrations. The values of the hydrophobic force constant (K- 232) estimated from the film thinning experiments were used to predict the disjoining pressure isotherms using the extended DLVO theory, which were found to be in excellent agreement with experiment. The TFPB technique was also used to measure the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>thicknesses</b> (H-e) of the foam films stabilized by a non-ionic surfactant, n-octanol, in the presence of NaCl. At a given ionic strength, H-e increased noticeably with increasing octanol concentration at very low concentrations.

40|$|The {{thin film}} {{pressure}} balance (TFPB) technique {{was used to}} study the kinetics of film thinning {{in the presence of}} sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium chloride (NaCl). The experimental results were compared with the predictions of the Reynolds equation. During the initial stages, the film thinning was controlled by the capillary pressure. As the film thickness is reduced, the process is controlled by surface forces. The thickness at which the surface forces begin to control the film thinning process vanes with the surfactant and electrolyte concentrations. At low surfactant and electrolyte concentrations, there was an excellent fit between the film thinning experiment and the Reynolds equation corrected for the contributions from the hydrophobic forces to the disjoining pressure. In the present work, the magnitudes of the hydrophobic forces were determined from the <b>equilibrium</b> film <b>thicknesses</b> using the TFPB technique. At low surfactant and high electrolyte concentrations, where it was difficult to determine the <b>equilibrium</b> film <b>thicknesses,</b> contributions from the hydrophobic forces were determined by fitting the film thinning data to the Reynolds equation. The hydrophobic forces determined in the present work decreased with increasing SDS and NaCl concentrations. It may, thus, be the role of surfactant and electrolyte to dampen the hydrophobic force and thereby to retard the film thinning process. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
