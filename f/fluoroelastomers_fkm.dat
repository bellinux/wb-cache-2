The use of biodiesel has, however, been limited by the deteriorative effect of biodiesel on rubber parts in automobile fuel systems. This work therefore aimed at investigating the degradation of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) and <b>fluoroelastomers</b> (<b>FKM)</b> on exposure to biodiesel and HVO at different temperatures and oxygen concentrations in an automated ageing equipment and a high-pressure autoclave. The oxidation of biodiesel at 80 °C was promoted {{by an increase in}} the oxygen partial pressure, resulting in the formation of larger amounts of hydroperoxides and acids in the fuel. The fatty acid methyl esters of the biodiesel oxidized less at 150 °C on autoclave aging, because the termination reactions between alkyl and alkylperoxyl radicals dominated over the initiation reactions. HVO consists of saturated hydrocarbons, and remained intact during the exposure. The NBR absorbed a large amount of biodiesel due to fuel-driven internal cavitation in the rubber, and the uptake increased with increasing oxygen partial pressure due to the increase in concentration of oxidation products of the biodiesel. The absence of a tan δ peak (dynamical mechanical measurements) of the bound rubber and the appearance of carbon black particles devoid of rubber suggested that the cavitation was caused by the detachment of bound rubber from particle surfaces. A significant decrease in the strain-at-break and in the Payne-effect amplitude of NBR exposed to biodiesel was explained as being due to the damage caused by biodiesel to the rubber-carbon-black network. During the high-temperature autoclave ageing, the NBR swelled less in biodiesel, and showed a small decrease in the strain-at-break due to the cleavage of rubber chains. The degradation of NBR in the absence of carbon black was due only to biodiesel-promoted oxidative crosslinking. The zinc cations released by the dissolution of zinc oxide particles in biodiesel promoted reduction reactions in the acrylonitrile part of the NBR. Heat-treated star-shaped ZnO particles dissolved more slowly in biodiesel than the commercial ZnO nanoparticles due to the elimination of inter-particle porosity by heat treatment. The fuel sorption was hindered in HVO-exposed NBR by the steric constraints of the bulky HVO molecules. The extensibility of NBR decreased only slightly after exposure to HVO, due to the migration of plasticizer from the rubber. The bisphenol-cured FKM co- and terpolymer swelled more than the peroxide-cured GFLT-type FKM in biodiesel due to the chain cleavage caused by the attack of biodiesel on the double bonds formed during the bisphenol curing. The FKM rubbers absorbed biodiesel faster, and to a greater extent, with increasing oxygen concentration. It is suggested that the extensive biodiesel uptake and the decrease in the strain-at-break and Young’s modulus of the FKM terpolymer was due to dehydrofluorination of the rubber by the coordination complexes of biodiesel and magnesium oxide and calcium hydroxide particles. An increase in the CH 2 -concentration of the extracted FKM rubbers suggested that biodiesel was grafted onto the FKM at the unsaturated sites resulting from dehydrofluorination.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the time-dependent chemical degradation of a <b>fluoroelastomer,</b> <b>FKM</b> (Viton® A), in an alkaline environment (10 % NaOH, 80 °C). Optical microscopy and SEM analysis reveal that degradation starts with surface roughness right from the earliest stage of exposure (e. g., 1 week) and finally results in cracks on the surface after prolonged exposure. Initially the extent of degradation is mainly confined to the surface regions (a few nanometers) but with longer exposure (e. g., 12 weeks) it extends to below the subsurface region of the fluoroelastomer. The extent of this surface degradation {{is found to be}} strong enough to affect the bulk mechanical properties. The molecular mechanisms of the surface chemical degradation were determined using surface analysis (XPS and ATR-FTIR) where the initial degradation was found to proceed via dehydrofluorination. This leads to double bond formation on the rubber backbone which accelerates the degradation even further with longer exposure. Furthermore, the cross-link sites of the exposed rubber samples are also found to be vulnerable to hydrolytic attack under the studied chemical environment as evidenced by the decrease in cross-link density and gel fraction (%) ...|$|R
40|$|Frictional {{behaviour}} of four sealing elastomers, {{including an}} acrylonitrile butadienerubber (NBR), a hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR), an acrylate rubber(ACM) and a <b>fluoroelastomer</b> (<b>FKM),</b> sliding against a steel surface under unidirectionallubricated conditions have been studied. The lubricant {{used in this}} study was paraffinic oilwith no additive and the experiments were conducted under a block-on-ring testconfiguration. The friction coefficients of the elastomers have been measured at differentsliding velocities in boundary and fluid film lubrication regimes. In the first part of each test,the sliding velocity varied from low to high values and then, in the second part, the slidingvelocity varied from high to low values repeating the same conditions in reverse order. Theresults show that the friction coefficients at low speeds are different for the two parts whichcan be due to the oil absorption or possibly dissolution of some elastomer constituents in theoil. The NBR and the ACM were the least and the most affected elastomer by the lubricantrespectively. The friction coefficients of NBR and ACM at low speeds decreased in thesecond part of the tests (in which the interaction of oil and elastomer was for longerdurations) but the friction coefficient of HNBR and FKM increased {{in the second part of}} thetests.

40|$|Ductile iron (DI) pipes {{have been}} used for the {{conveyance}} of drinking water in drinking water distribution systems over the past several decades. It has been estimated that almost half of all new water mains installed in North America are DI pipes. Although DI pipe itself is resistant to chemical permeation, the polymeric gaskets that join and seal the pipe segments are reported to be susceptible to permeation by organic contaminants. Pipe-drum, diffusion cell experiments, and numerical simulations were conducted in this research to obtain a faster mean to evaluate possible permeations through DI gaskets. Of the five types of gasket materials tested using the gravimetric sorption test, ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) had the highest sorption of gasoline, while <b>fluoroelastomer</b> rubber (<b>FKM)</b> exhibited very low sorption of gasoline. The sorption test results suggested that the least to most resistance to permeation of premium gasoline for the five gasket materials were EPDM, styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), chloroprene rubber (CR; neoprene), acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), and FKM. A typical gasket was found to be made of two portions, the heel and the bulb, of the same polymer but different formulation. Gravimetric sorption tests suggested that the heel portion of all gaskets may be more resistant to permeation than the bulb making it the limiting step for permeation of organic compounds in gasoline. Pipe-drum experiments showed that SBR gasket had the highest permeation rates of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), followed by CR, EPDM, and NBR. With regards to threats to drinking water under water stagnation conditions in the pipe, the 5 μg/L maximum contaminant level (MCL) for benzene will likely be exceeded during an 8 -hour stagnation period for SBR gaskets in contact with free-product premium gasoline. NBR gaskets were found to be sufficiently resistant to permeation by benzene or other BTEX compounds in gasoline and the benzene concentration is unlikely to exceed EPA MCLs. Assessment based on data from the pipe-drum experiments suggested that when there is flow of water in the pipe, benzene and other BTEX compounds in gasoline will not exceed EPA MCLs. A diffusion cell device was developed to obtain diffusion coefficients of BTEX compounds for various gasket materials under controlled conditions. Using curve fitting of the permeation data by numerical modeling, the diffusion coefficients of BTEX compounds through SBR and NBR gasket materials was found to range from 10 - 7 to 10 - 8 cm 2 /s. The steady-state permeation rates were found to correlate in a linear relationship with thickness while the diffusion coefficients were found to be invariable to the thickness of the polymer tested (2 mm to 5 mm). The diffusion cell provided a rapid, inexpensive, and relatively well-controlled means to study permeation of polymeric gasket materials for DI pipes and the data obtained were used to model benzene permeation of the pipe-drum experiments. The permeation of benzene through a 4 -inch SBR gasket of a pipe joint was modeled using Multiphysics diffusion module. The simulations showed that the heel portions as well as part of the bulb portions of a gasket were likely to be in contact with the contaminants. Model simulation predicted that a 4 -inch SBR gasket under hydrostatic pressure would permeate more organic chemicals than a pipe without hydrostatic pressure, posing greater risk to organic chemical permeations. Increase in the length/size of the bulb portion of a 4 -inch SBR gasket by compression or swelling from 10 % to 30 %, reduced the permeated mass of benzene by about 29 % to 71 % within 150 days of exposure to gasoline. In summary, SBR and NBR gaskets are compatible with any level of gasoline contamination in groundwater. NBR gasket is the most effective choice when a gasket material resistant to gasoline is desired. Diffusion cell experiments in combination with numerical simulations can be used in evaluating possible BTEX permeations effectively. Gasket exposure area and its orientation in the socket after pipe joint assembly are likely to affect permeation path and permeated mass of contaminants. Results from this study {{can be used as a}} basis for crisis management for DI pipes exposed to gasoline and for development of a better gasket to improve the reliability of infrastructure of development of water distribution system...|$|R
