50|$|This is a steep wall, {{where the}} current brings large {{pelagics}} like whitetip sharks, leopard sharks, jack, tuna, snapper and barracuda. Drift diving {{can be done}} {{with the help of a}} <b>grab</b> <b>line</b> permanently secured at 24 m across a relatively flat area on the upcurrent side of the point. Currents can be fierce with down currents.|$|E
5000|$|A snatch-block can {{be closed}} around a <b>line,</b> to <b>grab</b> the <b>line,</b> rather than {{threading}} {{the end of}} the line through the block.|$|R
50|$|The Multi-Line {{was capable}} of driving {{multiple}} 19.2Kb RS485 serial lines in a multi-drop configuration. The serial I/O was polled. A given terminal would wait until it was addressed, and <b>grab</b> the <b>line</b> and send any data it had pending.|$|R
5000|$|Interchange was {{released}} {{to allow the}} TBBS system to <b>grab</b> outgoing modem <b>lines</b> to dial other services, networking multiple BBS systems together.|$|R
50|$|The brake usually {{rides on}} a line running {{perpendicular}} to the boom; when the boom brake is actuated, it <b>grabs</b> the <b>line</b> and either works as a preventer, or slows the boom’s speed while jibing. The brake is actuated by either tensioning the line upon which it rides or using a second line to tension the brake relative to the main line.|$|R
40|$|I {{had plenty}} of warning about the task of writing this, my first Editorial. Perhaps it says {{something}} of the personality of emergency physicians that we thrive on the challenge of deadlines. A quick search of the brain for that pithy saying, that attention <b>grabbing</b> first <b>line</b> that seizes the reader and shakes an earnest five minutes from a full agenda. Beginning a new venture is difficult for all of us. Particularly when the precedent has been set at such a high standard [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The lining {{may also}} become {{contaminated}} by oil or leaked brake fluid. Typical symptoms will be brake chatter, where the pads vibrate as the <b>lining</b> <b>grabs</b> and releases the rotor's surface. The {{solution is to}} repair {{the source of the}} contamination and replace the damaged pads.|$|R
50|$|In {{the interim}} the beach cart had arrived {{and it was}} decided to try the {{breeches}} buoy to effect a rescue. Two shots from the Lyle Gun were fired across the Ulrica, but the crew was too cold to retrieve the line. The third shot fell close enough for the crew to <b>grab</b> the <b>line,</b> but because of the crew's exhausted state they were unable to make the line fast high enough in the rigging. Under these conditions Captain James thought it was too dangerous to use the breeches buoy and decided to make another attempt using the surfboat.|$|R

50|$|At 7:21, {{while the}} Hindenburg {{was at an}} {{altitude}} of 295 ft, the mooring lines were dropped from the bow; the starboard line was dropped first, followed by the port line. The port line was overtightened as it was connected to the post of the ground winch. The starboard line had still not been connected. A light rain began to fall as the ground crew <b>grabbed</b> the mooring <b>lines.</b>|$|R
25|$|Priscilla Tirado was {{too weak}} to <b>grab</b> the <b>line</b> when the {{helicopter}} returned to her. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped out onto the helicopter skid and grabbed her by the clothing to lift her onto the skid with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered.|$|R
5000|$|In recovery, the parasail {{is used to}} lift a {{tow line}} into the sky, with the tow line {{trailing}} a series of recovery lines hanging between the parasail and the ship. The drone is flown into the recovery lines, and a snaplock mechanism on the drone's wing <b>grabs</b> onto a <b>line.</b> The drone is then reeled {{back down to the}} ship. The tow line has more [...] "give" [...] to it than a recovery net, reducing the likelihood of damage.|$|R
50|$|Skutnik is {{a retired}} {{printing}} and distribution assistant for the Congressional Budget Office, generally known for his act of heroism following the crash of Air Florida Flight 90 into the Potomac River, Washington, D.C, on January 13, 1982. At the time, Skutnik was a U.S. government office assistant. During the rescue operation of passengers from the crashed plane, one passenger, Priscilla Tirado (who lost her husband and infant son in the plane crash), {{was too weak to}} <b>grab</b> the <b>line</b> dropped from a helicopter. Hundreds of people were watching, including emergency services personnel. Skutnik saw the situation, stripped off his coat and boots and, in short sleeves, dove into the icy water, swimming nearly 30 feet out to assist her. He succeeded in getting Tirado to the river shore, where she was subsequently taken to the hospital, saving her life.|$|R
50|$|Heston {{later wrote}} {{that his first}} {{touchdown}} at Michigan was his greatest thrill in football. His first game for Michigan was a September 1901 match against Albion College. Heston was put into {{the game in the}} second half. While sitting on the bench, he noticed that Albion's quarterback made long lateral passes to the backs. Heston snuck through the <b>line,</b> <b>grabbed</b> the ball as the quarterback was trying to throw it to a back, and ran the ball back 30 yards for his first Michigan touchdown.|$|R
50|$|Agee led off {{the game}} for the Mets with a home run off of Jim Palmer, then saved at least five runs with his defense. With two out in the fourth and Oriole runners on first and third, Agee raced to the 396-foot sign in left-center and made a backhanded running catch of a drive hit by Elrod Hendricks. In the seventh, the Orioles had the bases loaded with two out, but Agee made a headfirst diving <b>grab</b> of a <b>line</b> drive hit by Paul Blair in right-center.|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is dynamic geometry, {{a new way of}} {{exploring}} classical geometry using interactive computer software. This kind of software allows the user to make geometric constructions on a computer's screen. The constructions might consist of points, lines and conics whose positions have been constrained in various ways. The constraints, which may involve incidences, distances and angles, can be added and removed dynamically. For example, to force a line to always be incident on a point, the user would simply <b>grab</b> the <b>line</b> with the cursor and drop it onto the point. Any object whose position is not completely determined by the constraints can be grabbed and dragged around on the screen. The rest of the objects will then automatically self-adjust {{in order to keep the}} constraints satised. Dynamic geometry software is primarily used for teaching mathematics, but is useful in any situation where it is important to understand the geometric properties of a dynamic system. Over the last few years, a number of tools for dynamic geometry have bee...|$|R
40|$|The HERMES cold-water coral {{database}} is {{a combination}} of historical and published sclerectinia cold-water coral occurrences (mainly Lophelia pertusa) and new records of the HERMES project along the European margin. This database will be updated if new findings are reported. New or historical data can be sent to Ben De Mol (mailto:bendemol@ub. edu). Besides geocodes a second category indicates the coral species and if they are sampled alive or dead. If absolute dating is available of the corals this is provide together with the method. Only the framework building cold-water corals are selected: Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata and common cold-water corals often associated with the framework builders like: Desmophyllum sp and Dendrophylia sp. in comments other observed corals are indicated. Another field indicates if the corals are part of a large build-up or solitary. A third category of parameters is referencing {{to the quality of the}} represented data. In this category are the following parameters indicated: source of reference, source type (such as Fishermen location, scientific paper, cruise reports). sample code and or name and sample type (e. g. rock dredge, <b>grab,</b> video <b>line).</b> These parameters must allow an assessment of the quality of the described parameters...|$|R
50|$|When a belayer {{needs to}} {{transfer}} the load from his harness to the anchor to escape the system:a rope grab (mechanical or friction knot/Prusik) {{is placed on the}} load line towards the load, rope is terminated on the rope grab (or the tails of accessory cord are used when using a cordelette with a Prusik as a rope grab) and runs back to the anchor where a Munter mule is tied under tension. The load can then be lowered (transferred) from the original belay onto the Munter Mule via the rope <b>grab.</b> The new <b>line</b> is often consider independent of the safety system so the original belay needs to be maintained throughout the process and secured back to the anchor before the system can be left unattended.|$|R
50|$|Michael {{pulls out}} his own gun, killing another gangster, but is then shot by the two {{remaining}} gang members. Billy leaps and fires, killing one gangster, sending him flying through the bar window. The fourth gangster escapes. Billy approaches Michael, who asks, with his dying words, that Billy find the last gangster. Billy chases the last gang member to the marina across town. The gangster commandeers a yacht, so Billy gets {{the keys to the}} fastest speedboat from the boat boy. The captain orders Billy to let the harbor police catch the thief, but Billy refuses and speeds off. He calls an air unit who arrive on the scene and hoist him a <b>line.</b> Billy <b>grabs</b> onto the <b>line,</b> and lets his speedboat run into the henchman's boat, destroying both.|$|R
5000|$|Another memorable {{performance}} {{occurred in}} Cleveland, Ohio on June 25. The show {{was held at}} Cleveland Municipal Stadium, just {{a short distance from}} Burke Lakefront Airport. Most of the shows opened with a recording of jet airplane taking off, but promoters secretly arranged for the band's Boeing 737 jet to do a low flyover directly over the stadium as the show opened. The FAA later fined the promoters $1,500 over the incident. The show was also delayed briefly by a fan that <b>grabbed</b> the tether <b>line</b> for the inflatable pig and wouldn't release it. At their performance in Boston two nights later, Waters jokingly said [...] "We're going to take a PIG break, back in 20 minutes". He closed the show by gratefully commenting that this had been [...] "the perfect end to the perfect day, good night and God bless".|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a PC-based real time machine vision {{system for the}} quality assurance of canned tuna at a tin rate over 1, 000 tins per minute, allowing the inspection of the tin and its contents, with two main purposes: preventing defective tins from damaging the closure equipment or from reaching the market with a defective closure, and deviating from the production line tins with low quality content: bruised or darkened areas, excessive percentage of crumb, presence of strange bodies, or partially filled tins, such {{that they may be}} fixed and reintroduced in the line without wasting any oil or sauce. The system comprises a iPentium PC with frame <b>grabber,</b> a greyscale <b>line</b> scan CCD camera, a fibre optic halogen lighting system, and a compressed air system for the deviation of the rejected tins, and has been entirely programmed in C++. Keywords: Machine vision, quality assurance, real time image analysis...|$|R
50|$|Along the way, the {{brothers}} encounter a poor little rabbit or hare, flayed and raw-skinned, lying in agony upon a sea shore. The group asks what happened, and the hare {{explains that he}} came from the island of Oki across the sea. He thought of a marvelous way to accomplish this, and recruiting the crocodiles (wani (鰐/和邇), interpreted as an imagined creature based on a shark) into his service, unbeknownst to them. He beckoned one crocodile, and challenged him to a contest to decide which of them had the greater number of kin, the rabbit or the croc-fish. To settle the bet, he told the croc-fish to line up in a straight row across the strait, so he can hop on and count the numbers. But before the hare had completely gotten ashore to safety, he gloated about having tricked them, the last croc in <b>line</b> <b>grabbed</b> him and tore off the fur that clothed him.|$|R
50|$|Undrafted in 1990 {{after four}} years in college, Williams signed with the Chicago Bulls in 1990, playing four seasons with the team, mostly as a reserve, and winning three {{championship}} rings in his first three NBA seasons. On 7 June 1991, in game 3 of the finals against the Lakers, in Los Angeles, he scored four points (all from the free throw <b>line),</b> <b>grabbed</b> two rebounds and handed out two assists in only 11 minutes of play, in an eventual 104-96 overtime win. In 1994, Williams signed with the Philadelphia 76ers, where he played for 4½ injury-plagued seasons before being traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in 1999. His career saw a brief resurgence in Milwaukee, where he averaged career-highs of 7.6 points and 6.6 rebounds during the 1999-2000 season. Until his retirement in 2005, {{at the age of}} 37, he also appeared for the Denver Nuggets, the Phoenix Suns (one ½ seasons), the Dallas Mavericks (27 games) and the Cleveland Cavaliers.|$|R
50|$|Jerry acts out the {{situation}} that Tom made with {{him in front of}} her; watching that, the godmother gives Jerry a bottle of potion, explaining its effects to him in inaudible whispers. They exchange evil grins, and as Jerry thanks her as she disappears, he then pokes his head out of his hole, where he sees a cheese attached to a fishing rod held by Tom. Jerry drinks the potion, which renders him invisible, before leaving his hole unseen. He slowly unties the knot {{at the end of the}} line and takes the cheese into his hole while Tom looks on in wonder, dropping the rod. As the cat lies down with his face near the mouse hole, Jerry <b>grabs</b> the fishing <b>line</b> at the end of the rod and, throwing it as a lasso, hooks Tom's nose and loops the line around his neck, pulling his nose up in a shape somewhat reminiscent of a possum. Tom looks in astonishment before the mouse ties Tom's tail in a knot, flees unseen, and then comes around the corner carrying a pair of scissors. Seeing the blades snipping in his direction, Tom screams, escaping the fishing line and rocketing up to the attic, while the scissors barely cut hairs off of his tail.|$|R
5000|$|After {{winning the}} {{original}} British title, Hemery then entered the 1974 event {{though he was}} struggling with illness. Eventually narrowly beaten by John Conteh, Hemery {{then went on to}} the 1975 European contest where he was beaten again, this time by Ties Kruize. When Kruize suffered serious injuries in a car crash before the final, Hemery was invited to participate and performed bravely, scoring points in every event. He was soundly beaten by Kjell Isaksson, but could still finish second. The rules for European Superstars allowed athletes to compete in [...] "near specialist" [...] events with a handicap, meaning that both Hemery and Isaksson were allowed to run in the 100m and Steeplechase, but only after giving the other finalists a head start. In the final 600m Steeplechase event Hemery had to make up a 100m handicap on his rivals in order to finish in overall second, and valiantly did so, but only after again falling badly at the water jump. Hitting the ground hard while challenging Isaksson for the lead, Hemery rose with a grimace of pain on his face then sprinted for the <b>line,</b> <b>grabbing</b> third. However, as soon as the race was over he collapsed, with the TV cameras showing huge swelling to his injured leg - he had run the last 100m with badly torn ankle ligaments.|$|R
5000|$|... 1889 {{saw another}} round of deaths {{attributed}} to alternating current including a lineman in Buffalo, New York, four linemen in New York City, and a New York fruit merchant who was killed when the display he was using {{came in contact with}} an overhead line. NYC Mayor Hugh J. Grant, in a meeting with the Board of Electrical Control and the AC electric companies, rejected the claims that the AC lines were perfectly safe saying [...] "we get news of all who touch them through the coroners office". On October 11, 1889 John Feeks, a Western Union lineman, was high up in the tangle of overhead electrical wires working on what were supposed to be low-voltage telegraph lines in a busy Manhattan district. As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he <b>grabbed</b> a nearby <b>line</b> that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high-voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded climbing boot. Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering {{for the better part of}} an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below. Where the power came from that killed Feeks was not determined although United States Illuminating Company lines ran near by.|$|R
5000|$|As {{in every}} {{previous}} {{game of the}} series, the Mets {{took control of the}} game in the first inning when first baseman Lucas Duda hit a three-run home run to center field against Cubs starter Jason Hammel. The next batter, catcher Travis d'Arnaud, also hit a home run to make it 4-0. In the second inning, Cubs relief pitcher Travis Wood allowed a two-run double to Duda making it a 6-0 game. Duda's five RBIs tied a Mets record for most in a postseason game. Chicago's first rally came in the fourth when they loaded the bases with no outs for second baseman Starlin Castro. Mets third baseman David Wright made a leaping <b>grab</b> of Castro's <b>line</b> drive to prevent an extra base hit and two runs. However, the Cubs got their first run on an RBI groundout by left fielder Kyle Schwarber. Shortstop Javier Báez popped out in foul territory, stranding two runners and the Cubs were down 6-1. In the fifth inning, after outfielders Dexter Fowler and Jorge Soler reached base, Mets reliever Bartolo Colón struck out third baseman Kris Bryant and the Cubs again stranded two baserunners. In the eighth inning, New York's Daniel Murphy hit a two-run homer, his fourth home run of the series, his seventh of the postseason, and his sixth consecutive game with a home run, a new MLB postseason record. Bryant hit a consolation two-run home run {{in the bottom of the}} eighth to put the Mets lead to 8-3. When closer Jeurys Familia struck out Fowler in the ninth, the Mets were back in the World Series for the first time since 2000. The Cubs never had a lead at any point in the four game series. After hitting [...]529 with the four home runs and a 1.294 slugging percentage for the series, New York's Daniel Murphy was named series MVP.|$|R
