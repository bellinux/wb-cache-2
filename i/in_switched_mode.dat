This generalized concept can be extended from single-phase to multi-phase systems.

40|$|Abstract — Two {{approaches}} of operating inductors <b>in</b> <b>switched</b> <b>mode</b> power converters are compared. The classic method, utilized in most PWM converters, {{is to place}} the inductor in a path that has a non-zero average current. Such inductors are referred to here as "DC inductors". In contrast, inductors that operate with zero average current are denoted "AC inductors". The theoretical analysis carried out in this paper compares the small signal response of the current in the DC and AC inductors {{as a function of}} various system parameters, such as input and output voltages and duty cycle, {{in the case of the}} DC inductor, and frequency in the case of the AC inductor. The analysis was supported by large and small signal model developed in this study and verified against analytically derived large and small signal equations. The small signal current response was derived by applying average models. The analytical derivations and simulations of this study were verified experimentally. Good agreement was found between the theoretical predications and the analytical results. Based on the results of this study one can conclude that "AC inductor " based topologies are optimal for current sourcing applications, such as battery chargers, where differences between the average input and output voltages are expected to exist and develop over time.

This EMI noise is mitigated using Active Common mode EMI filter {{in front of}} the source. Approach: This study proposes a new active common mode Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) filter for switched mode PWM Inverter applications. The proposed filter is based on current sensing and compensation circuit which utilizes fast transistor amplifier for current compensation. The amplifier is biased with an isolated low voltage DC power supply. Hence it is possible to construct an active filter independent of the source voltage of equipment. Thus this filter can be used in any application regardless of working voltage. The proposed switched mode PWM inverter operated in 180 ° mode of operation. It's otherwise called as quasi square wave mode. Results: Simulation of output wave form is verified by using MATLAB Simulink model results and also its effectiveness has been verified hardware output wave forms. The hardware for this project is designed and developed for 50 V, 50 Hz three phase Fractional Horse Power (FHP) motor. Conclusion: In this Study the concept of the new active common mode EMI filter and quasi square PWM inverter has been proposed. The corresponding simulated output waveforms are verified with the Active Common mode EMI filter; it is possible to use low-voltage transistors for the amplifier by introducing coupling capacitors between the power line and the amplifier circuit.

40|$|Planar {{magnetic}} {{elements are}} becoming a replacement for their conventional rivals. Among the reasons supporting their application, is their smaller size. Taking less bulk in the electronic package is a critical advantage from the manufacturing point of view. The planar structure consists of the PCB copper tracks to generate the desired windings. The windings on each PCB layer could be connected in various ways to other winding layers to produce a series or parallel connection. These windings could be applied coreless or with a core depending on the application <b>in</b> <b>Switched</b> <b>Mode</b> Power Supplies (SMPS). Planar shapes of the tracks increase the effective conduction area in the windings, brings about more inductance compared to the conventional windings with the similar copper loss case. The problem arising from the planar structure of magnetic inductors is the leakage current between the layers generated by a pulse width modulated voltage across the inductor. This current value relies on the capacitive coupling between the layers, which in its turn depends on the physical parameters of the planar scheme. In order to reduce this electrical power dissipation due to the leakage current and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), reconsideration in the planar structure might be effective. The aim {{of this research is}} to address problem of these capacitive coupling in planar layers and to find out a better structure for the planar inductance which offers less total capacitive coupling and thus less thermal dissipation from the leakage currents.

40|$|Control {{applications}} of switched mode power supplies {{have been widely}} investigated. The main objective ofresearch and development (R&D) in this field is always {{to find the most}} suitable control method to be implemented in various DC/DC converter topologies. Inother words, the goal is to select a control method capable of improving the efficiency of the converter, reducing the effect of disturbances (line and load variation), lessening the effect of EMI (electro magnetic interference), and beingless effected by component variation. The main objective of this research work is to study different control methods implemented <b>in</b> <b>switched</b> <b>mode</b> power supplies namely (PID control, hysteresis control, adaptive control, current programmed control, variable structure control (VSC), and sliding mode control (SMC). The advantages and drawbacks of each control method are given. Two control methods, the PID and the SMC are selected and their effects on DC/DC (Buck, Boost, and Buck-Boost) converters are examined. Matlab/SimulinkTM is used to implement PID control method in DC/DC Buck converter and SMC in DC/DC (Buck, and Buck Boost) converters. For the prototype, operational amplifiers (op-amps) are used to implement PID control in DC/DC Buck converter. For SMC op-amps are implemented in DC/DC Buck converter and dSPACETM is used to control the DC/DC Buck-Boost converter. The SMC {{can be applied to the}} DC/DC (Buck, Boost, and Buck-Boost) converters. A comparison of the effects of the PID control and the SMC on the DC/DC Buck converter response in steady state, under line variations, load variations, and different component variations is performed. Also the Conducted RF-Emissions between the PID and SMC DC/DC Buck Converter are compared. The thesis shows that, in comparison with the PID control, the SMC provides better steady-state response, better dynamic response, less EMI, inherent order reduction, robustness against system uncertainty disturbances, and an implicit stability proof. Giving a better steady-state and dynamic response, the SMC is implemented in a DC/DC resonant converter. The half-wave zero current switching (HWZCS) DC/DC Buck converter is selected as a converter topology. A general guideline to select the tank component values, needed for the designing of a HWZCS DC/DC Buck, is obtained. The implementation of the SMC to a HWZCS DC/DC Buck converter is analysed.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} several reliability issues for LED lighting systems. Firstly, a full survey on exsiting LED ballast has been conducted, and critical design challenges are classified on power level basis (low/ middle/ high power). Specifically, reliability issues have been highlighted, and three major factors have been stipulated: issue of electrolytic capacitor; issue of current imbalance in parallel LED strings; issue of LED junction temperature. The information revealed in the whole survey provide important design criteria for existing LED system designs and guidance for further research directions by pointing out the critical design problems. Two possible solutions for Electrolytic-Capacitor-Less LED Ballasts are proposed regarding the first reliability issue. A series of novel passive LED ballasts are proposed. They {{are found to be}} suitable for outdoor applications, such as street lighting applications, where the ability to withstand extreme weather conditions are of major concern. When compared with those <b>in</b> <b>switched</b> <b>mode</b> power supplies, these passive ballasts have good power factor performance and comparatively high efficiency. In addition, an active solution has been developed for indoor applications. Its circuit topology is derived from existing differential inverter topologies and inherits same merits such as simple structure, reduced size, and low cost. Self-configurable current-mirror techniques have been derived and developed afterwards to cope with the current imbalance issue for system with parallel LED strings. In contrast with traditional current sharing methods (either linear type or switched type), the proposed techniques offer a simple solution without the need of independent current references, complicated controllers and auxiliary power supplies. These features are favored by outdoor applications and such re-configurable mirror circuits are originally designed for passive LED ballast as post-current regulators. The techniques are further extended with the ability to tolerate possible circuit failure, such as short circuit and open circuit fault. Then, a new non-contact method for the measurement of both junction-to-case thermal resistance and junction temperature in a LED device has been proposed, with respect to the third reliability issue. Traditionally the direct measurement of junction temperature in LED is not easy without the help of sophisticated methods such as laser or expensive equipment like TeraLED Transient Thermal Tester system. In contrast, the proposed method requires only the external LED power, luminous flux, and heatsink temperature information. The method can be further adopted as a simple tool by engineers to check the internal temperature states in a practical LED system for regulation and evaluation purpose. Finally, a thermal design methodology has been developedfor an LED street lamp system powered by a weakly regulated renewable small power grid. It has been successfully incorporated in the proposed passive LED ballast, such that the LED system can provide the least output luminous fluctuation against line voltage variation. It is envisaged that, with the proposed design methodology, such lighting system will not only provide high reliability, with potential lifetime exceeding 10 years, but with a proven feature of reduced light fluctuation, furthermore, it is found that the passive LED system can act as a smart load and has the potential of reducing the energy storage requirement for smart grids. These merits are attractive to public lighting systems powered by future renewable power grids. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
