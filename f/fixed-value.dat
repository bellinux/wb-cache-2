This model implies that, instead of fixed values or ranges, impulses can take any subset of the entire grey-values dynamic range. This model requires a more complex impulse detector, because the noise values do not necessarily locate at the low and high-intensities. We proposed a procedure for impulse value detection using the image entropy. For image restoration, an Adaptive Iterative Mean (AIM) filter is presented. In this filter, the noisy pixels which are farther than their nearest uncorrupted pixel, will be modified in more iterations. The AIM filter outperforms the best existing techniques for SPN and FRIN removal. The proposed method is fast and quite suitable for real-time applications.|$|R

40|$|Impulse {{noise is}} a most common noise which affects the image quality during {{acquisition}} or transmission, reception or storage and retrieval process. Impulse noise comes under two categories: (1) <b>fixed-valued</b> impulse noise, also known as salt-and-pepper noise (SPN) due to its appearance, where the noise value may be either the minimum or maximum value of the dynamic gray-scale range of image and (2) random-valued impulse noise (RVIN), where the noisy pixel value is bounded by {{the range of the}} dynamic gray-scale of the image. In literature, many efficient filters are proposed to suppress the impulse noise. But their performance is not good under moderate and high noise conditions. Hence, there is sufficient scope to explore and develop efficient filters for suppressing the impulse noise at high noise densities. In the present research work, efforts are made to propose efficient filters that suppress the impulse noise and preserve the edges and fine details of an image in wide range of noise densities. It is clear from the literature that detection followed by filtering achieves better performance than filtering without detection. Hence, the proposed filters in this thesis are based on detection followed by filtering techniques. The filters which are proposed to suppress the SPN in this thesis are: Adaptive Noise Detection and Suppression (ANDS) Filter Robust Estimator based Impulse-Noise Reduction (REIR) Algorithm Impulse Denoising Using Improved Progressive Switching Median Filter (IDPSM) Impulse-Noise Removal by Impulse Classification (IRIC) A Novel Adaptive Switching Filter-I (ASF-I) for Suppression of High Density SPN A Novel Adaptive Switching Filter-II (ASF-II) for Suppression of High Density SPN Impulse Denoising Using Iterative Adaptive Switching Filter (IASF) In the first method, ANDS, neighborhood difference is employed for pixel classification. Controlled by binary image, the noise is filtered by estimating the value of a pixel with an adaptive switching based median filter applied exclusively to neighborhood pixels that are labeled noise-free. The proposed filter performs better in retaining edges and fine details of an image at low-to-medium densities of <b>fixed-valued</b> impulse noise. The REIR method is based on robust statistic technique, where adaptive window is used for pixel classification.

30|$|The term {{interpolation}} {{comes from}} the topic of re-sampling described by Hanumantharaju et al. By definition, re-sampling [1] {{is a process of}} transforming a discrete image that is indicated at one particular set of coordinate locations to a new set of coordinate points. In specific, the process of interpolation refers to estimating unknown pixel values by using known pixels, such that the estimated pixel is close to the original pixel. The details usually denotes coordinates, color, gray level, or density with the image having any dimensions. Image interpolation finds many leads in the field of image analysis such as zooming, given by Hanumantharaju et al. [1] and Min et al., [2] resolution enhancement, image impainting, image warping, given by Wing et al. [3] and Bender et al., [4] and geometric transformations. This paper gives a framework for the removal of salt and pepper noise using interpolation methods. Salt and pepper noise is often induced in an image due to faulty camera sensors or due to transmission errors. Filters are the obvious choice for the noise removal. Over the decades, many filters were formulated for salt and pepper noise (SPN) removal, of which non-linear filters were good in removing the noise by preserving the edges. Hence, various non-linear filters were proposed. The standard median filter [5] (SMF) eliminates salt and pepper noise by preserving fine details of an image as described by Huang et al. The main drawback of the SMF is that all the pixels of the images are replaced by median, irrespective whether the pixel is noisy or not. Hence, an adaptive window [6] for increasing noise densities was proposed by Hwang et al. The size of the window affects the performance of the image. A smaller window size does not have sufficient information for noise removal, and on the contrary, a larger window blurs the image. Several special filters such as center-weighted median filter [7] by Ko et al., weighted median filter [8] given by Brownrigg et al., and tristate median filter [9] proposed by Chen et al. were introduced to eliminate <b>fixed-valued</b> salt and pepper noise. These filters either do not restore the pixels or preserve edges for high noise densities. Progressive switching median filter [10] given by Wang et al. uses switching scheme for detection of impulses, thus only proportion of all the images was filtered. This algorithm flutters at high noise densities. Eng et al. proposed a switching median filter [11] which identifies the corrupted pixel by using a decision tree structure and replace it with any of the three filters (all pass, standard median, and a weighted fuzzy filter). The performance of the algorithm was poor at high noise densities. Raymond et al. introduced an algorithm [12] that works in two phases. Initially, the algorithm uses adaptive filter for estimating the pixels if it is noisy or not. In the second phase, a regulation method was applied to the noisy pixels which resulted in noise suppression with preservation of image details. Decision based algorithm [13] was proposed by Srinivasan et al. to eliminate high density impulse noise. This algorithm replaces the corrupted pixel with median value or the preprocessed neighbor. This repeated replacement of preprocessed neighborhood results in streaking. The effect of streaking was minimized using an improved decision based algorithm [14] given by Madhu et al. that used mean of preprocessed pixel which resulted in reduced streaks. A cascaded filters [15] were proposed by Balasubramanian et al. for high density salt and pepper noise. This algorithm initially applies decision based median filter as first stage, and asymmetrical trimmed median and midpoint were applied on the later stage. This algorithm exhibits smoothing effect at high noise densities. A novel decision based asymmetric trimmed median filter [16] was proposed by Aiswarya et al. which used reduced computation for calculation of median by asymmetrical trimming. This algorithm exhibits fading at high noise densities. The performance of asymmetrical trimmed median [17] by Esakkiarajan et al. was improved by finding mean of the window, which was entirely corrupted by salt and pepper noise. The above algorithm was improved further, given by VeeraKumar et al. [18], by replacing the corrupted pixel with trimmed global mean if the entire window is either 0 or 255. A decision based asymmetrical trimmed variants [19] proposed by Vasanth et al. (2012) replaced the corrupted pixel with asymmetrical trimmed midpoint based on the content of the current processing window. An adaptive cardinal B-spline algorithm [20] (ACBSA) given by Syamala Jeyashree et al. exploited the interpolation property of B-spline to estimate a pixel value to replace the corrupted pixel. The adaptive algorithm identifies the corrupted pixel and operates {{based on the number of}} non-noisy pixels in the current processing window. At high noise densities, the edges do smudge. The Recursive Spline Interpolation Filter (RSIF) given by Veerakumar et al. [21] uses vicinity based noise-free pixels and preprocessed non-noisy output. The algorithm too exhibits fading effect at high noise densities. A decision based neighborhood-referred unsymmetrical trimmed variants [22] (DBNRUTVF), Vasanth et al. (2014) uses mean of the four neighbors or asymmetrical trimmed median or asymmetrical trimmed midpoint or the global trimmed mean for the replacement of the corrupted pixels. Hence, few nonlinear operations such as median, spline interpolation, nonlinear mean, asymmetrical trimmed median or asymmetrical trimmed midpoint, polynomial, bilinear, bicubic, etc. were used for the elimination of salt and pepper noise in images and videos. It was observed from the literatures that at high noise densities, the algorithm flatters or induce few ambiguities during noise removal. Peixuan et al. increased the adaptive size of the window [23] by increasing the window size until the two subsequent windows have the same outlier values. The corrupted pixel is replaced by weighted mean value of the current processing window. The adaptive window grows up to 39. At high noise densities, the restored image is attenuated. Hence, a proper noise detection and correction algorithm has to be used for a better result. The organization of the paper is as follows: Section  2 deals with existing interpolation techniques and decision based inverse distance weighted interpolation filter. Section  3 briefs the proposed algorithm. Section  4 gives the methodology of the interpolation technique. Section  5 gives the simulation results and discussions.

Contributions are a <b>fixed-value</b> theorem and two theorems on fanout stem unobservability. Our framework is an implication graph of signal controllabilities and observabilities represented as Boolean variables. Besides the conventional implication edges this graph also contains partial implications implemented by AND nodes. An analysis of the transitive closure (TC) of this graph provides many redundancies. Weaknesses of this procedure are {{in dealing with the}} e ects of xed-valued variables on TC and the lack of observability relations across fanouts.
