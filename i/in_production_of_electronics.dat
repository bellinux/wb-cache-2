40|$|Electroplated {{stainless}} steel alloys containing {{elements such as}} iron, chromium and nickel, are of great interest <b>in</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>electronics</b> and nanotechnology devices. Previous methods for electroplating of these alloys have been found problematic because of little control of composition and layer thickness of the electroplated layers. A new method for electroplating of Fe-Ni-Cr alloys is therefore desirable. The proposed method studied in this work is electrochemical reduction of metal oxides onto a conductive substrate. The {{ultimate goal is to}} develop a reproducible method for electroplating Fe-Ni-Cr alloys onto any conductive substrate, however, the focus in this work was to successfully reduce a mixture of oxides of iron and chromium to an alloy containing the respective metals. Mixtures of Fe 2 O 3 -Cr 2 O 3 or Fe 2 O 3 -Cr(OH) 3 were coated onto Cu substrates and reduced in 50 wt% aqueous NaOH at 114 degrees celsius under a constant cathodic current. Current and reduction time were varied and their effect on the deposits were studied using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Purification of the electrolyte using both a chemical and an electrochemical method, were also pursued. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to analyze the electrolyte before, during and after purification, with respect to the content of iron and nickel. In addition, measures to enhance the adhesion of the oxide layers were taken. SEM images revealed crystals growing on the surface of most samples, which possibly grew, predominantly, through a dissolution-redeposition mechanism. Further analysis with EDS revealed a high content of iron compared to that of oxygen, some chromium was also detected in all samples. However, additional analysis with XRD was necessary to confirm reduction of the oxides. No oxides were detected with XRD, which indicated a successful reduction of the analyzed samples. Further analysis with XPS confirmed the presence of both metallic and oxidized iron, which is to be expected when a metallic surface is analyzed. Small amounts of oxidized chromium was detected and no metallic chromium was found. However, this method only analyzes the topmost 5 - 10 nm. Consequently, {{it is possible that the}} chemistry of the layer is different further down in the sample, as indicated by the XRD analysis where no oxides were detected. It was found that a large cathodic current (- 15 A) and long reduction times (5 h) were the most successful, as this resulted in thicker and more uniform layers with a higher content of chromium. ICP-MS results revealed that the chemical method used for purification, employing high purity Ni(OH) 2 for absorption of iron, was significantly successful in the removal of iron down to almost 1 %. However, the method increased the nickel content in the electrolyte, which is unwanted as nickel is likely to co-deposit along with reduction of the metal oxides. The electrochemical method, which consisted of pre-deposition of metal ions from the solution, was slightly less successful in the removal of iron, but did also reduce the nickel content. Additionally, this method enabled larger volumes to be purified in an acceptable short time, and has the potential of reducing the amounts of all metal impurities. Therefore, the electrochemical method for purification was preferred. The new electroplating method for reduction of metal oxides to their respective metals showed promising results. However, additional characterization of the deposits is necessary to accurately determine whether full reduction of the oxide mixtures was achieved. In addition, further study is necessary to elucidate the operating conditions for successful reduction of Cr 2 O 3 and Cr(OH) 3, and subsequently also the reduction of a nickel oxide, into their respective metals. Furthermore, better adhesion of the oxide layers is necessary to come closer to the ultimate goal of developing a reproducible method for electroplating of Fe-Ni-Cr alloys onto any conductive surface, with precise composition and thickness control...|$|E

Inkjet printing techniques were also applied to develop micro-structural textures {{on the surface of}} the glass substrate and thereby modify the wettability of the substrate. The glass substrate, coated with heptadecafluorodecyltrichlorosilane was micro-structured using a UV curable ink to enhance the wettability for the silver nanoparticle ink. Using inkjet printing techniques to micro-structure the substrate allows modification of the wettability of the substrate whilst simultaneously printing on to the substrate. This enables the potential of increasing the performance of such printed lines, essentially permitting additional particulate material to be deposited thus increasing conductivity. The cross-sectional profile of the printed line was predicted numerically and analytically and compared to experimental data where agreement was observed. In addition, three analytical expressions for printed lines on the substrate were developed by writing the force balance equations in the x, y and z directions on a slice of printed line between z and z+dz...|$|R

Î¼Plasma printing is a technology which combines atmospheric plasma treatment with the versatility of digital on demand printing technology to selectively change the wetting behaviour of materials. In earlier research it was shown that with Î¼Plasma printing {{it is possible to}} selectively improve the wetting behaviour of functional inks on polymer substrates using atmospheric air plasma. In this investigation we show it is possible to selectively change the substrate wetting behaviour using combinations of different plasmas and patterned printing. For air and nitrogen plasmas, increased wetting of printed materials could be achieved on both polycarbonate and glass substrates. A minimal track width of 320 Î¼m for a 200 Î¼m wide plasma needle was achieved. A combination of N 2 with HMDSO plasma increases the contact angle for water up from < 100 to 1050 and from 320 to 460 for DEGDMA making the substrate more hydrophobic. Furthermore using N 2 -plasma in combination with a N 2 /HMDSO plasma, hydrophobic tracks could be printed with similar minimal track width.

It is utilized <b>in</b> the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> printed <b>electronics,</b> Radio Frequency (RF) devices and flexible displays [1 - 2]. A new application includes bump fabrication to electrically connect chip and substrate on semiconductor packages. In practice, wire bonding {{technology has been}} mainly used for these electrical connections, which can be bonded at a low price. At higher frequencies, however, the wire bonding technique reaches the limit for RF applications, because the bonding wire generates a parasitic inductance that degrades the transmission characteristics. On the other hand, flip chip bonding technology has been developed to overcome the disadvantages of wire bonding [3]. Although flip chip bonding technology can be performed minimizing the distance between chip and substrate, the bump fabrication process is very complex. To solve the disadvantage of flip-chip bonding, we propose a new technique, using inkjet-printed bump technology. The key of this technology is to make bumps using inkjet {{printing technology}}, which is cheaper and simpler {{when compared to the}} flip chip bonding method.

As {{the effect of the}} plasma treatment decreases in time, the so-called "aging effect", it is important to gain knowledge on how this effect impacts the wetting behavior of commonly used polymers {{in order to be able}} to optimize <b>production</b> processing times. <b>In</b> this article the authors study the wetting behavior of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) and polyimide (PI) polymer films after plasma treatment in time. The plasma treatment was performed using a novel maskless DBD plasma patterning technology, i. e., Plasma Printing, at atmospheric pressure under nitrogen atmosphere. After treatment, the samples were stored at room temperature at 30 %- 40 % relative humidity for up to one month. An increase in wettability is measured for all polymers directly after Plasma Printing. The major increase in wettability occurs after a small number of treatments, e. g., low energy density. More treatments show no further beneficial gain in wettability. The increase in wettability is mainly due to an increase in the polar part of the surface energy, which can probably be attributed to chemical modification of the surface of the investigated polymers. With the exception of FEP, during storage of the plasma treated polymers, the wettability partially declines in the first five days, after which it stabilizes to approximately 50 % of its original state. The wettability of FEP shows little decline during storage. As the storage time between production steps is mostly under two days, Plasma Printing shows good promise as a pre-treatment step <b>in</b> the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> printed <b>electronics.</b> d c 2013 Society for Imaging Science and Technology...|$|R

40|$|Flexographic {{printing}} is {{a common}} technique <b>in</b> the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> printed <b>electronics.</b> Its flexible printing plates offer many advantages, especially regarding printing on rigid and fragile substrates. Nevertheless, one major drawback is the so-called halo effect where ink is squeezed {{at the edges of}} the raised elements of the printing plate during transfer onto the substrate. The result is a halo-like structure surrounding the desired layout with a zone depleted of ink in-between. The approach of this study is to utilize the halo effect in flexographic printing for the structuring of a resist layer in wet etching processes of silver layers with the goal of integrating this process into printed electronics production. For this, three different aspects need to be considered. The first aspect is the influence of post-processing on printed silver layers. I investigated the effect of several parameters of photonic curing on the etching rate and on the sheet resistance of printed silver nanoparticle layers. For the latter, I utilized design of experiments (DoE). The second aspect is the impact of printing parameters on the behavior of printed lines regarding the halo effect in flexography. I investigated the halo effect of printed line structures on an IGT F 1 printability tester, also utilizing DoE. With this method, I structured a resist layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) for wet etching processes. The third aspect is the transferral of the layout of the printed etch resist to the silver layer using wet etching. For these trials I used nitric acid as etchant. The results of these investigations are the following: The printed silver layers were homogenous with a roughness of few ten nanometers. As expected, photonic curing does increase the conductivity. The extend of the increase depends on the energy density the sample is exposed to. I found a method to evaluate the isotropy of the electrical properties of printed silver layers using the correction factor in van der Pauw measurements. When printing line shaped elements the halo effect needs to be considered. Nearly all printed samples, regardless the printing parameters, show a more or less pronounced halo effect. Here, the most influential parameter is the pick-up volume: A high pick-up volume results in wide halos around a printed line with a distinct void in-between. The second largest impact has the printing force, whereas the influence of the printing speed is almost negligible. It was not possible to determine a relation between degree of post-processing, i. e. energy density during photonic curing, and etching rate. The measurements were inconclusive. Therefore, I used a different dilution of the etchant to transfer the layout of the printed resist structures into the silver layer. Using the halo effect in flexographic printing for structuring the resist layer, we can obtain line widths smaller than those attainable by directly using flexographic printing. To achieve this, anilox rollers with low pick-up volume are needed. Nevertheless, those lines are hardly reproducible. Their line quality needs further improvement regarding edge sharpness, bulging and interruptions...|$|R

40|$|Silicon-based {{materials}} are of vital importance in todayâs society. From {{the sand and}} clay dug up from the Earth {{to be used in}} construction, to the highly purified forms used <b>in</b> the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>electronics,</b> computers and medical implants, the chemical element Si has found its way into nearly every aspect of our lives. Nevertheless, our highly technological world is fueled by an ever-lasting quest for progress. This search continuously increases the demand for new materials with improved or new properties. One imaginative approach towards novel material design and synthesis starts from relatively small supramolecular building blocks that can be combined in ingenious ways to create highly specialized compounds. Within the world of silicon-based materials the octameric oligomer [Si 8 O 12], also known as the double four ring (D 4 R), is seen by many as such a potential building block. Considering its highly symmetrical near-cubic shape and the possibility to attach functional groups to each of its eight corners, one can imagine many different structures based on this versatile building unit. Up until now some attempts have been made in connecting D 4 R units in a controllable fashion, one of which by the connection with silicone linkers. Some of the reported materials were synthesized by reacting bifunctional silanes with the D 4 R units of a cyclosilicate hydrate. The large amounts of water molecules present in previously available D 4 R sources, however, rendered controlling the length of the silicone linkers very difficult, due to undesired oligomerization side reactions of the silane reagent. Alternative synthesis pathways suffer from a similar lack of control. Cyclosilicate hydrate chemistry does, however, provide hints at lowering the water content in the precursor material. Cyclosilicate hydrate structures made in the presence of hexamethyleneimine or tetrabutylammonium hydroxide both consist out of hydrogen bonded D 4 R units and contain much less water compared to conventionally used D 4 R sources. In this doctoral research, the possibility of using these alternative precursor materials as D 4 R source to synthesize D 4 R-silicone copolymers while exerting some control on the length of the connecting silicone linkers, was investigated. The resulting copolymers are referred to as polyoligosiloxysilicones, or POSiSils in short. This approach was proven successful as a first POSiSil material was synthesized from the hexamethyleneimine cyclosilicate hydrate and dimethyldichlorosilane. The resulting copolymer, which was given the code PSS- 1 after polyoligosiloxysilicone number 1, was shown to consist out of alternating D 4 R units connected solely by dimethylsilicone monomers. Electron microscopy imaging indicated preferential unidirectional growth of the copolymer. A model of PSS- 1 is proposed consistent with all experimental data, having an arrangement of D 4 R units in similar columnar structures as in the parent material with the columns being connected either by strong Van der Waals forces or by sporadic crosslinking. The synthesis of PSS- 1 would then be the first case of silicone-like materials wherein zero dimensional building blocks (D 4 R) from an already pre-organized structure are permanently fixed by the direct insertion of reactive linkers. A second member of the POSiSil family, referred to as PSS- 2, was made by reacting tetrabutylammonium cyclosilicate hydrate with dimethyldichlorosilane. PSS- 2 appeared to be a dense, amorphous material consisting of a network of D 4 R units systematically connected by short silicone chains. These chains are most likely composed of a roughly equal amount of dimeric and trimeric dimethylsilicone linkers. Permanent porosity of PSS- 2 was achieved by eliminating residual tetrabutylammonium cyclosilicate hydrate embedded inside partially transformed PSS- 2 polymer, by calcination. The collapse of the sacrificial parent material leaves nanovoids inside PSS- 2, which theoretically should be both flexible and hydrophobic. As the composition of PSS- 2 is far more complex than PSS- 1, the further development of such a challenging class of materials demanded greater insight in their structure. The Silicon connectivity of PSS- 2 was thus investigated at a deeper level using more advanced solid-state 29 Si NMR methods. In a first part 1 HÃ  29 Si multiple contact cross polarization (MC-CP) was shown to provide quantitative data in a much shorter time frame compared to traditional single pulse experiments. In a second part, the ensemble of NMR data, including challenging 29 Si- 29 Si double quantum â single quantum (DQ-SQ) MAS NMR experiments was used to gain more precise information about the surprisingly organized structure of PSS- 2. In future work this insight will prove indispensable for the further development of the POSiSil family. In the final part a new synthesis pathway to D 4 R-based spherosilicates with the synthesis of the previously inaccessible and highly reactive [Si 8 O 12][OSi(CH 3) 2 Cl] 8 spherosilicate suited for derivatization or hybrid material synthesis, is achieved. The minimal water content in this new elegant pathway not only enables the use of bifunctional silanes for functionalization, it also limits wasting silylating agents to unwanted side reactions. By altering the silylating agent the new synthesis pathway enables the quantitative synthesis of other spherosilicates such as the commonly used [Si 8 O 12][OSi(CH 3) 2 H] 8 spherosilicate with high yield and purity. This work has opened the way to the new family of POSiSil materials, situated next to existing families of nanoporous materials such as zeolites and metalorganic frameworks (MOFs). The variability of cyclosilicate and linkers makes the POSiSil family potentially as large as the latter families.

5000|$|Cryotronics is the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>electronics</b> that utilize superconductivity, {{and is not}} to be {{confused}} with cryoelectronics or cryolectronics. The simplest use of cryotronics is the cryotron, which is a switch. Rapid single flux quantum digital electronics technology is a good example of cryotronics, as it is based on superconductors. Additionally, the sensitive amplifiers used in radio telescopes are cooled using liquid helium to reduce thermal noise. Cryotronics includes creating,1.supersensitive miniature receivers for detecting weak radio signals.2.a crytron switch depends on the effect of inducing persistent current in a closed superconducting circuit for eg.ring ...|$|R

2500|$|Monocrystalline silicon is {{expensive}} to produce, {{and is usually}} justified only <b>in</b> <b>production</b> <b>of</b> integrated circuits, where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths. For other uses, other types of pure silicon may be employed. These include hydrogenated amorphous silicon and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) used <b>in</b> the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> low-cost, large-area <b>electronics</b> <b>in</b> applications such as liquid crystal displays and of large-area, low-cost, thin-film solar cells. Such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline, and are produced in comparable quatities as the monocrystalline silicon: 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per year. [...] The market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon. By 2013, polycrystalline silicon <b>production,</b> used mostly <b>in</b> solar cells, was projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year, while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than 50,000 tons/year.|$|R
