25|$|The {{history of}} Taoism {{stretches}} throughout Chinese history. Originating in prehistoric China, it has exerted a powerful influence over Chinese culture throughout the ages. Taoism evolved {{in response to}} changing times, with its doctrine and associated practices being revised and refined. The acceptance of Taoism by the ruling class has waxed and waned, alternately enjoying periods of favor and rejection. Most recently, Taoism <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> a period of suppression and is undergoing a revival in China.|$|E

The south and west of the region have historically had industrial based economies, although they have been moving away from this in recent decades.

The adults feed on fermented fruit and on tree sap, and the males are known to land on damp patches of ground to suck up moisture.|$|E

25|$|In India, {{the need}} for {{environmental}} flows <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the hundreds of large dams being planned in the Himalayan rivers for hydro power generation. The cascades of dams planned across the Lohit, Dibang River in the Brahmaputra River , the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi River in the Ganga basin and the Teesta in Sikkim for example, {{would end up in}} the rivers flowing more through tunnels and pen stocks rather than the river channels. There have been some recommendations by various authorities (Courts, Tribunals, Expert Appraisal Committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)) on releasing e-flows from dams. However, these recommendations have never been backed by strong objectives about why certain e-flow releases are needed.|$|E

Next, we see the young Jesus engaged in discussions with the two lawyers. Then Jesus is shown holding the hands of two lost souls who he has rescued from the open mouth of hell ("Abandon all hope ye who enter here") from which flames emerge and other lost souls writhe in agony, including the legendary Kattell Gollet. A demon sits above the mouth orchestrating proceedings and another with horns is with the others in the mouth itself.|$|E

25|$|A second kind of {{experiment}} resembles the ordinary double-slit experiment. The schematic diagram of this experiment {{shows that a}} lens {{on the far side}} of the double slits makes the path from each slit diverge slightly from the other after they cross each other fairly near to that lens. The result is that at the two wavefunctions for each photon will be in superposition within a fairly short distance from the double slits, and if a detection screen is provided within the region wherein the wavefunctions are in superposition then interference patterns will be seen. There is no way by which any given photon could have been determined to have arrived from one or the other of the double slits. However, if the detection screen is removed the wavefunctions on each path will superimpose on regions of lower and lower amplitudes, and their combined probability values will be much less than the unreinforced probability values at the center of each path. When telescopes are aimed to intercept the center of the two paths, there will be equal probabilities of nearly 50% that a photon will show up in one of them. When a photon is detected by telescope 1, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the lower slit. When one is detected in telescope 2, researchers may associate that photon with the wavefunction that emerged from the upper slit. The explanation that supports this interpretation {{of experiment}}al results is that a photon <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> one of the slits, and that is the end of the matter. A photon must have started at the laser, passed through one of the slits, and arrived by a single straight-line path at the corresponding telescope.|$|E
500|$|Marxists, who {{are skeptical}} of right-wing populist {{conspiracy}} theories, also accuse the global power elite {{of not having}} {{the best interests of}} all at heart, and many intergovernmental organizations of suffering from a democratic deficit, but they argue that the superclass are plutocrats only interested in brazenly imposing a neoliberal or neoconservative new world order—the implementation of global capitalism through economic and military coercion to protect the interests of transnational corporations—which systematically undermines the possibility of a socialist one-world government. Arguing that the world {{is in the middle of}} a transition from the American Empire to the rule of a global ruling class that <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> within the American Empire, they point out that right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, blinded by their anti-communism, fail to see is that what they demonize as the [...] "New World Order" [...] is, ironically, the highest stage of the very capitalist economic system they defend.|$|E
500|$|The critic {{writing for}} The Times thought that Bond was [...] "backed up by sound writing" [...] by Fleming. Although the plot was grandiose, the critic noted that: [...] "it sounds – and is – fantastic; {{the skill of}} Mr. Fleming is to be {{measured}} {{by the fact that}} it is made not to seem so." [...] For The Times Literary Supplement, Michael Robson considered that [...] "a new Bond <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> these pages: an agent more relaxed, less promiscuous, less stagily muscular than of yore." [...] Bond was not the only thing that was more relaxed, according to Robson, as [...] "the story, too, is more relaxed." [...] Robson saw this as a positive development, but it did mean that although [...] "there are incidental displays of the virtuosity to which Mr. Fleming has accustomed us, ...the narrative does not slip into top gear until Goldfinger unfolds his plan". The Evening Standard looked at why Bond was a success and listed [...] "the things that make Bond attractive: the sex, the sadism, the vulgarity of money for its own sake, the cult of power, the lack of standards". The Sunday Times called Goldfinger [...] "Guilt-edged Bond", whilst the Manchester Evening News thought that [...] "Only Fleming could have got away with it...outrageously improbable, wickedly funny, wildly exciting".|$|E

500|$|The American {{military}} establishment strongly backed Diệm. Colonel Edward Lansdale, a CIA agent who helped entrench Diệm {{in power in}} 1955, ridiculed Durbrow's comments and called on the Eisenhower administration to recall the ambassador. Lansdale said that [...] "It is most doubtful that Ambassador Durbrow has any personal stature remaining. Diệm must feel that Durbrow sided with the rebels emotionally. Perhaps he feels that Durbrow's remarks over the months helped incite the revolt." [...] Lansdale criticised Durbrow: [...] "At the most critical moment of the coup, the U.S. Ambassador urged Diệm {{to give in to}} rebel demands to avoid bloodshed." [...] Lieutenant General Lionel McGarr, the new commander of the Military Assistance Advisory Group, agreed with Lansdale. McGarr had been in contact with both the rebel and loyalist units during the standoff and credited the failure of the coup to the [...] "courageous action of Diệm coupled with loyalty and versatility of commanders bringing troops into Saigon". McGarr asserted that [...] "Diệm <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> this severe test in position of greater strength with visible proof of sincere support behind him both in armed forces and civilian population." [...] General Lyman Lemnitzer, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff said that [...] "When you have rebellious forces against you, you have to act forcibly and not restrain your friends. The main point is that sometimes bloodshed can't be avoided and that those in power must act decisively." [...] The State Department advised President Dwight David Eisenhower to send Diệm a congratulatory message, but Durbrow objected, arguing that Diệm would interpret the message as an unqualified endorsement of his rule and prevent him from [...] "grasping and heeding lessons of [...] coup".|$|E
