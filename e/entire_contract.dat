25|$|If {{the terms}} of the {{contract}} are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement {{in the eyes of the}} law. An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as price or safety, may cause the <b>entire</b> <b>contract</b> to fail. However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract. In New South Wales, even if there is uncertainty or incompleteness in a contract, the contract may still be binding on the parties if there is a sufficiently certain and complete clause requiring the parties to undergo arbitration, negotiation or mediation.|$|E

25|$|The {{result was}} the New York Arbitration Act of 1920, {{followed}} by the United States Arbitration Act of 1925 (now known as the Federal Arbitration Act). Both made agreements to arbitrate valid and enforceable (unless one party could show fraud or unconscionability or some other ground for rescission which undermined {{the validity of the}} <b>entire</b> <b>contract).</b> Due to the subsequent judicial expansion of the meaning of interstate commerce, the U.S. Supreme Court reinterpreted the FAA in a series of cases in the 1980s and 1990s to cover almost the full scope of interstate commerce. In the process, the Court held that the FAA preempted many state laws covering arbitration, some of which had been passed by state legislatures to protect their consumers against powerful corporations.|$|E
25|$|The lending {{agreements}} {{called for}} all disputes between the borrower and lender {{to be settled}} in arbitration. The original plaintiffs argued that the <b>entire</b> <b>contract,</b> including the arbitration clause, was invalid because it violated the law. When it was appealed to the High Court, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote {{for a majority of}} seven that the Federal Arbitration Act, as previously interpreted by the Court, settled a question that had long been debated by legal scholars and lower-court judges. The opinion distinguished void and voidable contracts, requiring that in the latter an arbitrator rule on all issues including the legality of the contract unless the arbitration clause was itself challenged. The only dissenter was Clarence Thomas, who restated his belief that the Arbitration Act does not supersede state law.|$|E
25|$|If the {{raise in}} the third season is greater than 4.5% of the first year, the {{offering}} team {{must be able to}} fit the average of the <b>entire</b> <b>contract</b> under their cap. Through the 2016–17 season, the accounting was different for the player's original team, where the player's salary for a given year—not the contract's average—was counted against the cap. In some cases, the offering team could exploit a loophole to create what is referred to as a poison pill for the player's original team, potentially forcing the original team to pay the luxury tax by the third season, as the Houston Rockets did in order to sign Jeremy Lin and Ömer Aşık away from the New York Knicks and Chicago Bulls, respectively. This could discourage them from matching the offer sheet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{deregulated}} {{power system}} offers more {{benefits to the}} customers {{so that it is}} quite popular in now a days. Due to the enormous rise of power demand, the existing power system is operated very closer to its stability limits. So we get two major problems like transmission congestion and voltage instability problems in power system. These are very serious problems which causes severe damage to the total power system. Due to the congestion in the network, there is not always possible to transmit the <b>entire</b> <b>contracted</b> power at all situations. The above mentioned problems are managed by using series FACTS devices. But for getting more benefits from these FACTS devices, we place those devices in optimal location. In this paper two different methodologies such as sensitivity approach and pricing approaches were going to be discussed to place the series FACTS devices in optimal location to manage the transmission congestion and voltage instability problems. These methods are tested on modified IEEE 14 bus system...|$|R
25|$|The company {{moved to}} have the case {{dismissed}} and compel arbitration. When that was denied, it petitioned the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal which ruled that arbitration was required because the <b>entire</b> <b>contract</b> had been challenged, not the severable arbitration clause. But then that decision was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which reversed {{on the grounds that}} the contract was illegal ab initio and thus the arbitration clause was unenforceable. It read Prima Paint to distinguish between void contracts that could never have legal standing, such as the one at issue, and voidable contracts where that result could come to pass later as a result of dispute resolution but where the contract was legal on its face. One justice of that court, Raoul Cantero, dissented, saying that the majority was ignoring the actual language of the FAA.|$|E

2500|$|The {{validity}} of arbitration clauses in the US {{is not a}} settled legal matter. Typically, the {{validity of}} an arbitration clause is decided by a court rather than an arbitrator. However, if {{the validity of the}} entire arbitration agreement is in dispute, then the Supreme Court of the United States case of Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson may apply. In that case, the court held that [...] "under the FAA, where an agreement to arbitrate includes an agreement that the arbitrator will determine the enforceability of the agreement, if a party challenges specifically the enforceability of that particular agreement, the district court considers the challenge, but if a party challenges the enforceability of the agreement as a whole, the challenge is for the arbitrator." [...] In other words, the law typically allows federal courts to decide these types of [...] "gateway" [...] or validity questions, but the Supreme Court ruled that since Jackson targeted the <b>entire</b> <b>contract</b> rather than a specific clause, the arbitrator decided the validity.
