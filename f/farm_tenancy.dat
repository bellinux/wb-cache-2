50|$|The {{new kind}} of tenancy {{introduced}} in the 1995 Act is called a <b>Farm</b> Business <b>Tenancy</b> ("FBT") and since 1995, almost all new agricultural lettings have used this framework. However, tenancies created under the 1986 Act remain in force and unchanged by the subsequent legislation. The 1995 Act has been amended somewhat in the Regulatory Reform Order 2006. This has, in a modest way, streamlined, simplified and deregulated <b>Farm</b> Business <b>Tenancies</b> to an even greater extent.|$|R

50|$|The current regime {{under the}} 1995 Act for {{regulating}} tenancies, {{commonly known as}} <b>Farm</b> Business <b>Tenancies,</b> permits {{the creation of a}} clearly and easily terminable interest, whether by a periodic tenancy or a fixed term. In the cycle of animal husbandry and land use and improvement, the long-term effect of the <b>Farm</b> Business <b>Tenancy</b> on the landscape of Britain is not yet proven. It was predicted by landowners and other industry spokesmen that the 1995 Act would create opportunities for new tenants by allowing large areas of new lettings but this has not happened in practice as most landowners have continued to favour share farming or management agreements over formal tenancies and the majority of new lettings under the Act have been to existing farmers, often owner-occupiers taking on extra land at significantly higher rents than could be afforded by a traditional tenant.|$|R
40|$|The report {{presents}} {{a repeat of}} a 1989 - 90 postal survey to explore the land tenurial changes in England and Wales that have resulted from legislative and structural change. Clearly, since 1990, the introduction of <b>Farm</b> Business <b>Tenancies</b> means that {{the two sets of}} results, while not directly comparable, allows the occupancy of land under unconventional forms of tenancy to be explored and contrasted. Furthermore, many factors influence the occupancy of land including taxation, inheritance laws, the profitability of farming, and structural and policy changes within the industry. Therefore, the occupancy of agricultural land in 2007 should be set against this backcloth of socio-political changes that impact upon the industry. Finally, this report is split into two sections, the first focuses on the occupation of land in England and Wales using weighted sample data, while the second explores some of the dynamics behind land tenure using the unweighted sample data.

50|$|Historically, {{rural society}} {{utilised}} a three tier structure of landowners (nobility, gentry, yeomanry), tenant farmers, and farmworkers. Originally, tenant farmers {{were known as}} peasants. Under Anglo-Norman law almost all tenants were bonded to the land, and were therefore also villeins, but after the labour shortage occasioned by the Black Death in the mid 14th century, the number of free tenants substantially increased. Many tenant farmers became affluent and socially well connected, and employed {{a substantial number of}} labourers and managed more than one <b>farm.</b> <b>Tenancy</b> could be either in perpetuity or rotated by the owners. Cottiers (cottagers) held much less land.|$|E

From 1937 to 1947, the couple lived in Cedar Falls, where Nuhn managed some family business interests.|$|E
5000|$|A {{secondary}} {{effect of the}} prohibition of sub-division was that other children, who would previously have inherited {{part of the family}} <b>farm</b> <b>tenancy</b> or married into a similar small farm, were forced to seek employment elsewhere. Many emigrated. Many entered religious life, as Roman Catholic priests, nuns or monks, such options becoming available due to a re-organisation of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland under Cardinal Cullen from the 1850s. This influx of young people into the religious life, thanks to the disappearance of sub-division, in part explains the massive growth in clerical numbers in Ireland in the period.|$|E

40|$|Binary logit and bivariate probit {{models were}} used to {{investigate}} the investment behavior of farmers relative to two energy-conserving assets, heat-recovery systems and precoolers. The bivariate probit procedure was useful in correcting for self-selectivity bias. Holdout samples and cross-validation procedures {{were used to}} develop true model statistics. Farm size, educational level of the operator, {{and the type of}} milking system in use were the important factors influencing investment behavior. As the economic costs of electrical-energy gener-ation rise and the environmental costs become more evident, energy conservation becomes a clear al-ternative to building more nuclear or sulphur-emit-ting plants. The first step to conservation is development of appropriate technologies. How-ever, after such technologies are developed, adop-tion may be very slow when the technology is embodied in durable capital items such as struc-tures or machines. An understanding of the in-vestment behavior of those who could be expected to use energy-conserving equipment or structures would be of value in predicting or attempting to modify rates of adoption and, thus, energy use. Attempts to quantify the behavioral relationships connected with investment at the firm (farm) level have generally focused on large field crop and grain storage equipment. Using a probit model, Hill and Kau found farm size, <b>farm</b> type, <b>tenancy,</b> operator age, and specific corn crop variables significant in determining investment in grain dryers in Illinois. Similarly, <b>farm</b> size, <b>tenancy,</b> corn production, and corn use variables were important determinants of grain bin investment in a tobit study by Dixon, Hill, and Saffell. A more recent multivariate analysis of tractor and combine investments found soil type, value of machinery inventory, operator age, and education to influence machinery investment decision making (Johnson, Brown, and O'Grady). In a simulated investment environment, Gustafson, Barry, and Sonka found that structural character. The authors are professor and former research support specialists, re...|$|R

While free African-Americans owned around $50 million by 1860, <b>farm</b> <b>tenancy</b> and {{sharecropping}} replaced slavery after the American Civil War because newly freed African American farmers did not own land or supplies and had {{to depend on the}} White Americans who rented the land and supplies out to them. At the same time, southern Blacks were trapped in debt and denied banking services while White citizens were given low interest loans to set up farms in the Midwest and Western United States. White homesteaders were able to go West and obtain unclaimed land through government grants, while the land grants and rights of African Americans were rarely enforced.|$|E

He did not fully agree with his elder brother's decision to donate the estate to the National Trust, [...] "but didn't question the right that the castle belonged to him". In 1956 he was a joint founder, with his former army comrade Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw (a Deputy Lieutenant for Bedfordshire, knighted by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for exports), of the leading fork-lift truck company Lancer Boss, a major employer in Leighton Buzzard, which went into receivership in 1994 due to problems with its German affiliate. Following his marriage in 1973, he retired from the business, having been a director for 17 years, and returned to Dunster, where he obtained a lease of Home Farm from the Crown Commissioners. He has a daughter Serena and a son, Hugh, qualified in estate management, whom he hopes will succeed him in the Home <b>Farm</b> <b>tenancy,</b> and who is also heir to his uncle at East Quantoxhead.

50|$|On September 29, 1930, 4,000 workers {{supported}} by the United Textile Workers of America left their jobs at the Dan River Mills in Danville (a town already reeling from the closing of cotton mills and furniture factories). Rather than repeat the bloodshed of North Carolina textile strikes, after the mill owner refused his offer to mediate and a November riot in support of 40 striking mill workers charged with unlawful assembly, Pollard acceded to local authorities' requests and called out three companies of the state's National Guard, which kept the peace until the strike collapsed on January 29, 1931. Moreover, widespread poverty within the state reduced the influence of economic fluctuations. In 1929 Virginia ranked 36th in per capita income (although 19th in total income); many blacks, mill workers and subsistence farmers lived in poverty. One tenth of Virginia's 170,000 farmers had incomes over $2500 in 1929, but even in that year two of every five earned less than $600. <b>Farm</b> <b>tenancy</b> was high in the state's cotton and tobacco-growing areas, although Virginia also had among the second lowest percentage in the nation of farms subject to mortgages, so foreclosures were not a severe problem. Pollard petitioned President Hoover for continuation in federal road advances (requesting $5 million to be repaid in 10 to 15 years), {{in order to avoid}} a dole. Governor Pollard again balanced the state budget, although he also appointed an Unemployment Relief Committee headed by Byrd confidante William T. Reed, who also opposed expensive work relief programs but urged businesses to adopt a five day workweek and start new building projects.|$|E

The land tenancy situation in rural Bangladesh was explored in this study with a reasonable high incidence of owners who cultivate their own land in comparison to owner-cum-tenants and tenants. A number of tenurial arrangements including sharing agreements were also revealed in the study villages. Share tenant farmers earned significantly lower net return (Tk. 19, 252. 18) than the cash tenant farmers (Tk. 22, 815. 89) from Boro rice production. However, Boro rice production was profitable from the viewpoint of both tenant operators.

40|$|This {{literature}} review focuses on recent and contemporary tenancy structures in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Tenancy {{for purposes of}} this review is broadly defined to include different leasing arrangements such sharecropping, labor tenancy, fixed cash rentals, and reverse leasing. We have limited our discussion to private leasing of agricultural land, thereby ignoring issues pertaining to leasing of public, forest, and other noncrop lands. The purpose of this {{literature review}} is to provide a basis for evaluation of the desirability, feasibility, and potential content of regulatory guidelines for lease agreements that might permit the land-lease market to operate effectively. The works discussed herein are both theoretical and empirical. We have attempted to locate the most recent literature on tenancy for Asia, Africa, and Latin America. If contemporary literature is scarce or if historical developments are useful to understanding current tenancy trends, references and inclusion of recent past experiences and dynamics are included. As can be expected, the availability of studies on tenancy in the three regions is quite different. <b>Farm</b> <b>tenancy</b> [...] Asia, <b>Farm</b> <b>tenancy</b> [...] Africa, Sub-Saharan, <b>Farm</b> <b>tenancy</b> [...] Latin America, <b>Farm</b> <b>tenancy</b> [...] Developing countries [...] Bibliography, Land tenure [...] Developing countries, Land Economics/Use,...|$|E

40|$|Little {{research}} has been conducted on the restructuring activities of tenant farmers in response to changing tenancy legislation and recent CAP reforms. This paper examines the geography of <b>farm</b> <b>tenancy</b> agreements in England since 1995 and presents some findings from postal and telephone surveys on the possible future business trajectories of tenant farmers and the changing nature of landlord-tenant relationships. A clear north-south divide is identified in terms of <b>farm</b> <b>tenancy</b> agreements and a complex array of different tenancy agreements is demonstrated. The relationships between landlords and tenants are changing and the increasing variety of agreements provides evidence of a more fluid (post-feudal) system of agricultural leases. Nevertheless, high levels of uncertainty and negativity characterise tenant farmers' views on the impacts of CAP reforms. Crucially, the very identity of a tenant farmer is changing, towards an owner-occupier who rents additional land, and there is an urgent need for more detailed research on the 'consequential geographies' of farm property rights and the changing nature of landlord-tenant relationships...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine which}} factors, if any, are responsible for inter-county variation in the percent of farm operators residing off the farm in California, Iowa, Kansas, Texas, and Utah.

These states vary significantly in type of farm, tenure conditions, off-farm employment opportunities, cultural patterns, remoteness of farms from town, and other variables. Forward step-wise regression analysis was utilized in each of the states to correlate percent of farm operators residing off the farm with type of <b>farm,</b> <b>farm</b> sales, <b>tenancy,</b> non-commercial <b>farms,</b> off-farm employment, remoteness, college education, and average off-farm income. In addition to the above variables, percent of Mormon farm operators and percent of non-white farm operators were used only in the Utah and Texas analyses respectively.
