50|$|This {{molecule}} {{is involved}} in the initial stages of the human immunodeficiency virus infection, as the HIV <b>gp120</b> <b>molecule</b> causes co-internalization of the DC-SIGN molecule and HIV virus particle (virion). The dendritic cell then migrates to the cognate lymphoid organ, whereupon recycling of the DC-SIGN/HIV virion complex to the cell periphery facilitates HIV infection of CD4+ T cells by interaction between DC-SIGN and ICAM-3.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that using aurintricarboxylic acid against influenza-A post-infection has a strong protective effect by inhibiting the virus' ability to reproduce. In cultured canine kidney cells, it was found to reduce viral reproduction and infection when applied post-infection, but not when used as a 'vaccine'. It {{has also been shown}} to block the binding of the HIV coat <b>molecule</b> <b>gp120</b> to the CD4 co-receptor on T cells through which it invades.|$|R
