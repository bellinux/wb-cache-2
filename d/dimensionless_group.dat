40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the industrial problem of air current segregation in alumina storage silos which occurs with {{the handling of}} the feedstock alumina in aluminium plants. One significant parameter, the air extraction rate, was studied in an experimental silo which was manufactured for this purpose. The experiments conducted in small scale devices displayed the interaction between the particle flow and air current segregation. Results from these experiments show that the increase of the silo air extraction rate reduces air current segregation. The dimensional analysis method has been applied to form <b>dimensionless</b> <b>groups</b> out of the significant parameters. Five <b>dimensionless</b> <b>groups</b> were obtained which is unwieldy. To reduce the number of <b>dimensionless</b> <b>groups</b> the physical properties were lumped into the terminal velocity.

40|$|Classical {{dimensional}} analysis has two limitations: (i) the computed <b>dimensionless</b> <b>groups</b> are not unique, and (ii) the analysis does not measure {{relative importance of}} the <b>dimensionless</b> <b>groups.</b> We propose two algorithms for estimating unique and relevant <b>dimensionless</b> <b>groups</b> assuming the experimenter can control the system's independent variables and evaluate the corresponding dependent variable; e. g., computer experiments provide such a setting. The first algorithm {{is based on a}} response surface constructed from a set of experiments. The second algorithm uses many experiments to estimate finite differences over a range of the independent variables. Both algorithms are semi-empirical because they use experimental data to complement the {{dimensional analysis}}. We derive the algorithms by combining classical semi-empirical modeling with active subspaces, which [...] -given a probability density on the independent variables [...] -yield unique and relevant <b>dimensionless</b> <b>groups.</b> The connection between active subspaces and dimensional analysis also reveals that all empirical models are ridge functions, which are functions that are constant along low-dimensional subspaces in its domain.

The results include a new set of two <b>dimensionless</b> <b>groups</b> for turbulent pipe flow that are ordered by relevance to the system; the precise notion of relevance is closely tied to the derivative based global sensitivity metric from Sobol' and Kucherenko...|$|R

40|$|Adsorbed {{natural gas}} (ANG) has been {{emerging}} as an attractive alternative to {{compressed natural gas}} or liquefied natural gas, on various circumstances. However, {{in spite of the}} advantages associated with ANG over other storage modes, there are some issues that need be properly addressed in order to ensure a viable employment of such alternative. One major problem is that the thermal effects associated with the sorption phenomena tend to diminish the storage capacity, thereby resulting in poorer performance. Hence, in order to design commercially viable storage vessels, the heat and mass transfer mechanisms that occur in these devices must be carefully understood and controlled. With the purpose of improving the understanding of mass and energy transport within ANG vessels, <b>dimensionless</b> <b>groups</b> associated with this problem have been developed in this study, resulting in an innovation to the ANG literature. Along with the <b>dimensionless</b> <b>groups,</b> a lumped-capacitance formulation has been also proposed. Although this type of formulation is limited compared to the multi-dimensional formulations present in the literature, its computational solution is remarkably faster. Numerical solution results using the proposed lumped formulation are compared with those of a previous study, suggesting that the simpler model can be applied to larger process times. The process of charging and discharging ANG vessels was then simulated employing the proposed formulation for different combinations of the developed <b>dimensionless</b> <b>groups.</b> In order to properly assess charge and discharge processes, a performance coefficient was employed. The results show that increasing the heat capacity ratio and dimensionless heat transfer coefficient tend to augment the performance coefficient, whereas an increase in the dimensionless heat of sorption worsens performance. The proposed normalization scheme is applicable to both multi-dimensional and spatially-lumped formulations, thereby facilitating the analysis of heat transfer enhancement in these storage vessels.
