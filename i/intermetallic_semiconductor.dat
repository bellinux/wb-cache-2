40|$|FeGa$_ 3 $ is {{an unusual}} <b>intermetallic</b> <b>semiconductor</b> that {{presents}} intriguing magnetic responses to the tuning of its electronic properties. When doped with Ge, the system evolves from diamagnetic to paramagnetic to ferromagnetic ground states that are not well understood. In this work, we have performed a joint theoretical and experimental study of FeGa$_{ 3 -x}$Ge$_x$ using Density Functional Theory and magnetic susceptibility measurements. For low Ge concentrations we observe the formation of localized moments on some Fe atoms and, as the dopant concentration increases, a more delocalized magnetic behavior emerges. The magnetic configuration strongly depends on the dopant distribution, leading even to the appearance of antiferromagnetic interactions in certain configurations.

Analysis shows that these materials form type-I clathrates, with copper content between x = 4. 9 and 5. 3, nearly {{independent of the}} starting composition. We used x-ray powder diffraction and single-crystal electron diffraction to confirm the cubic type-I clathrate structure, while electron microprobe measurements confirmed {{the stability of the}} x = 5 composition. This result differs from the corresponding Ag and Au clathrates, and was not known previously due perhaps to the similar Cu and Ge form factors in x-ray diffraction. The observed composition adheres very tightly to a valence-counting scheme, in agreement with a Zintl-type stability mechanism. This implies a gap in the electronic density of states, also in contrast to the metallic behavior of the Au and Ag analogs. Magnetization measurements showed a large diamagnetic response in the Ba-Cu-Ge clathrate.

40|$|Solid state amorphization (SSA) can be {{achieved}} in crystalline materials including metal alloys, <b>intermetallics,</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> minerals and molecular crystals. Even though the mechanisms may differ in different materials, the crystalline to amorphous transformation occurs when the crystal reaches a metastable state in which its free energy is {{higher than that of}} the amorphous phase. SSA is observed in metal alloys because of interdiffusion of the crystalline elements during mechanical milling, thermal reaction of vapor deposited thin metal layers, mixture of metal powders and flat rolling of alternating thin metal sheets, and hydrogen reaction. We investigate the process of mechanically induced amorphization in small molecule organic crystals under extensive deformation. In this study we develop a model that describes the amorphization of molecular crystals in which plastic strain is calculated with a phase field dislocation dynamics theory in four materials: Acetaminophen, Sucrose, -Indomethacin, and Aspirin. The model is able to predict the fraction of amorphous material generated in single crystals for a given applied stress.

First principles based DFT calculations within the GGA approximation indicate that although the unit cell volume matches well with the experimentally obtained value at ambient pressure, it is significantly underestimated at high pressures and the difference between them increases as pressure increases. GGA + U calculations with increasing values of U_Fe(3 d) (on-site Coulomb repulsion between the Fe 3 d electrons) at high pressures, correct this discrepancy. Further, the GGA+U calculations also show that along with U_Fe(3 d), the Fe 3 d band width also increases with pressure and around a pressure of 4 GPa, a small density of states appear at the Fermi level. High pressure resistance measurements carried out on FeGa_ 3 also clearly show a signature of an electronic transition.

40|$|The Zn-Sb binary phase {{system has}} been of {{interest}} {{for many years in}} the search for efficient and low-cost thermoelectric materials. Of primary interest has been the Zn 4 Sb 3 phase which exhibits a thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, in excess of 1 in an intermediate temperature range. In this study, Zn 4 Sb 3 is shown to be entropically stabilized with respect to decomposition to Zn and ZnSb through the effects of configurational disorder and phonon free energy. Single-phase stability is predicted for a range of compositions and temperatures. Retrograde solubility of Zn is predicted on the two-phase boundary region between Zn 4 Sb 3 and Zn. The complex temperature-dependent solubility can be used to explain the variety of nanoparticle formation observed in the system: formation of ZnSb on the Sb-rich side, Zn on the far Zn-rich side, and nano-void formation due to Zn precipitates being reabsorbed at lower temperatures. A new binary compound, Zn 8 Sb 7, known only in nanoparticulate form, is also studied using density functional calculations. The free energies of formation, including effects from vibrations and configurational disorder, are calculated to compare with the relevant phases ZnSb, Zn, and Zn 4 Sb 3, yielding insight into the phase stability of Zn 8 Sb 7. Band structure calculations predict Zn 8 Sb 7, much like ZnSb and Zn 4 Sb 3, to be an <b>intermetallic</b> <b>semiconductor</b> with similar thermoelectric properties.

The stable defect level depends on the choice of A, and is consistent with experimentally observed carrier concentrations in these materials. These results demonstrate that point defects are the primary mechanism by which the covalency of the cation bond can influence carrier concentration in nominally valence-precise AZn 2 Sb 2 compounds.

The use of a solvent, growth at lower temperatures and the zoning process, that are inherent ingredients of the method, can help to grow large, high structural quality, high purity crystals. In order to optimize this process, careful control of the various growth variables is imperative; however, this can be difficult to achieve due to the large number of independent experimental parameters that can be grouped under the broad headings growth conditions, characteristics of the material being grown, and experimental configuration, setup and design. This review attempts to describe the principles behind the traveling solvent technique and the various experimental variables.

40|$|Solid state amorphization, and in {{particular}} crystalline to amorphous transformation, {{can be observed in}} metallic alloys, <b>semiconductors,</b> <b>intermetallics,</b> minerals, and also molecular crystals when they undergo irradiation, hydrogen gas dissolution, thermal interdiffusion, mechanical alloying, or mechanical milling. Although the amorphization mechanisms may be different, the transformation occurs due to the high level of disorder introduced into the material. Milling induced solid state amorphization is proposed {{to be the result of}} accumulation of crystal defects, specifically dislocations, as the material is subjected to large deformations during the high energy process. Thus, understanding the deformation mechanisms of crystalline materials will be the first step in studying solid state amorphization in crystalline materials, which not only has scientific contributions, but also technical consequences. ^ A phase field dislocation dynamics (PFDD) approach is employed in this work to simulate plastic deformation of molecular crystals. This PFDD model has the advantage of tracking all of the dislocations in a material simultaneously. The model takes into account the elastic interaction between dislocations, the lattice resistance to dislocation motion, and the elastic interaction of dislocations with an external stress field. The PFDD model is employed to describe the deformation of molecular crystals with pharmaceutical applications, namely, single crystal sucrose, acetaminophen, γ-indomethacin, and aspirin. Stress-strain curves are produced that result in expected anisotropic material response due to the activation of different slip systems and yield stresses that agree well with those from experiments. The PFDD model is coupled to a phase transformation model to study the relation between plastic deformation and the solid state amorphization of crystals that undergo milling. This model predicts the amorphous volume fraction in excellent agreement with experimental observation. Finally, we incorporate the effect of stress free surfaces to model the behavior of dislocations close to these surfaces and in the presence of voids. ...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{independence}} {{requires that}} the nation reduce its {{dependence on foreign oil}} imports. This can be achieved through electrification of transportation vehicles if proper battery technology can be developed. In addition, the renewable energy sources such as solar and wind tend to be intermittent with time scales ranging from seconds to hours. So, a suitable energy storage technology is essential for integrating renewable sources for base load generation. Lithium ion battery technology is promising; however, the big challenge limiting its widespread implementation is with capacity, durability and safety. A dramatic advancement is needed in terms of materials used for both electrodes and electrolytes. Several materials such as tin, tin oxide (SnO 2), cobalt oxide (CoO 3), iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3), <b>intermetallic</b> alloys and <b>semiconductors</b> like silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) potentially provide much higher theoretical capacity compared to conventionally used carbon based materials for anodes. Although most of these materials have favorable characteristics, they {{come at the expense of}} enormous volume changes associated with lithium alloying as a result of which the material integrity is lost. One-dimensional nanowires are believed to have better charge transport and strain relaxation properties but mostly unproven. In this dissertation, a generic hybrid architecture concept involving one-dimensional nanowires covered with nanoclusters IS proposed for improving the durability of anodes with high capacity retention. Specifically, this concept is demonstrated with metal-nanocluster-covered metal oxide nanowires using Sn/SnO 2 system. The results showed that Sn nanocluster covered SnO 2 nanowires exhibited a capacity retention of ~ 800 mAhg- 1 for up to 100 cycles, the highest reported until now. In this study, the presence of well-spaced nanoclusters provides adequate room for metal volume expansion on lithiation preventing cluster coalescence leading to stable material structure while the metal oxide base provides various channels for electron conductivity. Cyclic voltammetric studies are conducted to understand the fundamental behavior of mono layers of nanoscale and micron scale tin clusters supported on both metallic substrates and hybrid architectures. The results suggest that tin clusters with sizes less than 50 nm undergo complete de-lithiation while larger clusters exhibit incomplete delithiation due to diffusion limitation. The hybrid architecture concept can also be extended to other high capacity materials systems using unique carbon structures and molybdenum oxide nanowire arrays as base materials. In this direction, carbon microtubes (CMTs) are synthesized in large quantities and tested for their lithiation and de-lithiation characteristics. CMTs are micron sized tubes with 50 nm walls comprised of random nanographite domains. The results indicated that CMTs exhibited capacity retention of ~ 440 mAhg-l, higher than the theoretical capacity of graphite. More importantly, CMTs show excellent rate capability of ~ 135 mAhg- 1 at rates as high as 5 C which makes them ideal as base materials in hybrid architectures. Another material of interest is molybdenum oxide (MoO 3) which has excellent theoretical capacity and stability. Nanowire arrays are grown on conducting substrates providing direct charge conduction pathways eliminating the use of conducting polymer, generally used in powder based electrodes. These arrays show good capacity retention of ~ 630 mAhg- 1 along with rate capability. In addition, the capacity retention below 0. 7 V is ~ 500 mAhg- 1, which is better than the performance of any other MoO 3 based materials and hence, makes the material viable for practical application as electrodes. Technologically, the proposed concept of hybrid architectured materials involving I-D materials with nanoclusters should result in the development of new materials architectures for high capacity, high rate and durable anodes. Scientifically, for the first time, the study showed fundamental differences in the lithiationlde-lithiation behavior of tin clusters at nanoscale which could apply to several other material systems. In addition, the interesting aspects involved in high capacity retention and durability have been aptly studied and understood for further application in other material systems...|$|R
