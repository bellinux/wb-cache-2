[...] Later that month, another new immigrant was arrested and ordered {{to leave the country}} after refusing to purchase a merchant license before trading with the Indian tribes. [...] On November 22, 1826, local militia colonel Martin Parmer and 39 other Edwards colonists entered Nacogdoches and arrested Norris, Sepulveda, and the commander of the small Mexican garrison, charging them with oppression and corruption. [...] Haden Edwards was also arrested for violating his <b>expulsion</b> <b>order</b> but was immediately paroled, possibly as a ploy to disguise his own involvement in the plot. A kangaroo court found the other men guilty, removed them from their positions, and banned them from ever holding another public office.

The Jews of Provence were given the option of conversion to Christianity and a number chose that option. However, after a short while – if only to compensate partially for the loss of revenues caused by the departure of the Jews – the king imposed a special tax, referred to as [...] "the tax of the neophytes."

2500|$|The Colonial Secretary had {{the power}} to issue {{warrants}} to arrest and deport any persons suspected of endangering public order and social stability. The Chinese community back then regarded the colonial Governor as the highest ranking [...] "prince" [...] ( [...] wáng) under the British monarch, while the Colonial Secretary was viewed as a [...] "prince" [...] second to the Governor. Also, the word [...] "warrant" [...] was transliterated as [...] "hua" [...] ( [...] huā). Therefore, the Chinese community termed warrants issued by the Colonial Secretary as the [...] "Second Prince's Warrant" [...] (二王花 Èr-wáng Huā). Persons who were taken into custody and deported by the Colonial Secretary included Hau Say Hoan (侯西反), an anti-Japanese Chinese businessman who resided in Singapore for 38 years. He was accused by Sir Alexander Small, the then-Colonial Secretary of being anti-British and engaging in dealings with illegal organisations to endanger public order in December 1939; Small invoked the <b>Expulsion</b> <b>Order</b> and deported Hau, and prohibited him from re-entry.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1948 war, the Egyptian army {{occupied}} {{a large part}} of Gaza including Majdal. Over the next few months, the town was subjected to Israeli air-raids and shelling. All but about 1,000 of the town's residents were forced to leave {{by the time it was}} captured by Israeli forces as a sequel to Operation Yoav on 4 November 1948. General Yigal Allon ordered the expulsion of the remaining Palestinians but the local commanders did not do so and the Arab population soon recovered to more than 2,500 due mostly to refugees slipping back and also due to the transfer of Palestinians from nearby villages. Most of them were elderly, women, or children. During the next year or so, the Palestinians were held in a confined area surrounded by barbed wire, which became commonly known as the [...] "ghetto". Moshe Dayan and Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion were in favor of expulsion, while Mapam and the Israeli labor union Histadrut objected. The government offered the Palestinians positive inducements to leave, including a favorable currency exchange, but also caused panic through night-time raids. The first group was deported to the Gaza Strip by truck on 17 August 1950 after an <b>expulsion</b> <b>order</b> had been served. The deportation was approved by Ben-Gurion and Dayan over the objections of Pinhas Lavon, secretary-general of the Histadrut, who envisioned the town as a productive example of equal opportunity. By October 1950, 20 Palestinian families remained, most of whom later moved to Lydda or Gaza. According to Israeli records, in total 2,333 Palestinians were transferred to the Gaza Strip, 60 to Jordan, 302 to other towns in Israel, and a small number remained in Ashkelon. Lavon argued that this operation dissipated [...] "the last shred of trust the Arabs had in Israel, the sincerity of the State's declarations on democracy and civil equality, and the last remnant of confidence the Arab workers had in the Histadrut." [...] Acting on an Egyptian complaint, the Egyptian-Israel Mixed Armistice Commission ruled that the Palestinians transferred from Majdal should be returned to Israel, but this was not done.|$|E

2500|$|Gandhi {{made his}} {{political}} debut in India in 1917 in Champaran district in Bihar, near the Nepal border, {{where he was}} invited {{by a group of}} disgruntled tenant farmers who, for many years, had been forced into planting indigo (for dyes) on a portion of their land and then selling it at below-market prices to the British planters who had leased them the land. Upon his arrival in the district, Gandhi was joined by other agitators, including a young Congress leader, Rajendra Prasad, from Bihar, who would become a loyal supporter of Gandhi and go on to play a prominent role in the Indian independence movement. [...] When Gandhi was ordered to leave by the local British authorities, he refused on moral grounds, setting up his refusal as a form of individual Satyagraha. [...] Soon, under pressure from the Viceroy in Delhi who was anxious to maintain domestic peace during wartime, the provincial government rescinded Gandhi's <b>expulsion</b> <b>order,</b> and later agreed to an official enquiry into the case. [...] Although, the British planters eventually gave in, they were not won over to the farmers' cause, and thereby did not produce the optimal outcome of a Satyagraha that Gandhi had hoped for; similarly, the farmers themselves, although pleased at the resolution, responded less than enthusiastically to the concurrent projects of rural empowerment and education that Gandhi had inaugurated in keeping with his ideal of swaraj. [...] The following year Gandhi launched two more Satyagrahasboth in his native Gujaratone in the rural Kaira district where land-owning farmers were protesting increased land-revenue and the other in the city of Ahmedabad, where workers in an Indian-owned textile mill were distressed about their low wages. [...] The satyagraha in Ahmedabad took the form of Gandhi fasting and supporting the workers in a strike, which eventually led to a settlement. [...] In Kaira, in contrast, although the farmers' cause received publicity from Gandhi's presence, the satyagraha itself, which consisted of the farmers' collective decision to withhold payment, was not immediately successful, as the British authorities refused to back down. [...] The agitation in Kaira gained for Gandhi another lifelong lieutenant in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who had organised the farmers, and who too would go on to play a leadership role in the Indian independence movement. Champaran, Kaira, and Ahmedabad were important milestones in the history of Gandhi's new methods of social protest in India.|$|E

5000|$|The Israeli cabinet {{reportedly}} {{knew nothing}} about the expulsion plan until Bechor Shitrit, Minister for Minority Affairs, appeared unannounced in Ramle on 12 July. He was shocked when he realized troops were organizing expulsions. He returned to Tel Aviv for a meeting with Foreign Minister Moshe Shertok, who met with Ben Gurion to agree on guidelines for the treatment of the residents, though Morris writes that Ben Gurion apparently failed to tell Shitrit or Shertok that he himself was the source of the <b>expulsion</b> <b>orders.</b> Gelber disagrees with Morris's analysis, arguing that Ben-Gurion's agreement with Shitrit and Shertok is evidence that expulsion was not his intention, rather than evidence of his duplicity, as Morris implies. The men agreed the townspeople should be told that anyone who wanted to leave could do so, but that anyone who stayed was responsible for himself and would not be given food. Women, children, the old, and the sick were not to be forced to leave, and the monasteries and churches must not be damaged, though no mention was made of the mosques. Ben-Gurion passed the order to the IDF General Staff, who passed it to Dani HQ at 23:30 hours on 12 July, ten hours after the <b>expulsion</b> <b>orders</b> were issued; Morris writes that there was an ambiguity in the instruction that women, children and the sick were not to be forced to go: the word [...] "lalechet" [...] can mean either [...] "go" [...] or [...] "walk". Satisfied that the order had been passed on, Shertok believed he had managed to avert the expulsions, not realizing that, even as he was discussing them in Tel Aviv, they had already begun.|$|R
2500|$|Overall, Morris {{concludes that}} {{during this period}} the [...] "Arab {{evacuees}} from the towns and villages left largely because of Jewish—Haganah, IZL or LHI—attacks or fear of impending attack" [...] but that only [...] "an extremely small, almost insignificant number of the refugees during this early period left because of Haganah or IZL or LHI <b>expulsion</b> <b>orders</b> or forceful 'advice' to that effect." [...] In this sense, Glazer quotes the testimony of Count Bernadotte, the UN mediator in Palestine, who reported that [...] "the exodus of the Palestinian Arabs resulted from panic created by fighting in their communities, by rumours concerning real or alleged acts of terrorism, or expulsion. Almost {{the whole of the}} Arab population fled or was expelled from the area under Jewish occupation." ...|$|R
50|$|These efforts again proved unsuccessful. The Jewish {{population}} remained sufficiently sizable as {{to prompt}} Wamba (672-680) to issue limited <b>expulsion</b> <b>orders</b> against them, and {{the reign of}} Erwig (680-687) also seemed vexed by the issue. The Twelfth Council of Toledo again called for forced baptism, and, for those who disobeyed, seizure of property, corporal punishment, exile, and slavery. Jewish children over seven years of age were taken from their parents and similarly dealt with in 694. Erwig also took measures to ensure that Catholic sympathizers would not be inclined to aid Jews {{in their efforts to}} subvert the councils rulings. Heavy fines awaited any nobles who acted in favor of the Jews, and members of the clergy who were remiss in enforcement were subject to a number of punishments (Encyclopaedia Judaica, p. 222).|$|R
