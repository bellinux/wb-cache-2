Wastewater was collected from the effluent ponds of agro-industrial factories (cassava and ethanol production plants). Only 2 microalgal strains were isolated and identified as Scenedesmus quadricauda and Chlorella sp [...] However, only S. quadricauda was selected to cultivate in various wastewater concentrations (10 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 %). The highest biomass obtained at 6. 6 × 10 6 and 6. 27 × 10 6 cells/ml when 60 % wastewater was used in flask and photo-bioreactor. The cultures gave the <b>highest</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> at 18. 58 % and 42. 86 % in cases of S. quadricauda and S. obliquus. In addition, under salt stress (1. 0 M NaCl), S. obliquus demonstrated the <b>highest</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> at 50 % which {{was much more than}} the case of no NaCl adding.

40|$|Aims: Variation in the {{traditional}} growth medium conditions to enhance the production of lipids, carbohydrates, protein and the free amino acids content of three cyanobacterial species. Methodology and Results: Three species of cyanobacteria (Anabaena laxa, Anabaena fertilissima and Nostoc muscorum) were collected from the culture collection of Soils, Water and Environment Research Institute, Agriculture Research Center, Giza, Egypt, to investigate their biochemical composition under different growth conditions, using BG 110 (nitrogen free) as growth medium. These conditions were represented by control medium, static glucose medium with (1 %, w/v), aerated medium (aerated by bubbling technique depending on CO 2 normally existed in air with a concentration of 0. 03 %), molasses medium (0. 7 %, v/v) and aerated medium enriched with glucose (1 %, w/v). Lipid content, total carbohydrates, soluble proteins and free amino acids were determined at the previous conditions. Glucose at 0. 7 % (w/v) was the most favorable for lipid production in A. laxa, where it exhibited the <b>highest</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> (427 μg/g fresh wt.). Increasing molasses concentration up to 0. 7 % (v/v) produced an increase in lipid contents of the tested cyanobacterial strains. The <b>highest</b> <b>lipid</b> <b>content</b> of both N. muscorum (366. 2 μg/g fresh wt.) and A. laxa (357. 4 μg/g fresh wt.) were recorded at molasses concentrations of 0. 1 and 0. 7 % (v/v), respectively. A. laxa expressed high significant values for both proteins (31. 6 μg/mL) and free amino acids (40. 5 mg/g dry wt.) after 6 days of incubation period under aerated enriched glucose condition (1 %, w/v). Also, at the same growth conditions, A. fertilissima exhibited high significant values for carbohydrates at 4 th day (876. 8 mg/g dry wt.).
