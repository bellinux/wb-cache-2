25|$|One {{advantage}} of the FET is its high gate to main current resistance, {{on the order of}} 100 MΩ or more, thus providing a high degree of isolation between control and flow. Because base current noise will increase with shaping time, a FET typically produces less noise than a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), and is thus found in noise sensitive electronics such as tuners and low-noise amplifiers for VHF and satellite receivers. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no offset voltage at zero drain current and hence makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT. Because they are controlled by <b>gate</b> <b>charge,</b> once the gate is closed or opened, there is no additional power draw, as there would be with a bipolar junction transistor or with non-latching relays in some states. This allows extremely low-power switching, which in turn allows greater miniaturization of circuits because heat dissipation needs are reduced compared to other types of switches.|$|E

This notion was tested in the squid axon in which kinetics and steady-state properties of the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> movement were compared before and after removal of the Na inactivation by batrachotoxin (BTX), pronase, or chloramine-T. The immobilization of <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> was determined by measuring the total charge movement (QON) obtained by integrating the ON gating current (Ig,ON) using a double pulse protocol. After removal of the fast inactivation with pronase or chloramine-T, the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> movement was no longer immobilized. In contrast, after BTX modification, the channels still exhibited an immobilization of the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> (QON) with an onset time course and voltage dependence similar to that for the activation process.

40|$|AbstractKv {{channels}} detect {{changes in}} the membrane potential via their voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) that control {{the status of the}} S 6 bundle crossing (BC) gate. The movement of the VSDs results in a transfer of the S 4 <b>gating</b> <b>charges</b> across the cell membrane but only the last 10 – 20 % of the total <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> movement is associated with BC gate opening, which involves cooperative transition(s) in the subunits. Substituting the proline residue P 475 in the S 6 of the Shaker channel by a glycine or alanine causes a considerable shift in the voltage-dependence of the cooperative transition(s) of BC gate opening, effectively isolating the late <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> component from the other <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> that originates from earlier VSD movements. Interestingly, both mutations also abolished Shaker’s sensitivity to 4 -aminopyridine, which is a pharmacological tool to isolate the late <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> component. The alanine substitution (that would promote a α-helical configuration compared to proline) resulted in the largest separation of both <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> components; therefore, BC gate flexibility appears to be important for enabling the late cooperative step of channel opening...|$|R

The two electrode voltage-clamp technique allowed us to determine the total <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> of sodium and potassium ion channels, while a relative measure of the amount of expressed channels could be established {{on the basis of the}} quantification of the fluorescence intensity of membrane-bound channels marked by enhanced green fluorescent proteins.

PNAS. 100 : 10534 – 10539) reveals two kinetic components of <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> transfer that may originate from two channel domains. This study {{is designed to}} address three questions: (1) which of the six positive charges in hERG's major voltage sensor, S 4, are responsible for <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> transfer during activation, (2) whether a negative charge in the cytoplasmic half of S 2 (D 466) also contributes to <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> transfer, and (3) whether S 4 serves as the sole voltage sensor for hERG inactivation. We individually mutate S 4 's positive charges and D 466 to cysteine, and examine (a) effects of mutations {{on the number of}} equivalent <b>gating</b> <b>charges</b> transferred during activation (za) and inactivation (zi), and (b) sidedness and state dependence of accessibility of introduced cysteine side chains to a membrane-impermeable thiol-modifying reagent (MTSET). Neutralizing the outer three positive charges in S 4 and D 466 in S 2 reduces za, and cysteine side chains introduced into these positions experience state-dependent changes in MTSET accessibility. On the other hand, neutralizing the inner three positive charges in S 4 does not affect za. None of the charge mutations affect zi. We propose that the scheme of <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> transfer during hERG's activation process is similar to that described for the Shaker channel, although hERG has less <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> in its S 4 than in Shaker.

40|$|Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase–like {{proteins}} (DPLPs) {{interact with}} Kv 4 channels and thereby induce a profound remodeling of activation and inactivation gating. DPLPs are constitutive {{components of the}} neuronal Kv 4 channel complex, and recent observations have suggested the critical functional role of the single transmembrane segment of these proteins (Zagha, E., A.

However, the underlying mechanism of action is unknown. We hypothesized that a unique interaction between the Kv 4. 2 channel and a DPLP found in brain (DPPX-S) may remodel the channel 2 ̆ 7 s voltage-sensing domain. To test this hypothesis, we implemented a robust experimental system to measure Kv 4. 2 gating currents and study <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> dynamics in the absence and presence of DPPX-S. The results demonstrated that coexpression of Kv 4. 2 and DPPX-S causes a – 26 mV parallel shift in the gating charge-voltage (Q-V) relationship.

In sharp contrast, DPPX-S had no effect on <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> movements of the Shaker B Kv channel.

We explore the consequences of the existence of such a cavity through the electrostatic effects on the gating currents of Shaker K+ channels under conditions of reduced ionic strength S. We observe that ∼ 10 -fold reductions of intracellular S produce reductions of the measured <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> of ∼ 10 %. These effects continue at even lower values of S. The reduction of <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> when S is reduced by 10 -fold at the extracellular surface is much smaller (∼ 2 %).

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the voltage-sensor domains present in voltage-gated ion channels and some phosphatases operate by transferring several <b>charged</b> residues (<b>gating</b> <b>charges),</b> mainly arginines located in the S 4 segment, across the electric field. The conserved phenylalanine F 290 located in the S 2 segment of the Shaker K channel is an aromatic residue thought to interact with all the four gating arginines carried by the S 4 segment and control their transfer [Tao X, et al.

In this paper we study the possible interaction of the <b>gating</b> <b>charges</b> with this residue by directly detecting their movement with gating current measurements in 12 F 290 mutants. Most mutations do not significantly alter the first approximately 80 – 90 % of the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> transfer nor the kinetics of the gating currents during activation.

40|$|One {{measure of}} the voltage {{dependence}} of ion channel conductance {{is the amount of}} <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> that moves during activation and vice versa. The limiting slope method, introduced by Almers (Almers, W. 1978. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 82 : 96 – 190), exploits the relationship of charge movement and voltage sensitivity, yielding a lower limit to the range of single channel <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> displacement. In practice, the technique is plagued by low experimental resolution due to the requirement that the logarithmic voltage sensitivity of activation be measured at very low probabilities of opening. In addition, the linear sequential models to which the original theory was restricted needed to be expanded to accommodate the complexity of mechanisms available for the activation of channels. In this communication, we refine the theory by developing a relationship between the mean activation charge displacement (a {{measure of the}} voltage sensitivity of activation) and the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> displacement (the integral of gating current).

40|$|Ion {{channels}} are vital for nearly {{every form of}} {{life as we know}} it. Embedded in the cellular membrane, these complex macromolecular proteins control ionic conductivity by opening or closing an ionic pore upon mechanical, chemical or electrical stimuli. In nerve cells, voltage gated ion channels generate and mediate the transduction of electrical signals from one cell to the next. Some residues of the channel structure are electrically charged and can move through the membrane in response to changes in the transmembrane voltage. These <b>charges</b> are called <b>gating</b> <b>charges.</b> As a consequence of their movement, the three–dimensional conformation of the protein changes and triggers the opening or closing of the ionic pore. The interplay of sodium– and potassium–selective ion channels (Na+ and K+ channels) in nerve cells gives rise to the so–called action potential. The voltage dependence of the probability of channels to open their ionic pore is so steep that a change of the transmembrane voltage of as little as 10 mV can increase this probability by a factor of 150. For Shaker type K+ channels, the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> has consistently been reported to be of the size of 13 elementary charges. However, for Na+ channels corresponding findings vary between 4 and 16 elementary <b>charges.</b> The <b>gating</b> current is the current due to the movement of the <b>gating</b> <b>charges</b> in the electric field along the ionic pore. For a single voltage gated ion channel the gating current is in the order of pA and therefore below detection threshold in complex biological systems. In the present study, the <b>gating</b> <b>charges</b> of K+ and Na+ ion channels have been determined by the controlled electrical stimulation of cells containing 108 – 1010 channel proteins. The number of channels was quantified by a novel approach based on fluorescence intensitymeasurements of genetically modified ion channels labeled with enhanced green fluorescent proteins (eGFP). On the basis of the known value for the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> of the K+ channel, it has been possible to determine that the size of the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> in the rBIIA Na+ channel is of 5. 2 ± 0. 3 elementary charges. The present thesis is structured in three parts: 1) An introductory chapter on voltage gated ion channels, 2) an experimental part dealing with the determination of the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> of the Shaker K+ channel and of the rBIIA Na+ channel, including a comparison of both <b>gating</b> <b>charges</b> and 3) a chapter on the use of optical fibers to locally excite fluorescent proteins and detect their fluorescence emission light. The introductory part is intended for the reader to get a brief overview about the biological significance of voltage gated ion channels for living organisms, about their function and their molecular structure. The relation between the structure and the function of voltage gated ion channels is discussed {{in the context of the}} most important publications of the last 20 years. In order to provide the necessary background for the second chapter, the primary focus was laid on the gating process of voltage gated ion channels and its structural implications. The second chapter deals with experiments on the quantification of the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> in Shaker K+ channels and rBIIA Na+ channels. The <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> of a large number of K+ and Na+ channels was determined and the number of channels was estimated by fluorescence intensity measurements.

We investigated the molecular basis of the lidocaine-induced reduction in cardiac Na channel–gating charge by sequentially neutralizing basic residues in each of the voltage sensors (S 4 segments) in the four domains of the human heart Na channel (hH 1 a). By determining the relative reduction in the Qmax of each mutant channel modified by lidocaine we identified those S 4 segments that contributed to a reduction in <b>gating</b> <b>charge.</b> No interaction of lidocaine was found with the voltage sensors in domains I or II. The largest inhibition of charge movement was found for the S 4 of domain III consistent with lidocaine completely inhibiting its movement. Protection experiments with intracellular MTSET (a charged sulfhydryl reagent) in a Na channel with the fourth outermost arginine in the S 4 of domain III mutated to a cysteine demonstrated that lidocaine stabilized the S 4 in domain III in a depolarized configuration. Lidocaine also partially inhibited movement of the S 4 in domain IV, but lidocaine's most dramatic effect was to alter the voltage-dependent charge movement of the S 4 in domain IV such that it accounted for the appearance of additional <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> at potentials near − 100 mV.

These results provide evidence that the recovery of the gating elements is uncoupled from that of the pore in Na+-conducting inactivated channels. The dissociation of the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> movements and the pore closure could also be observed in the presence of symmetrical Na+ but not symmetrical Cs+. This difference probably stems from the difference in the respective abilities of the two ions to limit inactivation to the P-type state or prevent it altogether...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple method}} of {{measuring}} charge in surface {{states as a}} function of the surfacepotential in MOS transistor or MOS capacitors is proposed. A constant d. c. current is fed into the gate of an MOS transistor and with the help of an operational amplifier, the gate voltage Vg with respect to the bulk is plotted {{as a function of}} <b>gate</b> <b>charge</b> Qg. The <b>gate</b> <b>charge</b> {{as a function of the}} surfacepotential φs can be directly read off from the Vg-Qg curve. As the silicon charge Qs(φs) is known from the literature the surface state charge can be easily determined as a function of φs. The method is illustrated with measurements on n-type and p-type MOS transistors. Finally the accuracy of the charge measuring method is discussed and a comparison with other interface state charge measuring methods is made from which the charge measuring method evolves as a method, attractive for its simplicity...|$|E
40|$|A general {{mechanism}} for the physiological regulation of the activity of voltage-dependent Na+, Ca++, K+, and Cl channels by neurotransmitters {{in a variety of}} excitable cell types may involve a final common pathway of a cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of the channel protein. The functional correlates of channel phosphorylation are known to involve a change in the probability of opening, and a negative or positive shift in the voltage dependence for activation of the conductance. The voltage dependence for activation appears to be governed by the properties of the charge movement of the voltage-sensing moiety of the channel. This study of the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> movement of cardiac Ca++ channels has revealed that isoproterenol or cAMP (via a presumed phosphorylation of the channel) speeds the kinetics of the Ca++ channel <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> movement. These results suggest that the changes in the kinetics and voltage dependence of the cardiac calcium currents produced by beta-adrenergic stimulation are initiated, in part, by parallel changes in the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> movement...|$|R
40|$|A purely {{electrical}} {{mechanism for}} the gating of membrane ionic channel {{gives rise to a}} simple I-V relationship for membrane current. Our approach is based on the known presence of <b>gating</b> <b>charge,</b> which is an established property of the membrane channel <b>gating.</b> The <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> is systematically treated as a polarization of the channel protein which varies with the external electric field and modifies the effective potential through which the ions migrate in the channel. Two polarization effects have been considered: 1) the up or down shift of the whole potential function, and 2) the change in the effective electric field inside the channel which is due to familiar effect of the effective reduction of the electric field inside a dielectric body {{because of the presence of}} surface charges on its surface. Both effects are linear in the channel polarization. The ionic current is described by a steady state solution of the Nernst-Planck equation with the potential directly controlled by the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> system. The solution describes reasonably well the steady state and peak-current I-V relationships for different channels, and when applied adiabatically, explains the time lag between the <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> current and the rise of the ionic current. The approach developed can be useful as an effective way to model the ionic currents in axons, cardiac cells and other excitable tissues...|$|R
40|$|The {{voltage-gated}} K(+) (Kv) channel subunit Kv 6. 4 {{does not}} form functional homotetrameric channels but co-assembles with Kv 2. 1 to form functional Kv 2. 1 /Kv 6. 4 heterotetrameric channels. Compared to Kv 2. 1 homotetramers, Kv 6. 4 exerts a ~ 40 mV hyperpolarizing {{shift in the}} voltage-dependence of Kv 2. 1 /Kv 6. 4 channel inactivation, without {{a significant effect on}} activation gating. However, the underlying mechanism of this Kv 6. 4 -induced modulation of Kv 2. 1 channel inactivation, and whether the Kv 6. 4 subunit participates in the voltage-dependent gating of heterotetrameric channels is not well understood. Here we report distinct <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> movement of Kv 2. 1 /Kv 6. 4 heterotetrameric channels, compared to Kv 2. 1 homotetramers, as revealed by gating current recordings from mammalian cells expressing these channels. The <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> movement of Kv 2. 1 /Kv 6. 4 heterotetrameric channels displayed an extra component around the physiological K(+) equilibrium potential, characterized by a second sigmoidal relationship of the voltage-dependence of <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> movement. This distinct <b>gating</b> <b>charge</b> displacement reflects movement of the Kv 6. 4 voltage-sensing domain and has a voltage-dependency that matches the hyperpolarizing shift in Kv 2. 1 /Kv 6. 4 channel inactivation. These results provide a mechanistic basis for the modulation of Kv 2. 1 channel inactivation gating kinetics by silent Kv 6. 4 subunits...|$|R
