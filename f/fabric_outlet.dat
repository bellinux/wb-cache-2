Uncontrolled waste dumped has led to diverse kind of health problems. The {{purpose of this article}} is to characterize urban cities and evaluate their waste generation using the Geographical Info rmation System (GIS). The focus is on two cities in Burkina Faso. Specific variabl es which were considered during the survey include urban <b>fabric,</b> grey water <b>outlets</b> a nd household garbage dumps sites/techniques. The study shows that in the two cities, the most dominant urban fabric is low standard of living (about 64 % of housing in Fada and 62 % of housing in Pouytenga). The urban fabric is also characterized by the exis tence of empty spaces. Overall, the average density of grey water discharge points is 0. 85 points and 5. 7 points per ha of street in Fada N’Gourma and Pouytenga respectivel y. The average density of solid waste dumps is 1. 45 waste dumps per ha street a nd 7 waste dumps per ha street in Fada N'Gourma and Pouytenga respectively. In case of urgent waste management intervention, the priority areas for speedy intervention are area 10 in Fada N’Gourma, areas 2 and 5 in Pouytenga. GIS applied to w aste management can be a decision making tool for urban planne rs {{in developing}} country...|$|R
