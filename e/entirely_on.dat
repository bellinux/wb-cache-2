5|$|Egon Mayer (19 August 1917– 2 March 1944) was a German {{fighter pilot}} during World War II. He was {{credited}} with 102 enemy aircraft shot down in over 353 combat missions. His victories were all claimed over the Western Front. Mayer was the first fighter pilot to score 100 victories <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Extensively reared animals may subsist <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> forage, {{but more}} intensively kept {{livestock}} will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, {{fats and oils}} and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or meat meal, milk products, legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction. Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, {{in the form of}} pelleted or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the different classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food.|$|E

5|$|The first Winter Olympics {{took place}} in 1924. Australia first competed at the Winter Olympics in 1936, when its sole representative, Kenneth Kennedy, participated in speed skating. Kennedy came 33rd in both the 1500m and 5000m, {{near the bottom of}} the standings. He was <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> his own; no Australian support staff were in attendance, even though the AOF officially sanctioned Kennedy's entry.|$|E
5|$|The levade: a {{position}} wherein the horse raises up both front legs, {{standing at a}} 30-degree angle <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> its hind legs in a controlled form that requires {{a great deal of}} hindquarter strength.

5|$|The {{original}} Moscow–Vladivostok route, {{completed in}} 1904, cut across China's northeastern provinces, or Manchuria; {{the section of}} the railway located within China was known as the Chinese Eastern Railway. While the more northerly Trans-Siberian route, located <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> Russian soil, was completed in 1916, the former Chinese Eastern Railway route continues as an important connector between the two countries' railway networks.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevention}} of oxygen toxicity depends <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> the setting. Both underwater and in space, proper precautions can eliminate the most pernicious effects. Premature infants commonly require supplemental oxygen to treat complications of preterm birth. In this case {{prevention of}} bronchopulmonary dysplasia and {{retinopathy of prematurity}} {{must be carried out}} without compromising a supply of oxygen adequate to preserve the infant's life.|$|E

Kinect 2.0 was released as a standalone and optional item in October 2014; it is bundled with a digital copy of Dance Central Spotlight. The Kinect {{was the source of}} controversy due to the huge price of the system as a result of being bundled with the system. It was removed from the Xbox One bundle in May 2014 and production stopped <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> October 25, 2017.|$|E

5|$|A common {{assumption}} in mammalogy is {{that small}} mammals cannot subsist <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> plant material {{and must have}} a high-calorie diet in order to survive. As a result, {{it was thought that}} the diet of tiny primates must be high in protein-containing insects (insectivory). Research has shown, however, that mouse lemurs, the smallest living primates, consume more fruit than insects, contradicting the popular hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|After {{a success}} as Hamlet in London in 1925, Barrymore left {{the stage for}} 14 years and instead focused <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> films. In the silent film era, he was well {{received}} in such pictures as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920), Sherlock Holmes (1922) and The Sea Beast (1926). During this period, he gained his nickname, the Great Profile. His stage-trained voice proved an asset when sound films were introduced, and three of his works, Grand Hotel (1932), Twentieth Century (1934) and Midnight (1939) have been inducted into the National Film Registry.|$|E
5|$|During the Renaissance, {{money and}} art went hand in hand. Artists {{depended}} <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent. Wealth {{was brought to}} Italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into Asia and Europe. Silver mining in Tyrol increased the flow of money. Luxuries from the Eastern world, brought home during the Crusades, increased the prosperity of Genoa and Venice.|$|E

5|$|Enumerative {{problems}} in mathematics often concern {{a class of}} geometric objects called algebraic varieties which are defined by the vanishing of polynomials. For example, the Clebsch cubic (see the illustration) is defined using a certain polynomial of degree three in four variables. A celebrated result of nineteenth-century mathematicians Arthur Cayley and George Salmon states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> such a surface.|$|E

The Javan slow loris (N.javanicus) {{is native to}} the Indonesian island of Java, whereas the Bornean slow loris (N.menagensis) {{can be found on}} Borneo and nearby islands, including the Sulu Islands in the Philippines. The Sunda slow loris is found on the Indonesian island of Sumatra as well as Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. The other two species are found <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> the mainland, with the Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis) native to Bangladesh, Cambodia, southern China, Northeast India, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam and the pygmy slow loris (N.pygmaeus) found in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and southern China.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn, {{as well as}} {{the other}} Inns of Court, became noted for the parties and festivals it hosted.

At Christmas the students ruled the Inn for the day, appointing a Lord of Misrule called the Prince of Purpoole, and organising a masque <b>entirely</b> <b>on</b> their own, with the Benchers and other senior members away for the holiday.|$|E
