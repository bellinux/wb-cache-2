40|$|Abstract. Zr and/or Nb added Fe 3 Al based {{intermetallic}} alloys (i. e., Fe 3 Al-Zr, Fe 3 Al-Nb and Fe 3 Al-Zr-Nb) were arc-melted, homogenized, hot-rolled {{and then}} annealed to evaluate microstruc-ture and tensile property {{at room temperature}} {{as well as at}} a high temperature (873 K). After anneal-ing, the rolled alloys exhibited a recrystallized microstructure containing coarse second phase parti-cles, except for the Nb-added alloy with a minor content of Nb. Relatively <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> elongation as well as <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength was observed at room temperature in the Zr-added alloys with a minor amount of Zr. Also, these alloys showed relatively <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength and elongation at high tem-perature (873 K). The results suggest that tensile ductility as well as strength of Fe 3 Al-based alloys can be improved by introduction of the second phase dispersions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> {{steel sheet}} attracts {{attention}} in recent years. Galling occurs {{easily in the}} press forming processes of the <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> steel sheet {{because of the high}} contact pressure. However, the galling behavior can’t be predicted in the forming process yet. The object {{of this study is to}} clarify the galling mechanism and develop a prediction method of galling behavior in press forming. Experiments were carried out to investigate the galling behavior in the square cup drawing of a <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength steel sheet. On the die surface, galling occurs at the bottom of the boundary between the straight and corner. On the drawn cup galling starts at the top of the same boundary. The variations of contact pressure, sliding distance and temperature were investigated by using FEM. It was found that galling occurs on the sheet surface position having the history of maximum temperature and at the moment just before sliding out from the die. 1...|$|R
