40|$|We analyze optimal hedging {{contracts}} {{and show that}} although hedging aims at sharing risk, {{it can lead to}} more risk-taking. News implying that a hedge is likely to be loss-making undermines the risk-prevention incentives of the protection seller. This incentive problem limits the capacity to share risks and generates endogenous counterparty risk. Optimal hedging can therefore lead to contagion from news about insured risks to the balance sheet of insurers. Such endogenous risk is more likely to materialize ex post when the ex ante probability of counterparty default is low. Variation margins emerge as an optimal mechanism to enhance risk-sharing capacity. Paradoxically, they can also induce more risk-taking. <b>Initial</b> <b>margins</b> address the market failure caused by unregulated trading of {{hedging contracts}} among protection sellers.

40|$|The Trench Reactor (TR) is {{a liquid}} sodium cooled fast power reactor. The reactor core is fueled with U-Pu-Zr metal fuel and generates 800 MW of thermal power. The core {{is located in}} a sodium pool which is {{contained}} in a thin and deep rectangular vessel. Also located in the pool are the two intermediate heat exchangers (IHX) and the two primary pumps. The liquid sodium exists the core at 485 °C and is pumped through the IHXs where it is cooled to 343 °C and enters the core through an inlet plenum. The reactor building atmosphere is nitrogen which circulates through the guard tank and reactor vessel. The secondary sodium enters the IHXs at 294 °C and exits at 465 °C. It then is used to generate steam at 425 °C and 15 MPa. The electric power output of the plant is 300 MWe.;TR has the advantages of a small power plant. The current technology can be applied to build the main components of the reactor system. The <b>initial</b> <b>margins</b> to failure are large and the failure mechanisms are slow.

The major design changes introduced are the elimination of heat capacity effects associated with the core inlet temperature and the rectangular shape of the reactor vessel and the core. The former helped to improve the response of the TR {{to a wide range of}} accidents by enabling the effects of core inlet temperature changes to be felt early in the transients.

40|$|The IASB {{has issued}} a Discussion Paper on {{accounting}} for insurance and reinsurance contracts. This project {{is based on a}} prospective measurement of the insurance liabilities, the current exit value, which corresponds to a “market consistent” transfer value of insurance contracts to another market participant. This project is similar to the Elaborated Principles (the EPs) proposed by the CFO Forum in June 2006 : a single model for measuring the insurance liabilities based on a three building blocks approach: expected future cash flows, discounted at risk-free rate, plus a margin for risk and uncertainties. However, there are key major differences between the two. Those differences concern several areas: future cash flows (only cash flows which are legally or contractually enforceable would be recognized), “market consistent” approach (in particular estimation of expenses should be based on a theoretical level of efficiency rather than on the own costs of the insurer), service margin (according to the IASB, to be transferred to another market participant), and upfront profit recognition of <b>initial</b> <b>margins</b> (rather than over time as for other long-term services). The European insurers disagree with the IASB view that such service margin concept is relevant. They also disagree that the retail market and the wholesale market for insurance would be the same. They think there is a significant difference between entry and exit prices, that is, a significant initial profit. The insurers are concerned by the consequences of those proposals, which would lead to a non-economic valuation of the insurance liabilities and a flawed pattern of profit recognition. Since the measurement of assets and liabilities in Solvency II project should be based on IFRS, the IASB accounting for insurance project could jeopardize Solvency II, which is currently based on an economic balance sheet approach. The CFO Forum has been supporting a market consistent measurement of liabilities for accounting purposes that is the same as proposed under Solvency II. The CFO Forum is considering alternatives for recognition of profit over the time of contracts when the risk is released and the services rendered to policyholders; these alternatives should be consistent with recognition of the initial profit margin as available capital for solvency requirements.
