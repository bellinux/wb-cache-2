5|$|Grand Teton National Park and the {{surrounding}} region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude variance of over , the park {{has a number of}} different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area.

5|$|The {{range of}} {{altitude}} in Grand Teton National Park impacts {{the types of}} plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately , tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line {{to the base of}} the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park. The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island. In this <b>ecotone,</b> forested islands surrounded by sagebrush expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for night time foraging.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{investigation}} into <b>ecotones</b> enabled {{a better understanding}} of the causal relationships between certain landscape elements, landscape utilisation categories and <b>ecotones.</b> By studying <b>ecotones,</b> we wanted to expand understanding of patterns having an influence on the landscape condition, structure, functions, landscape elements and their relationships. The fuzzy approach was applied for better understanding and modelling of <b>ecotones.</b> This methodology was afterwards built in expert system. The landscape assessment process based upon an expert system allows for a multidisciplinary view of a landscape. The landscape is evaluated from several perspectives: the ecological stability, soil erosion, retention capacity and economic landscape calculations by designed expert system. These results from expert system were taken into consideration during mapping <b>ecotones.</b> <b>Ecotones</b> may serve as one of the distinctive indicators of the impact humans have on the landscape. It is therefore necessary to develop more sophisticated methods of their studying. ...|$|R
30|$|During a {{previous}} research project that utilized historical maps and aerial photos, {{we discovered that}} there were areas where the mangrove-marsh <b>ecotones</b> had shifted position over time (Smith et al. 2010). There were also areas where no change in position had occurred. This observation led us to ask: what factors influence {{the position of the}} mangrove-marsh <b>ecotones</b> through time? In this paper, we examined changes in areal extent of mangrove forest and marsh as well as patterns of movement of mangrove-marsh <b>ecotones</b> over time. We specifically analyzed the roles of fire, sea level, and water levels in the positioning of mangrove-marsh <b>ecotones.</b>|$|R
40|$|The main aims of biogeographical {{research}} of <b>ecotones</b> in Trkmanka river catchment (the south-eastern {{part of the}} Czech Republic) {{is to examine the}} state and distribution of <b>ecotones</b> in the natural and cultural landscape, to carry out their typology and to propose their optimal distribution. The investigation performed suggests that the actual <b>ecotones</b> net in agricultural landscape has a greater density than the convergent and divergent borders among natural biocoenoses. The man-made ecotonal lines are typically dominated by ruderal species. Surprisingly, xerothermal ecotonal lines with high species diversity developed on 30 -year-old terraced slopes. Consequent phytocoenological and faunistic investigation on stand transects will contribute to precise typology and identification of <b>ecotones...</b>|$|R
25|$|A type of {{boundary}} is the <b>ecotone,</b> or {{the transitional}} zone between two communities. Ecotones can arise naturally, {{such as a}} lakeshore, or can be human-created, such as a cleared agricultural field from a forest. The ecotonal community retains characteristics of each bordering community and often contains species {{not found in the}} adjacent communities. Classic examples of ecotones include fencerows, forest to marshlands transitions, forest to grassland transitions, or land-water interfaces such as riparian zones in forests. Characteristics of ecotones include vegetational sharpness, physiognomic change, occurrence of a spatial community mosaic, many exotic species, ecotonal species, spatial mass effect, and species richness higher or lower than either side of the <b>ecotone.</b>|$|E

A complete model (i. e., abiotic gradients, disturbances and woody encroachment) was the most plausible for abundance considering all <b>ecotones,</b> and for niche similarity considering both all and only disturbed <b>ecotones.</b> Niche similarity increased with distance from hydric resources, and abundance with increasing vegetation height. Further, disturbed habitats harbored simplified species assemblages. Habitat selection was detected in all <b>ecotones</b> due to the occurrence of habitat-specialist species on undisturbed sites.

40|$|Forest-agricultural <b>ecotones</b> {{are defined}} as areas that adjoin forests and other natural {{habitats}} and that lie between forests and zones of intensive agriculture. These <b>ecotones</b> are critical for conservation of biodiversity and {{for the maintenance of}} livelihoods of people that inhabit these areas. Here we focus on three questions: (1) How can we make land use sustainable in forest agriculture <b>ecotones?</b> (2) How can forest agriculture <b>ecotones</b> contribute to conservation of biodiversity? (3) How can we improve the institutions that foster sustainability and conservation of biodiversity in forest-agriculture <b>ecotones?</b> We address these questions in the context of interventions to foster biodiversity and rural livelihoods made by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment(ATREE),Bangalore, in theWestern Ghats and the Eastern Himalayas, 2 of the 34 global hotspots of biodiversity in India. At several sites, ATREE’s interventions have improved the livelihoods of several rural communities by providing increased income from non-timber forest products (NTFPs), diversification of livelihoods and enhanced agricultural production. These interventions have improved the prospects for sustainable land use in the forest agriculture <b>ecotones.</b> Simultaneously, ATREE’s interventions have strengthened a range of village level and regional institutions that {{play a critical role in}} the rural economy and in conservation of biodiversity. We believe that the path to sustainability in agriculture as well as maintenance of biodiversity passes through adaptive strong and relevant institutions. The development of institutions however is severely constrained by low social and human capital and the neglect of forest-agriculture <b>ecotones</b> by the governmental agencies and international organizations.

25|$|It tolerates a {{range of}} dry or mesic habitats, {{typically}} bushy grassland or sparsely wooded savannah. It also occurs along the fringes of marshes, in woodland clearings or in the fragmented <b>ecotone</b> of woodland and grassland. It is present from near sea level in the south, to about 3,000 meters near the equator. In Zimbabwe it occurs from 900 to 1,800 meters, and in East Africa from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. Termitaria, bushes, small trees or fence posts provide perches for display, while a combination of tall and short grass provides cover and foraging space. In southern Africa it occurs only sparsely in grassy fynbos, grassy karoo and upland sour grasslands, but has high reporting rates in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe, in miombo and in sweet or mixed grasslands.|$|E
25|$|Topi live {{primarily}} in grassland habitats ranging from treeless plains to savannas. In <b>ecotone</b> habitats between woodlands and open grasslands, they stay {{along the edge}} using the shade in hot weather. They prefer pastures with green grass that is medium in height with leaf-like swards. Topis are more densely populated in areas where green plants last into the dry season, particularly near water. The topi is a selective feeder and uses its elongated muzzle and flexible lips to forage for the freshest plants. When foraging for food, topi tend to take small bites at a fast rate. Topi generally frequent flat lowlands and at elevations below 1500 m. When {{they have access to}} enough green vegetation, topi usually do not have to drink. They drink more when relying on dry grass. Topi use , such as termite mounds, to {{get a good look at}} their surroundings.|$|E
40|$|Areas of {{environmental}} transition, where ecological communities coincide, are sometimes termed <b>ecotones.</b> These regions often correspond with sharp environmental gradients. <b>Ecotones</b> occur at multiple spatial scales, ranging from transitions between biomes to local small-scale transitions.

500|$|The impala inhabits {{woodlands}} {{due to its}} {{preference for}} shade; it can also occur on the interface (<b>ecotone)</b> between woodlands and savannahs. Places close to water sources are preferred. In southern Africa, populations tend {{to be associated with}} Colophospermum mopane and Acacia woodlands. Habitat choices differ seasonallyAcacia senegal woodlands are preferred in the wet season, and A. drepanolobium savannahs in the dry season. Another factor that could influence habitat choice is vulnerability to predators; impala tend to keep away from areas with tall grasses as predators could be concealed there. A study found that the reduction of woodland cover and creation of shrublands by the African bush elephants has favoured impala population by increasing the availability of more dry season browse. Earlier, the Baikiaea woodland, which has now declined due to elephants, provided minimum browsing for impala. The newly formed Capparis shrubland, on the other hand, could be a key browsing habitat. Impala are generally not associated with montane habitats; however, in KwaZulu-Natal, impala have been recorded at altitudes of up to [...] above sea level.|$|E
