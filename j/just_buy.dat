25|$|Future {{contracts}} are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without {{a few of}} the risks that forward contracts have. Future {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses ensure that every contract is honored and they take the opposite side of every contract. Future contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of future contracts. Future contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery never happens. The exchanges and clearinghouses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and cash out. So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that he predicts to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (spot) price of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to make money on the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his short position in the futures market which offsets any decrease in revenues from the spot market for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the futures market which is offset by an increase in revenues on the spot market for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a set date, the farmer will <b>just</b> <b>buy</b> and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers found {{independently}} {{producing the}} film to have both benefits and challenges. Although {{they were given a}} great amount of creative control by their executive producer Maurice Kanbar, their small budget kept them from making potentially beneficial changes to the story once production was underway. Todd Edwards related that [...] "Money doesn't <b>just</b> <b>buy</b> you more talent and more machinery, it also buys you flexibility on a story level. At Disney, if they don't like the third act, they just throw the whole thing out and re-animate the whole thing, even if it's finished... We had no such luxury, and so in a way, you're watching our first version of the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Challenged with inventing an {{original}} way for Quark {{to survive the}} fight without directly paralleling prior material, writers devised a [...] "holographic puppeteer" [...] system. Worf is seen wearing a headset which allows him to control the body movements of Quark, who is wearing a concealed receiver. It is not made clear how the [...] "virtual control device" [...] works. Indeed, Ronald D. Moore clarified: [...] "I wasn't interested in explaining it to the viewers. We <b>just</b> <b>buy</b> the premise and move on." [...] However, science consultant André Bormanis agreed that the [...] "web of sensors and actuators" [...] was conceptually sound. Dan Curry, who originally designed the bat'leth and helped developed Klingon fighting techniques, was instrumental in choreographing the combat scene between Quark and Thopok. Despite his character's apparent ineptitude at hand-to-hand combat, Shimerman practiced extensively with a bat'leth to make Worf's influence over Quark seem convincing. Shimerman also {{enlisted the help of}} a mime artist to improve his technique.|$|E

[...] Following {{the release of the}} theatrical trailer, media started speculating that the film might be a remake of or inspired by the 2005 Taiwanese film Three Times, which has a similar theme. However, Kohli denied the speculations, saying that he had not even seen that film and any resemblance was just a coincidence. [...] "Now-a-days if you want to remake a film, you <b>just</b> <b>buy</b> the rights and make the film," [...] he said. [...] "So if I wanted to make 'Three Times' I would have bought the rights."

[...] He looks to Magik for agreement, but she responds by teleporting him to Limbo for five days without food or water. [...] Eventually she returns to bring him water, and Anole tells her that he learned his lesson: without their own food supply, the mutant race could die. [...] Magik informs him that this was not a lesson and that she merely sent him to Limbo because she was sick of looking at him. [...] She returns them both to Utopia and Anole resumes farming, too afraid of Magik to tell anyone what happened. He is almost killed by the mutant Sack, who wanted his own corner of Utopia.|$|E
