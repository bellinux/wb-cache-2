5|$|Scully {{decides to}} join Mulder in the game, {{and the two}} fight Maitreya together. Maitreya begins to {{duplicate}} herself, making the task of killing her more difficult. Finally, Maitreya sits atop a virtual tank and aims it at the agents. Phoebe admits there {{is one way to}} stop the game, but <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> erase the entire program. Despite protests from Ivan, Phoebe gives Byers the kill command, effectively destroying Maitreya along with the game while saving Mulder and Scully. During Mulder's narration, we see that in the control room one of the monitors is still active. There, Ivan sees Maitreya's avatar, but with Scully's face.|$|E
5|$|Rose Tyler mysteriously {{appears to}} Donna to warn her of these events, but never reveals her {{identity}} to Donna. Rose's advice saves Donna {{and her family}} from the destruction of London. Sometime later, Rose appears again and tells her that she needs Donna to come with her, but that <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> result in Donna dying. Donna refuses, and Rose tells her {{that she will be}} back in three weeks. Three weeks later, Donna and Wilfred are using his telescope when they realise that the stars are disappearing from the sky. Rose appears and Donna is now convinced to go with her. Rose takes her to UNIT and explains that the stars are going out in every universe, and the fabric of reality is collapsing, allowing Rose to travel between universes. Rose implores to Donna that the Doctor {{is the only one who}} can stop it.|$|E

5|$|Like its predecessors, {{the game}} {{features}} some role-playing elements. Players can earn experience points by completing missions and defeating enemies, and these experience points {{can then be}} spent on performance boosts and upgrades. There are two sets of abilities for players to choose from, called The Tiger and The Elephant. The Tiger upgrades mainly improve players' offensive abilities, while The Elephant upgrades improve players' defensive skills. A variety of random events and hostile encounters take place throughout the game; for example, the player may unexpectedly be attacked by an eagle, be hit by a car, or witness an animal attack. Players can accumulate karma by performing kind actions towards the rebels, such as by assisting them in battles when they are attacked by wildlife or enemies. <b>Doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> give players discounts when purchasing new items at trading posts, and will allow players to call in support and back-up {{from members of the}} Golden Path. Players can also gain experience by collecting items like masks, propaganda posters, and prayer wheels. There is also an Arena mode, in which players battle human enemies and animals for additional experience points and rewards.|$|E

25|$|A {{transitive}} {{orientation of}} a graph, if it exists, {{can be found}} in linear time. However, the algorithm for <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> assign orientations to the edges of any graph, so to complete the task of testing whether a graph is a comparability graph, one must test whether the resulting orientation is transitive, a problem provably equivalent in complexity to matrix multiplication.|$|E
25|$|The Banishers: Banishers are warped Mages who {{dedicate}} {{themselves to}} destroying other Mages. Generally speaking, their Awakening was traumatic, undesired, and misunderstood, {{and they do}} not accept their mystical powers. They exist outside of normal mage society, and are often obsessed with hunting and killing other mages, usually driven by a desire for repentance or a belief that <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> cause their life to be returned to normal.|$|E
25|$|More complex attacks will however be hard {{to block}} with simple rules: for example, {{if there is an}} ongoing attack on port 80 (web service), it is not {{possible}} to drop all incoming traffic on this port because <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> prevent the server from serving legitimate traffic. Additionally, firewalls may be too deep in the network hierarchy, with routers being adversely affected before the traffic gets to the firewall.|$|E

25|$|Strong Bad {{appears as}} one of the {{computer-controlled}} opponents in Telltale's Poker Night at the Inventory, using the same model from SBCG4AP. Players can unlock in-game card sets and table designs based on Homestar Runner. Additionally, Strong Bad will occasionally bet Dangeresque Too's sunglasses in place of in-game cash; defeating him after <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> unlock the glasses as an equippable cosmetic item for the Demoman in Team Fortress 2. The game was released for PC and Mac on November 22, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Mary Warren {{enters and}} gives Elizabeth a 'poppet' (doll-like puppet) {{that she made}} in court that day while sitting as a witness. Angered that Mary is {{neglecting}} her duties, John threatens to beat her. Mary retorts that she saved Elizabeth's life that day, as Elizabeth was accused of witchcraft and was to be arrested until Mary spoke in her defense. Mary refuses to identify Elizabeth's accuser, but Elizabeth surmises accurately {{that it must have}} been Abigail. She implores John to go to court and tell the judges that Abigail {{and the rest of the}} girls are pretending. John is reluctant, fearing that <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> require him to publicly reveal his past adultery.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the sixth}} season, Willow struggles to allow herself to perform magic without the {{darkness}} within her taking her over. She {{is no longer}} able to abstain from magic as it is such an integral part of her that <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> kill her. In the instances when she is highly emotional the darkness comes out. Willow must control that part of her and is occasionally unable to do so, giving her a trait similar to Angel, a cursed vampire who fears losing his soul will turn him evil. In a redemptive turn, when Willow turns all the Potentials into Slayers, she glows and her hair turns white, astonishing Kennedy and prompting her to call Willow a goddess.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} Ghosts are {{hand-picked}} to form specialist kill-teams, {{placed in a}} regime of additional jump-training and covertly deployed into Ouranberg prior to the invasion. Codenamed Operation Larisel, their mission is to kill Sagittar Slaith; the Chaos commander of the Blood Pact holding Ouranberg. <b>Doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> break {{the morale of the}} Chaos worshippers and enable the Imperial forces to recapture Ouranberg with greater ease. The task is made more daunting with the prospect of thousands of Blood Pact troopers and loxatl mercenaries standing between them and their target. However, the rest of the Tanith First face their own trials as they await deployment; a great unease is brewing between the Tanith and the Verghastite soldiers, and a crime case involving several Ghosts highlights this divide.|$|E
25|$|In each level, {{the player}} is {{accompanied}} by three computer-controlled wingmen: Peppy Hare, Slippy Toad and Falco Lombardi. At certain pre-scripted points, one will fly into the player's view, often either chasing an enemy or being chased and asking for assistance. Ignoring a wingman's pleas will result in him taking damage, or even being shot down. They cannot be damaged by the player's own lasers (although they will complain if hit). Regardless of their survival, wingmen are not present during boss battles but rejoin the player before the next stage. A player may choose to help their wingmen when they ask for assistance, as <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> allow them to engage some of the enemies not destroyed by the player, helping the player to succeed and additionally {{making it easier to}} achieve maximum score in a given level. Additional points are also granted {{at the end of each}} level depending on the health of each wingman. If a wingman gets shot down, he will not return for the rest of the game.|$|E

500|$|Rather than {{stopping}} play, {{the referee}} may allow play to continue if <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This {{is known as}} [...] "playing an advantage".

Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.|$|E
500|$|Garupe {{leaves for}} Hirado Island, believing that their {{presence}} forces the shogunate to terrorize the village.

Wandering around Gotō, he struggles over whether it is self-centered to refuse to recant when <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> end others' suffering. He eventually reunites with Kichijiro, who betrays him {{into the hands of}} the samurai. An old samurai, who had earlier accompanied the [...] "Inquisitor" [...] to Tomogi, tells Rodrigues that other captured Christians will suffer unless he renounces his faith.|$|E
500|$|The faceless Darkspawn horde {{is led by}} the archdemon Urthemiel, {{supposedly}} one of the Old Gods of the Tevinter Imperium, incarnated in {{the form}} of a powerful and corrupted dragon with total control over the darkspawn. The game's other main antagonists are Teyrn Loghain Mac Tir, father of Queen Anora, a once-respected war hero gone mad with ambition and paranoia; and Rendon Howe, the amoral and corrupt Arl of Amaranthine who allies with Loghain to further his own ambitions. Loghain can be recruited as a [...] "secret companion," [...] but <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>will</b> cause Alistair to leave the Warden.|$|E
