5|$|Luna, Ron, Ginny, and Neville {{join them}} in the forest and all six fly to the Ministry on thestrals, expecting to find and rescue Sirius. Once in the Department of Mysteries, Harry realises that his vision was falsely planted by Voldemort; however, he finds a glass sphere that bears his and the Dark Lord's names. Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy attack in order to capture the sphere, which is a {{recording}} of a prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort, which is revealed to be the object Voldemort {{has been trying to}} obtain for the whole year, the Dark Lord believing that there was something he missed when he first heard the prophecy. Lucius explains that only the subjects of the prophecies, in this case Harry or Voldemort, can safely remove them from the shelves. During a heated fight Neville accidentally kicks and smashes the prophecy. Harry and his friends, soon joined by members of the Order, enter a battle with the Death Eaters, during which Bellatrix Lestrange kills Sirius and Voldemort himself arrives to kill Harry, but Dumbledore rescues him and climatically fights the Dark Lord to a stalemate. In the midst of the duel, Voldemort unsuccessfully tries to possess Harry in an attempt to get Dumbledore to kill the boy, then escapes just as Cornelius Fudge appears, finally faced with <b>first-hand</b> <b>evidence</b> that Voldemort has truly returned.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a general trust {{establishment}} framework comprising three components. The first part is the trust computation model that evaluates the trust level of each participating node through monitoring and quantification of some relevant behavioral indicative metrics. The second part is the trust evidence distribution scheme that distributes the trust evidences obtained by the first component. And finally the third part is the reputation computation model that combines the collected trust evidences from other nodes to form an overall reputation score and a judgment basis regarding the trustworthiness level of each node. The trust computation model is based on <b>first-hand</b> <b>evidences</b> obtained via direct observations at the MAC layer. The proposed trust evidence distribution scheme is an efficient, scalable and completely distributed scheme based on ant colony optimization algorithm. For combination of collected evidences in the reputation computation model, Dempster’s rule for combination is applied. Dempster’s rule for combination gives a numerical procedure for fusing together multiple pieces of evidence from unreliable observers. The paper, illustrates {{the applicability of the}} proposed framework on data packet delivery functionality with Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) as the underlying routing protocol. We present simulation results which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework...|$|R

500|$|According to {{literary}} scholar Anne Myles, {{the life of}} Mary Dyer [...] "functions as a powerful, almost allegorical example of a woman returning, over and over, to the same power-infused site of legal and discursive control."

[...] Looking at Burrough's account of the conversation between Dyer and Governor Endicott, Myles views {{the two most important}} dimensions as being agency and affiliation. The first is that Dyer's actions [...] "can be read as staging a public drama of agency," [...] a means for women, including female prophets, to act under the power and will of God.

He used Trigault's De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas (1615), based on a manuscript by Matteo Ricci, {{the founder of the}} Jesuit mission in Beijing in 1601, for information about that mission. Details pertaining to the sea voyage and Saint Helena likely came from Thomas Cavendish's account of his first circumnavigation of the world, available in Richard Hakluyt's Principal Navigations (1599–1600) and in Purchas His Pilgrimage, first published in 1613. Information on the Dutch Revolt, the historical setting for the early part of Gonsales' career, likely came from the annals of Emanuel van Meteren, a Dutch historian working in London.|$|E

In drawing so heavily on Moran for what he took to be the latter's totally reliable, <b>first-hand</b> clinical <b>evidence</b> of Churchill's lifelong struggle with [...] "prolonged and recurrent depression" [...] and its associated [...] "despair", Storr produced a seemingly authoritative and persuasive diagnostic essay that, {{in the words of}} John Ramsden, [...] "strongly influenced all later accounts".|$|R

Widespread agreement exists, however, that an exceptionally tall individual was reliably measured at 112.8 m by theodolite in 1880 by a surveyor, George Cornthwaite, at Thorpdale, Victoria (the tree is known both as the Cornthwaite or Thorpdale Tree). When it was felled in 1881, Cornthwaite remeasured it on the ground by chain at 114.3 m. The stump is commemorated with a plaque.

40|$|Our {{internal}} {{repository of}} words, often {{known as the}} mental lexicon, has primarily been modelled by psychologists {{as some kind of}} network. One way to probe its organisation and access mechanisms is by means of word association techniques, which have rarely been applied on Chinese. This paper reports on the design and implementation of a pilot word association test on native Hong Kong Cantonese speakers. The test contains 500 stimulus words, carefully selected and controlled on important factors including word frequency, part-of-speech, syllabicity, concreteness and vocabulary type. The resulting association norms based on 58 participants reveal interesting properties of the Chinese mental lexicon, such as the dominance of disyllabic and nominal concepts, and collocational associations. Despite its current small scale, the word association norms obtained from this study do not only offer <b>first-hand</b> psycholinguistic <b>evidence</b> for investigating the Chinese mental lexicon but also provide a useful resource to inform future studies in Chinese lexical access, lexical semantics and lexicography. ...|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{original}} works was On the Letters (О писмєньхъ) by Chernorizets Hrabar, where he defended the Cyrillic alphabet against its Byzantine Greek critics and proved not only its right to existence but also its superiority to the Greek alphabet arguing that the Greek letters were neither the oldest known to man, nor divine. In the form of rhetoric questions and answers On the Letters demonstrated excellent historic and linguistic knowledge of Chernorizets Hrabar, as he indicated that [...] "God did not first create the Hebrew or the Greek language, but Syrian which Adam spoke..." [...] and underlined that [...] "Before then the Greeks had no alphabet of their own but wrote their speech with Phoenician letters." [...] Constantine of Preslav and John the Exarch combined translated and adapted Byzantine works with original texts. The latter compiled the Shestodnev (Шестоднев – Hexameron) that included valuable <b>first-hand</b> <b>evidence</b> about the Bulgarian Empire under Simeon I. Constantine of Preslav's Didactic Gospel was the first systematic work treating sermons in Slavic literature that also featured the poetic preface Azbuchna molitva (Азбучна молитва – Alphabet Prayer), the first original poetry in Bulgarian language.

40|$|Through {{the action}} of its membrane-bound type I receptors, {{transforming}} growth factor-β (TGF-β) elicits {{a wide range of}} cellular responses that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Many of the signaling responses induced by TGF-β are mediated by Smad proteins, but certain evidence has suggested that TGF-β can also signal independently of Smads. We found in mouse mammary epithelial (NMuMG) cells, which respond to TGF-β treatment in multiple ways, that TGF-β-induced activation of p 38 MAP kinase is required for TGF-β-induced apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but not growth arrest. We further demonstrated that activation of p 38 is independent of Smads using a mutant type I receptor, which is incapable of activating Smads but still retains the kinase activity. This mutant receptor is sufficient to activate p 38 and cause NMuMG cells to undergo apoptosis. However, it is not sufficient to induce EMT. These results indicate that TGF-β receptor signals through multiple intracellular pathways and provide <b>first-hand</b> biochemical <b>evidence</b> for the existence of Smad-independent TGF-β receptor signaling...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there has}} been {{considerable}} research on firm-level technological capability building {{in the context of}} developing economies, there is a scarcity of studies which examine this issue in multinational enterprises’ socially motivated businesses located in less developed economies. This paper examines the latterissue on the basis of <b>first-hand</b> empirical <b>evidence</b> derived from an extensive field research on Grameen-Danone Foods Limited (GDFL) in Bangladesh. The study found that GDFL generated relevant spillovers to the host economy by accumulating production capabilities in association with innovation capabilities at intermediate levels across four technological functions: project management, process and production organization, product centred and equipment-related. Apart from revealing the types of frugal and reverse innovations which emanates from such a business, our study also explores - unlike existing studies which only focus on the financial and social benefits - the technological benefits generated from a social business model. Understanding the nature and dynamics of technological activities in social businesses of less developed economies is relevant for the achievement of enhanced local, autonomous and sustainable economic and social development...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to the debate relative to industrial technological capability building in association with changes into a liberalised and globalized economic regime implemented from the early 1990 s in several late-industrialising countries. During the past few years certain generalisations have held that such policy changes had a pervasive negative impact on industrial technological capabilities in Southern Latin American countries, particularly in Brazil. Such issue is examined here in three sets of manufacturing firms in the Industrial Pole of Manaus (Northern Brazil) – a total of 46 firms. The paper draws on <b>first-hand</b> empirical <b>evidence</b> collected through extensive fieldwork. The technological capability of most foreign subsidiaries and local firms, far from being static and confined to basic levels, have been upgraded to carry out diverse types of innovative activities. These capability levels are strongly associated with local decision-making and control. Inter-firm technological learning links have contributed to building such capability levels. Exporter firms are those with deeper capability levels.

40|$|Although {{much has}} been written about the {{implications}} of the structural reforms of the 1990 s for industrial progress in developing countries, especially in Latin America, less attention has been given to the role of meso and micro factors in sector and firm-level technological capability building. Most existing studies are based on aggregate analyses that argue either for or against such reforms. Seeking to offer an alternative perspective on this debate, this paper examines sources of firms' technological capability accumulation in the light of changes in government policies. It draws on <b>first-hand</b> empirical <b>evidence</b> from 75 organizations in Northern Brazil. The evidence suggests that policies and factors at the meso and micro level do matter in understanding the learning strategies underlying firms' capability-building processes. The latter do not take place in a vacuum or just on the back of sound, market-oriented macroeconomic policies. A combination of different kinds of government policies, foreign competition and firm-level learning efforts has been proving essential for firms to develop innovative capability. However, the move into more advanced capability levels in the sampled firms will not just involve a “discontinuity” in their existing learning strategies; it will also entail a redesign of the related government policies. ...|$|R

The evidence indicates that the efforts on technological capability accumulation, especially for innovative activities, permitted the case-study firm to improve its operational performance, notably in terms of technical and, to some extent, in terms of commercial indicators. This study contributes to advancing our understanding of relationship between the firm-level accumulation of technological capabilities and operational performance improvement. The study draws managers’ attention to the importance of managing and measuring a multiplicity of technological capabilities within firms and to the relevance of firm-level engineering-based innovative activities, normally neglected by policy makers...|$|R

60|$|Something {{more akin}} to modern {{research}} began {{about the time of}} the Reformation, and lasted till about 1680. The fury for burning witches led men of sense, learning, and humanity to ask whether there was any reality in witchcraft, and, generally, in the marvels of popular belief. The inquiries of Thyraeus, Lavaterus, Bodinus, Wierus, Le Loyer, Reginald Scot, and many others, tended on the whole to the negative side as regards the wilder fables about witches, but left the problems of ghosts and haunted houses pretty much where they were before. It may be observed that Lavaterus (circ. 1580) already put forth a form of the hypothesis of telepathy (that 'ghosts' are hallucinations produced by the direct action of one mind, or brain, upon another), while Thyraeus doubted whether the noises heard in 'haunted houses' were not mere hallucinations of the sense of hearing. But all these early writers, like Cardan, were very careless of <b>first-hand</b> <b>evidence,</b> and, indeed, preferred ghosts vouched for by classical authority, Pliny, Plutarch, or Suetonius. With the Rev. Joseph Glanvil, F.R.S. (circ. 1666), a more careful examination of evidence came into use. Among the marvels of Glanvil's and other tracts usually published together in his 'Sadducismus Triumphatus' will be found letters which show that he and his friends, like Henry More and Boyle, laboured to collect <b>first-hand</b> <b>evidence</b> for second sight, haunted houses, ghosts, and wraiths. The confessed object was to procure a 'Whip for the Droll,' a reply to the laughing scepticism of the Restoration. The result was to bring on Glanvil a throng of bores--he was 'worse haunted than Mr. Mompesson's house,' he says-and Mr. Pepys found his arguments 'not very convincing.' Mr. Pepys, however, was alarmed by 'our young gib-cat,' which he mistook for a 'spright.' With Henry More, Baxter, and Glanvil practically died, for the time, the attempt to investigate these topics scientifically, though an impression of doubt was left on the mind of Addison. Witchcraft ceased to win belief, and was abolished, as a crime, in 1736. Some of the Scottish clergy, and John Wesley, clung fondly to the old faith, but Wodrow, and Cotton Mather (about 1710-1730) were singularly careless and unlucky in producing anything like evidence for their narratives. Ghost stories continued to be told, but not to be investigated.|$|E
60|$|Since {{the first}} {{publication}} of Cock Lane and Common-Sense in 1894, nothing has occurred to alter greatly the author's opinions. He {{has tried to}} make the Folklore Society see that such things as modern reports of wraiths, ghosts, 'fire-walking,' 'corpse-lights,' 'crystal-gazing,' and so on, are within their province, and within the province of anthropology. In this attempt he has not quite succeeded. As he understands the situation, folklorists and anthropologists will hear gladly about wraiths, ghosts, corpse- candles, hauntings, crystal-gazing, and walking unharmed through fire, as long as these things are part of vague rural tradition, or of savage belief. But, as soon as there is <b>first-hand</b> <b>evidence</b> of honourable men and women for the apparent existence of any of the phenomena enumerated, then Folklore officially refuses {{to have anything to do}} with the subject. Folklore will register and compare vague savage or popular beliefs; but when educated living persons vouch for phenomena which (if truly stated) account in part for the origin of these popular or savage beliefs, then Folklore turns a deaf ear. The logic of this attitude does not commend itself to the author of Cock Lane and Common-Sense.|$|E

40|$|Background: Lifetime risk {{of suicide}} in first-episode {{psychosis}} far exceeds the general population, with {{the risk of}} suicide persisting long after first presentation. There is strong {{evidence to suggest that}} women more frequently attempt suicide, while men are at a greater risk of completing suicide. <b>First-hand</b> experiential <b>evidence</b> is needed in order to better understand men's motives for, and struggles with, suicidality in early psychosis. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 7 participants. The interviews explored each respondent's account of their suicide attempt within the broader context of their life, in relation to their past, present and future. In line with the exploratory, inductive nature of the study, an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to explore the meaning of suicide attempts in these accounts. Results: Three super-ordinate themes emerged: Self-as-vulnerable (intra- and inter-personal relationships), appraisal of cumulative life events as unbearable and meaning of recovery marked by shared sense of hope and imagery for the future. Conclusions: Young men {{in the early stages of}} their treatment are seeking to find meaning for frightening, intrusive experiences with origins which often precede psychosis. These experiences permeate personal identity, relationships and recovery. Suicide was perceived as an escape from this conundrum, and was pursued angrily and impulsively. By contrast, the attainment of hope was marked by sharing one's burden and finding a sense of belonging. Specialized assertive outreach programmes may be beneficial in improving the social inclusion of young men who may be particularly marginalized...|$|R
60|$|There {{is a kind}} of hallucinations--namely, Phantasms of the Dead--about {{which it}} seems better to say nothing in this place. If such phantasms are seen by savages when awake, they will doubtless greatly corroborate that belief in the {{endurance}} of the soul after death, which is undeniably suggested to the early reasoner by the phenomena of dreaming. But, while it is easy enough to produce evidence to recognised phantasms of the dead in civilised life, {{it would be very difficult}} indeed to discover many good examples in what we know about savages. Some Fijian instances are given by Mr. Fison in his and Mr. Howitt's 'Kamilaroi and Kurnai,' Others occur in the narrative of John Tanner, a captive from childhood among the Red Indians. But the circumstance, already noted, that an Australian lad became a wizard on the strength of having seen a phantasm of his dead mother, proves that such experiences are not common; and Australian black fellows have admitted that they, for their part, never did see a ghost, but only heard of ghosts from their old men.
