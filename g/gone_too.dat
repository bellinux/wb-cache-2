5|$|At Cranbrook, Romney helped {{manage the}} ice hockey team, {{and he joined}} the pep squad. During his senior year, he joined the cross country running team. He belonged to eleven school {{organizations}} and school clubs overall, including the Blue Key Club, a booster group that he had started. During his final year there, his academic record improved but fell short of excellence. Romney was involved in several pranks while attending Cranbrook. He has since apologized for those, stating {{that some of the}} pranks may have <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far. In March of his senior year, he began dating Ann Davies; she attended the private Kingswood School, the sister school to Cranbrook. The two became informally engaged around the time of his June 1965 graduation.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E

5|$|Goldstein {{appeared}} as himself in several television series, contributed mixes to and portrayed a playable {{character in the}} video game DJ Hero, and filmed a cameo appearance for Iron Man 2. Goldstein hosted the 2009 MTV drug intervention series <b>Gone</b> <b>Too</b> Far, and {{he appeared to be}} struggling with his addiction during filming. On August 28, 2009, he was found dead in his New York City apartment from a drug overdose. The DJ AM Memorial Fund, an organization designed to help people struggling with drug addiction, was launched in his memory by his sister, and Iron Man 2, which was released in 2010, was dedicated to him.|$|E
5|$|Goldstein was {{the host}} of <b>Gone</b> <b>Too</b> Far, a drug {{intervention}} reality show for MTV. He had approached MTV in mid 2008, pitching {{the idea of a}} reality show that focused on his life to Tony DiSanto. DiSanto said that such shows were declining in popularity, and instead suggested a drug intervention show to which Goldstein agreed. The show was still in pre-production when Goldstein was injured in the plane crash. Following the crash, the show's producer Cheryl Sirulnick said she assumed the show would not go ahead, but Goldstein insisted on continuing. Eight episodes were filmed; three days before his death, Goldstein tweeted that filming had been completed.|$|E
5|$|In the 2016 Honolulu mayoral {{elections}} {{the main}} three candidates again took opposing views on rail. Charles Djou, former mayor Peter Carlisle, and incumbent Kirk Caldwell all ran for mayor with the stated goal of finishing rail. However, Republican Djou ran on drastically cutting spending on rail by cutting funding on buying {{cars on the}} rail before its completion, and hiring mainland consultants. Kirk Caldwell also stated that spending on rail should be cut, but instead by shortening the rail to end at Middle Street. Carlisle was the only candidate in full support of funding the rail system and stated that rail has <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far to be stopped. Kirk Caldwell won the election, and promptly went on to adopt Carlisle's position that rail should be completed.|$|E

During the feud, Tara began claiming that Rayne had <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far in her brutality towards Mickie James, but {{was forced to}} follow her orders due to being under exclusive contract with her, and not TNA. After Rayne lost the Knockouts Championship to James at Lockdown, James agreed {{to give her a}} rematch on the condition that if she is unable to regain the title, Tara would be released from her contract with Rayne. On May 15 at Sacrifice, Tara became a fan favorite after knocking out Rayne during her match with James, costing her the Knockouts Championship and guaranteeing herself a release from her contract with Rayne.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners who developed black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E
5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was {{developed}} by Grasshopper Manufacture. The game was conceived by studio founder Goichi Suda, beginning development in 1999 after completion of the studio's debut title The Silver Case. The staff number for The Silver Case was under ten people and thus they had to adjust their development goals based on that. For Flower, Sun, and Rain five or six more people were involved and thus the scope was increased, such as including exploration and action elements. According to Suda, Flower, Sun, and Rain {{was part of the}} studio's transition towards more action-oriented titles. While The Silver Case was published on the original PlayStation, that console was nearing the end of its viable life cycle, so Flower, Sun, and Rain {{was developed}} for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). Flower, Sun, and Rain moved away from the purely text-driven structure of The Silver Case, but it still carried over many of the previous game's themes and concepts. As with The Silver Case, Suda wanted to include puzzles, but felt that he had <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far with the variety and challenge of puzzles within The Silver Case. Instead, Suda created a single puzzle system revolving around numerical combinations, which both simplified puzzles and tied in with Mondo's character.|$|E

5|$|Árbenz's role {{as defense}} {{minister}} {{had already made}} him a strong candidate for the presidency, and his firm support of the government during the 1949 uprising further increased his prestige. In 1950, the economically moderate Partido de Integridad Nacional (PIN) announced that Árbenz would be its presidential candidate in the upcoming election. This announcement was quickly followed by endorsements from most parties on the left, including the influential PAR, {{as well as from}} labor unions. Árbenz had only a couple of significant challengers in the election, in a field of ten candidates. One of these was Jorge García Granados, who was supported by some members of the upper-middle class who felt the revolution had <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far. Another was Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes, who had been a general under Ubico, and who had the support of the hardline opponents of the revolution. During his campaign, Árbenz promised to continue and expand the reforms begun under Arévalo. The election was held on 15 November 1950, and Árbenz won more than 60% of the vote, in elections that were free and fair {{with the exception of the}} disenfranchisement of illiterate female voters. Árbenz was inaugurated as president on 15 March 1951.|$|E

25|$|In English Canada, {{there is}} some {{regional}} variation in attitudes towards federal bilingualism policy, but it is relatively modest {{when compared to the}} divergence between the views expressed by Quebecers and those expressed {{in the rest of the}} country. For example, in a poll conducted in 2000, only 22% of Quebecers agreed with the statement, “We have <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far in pushing bilingualism,” while positive response rates in English Canada ranged from a low of 50% in the Atlantic to a high of 65% in the Prairies.|$|E
25|$|The Triggering: Has Political Correctness <b>Gone</b> <b>Too</b> Far? was {{an event}} {{hosted by the}} College Republicans Club of the University of Massachusetts Amherst on April 25, 2016, {{featuring}} former philosophy professor and host of The Factual Feminist YouTube series Christina Hoff Sommers, political commentator Steven Crowder and former Breitbart senior technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos. The topic of discussion was the effect of political correctness on free speech, and whether political correctness culture has grown to be detrimental. Additional topics included social justice, feminism, trigger warnings, and microaggressions. Some students attending began protesting mid-event, accusing the panelists of hate speech and demanding that they leave campus.|$|E

Jourdain clearly outlined the dangers of following the academic path in his review of the 1889 Exposition, while pointing out the potentials in the art of engineers, aesthetics, the fusion with decorative arts and the need for social reform. He soon became well known as a staunch critic of traditionalism and a fervent proponent of Modernism, yet even for him, the Cubists had <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far.|$|E
25|$|McDonald, {{along with}} USWA general counsel Arthur J. Goldberg, {{played a key}} role in the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955.

With the death of Murray on November 9 and AFL president William Green just two weeks later, the personality differences keeping the two labor federations apart seemed to disappear. <b>Gone</b> <b>too</b> were the paralyzing arguments over industrial unionism, organizing and civil rights. Both labor federations were organizing significant numbers of workers (including blacks), and many of the workers went into industrial unions.|$|E
25|$|The {{comprehensive}} and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over {{the pace of}} marketization and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers ("the right", led by Hu Yaobang) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives ("the left", led by Chen Yun) said that the reforms had <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. Both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.|$|E
