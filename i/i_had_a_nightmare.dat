I know every word, I know every note, and yet I can't feel sure. I can't sleep for {{thinking}} about it. Only last night <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> I saw all those rows and rows of faces, and the lights, and my voice went, my tongue was dry and hard, not a word would come. And you were there--and the others!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wish the}} man did not run in my {{thoughts}} so much. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> {{on the night of}} the 20th, in which I thought my bunk was a coffin, that I was laid out in it, and that Goring was endeavouring to nail up the lid, which I was frantically pushing away. Even when I woke up, I could hardly persuade myself that I was not in a coffin. As a medical man, I know that a nightmare is simply a vascular derangement of the cerebral hemispheres, and yet in my weak state I cannot shake off the morbid impression which it produces.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the first}} night the whole pit and gallery, except certain members of the Fabian Society, started {{to laugh at the}} author and then, {{discovering}} that they themselves were being laughed at, sat there not converted--their hatred was too bitter for that--but dumbfounded, {{while the rest of the}} house cheered and laughed. In the silence that greeted the author after the cry for a speech one man did indeed get his courage and boo loudly. [...] "I assure the gentleman in the gallery," [...] was Shaw's answer, [...] "that he and I are of exactly the same opinion, but what can we do against a whole house who are of the contrary opinion?" [...] And from that moment Bernard Shaw became the most formidable man in modern letters, and even the most drunken of medical students knew it. My own play, which had been played with The Comedy of Sighs, had roused no passions, but had pleased a sufficient minority for Florence Farr to keep it upon the stage with Arms and the Man, and I was in the theatre almost every night for some weeks. [...] "Oh, yes, the people seem to like Arms and the Man," [...] said one of Mr Shaw's players to me, [...] "but we have just found out that we are all wrong. Mr Shaw did really mean it quite seriously, for he has written a letter to say so, and we must not play for laughs any more." [...] Another night I found the manager, triumphant and excited, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh had been there, and the Duke of Edinburgh had spoken his dislike out loud so that the whole stalls could hear, but the Prince of Wales had been [...] "very pleasant" [...] and [...] "got the Duke of Edinburgh away as soon as possible." [...] "They asked for me," [...] he went on, [...] "and the Duke of Edinburgh kept on repeating, 'The man is mad,' meaning Mr Shaw, and the Prince of Wales asked who Mr Shaw was, and what he meant by it." [...] I myself was almost as bewildered for though I came mainly to see how my own play went, and for the first fortnight to vex my most patient actors with new lines, I listened with excitement to see how the audience would like certain passages of Arms and the Man. I hated it; it seemed to me inorganic, logical straightness and not the crooked road of life and I stood aghast before its energy as to-day before that of the Stone Drill by Mr. Epstein or of some design by Mr Wyndham Lewis. He was right to claim Samuel Butler for his master, for Butler was the first Englishman to make the discovery, that it is possible to write with great effect without music, without style, either good or bad, to eliminate from the mind all emotional implication and to prefer plain water to every vintage, so much metropolitan lead and solder to any tendril of the vine. Presently <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> that I was haunted by a sewing machine, that clicked and shone, but the incredible thing was that the machine smiled, smiled perpetually. Yet I delighted in Shaw the formidable man. He could hit my enemies and the enemies of all I loved, as I could never hit, as no living author that was dear to me could ever hit.|$|E
5000|$|Leading {{up to the}} event, Beck {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} various media personalities, comedians and writers. MSNBC's Keith Olbermann stated that {{he was worried about}} Glenn Beck's sanity after Beck said that he wanted to let [...] "the spirit" [...] speak through him at the rally. The day before the rally on the same network, Chris Matthews, of Hardball With Chris Matthews, used his ending segment to announce: Can we imagine if King were physically here tomorrow, today, were he to reappear tomorrow on the very steps of the Lincoln Memorial? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> that one day a right wing talk show host will come to this spot, his people's lips dripping with the words interposition and nullification. Little right wing boys and little right wing girls joining hands and singing their praise for Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b>|$|R

In an ideal world <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> wanted to up the tempo from three out, but with the loose horse <b>I</b> was <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> However, Bindaree got me out of jail at the last â€” he's a {{brilliant}} jumper." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} nine months before her death, Amy Wallace said that Irving was [...] "virtually a perfect dad - a wonderful, loving man, {{who did a}} lot of the things one would expect a mother to do: when I wet the bed at three in the morning when I was little, he uncomplainingly got up and changed them; he cut out my paper dolls; when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> he got up with me, no matter what time, to share a cup of tea and talk about it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Savage {{signed a}} year {{extension}} to his Derby {{contract with the}} club on 10 August 2009 to take him {{through to the end}} of the 2010-11 season. The next day, he was named in the Championship Team of the Week for his performance in the opening day victory over Peterborough United. Later that month, Savage was renamed as Captain of Derby County, replacing Paul Connolly, who manager Nigel Clough wanted to [...] "concentrate on his own game". In response, Savage said that: [...] "I did not deserve the captaincy when I first came to the club. I was handed it from the first day and I shouldn't have been. It was too much pressure for me and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>nightmare.</b> I let it get to me. I think I'm ready for it now. I feel more comfortable with it now." [...] Derby struggled once again during the season, not achieving safety until the 44th fixture, but the season was a personal success for Savage as he appeared in all but one of Derby's 51 league and cup fixtures during the campaign, the match which he missed being due to suspension, starting 49 of them. He also scored twice; a free kick against Queens Park Rangers in a 4-2 home defeat and a volley at Sheffield United in a 1-1 draw. He also won the club's own Player of the Year award but lost out on the fan's award to Shaun Barker.|$|E

'I {{told you}} at the inn in London, I am heavy company for myself, sometimes. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> <b>nightmare</b> to myself, just now--must <b>have</b> <b>had</b> one, <b>I</b> think.

60|$|The {{next thing}} I {{remember}} is, waking {{up with a}} feeling as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> frightful <b>nightmare,</b> and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation, uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my faculties. Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me; lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more tenderly than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever been raised or upheld before. I rested my head against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.|$|R
60|$|My {{sense of}} the enormity of London {{increased}} with the twilight, and began to prevail a little against my intense personal wretchedness. I remember wastes of building enterprise, interminable vistas of wide dark streets, with passing trams, and here and there at strategic corners coruscating groups of shops. And somewhere I came along a narrow street suddenly upon the distant prospect of a great monstrous absurd place on a steep hill against the last brightness of the evening sky, a burlesque block of building with huge truncated pyramids at either corner, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> since learnt was the Alexandra Palace. It was so queer and bulky that it arrested and held my attention, struck on my memory with an almost dreamlike quality, so that years afterwards I went to Muswell Hill to see if indeed there really was such a place on earth, or whether <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> waking <b>nightmare</b> during my wanderings....|$|R
2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2008, as the U.S. presidential {{nomination}} conventions approached, Hamsher continued her opposition to Senator Joe Lieberman's political aspirations in both Firedoglake and other venues, culminating in her The Huffington Post entry emphatically stating her fear {{that he might be}} chosen by the Republican Presidential candidate John McCain for his Vice Presidential running mate: [...] "Obviously, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> elaborate <b>nightmare</b> where Joe Lieberman gets the VP nod, McCain wins, then dies -- and we're looking at a President Lieberman. At which point I and a [...] host of others bloggers who supported Ned Lamont wind up in Guantanamo Bay." [...] After Barack Obama became President Elect on November 4, 2008, Hamsher unsuccessfully opposed Lieberman's staying in the Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate and retaining his chairmanship of his United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (both of which Obama ultimately supported), as a consequence not only of Senator Lieberman's prior disengagement from the Democratic Party, his support of the Republican presidential candidate McCain, and his failure to adhere to promises not to attack Obama during the campaign, but, also, more importantly from her perspective, of what she alleges to be Lieberman's [...] "prevent Senatorial investigation into no-bid contracts and contractor abuse within the Department of Homeland Security," [...] urging her readers to sign the [...] "Just Say No to Joe" [...] petition that she posted on Firedoglake.|$|R
