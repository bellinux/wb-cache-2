2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of Howard Hughes' personal 307 also survives, {{although it}} has been converted into a houseboat. The aircraft was awaiting restoration at Fort Lauderdale international airport when it was severely damaged in a hurricane in the early 1960s, having been blown into a stand of trees after its tiedowns failed. [...] The aircraft languished for nearly a year before being removed and longer still until later salvaged for its conversion into the <b>house</b> <b>boat.</b> [...] The interior is notable for the original finishes and fitments added by Howard Hughes.|$|E
60|$|Next {{morning we}} arrived at Buenos Ayres, and cast anchor about two miles from shore, for that was as near the land as we could get. Presently we were boarded by a Custom House officer, and for some time longer I was engaged in getting out our luggage and in {{bargaining}} with the captain to put us on shore. When I had completed these arrangements I was very much {{surprised to see the}} cunning old soldier I had talked with the evening before sitting in the Custom <b>House</b> <b>boat,</b> which was just putting off from the side. Demetria had been looking on when the old fellow had left the ship, and she now came to me looking very excited.|$|E

60|$|The {{very fact}} that this common-looking old man had gone on shore in the Custom <b>House</b> <b>boat</b> proved {{that he was a}} person of {{consequence}} in disguise, and I could not doubt that Demetria was right. I felt excessively annoyed at myself for having failed to penetrate his disguise; for something of the old Marcos Marcó style of speaking might very well have revealed his identity if I had only had my wits about me. I was also very much concerned on Demetria's account, for it seemed that I had missed finding out something for her which would have been to her advantage to know. I was ashamed to tell her of that conversation about a relation in Buenos Ayres, but secretly determined to try and find Santa Coloma to get him to tell me what he knew.|$|E
