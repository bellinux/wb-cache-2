40|$|Minimization {{of frost}} {{formation}} on the outdoor coils of residential heat pumps and subsequent <b>defrost</b> <b>cycles</b> {{to remove the}} frost in an energy efficient manner remains an active area {{of research and development}} in the HVAC industry. Inverting the cycle to reject heat from the outdoor coils is the most common method to run <b>defrost</b> <b>cycles</b> of the residential heat pumps. However, these <b>defrost</b> <b>cycles</b> are energy intensive. This research proposes a novel method that can substantially reduce the energy consumed in such <b>defrost</b> <b>cycles.</b> The method involves controlled use of reverse air flow on the outdoor coil surface during the <b>defrost</b> <b>cycle,</b> resulting in fewer <b>defrost</b> <b>cycles</b> needed for a given duration of heat pump operation.

Considering the different characteristics of variable refrigerant flow {{air conditioning system}} (VRF AC) from the common air conditioners, the defrosting criterion model of time-coil temperature-condensation temperature has been built. In this model, there exist four temperature regions based on different frosting characteristics at different ambient temperatures, i. e., T-ao(degrees C) {{is an element of}} (-infinity, - 9], (- 9, 0], (0, 4], (4, 21]. The relations between the defrosting judgment temperatures and ambient temperatures have been determined by experiments. And the minimum <b>defrosting</b> <b>cycle</b> when T-ao(degrees C) is an element of (- 9, 21] and T-ao(degrees C) is an element of (-infinity, - 9] were respectively determined to be 60 min and 90 min by experiments. Moreover, the defrosting accumulative coefficient, the defrosting judgment time constant and the restriction of the condensation temperature have been introduced into the model. Thus the complete criterion model can avoid delayed and premature defrosting, even false defrosting and inaccessible defrosting. A large number of experiments have verified the feasibility of the model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacities}} of performance improvements of low and mid-size heat pumps are studied in this project. For the new buildings market, {{the components of}} the heat pump match already well the requirements for high performance and monovalent heating. Minor improvements are to be expected on inverter driven compressors and on the integration of the domestic water in the heat pump cycle. This study is focused on the retrofit market (replacement of existing oil burners). For this case the existing air-water heat pumps are not economical and performance decrease rapidly at low air temperatures. A two-stage heat pump with two phase injection and an economiser vessel has been built in collaboration with Termogamma. It has been compared to a single-stage configuration (Pompe à chaleur biétagée à haute performance, Phase I). The measurements at steady state conditions show significant improvements on heat output and coefficient of performance for the refrigerants R 22 and R 407 C. In phase 2 of this project the tests are focused on a new defrosting scheme using energy stored at low exergy in the economiser. This method is compared to the reversed cycle defrosting at critical conditions A 2 /W 50 / 93 r. h. Both defrosting methods have equivalent performance reduction. Relative heat output reduction is - 12 % COP is reduced by - 4 % comparing to the steady state conditions (evaporator not frosted). Combining the two methods, reversed cycle and economiser, the overall performances are further improved (heat output - 7 % and COP - 3 %). The complete cycle length was limited by oil migration effects. The mechanisms of oil migration in two-stage heat pumps will be examined in a starting project at the Laboratory for Industrial Energy Systems (LENI). Several types of refrigerants are compared in the single-stage and two-stage case by simulation. The simulation includes real compressor and exchanger characteristics. The results show the important decrease of the coefficient of performance and the reduction of the heat output at low air temperatures. At higher temperatures the single stage mode is more adapted for the existing compressors. COP crossing occurs between 0 °C and 5 °C external air temperature. For the retrofit application, traditional heat pump design cannot be explored efficiently in the case of monovalent heating. This two stage concept is very promising, but oil migration problems have to be solved for commercialisation. The refrigerant cycle can be simplified, according to the refrigerant type used. The economiser did not show the expected improvement for the <b>defrosting</b> <b>cycle.</b> The major part of the energy potential could not be explored in the tests. For an air-air heat pump the increased refrigerant charge can be justified with the important improvements on the defrosting (only hot gas defrosting can be implemented in this case) ...|$|E

40|$|Today, {{transport}} refrigeration systems form {{a crucial}} part of the “ Cold Chain” transporting fresh and frozen produce from refrigerated warehouses to wholesalers. When these systems operate with compartment set-point temperatures of 0 °C or below frost forms {{on the surface of the}} evaporator coil due to the presence of moisture in the air. This moisture may result from air infiltration due to door openings or produce transpiration. As frost forms on the evaporator coil the free airflow space between the evaporator fins decreases, ultimately reducing the refrigerating capacity o f the system. <b>Defrost</b> <b>cycles</b> are periodically required to remove this frost to maintain system performance.

An important {{problem in the}} refrigeration industry is the formation and removal of frost layers on sub-freezing air coolers. The frost layer, a porous structure of ice and air, directly diminishes the performance and efficiency of the entire cooling system by presenting resistances to air flow and heat transfer in the air cooler. To return the system to pre-frosted performance the layer must be removed through a <b>defrost</b> <b>cycle.</b> The most common <b>defrost</b> <b>cycle</b> uses heat applied at the heat exchanger surfaces to melt the frost. Current methods of defrosting are inherently inefficient, {{with the majority of}} the heat being lost to the surrounding environment. Most studies have concentrated on the formation of the frost layer, and not the melting phenomena during the <b>defrost</b> <b>cycle.</b> In this study, direct measurements and a fundamental model to describe the melting process of a frost layer on a vertical heated surface are presented. The experimental facility provides the first direct measurements of heat and mass transfer during defrost. The measurements confirmed the multistage nature of defrost. The multistage model characterized the different thermal and mass transport processes that dominate each stage. The first stage is dominated by sensible heating of the frost layer. Both the experiment and model showed that heat and mass transfer through sublimation during the initial stages are insignificant, accounting for less than 1 % of the total energy transfer. The second stage of defrost is dominated by the melting of the frost layer. The melt rate model generally predicts the front velocity within 25 % of the velocity determined using the digital image analysis technique. Higher heat transfer rates resulted in faster melt velocity, and thus shortened defrost times. Evaporation of the melt liquid from the surface dominates the final stage. The heat transfer model for this stage predicts the heat transfer coefficient within ± 25 % of the experiment. The overall defrost efficiency was found to be primarily dependent on the initial frost thickness, with thicker layer having less heat lost to the ambient space and a higher efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Frost {{formation}} in heat/energy exchangers is undesirable {{because it may}} reduce air flow through the exchanger, increase the power consumption of fans, decrease {{the effectiveness of the}} exchanger, and in extreme cases, cause physical damage to the exchanger. Frosting is more critical in regions with arctic weather conditions, such as Canada and Northern Europe. Membrane-based energy exchangers are believed to be an important step towards frost free exchangers; however, {{at the beginning of this}} PhD study, there was no data available in the open literature documenting frosting in membrane energy exchangers. Therefore, the main goal of this PhD work is to determine if membrane energy exchangers are less susceptible to frosting than conventional heat exchangers. In this thesis, an in-depth study between conventional cross-flow air-to-air heat exchangers and membrane energy exchangers is conducted to (1) quantify the frosting limit; the operating conditions at which frost first begins in an exchanger, (2) develop a theoretical model to predict the frosting limit, and (3) quantify the energy impact of frosting and <b>defrosting</b> <b>cycles</b> on energy recovery. To meet these objectives, a test facility to test exchangers under frosting and <b>defrosting</b> <b>cycles</b> is developed and different strategies to detect frosting inside the exchangers are investigated. For the first time in the literature, it is shown that the temperature profile at the exhaust outlet can be used as a reliable and quick method to detect frosting. The frosting limit temperature of the energy exchanger is found to be 5 ℃ to 10 ℃ lower than the frosting limit of the heat exchanger under the same air flow rate and exhaust air relative humidity. Testing the exchangers under both frosting and defrosting conditions shows that the frost accumulation rate is nearly linear with time, while the frost removal rate decreases exponentially with time. Moreover, the frosting rate in the heat exchanger is found to be three times higher than that of the energy exchanger. A theoretical model to predict the frosting limit using the design parameters of the exchangers and the operating conditions is developed. The model is verified with experiments. Both the experimental and theoretical results show that the indoor air moisture content and the outdoor air temperature have significant effects on the frosting limit. Finally, a method to calculate the energy impact of frosting is introduced. Comparison between different frost control strategies in exchangers shows that frost prevention is preferred over repeated cycle of frosting followed by defrosting...|$|R

In the energy technology department of SP there is a new climate chamber that has recently been used in a research project to evaluate the performance of two air-to-air heat pumps. The performance of the climate chamber is critical to the accuracy of the testing results. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the thermal property of the climate chamber, develop a numerical model to describe the dynamic thermal process of the chamber and evaluate the testing results by simulating the heating process. By transforming the chamber thermal model to an equivalent analog electrical circuit and solving this first order system, an equation set was derived to describe the chamber thermal process. Several measurements and computer calculations were performed to determine the optimal parameters for the model. Finally the model was integrated with Matlab GUI and developed as a programme with user interface. Several heat pump testing cases were investigated with this model. The results show that for measurements without large power variation and <b>defrosting</b> <b>cycles</b> the COP values from the Calorimeter test method and the simulations are very close.

50|$|Modern air {{conditioning}} systems are not designed to draw air into the room from the outside, they only recirculate the increasingly cool air on the inside. Because this inside air always has some amount of moisture suspended in it, the cooling portion of the process always causes ambient warm water vapor to condense on the cooling coils and to drip from them down onto a catch tray {{at the bottom of}} the unit from which it must then be routed outside, usually through a drain hole. As this moisture has no dissolved minerals in it, it will not cause mineral buildup on the coils. This will happen even if the ambient humidity level is low. If ice begins to form on the evaporative fins, it will reduce circulation efficiency and cause the development of more ice, etc. A clean and strong circulatory fan can help prevent this, as will raising the target cool temperature of the unit's thermostat to a point that the compressor is allowed to turn off occasionally. A failing thermistor may also cause this problem. Refrigerators without a <b>defrost</b> <b>cycle</b> may have this same issue. Dust can also cause the fins to begin blocking air flow with the same undesirable result: ice.|$|R
5000|$|Frost-free {{refrigerators}} or freezers use {{electric fans}} {{to cool the}} appropriate compartment. This could be called a [...] "fan forced" [...] refrigerator, whereas manual defrost units rely on colder air lying at the bottom, versus the warm air at the top to achieve adequate cooling. The air is drawn in through an inlet duct and passed through the evaporator where it is cooled, the air is then circulated throughout the cabinet via a series of ducts and vents. Because the air passing the evaporator is supposedly warm and moist, frost begins to form on the evaporator (especially on a freezer's evaporator). In cheaper and/or older models, a <b>defrost</b> <b>cycle</b> is controlled via a mechanical timer. This timer is set to shut off the compressor and fan and energize a heating element located near or around the evaporator for about 15 to 30 minutes at every 6 to 12 hours. This melts any frost or ice build up and allows the refrigerator to work normally once more. It is believed that frost free units have a lower tolerance for frost, due to their air-conditioner like evaporator coils. Therefore, if a door is left open accidentally (especially the freezer), the defrost system may not remove all frost, in this case, the freezer (or refrigerator) must be defrosted.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen {{the surface}} {{temperature}} of the outdoor coil in an {{air source heat pump}} (ASHP) unit is below both the air dew point and freezing point of water, frost can be formed and accumulated over the surface of the outdoor coil, which is usually of multi-circuit structure in order to minimize its refrigerant pressure loss and enhance the heat transfer between refrigerant and ambient air. However, frosting adversely affects the operational performance and hence the energy efficiency of the ASHP unit, therefore periodic defrosting is necessary. Currently, the most widely standard defrosting method used for ASHP units is reverse <b>cycle</b> <b>defrosting.</b> A previous related study has suggested that during reverse <b>cycle</b> <b>defrosting,</b> downwards flowing of melted frost due to gravity over a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil in an ASHP unit could deteriorate defrosting performance, by using more energy for defrosting and prolonging a defrosting process. If however an outdoor coil can be horizontally installed, the flow path for melted frost over coil surface can be shortened, and a better defrosting performance expected. In this paper, therefore, an experimental study on performance during reverse <b>cycle</b> <b>defrosting</b> of an ASHP unit having a horizontal three-circuit outdoor coil has been carried out. Firstly, {{a detailed description of the}} ASHP unit is presented. This is followed by reporting the experimental results. Finally, a comparative and quantitative analysis is given...|$|R
