5|$|With Brescia, Baggio scored 46 {{goals in}} 101 {{appearances}} in all competitions, scoring 45 goals in 95 Serie A appearances, and one goal in two European matches. Baggio also made four Coppa Italia appearances with Brescia. Baggio retired as Brescia's all-time leading goalscorer in Serie A. He ended {{his career with}} 205 goals in Serie A, making him the seventh-highest scorer of all time, behind Silvio Piola, Francesco Totti (who overtook him in 2011), Gunnar Nordahl, Giuseppe Meazza, Jos√© Altafini and Antonio Di Natale (who overtook him in 2015). Baggio's number 10 shirt was retired by Brescia in his honour, and he is considered the club's greatest ever player. Before Baggio had joined Brescia, they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> avoid relegation after being newly promoted to Serie A, in over 40 years. During the four years under Baggio, Brescia recorded their best ever Serie A run and were never relegated.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005, Salzgeber's then-current Grand Prix mount, Wall Street, was euthanized {{following}} {{an episode of}} colic. This, combined with the recent retirement of Rusty, left her with no Grand Prix-level horses. Wall Street, while a relatively successful dressage horse, had suffered health problems and <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> compete with Rusty as Salzgeber's top horse. In 2008, Salzgeber again began competing at the Grand Prix level on Herzruf's Erbe, who would develop into one of her top international horses. In that year, the pair won the Otto Lorke Prize, given each year to the best German Grand Prix horse under 10 years old. During 2008, Salzgeber and Herzruf's Erbe had won 10 Grand Prix competitions. In 2009, the pair were expected to compete at the European Dressage Championships, but were not chosen for the German team after Herzruf's Erbe sustained an injury at a competition in July. The immediate diagnosis was a severely pulled tendon, although a later diagnosis was that the horse had strained a suspensory muscle, expected to heal in about three months. By early 2010, the horse was again able to be ridden, but was still not in top condition.|$|E

25|$|The on-field umpires were Simon Taufel of Australia and Aleem Dar of Pakistan, with Ian Gould {{being the}} third (TV) umpire. All of these umpires are highly rated; Taufel has won 5 ICC Umpire of the Year awards, while Dar has won two. Taufel <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{officiate}} in a World Cup final because Australia had been qualifying for the finals {{in the last}} four editions. Jeff Crowe was the match referee and Steve Davis the reserve umpire.|$|E
25|$|The joining {{of the two}} crowns {{deprived}} Portugal of {{a separate}} foreign policy, with King Phillip II's enemies becoming Portugal's enemies as well. War with the Dutch led to attacks on most of Portugal's far-flung trading network in and around Asia, including Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), and Goa, as well as attacks upon her commercial interests in Japan, Africa (especially Mina), and South America. Even though the Portuguese <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> capture the entire island of Ceylon, they {{had been able to}} keep the coastal regions under their control for a considerable time before the coming of the Dutch in war. Portugal's South American colony, Brazil, was partially conquered by both France and the United Provinces.|$|E

25|$|Many {{visitors}} {{came to him}} {{and some}} became his devotees. Kavyakantha Sri Ganapati Sastri, a Vedic scholar of repute in his age, with a deep knowledge of the Srutis, Sastras, Tantras, Yoga, and Agama systems, but lacking the personal darshan of Shiva, came to visit Ramana in 1907. After receiving upadesa from him on self-enquiry, he proclaimed him as Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. Ramana was known by this name from then on. Ganapati Sastri passed on these instructions to his own students, but later in life confessed that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> achieve permanent Self-abidance. Nevertheless, he was highly valued by Ramana Maharshi and {{played an important role}} in his life.|$|E
25|$|In August 1939, Wavell {{had ordered}} a plan covertly to {{encourage}} the rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of Gojjam, that the Italians <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> repress. In September, Colonel D. A. Sandford arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the policy of appeasement. Mission 101 was formed to co-ordinate {{the activities of the}} Ethiopian resistance. In June 1940, Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations. In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes be established before the rains ended, to the area north of Lake Tana and that Selassie should return in October, as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa to prevent them concentrating against the Arbegnoch. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissensions among local potentates were reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.|$|E
25|$|Injuries {{quickly became}} a challenge, as the team lost more players to {{injuries}} in their first preseason game than they did during the entire 22-game (preseason through playoffs) 1979 season. The secondary, particularly the safety position, was hit especially hard. Mark Cotney was lost for {{the season with a}} knee injury, Curtis Jordan suffered a broken collarbone, and Cedric Brown missed some time with a bruised shoulder. Cotney was expected to have lost his starting role to Colzie, but was valued as a backup. Jordan was lost to the team when, upon being activated from injured reserve later in the season, he was claimed off of procedural waivers by the Washington Redskins. An injury to Dave Reavis during the same game required arthroscopic surgery that left him sidelined into the regular season, and left the team with only two offensive tackles. As the team had opened training camp with a small roster, McKay had to trade draft picks to the Philadelphia Eagles and Los Angeles Rams to augment the roster with safeties Zac Henderson and Jeff Delaney, and tackle Rick Dozier. Ray Snell was also sidelined, for the second consecutive year, with severe headaches which were attributed to high blood pressure. Rick Berns, the 1979 third-round draft pick who was a capable runner but ineffective as a blocker and passer and who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> recover from McKay's , was released late in camp. An unexpected shakeup of the receiving corps took place when ex-Steeler Theo Bell and ex-49er James Owens, both among the NFL's leading returners, were brought in with an eye toward improving the special teams. This resulted in the displacement of former FSU star Mike Shumann and original Buccaneer Isaac Hagins, who were promptly released with the hope that they would still have time to catch on with another team. Owens, an Olympic sprinter, came to the team in a late trade, as did Dallas Cowboys starting cornerback Aaron Mitchell, a tough tackler brought in to fill Cotney's role in run support. Adjustments were made to the team's defensive philosophy, with the secondary moving to a more aggressive style of play intended to cut down on opponents' success in the short passing game. The secondary also benefited from an improved pass rush, with Hugh Green's presence preventing blockers from concentrating their efforts on Lee Roy Selmon. James Wilder emerged as a reliable receiver, leading the team in catches during the preseason. McKay reported being happy with the team's preseason performance, saying that they were playing with the intensity and enthusiasm that had been missing the previous year.|$|E

The story is told in a non-linear fashion, with many of the story's climaxes‚ÄîBilly's death in 1976, his kidnapping by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore nine years earlier, and the execution of Billy's friend Edgar Derby in the ashes of Dresden for stealing a teapot‚Äîdisclosed in the story's first pages.

500|$|Diefenbaker was embittered by {{his loss}} of the party leadership.

Trudeau called a general election for June 1968; Stanfield asked Diefenbaker to join him {{at a rally in}} Saskatoon, which Diefenbaker refused, although the two appeared at hastily arranged photo opportunities. Trudeau obtained the majority against Stanfield that Pearson <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> obtain against Diefenbaker, as the PC party lost 25 seats, 20 of them in the West. The former Prime Minister, though stating, [...] "The Conservative Party has suffered a calamitous disaster" [...] in a CBC interview, could not conceal his delight at Stanfield's humiliation, and especially gloated at the defeat of Camp, who made an unsuccessful attempt to enter the Commons. Diefenbaker was easily returned for Prince Albert.|$|E
500|$|The final {{segment is}} based on the Halloween cartoon It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It could not be titled [...] "It's the Great Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] to exactly match its namesake because of a [...] "big legal issue", {{according}} to Al Jean. However, the characters were redesigned to resemble the style of Peanuts, and they also obtained rights to use Vince Guaraldi's music. Jean said in 2011 that [...] "For years we <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> parody Charlie Brown's Halloween special, {{which is one of the}} all-time top three animated shows ever. The Vince Guaraldi music is such a huge part of it, so we got to clear it. It was just a dream come true to satirize it.

500|$|The second {{series of}} Inside No. 9 {{was written in}} 2014 by the programme's creators Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. The idea for [...] "S√©ance Time" [...] began with the [...] "trigger" [...] of a s√©ance, and the plot grew out of this, while the episode's title was taken from a line {{performed}} by David Warner in the film From Beyond the Grave. Shearsmith had previously taken part in a s√©ance with The League of Gentlemen in a putatively-haunted house. He had heard tapping and seen movement on a ouija board, and believed he had experienced something supernatural until Mark Gatiss confessed that he was responsible. Shearsmith {{said that he and}} Pemberton had always wanted to do a s√©ance-inspired story, but <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> find a new angle from which to approach the theme. [...] "S√©ance Time", he thought, [...] "felt a bit different" [...] to how s√©ances had previously been portrayed.

500|$|The {{multiplicity}} of early names complicated later research, {{with the situation}} compounded by the terse descriptions provided by Marsh and Cope. Even at the time, authors such as Samuel Wendell Williston suggested that too many names had been coined. For example, Williston pointed out in 1901 that Marsh <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> adequately distinguish Allosaurus from Creosaurus. The most influential early attempt {{to sort out the}} convoluted situation was produced by Charles W. Gilmore in 1920. He {{came to the conclusion that}} the tail vertebra named Antrodemus by Leidy was indistinguishable from those of Allosaurus, and Antrodemus thus should be the preferred name because as the older name it had priority. Antrodemus became the accepted name for this familiar genus for over fifty years, until James Madsen published on the Cleveland-Lloyd specimens and concluded that Allosaurus should be used because Antrodemus was based on material with poor, if any, diagnostic features and locality information (for example, the geological formation that the single bone of Antrodemus came from is unknown). [...] "Antrodemus" [...] has been used informally for convenience when distinguishing between the skull Gilmore restored and the composite skull restored by Madsen.|$|E
500|$|... "Cherish" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and released {{as the third}} single from Like a Prayer (1989). The song is built around the themes of love and relationships, with William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet one of its major inspirations. Madonna was reading Romeo and Juliet during the breaks during rehearsals for Speed the Plow, a Broadway show {{in which she was}} starring in 1988. On the third day of the Like a Prayer recording sessions, she presented Leonard with the lyrics of [...] "Cherish", and explained that she had written the song [...] "one sunny afternoon by the beach", but later confessed that it was actually written in her make-up room. [...] "I wrote it in a superhyper-positive state of mind that I knew was not going to last", the singer recalled. Leonard introduced one line from the similar titled song by the 1960s band The Association, [...] "Cherish is the word I use", after which Madonna decided to include it on Like a Prayer. The B-side of the single release of [...] "Cherish" [...] was a previously unreleased track called [...] "Supernatural", initially composed during the recording sessions of her third studio album, True Blue and later completed in 1989. In 2009, during an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna confessed that she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> predict if her songs would be successful, irrespective of her personal opinion of them. As an example, she cited [...] "Cherish" [...] {{as one of the most}} [...] "retarded" [...] songs she had written, but noted it became a commercial success. The song was also included on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection and the two-disc edition of her 2009 compilation Celebration.|$|E
