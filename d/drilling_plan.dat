40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to follow up {{blasting}} at the development work of drifts by measuring the distance from a fixed point to the faces before and after scaling and then analyzes the data. LKAB Malmberget needs to follow up the blasting to improve and make the development of drifts more effective. The goals of the project have been to investigate if {{the length of the}} drill rods, <b>drilling</b> <b>plan</b> or the placement of faces affects the need for scaling. The work has involved a literature review of tunneling and its processes, a five-week field study at the development of drifts in LKAB Malmberget where the collection of data was done, analysis, comparing and finally documenting in report form. Development {{is the first step in}} the extraction of ore. Development involves the building of new fields and transport routes in the mine where the ore can be mined and transported. There are two types of drifts in the ore bodies, main gallery and cross cut. It is in the cross cuts the large-scale sub-level caving takes place, which LKAB is known for. At the development work, LKAB Malmberget is using the conventional cycle of blasting which includes drilling, charging, blasting, ventilation, excavation, scaling and reinforcement. At the drilling of the drifts there are three drilling rigs with two different lengths of the drill rods, 16 and 18 feet. In the western field, a rig with 18 foot rod is used and the eastern field has two rigs with both 16 and 18 foot. There are also two different types of drilling plans with different numbers of holes. The <b>drilling</b> <b>plan</b> with 76 holes is used on the western field and the <b>drilling</b> <b>plan</b> on the eastern field has fewer holes. The results of the project show that the need for scaling is greatest when using the 18 foot drill rods, which can be caused by abnormalities of the drill holes or a failed blasting where the rock was not thrown out in the drift. Since the drill holes are longer when using 18 foot drill rods there are also possible that air pockets are formed during the charging in the explosives which can result in an uneven and weak detonation. Further the results show that the need of scaling increases when the face is placed in ore which may be caused by the density. The ore has a higher density than waste rock which makes it harder to blast in ore. The difference in distance before and after scaling is more even for faces placed in ore, which may its base in the formation of a slice of ore closest to the face which is released more even then waste rock does under the scaling process. The <b>drilling</b> <b>plan</b> has no significant effect on the needed scaling because there is only a few holes difference in the drilling plans on the eastern and western field which otherwise is equal. If the dimensions of the profile may vary, there can be an effect on the need for scaling. Validerat; 20110928 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|On June 24, 1991, a {{third-party}} investigation team consisting of Richard P. Thomas, Duey E. Milner, James L. Moore, and Dick Whiting began {{an investigation into}} the blowout of well KS- 8, which occurred at the Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) site on June 12, 1991, and caused the unabated release of steam for a period of 31 hours before PGV succeeded in closing in the well. The scope of the investigation was to: (a) determine the cause(s) of the incident; (b) evaluate the adequacy of PGVs drilling and blowout prevention equipment and procedures; and (c) make recommendations for any appropriate changes in equipment and/or procedures. This report finds that the blowout occurred because of inadequacies in PGVs <b>drilling</b> <b>plan</b> and procedures and not as a result of unusual or unmanageable subsurface geologic or hydrologic conditions. While the geothermal resource in the area being drilled is relatively hot, the temperatures are not excessive for modem technology and methods to control. Fluid pressures encountered are also manageable if proper procedures are followed and the appropriate equipment is utilized. A previous blowout of short duration occurred on February 21, 1991, at the KS- 7 injection well being drilled by PGV at a depth of approximately 1600 '. This unexpected incident alerted PGV to the possibility of encountering a high temperature, fractured zone at a relatively shallow depth. The experience at KS- 7 prompted PGV to refine its hydrological model; however, the <b>drilling</b> <b>plan</b> utilized for KS- 8 was not changed. Not only did PGV fail to modify its drilling program following the KS- 7 blowout, but they also failed to heed numerous ''red flags'' (warning signals) in the five days preceding the KS- 8 blowout, which included a continuous 1 -inch flow of drilling mud out of the wellbore, gains in mud volume while pulling stands, and gas entries while circulating muds bottoms up, in addition to lost circulation that had occurred earlier below the shoe of the 13 - 3 / 8 -hch casing...|$|E

40|$|Rock {{blasting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} dominating operations in open pit mining efficiency. As many downstream processes depend on the blast-induced fragmentation, an optimized blasting strategy can influence the total revenue of a mine to a large extent. Boliden Aitik mine in northern Sweden {{is one of the}} largest copper mines in Europe. The annual production of the mine is expected to reach 36 million tonnes of ore in 2014; so continuous efforts are being made to boost the production. Highly automated equipment and new processing plant, in addition to new crushers, have sufficient capacity to reach the production goals; the current obstacle in the process of production increase is a bottleneck in crushers caused by oversize boulders. Boulders require extra efforts for secondary blasting or hammer breakage and if entered the crushers, they cause downtimes. Therefore a more evenly distributed fragmentation with less oversize material can be advantageous. Furthermore, a better fragmentation can cause a reduction in energy costs by demanding less amounts of crushing energy. In order to achieve a more favorable fragmentation, two alternative blast designs in addition to a reference design were tested and the results were evaluated and compared to the current design in Aitik. A comparatively large bench was divided to three sections with three different <b>drill</b> <b>plans,</b> which led to different specific charges in each section. The sections were drilled in patterns of 6 x 9 m, 7 x 9 m and 7 x 10 m of burden and spacing; planned specific charges of the sections were 1. 17 kg/m 3, 1. 02 kg/m 3, and 0. 91 kg/m 3 respectively. Similar to the current <b>drill</b> <b>plan</b> in Aitik, the section with 7 x 9 m (1. 02 kg/m 3 specific charge) was used as the reference for results comparison. The drilling and charging processes were monitored carefully and the post-blast parameters were measured accordingly. Laser scanning was used to measure the swelling of the sections and two different methods of image analysis were utilized to evaluate the fragmentation of the rock for each section. Drilling log data (MWD) were analyzed to evaluate the hardness of the rock; energy consumption log of the crusher was also analyzed and all the data was collected in a single database. VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) programming language was embedded within data spreadsheets to correlate the mentioned data to the coordinates of the rock by means of Minestar logs, which include both timestamps and coordinates of all machinery e. g. shovels and trucks. The results of the test show significant improvements in fragmentation and oversize material percentage in the section with 6 x 9 m <b>drill</b> <b>plan</b> (1. 17 kg/m 3). The advantage of 6 x 9 m plan was confirmed by 52 % higher swelling, 66 % lower oversize material and 26 % lower crushing energy compared to the reference section. The section with 7 x 10 m <b>drill</b> <b>plan</b> (0. 91 kg/m 3) also showed theoretically acceptable results; however, the deviations from reference were not as large as formerly mentioned section. The swelling had a decrease of 8 % compared to the reference section and the percentage of oversize material and crushing energy were increased by 16 % and 2 % respectively. Presented results are based only on technical aspects and do not include the costs of drilling and charging. Thus, in order to evaluate the <b>drill</b> <b>plans</b> in practice an economical evaluation of the sections should be conducted. Also a confirmation test with more accurate geology explorations is recommended. Finally, upon the request of Boliden Mines, a short report on the usage of Air-decking technique in Aitik is enclosed as an appendix. The report includes a brief introduction to air-decking and discusses practical solutions to apply this technique in Aitik. Validerat; 20121001 (anonymous...|$|R

40|$|In November of 2008, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the North Slope Borough (NSB) {{committed}} {{funding to}} develop a <b>drilling</b> <b>plan</b> to test the presence of hydrates in the producing formation {{of at least one}} of the Barrow Gas Fields, and {{to develop a}} production surveillance plan to monitor the behavior of hydrates as dissociation occurs. This drilling and surveillance plan was supported by earlier studies in Phase 1 of the project, including hydrate stability zone modeling, material balance modeling, and full-field history-matched reservoir simulation, all of which support the presence of methane hydrate in association with the Barrow Gas Fields. This Phase 2 of the project, conducted over the past twelve months focused on selecting an optimal location for a hydrate test well; design of a logistics, drilling, completion and testing plan; and estimating costs for the activities. As originally proposed, the project was anticipated to benefit from industry activity in northwest Alaska, with opportunities to share equipment, personnel, services and mobilization and demobilization costs with one of the then-active exploration operators. The activity level dropped off, and this benefit evaporated, although plans for drilling of development wells in the BGF's matured, offering significant synergies and cost savings over a remote stand-alone drilling project. An optimal well location was chosen at the East Barrow No. 18 well pad, and a vertical pilot/monitoring well and horizontal production test/surveillance well were engineered for drilling from this location. Both wells were designed with Distributed Temperature Survey (DTS) apparatus for monitoring of the hydrate-free gas interface. Once project scope was developed, a procurement process was implemented to engage the necessary service and equipment providers, and finalize project cost estimates.
