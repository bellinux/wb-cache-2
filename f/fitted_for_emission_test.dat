The aim is to successfully follow industry standard <b>test</b> cycles used <b>for</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>testing</b> and produce repeatable results. Success will be measured by not exceeding the limits set for human drivers for a successful test.

A full SIMULINK model has been created and used for simultaion and rapid control prototyping using dSPACE. The system has been developed and tested from simulation through to actual dynamometer testing. Test results show that by time-shifting the drive cycle 2 seconds forward, the robotic driver successfully adhered to the ADR 37 / 01 standard, and produced repeatable results.

By allowing the smoke to pass through the LDR and Light Source, the desired resistance is acquired and processed by the microcontroller to obtain the Light Absorption Coefficient. This value is the basis for being a smoke belcher (If it exceeds 2. 5 k).
