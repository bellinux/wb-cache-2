40|$|Anaplastic {{lymphoma}} kinase (ALK) and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML 4) gene rearrangements {{occur in}} approximately 5 % of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC), {{leading to the}} overexpression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase and predicting {{a response to the}} targeted inhibitor, crizotinib. Malignant pleural effusion occurs in most patients with advanced lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma, and tissue samples are not always available from these patients. We attempted to clarify the feasibility of detecting the EML 4 -ALK fusion gene in pleural <b>effusion</b> <b>cells</b> using different methods. We obtained 66 samples of pleural effusion from NSCLC patients. The pleural effusion fluid was centrifuged, and the cellular components obtained were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. The EML 4 -ALK fusion gene status was determined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). EML 4 -ALK was detected in three of 66 patient samples (4. 5 %) with RT-PCR. When the RT-PCR data were used as the standard, one false positive and one false negative samples were identified with IHC; and one false negative sample was identified with FISH. These results suggest that a block of pleural <b>effusion</b> <b>cells</b> can be used to detect the EML 4 -ALK fusion gene. IHC had good sensitivity, but low specificity. FISH had low sensitivity, but high specificity. RT-PCR is a good candidate method for detecting EML 4 -ALK in blocks of pleural <b>effusion</b> <b>cells</b> from lung cancer patients...|$|R

40|$|A {{material}} outgassing test {{consists of}} an <b>effusion</b> <b>cell,</b> mass spectrometer, and thermally controlled quartz crystal microbalance (TQCM). The material sample {{is placed in the}} <b>effusion</b> <b>cell</b> at a predetermined temperature, and the sample is outgassed in a vacuum of 0. 000001 torr range. The total outgassing mass as a function of time is determined with the TQCM which is cooled to LN 2 temperatures. Based on the view factor of the TQCM, the total outgassed mass can be determined. The technique can be verified by comparing the results to the actual mass loss of the sample which is determined by hanging the diffusion cell from the Cohn microbalance. The mass spectrometer can be used to determine if there are any low molecular weight components outgassing, such a nitrogen which does not condense on the TQCM. After the material outgasses to a point of saturation, the <b>effusion</b> <b>cell</b> is closed off, and the TQCM is slowly heated to allow the condensed film to be broken down into its components. As the temperature is increased, the components evaporate from the surface at a different rate and can be detected with the mass spectrometer. The relative amount of each component is found by the change in frequency of the TQCM as the component evaporates. Hence, from this test, not only is isothermal kinetic data obtained, but the primary components can also be identified in terms of their molecular weight...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] In {{conventional}} cytological {{diagnosis of}} pleural effusions {{the assessment of}} morphological features plays an important part. However, false negative and false positive results may occur. In this study conventional cytology was compared with flow cytometric DNA analysis and the argyrophil staining technique for nucleolar organiser regions (AgNOR) to characterise benign and malignant effusions. METHODS [...] Pleural effusions from 71 patients (38 with benign lung disease, 33 with proven adenocarcinoma of lung) were studied by conventional cytology, flow cytometric DNA analysis, and the AgNOR technique. Tumour cell ploidy was determined by flow cytometry. In an attempt to detect the cell proliferative state, flow cytometric S phase fraction and the AgNOR technique were used. The correlations among conventional cytology, flow cytometric DNA ploidy, S phase fraction analysis, and nucleolar organiser regions were investigated. RESULTS [...] All the 38 benign pleural effusions were diploid. There were 17 (52 %) aneuploid and 16 (48 %) diploid malignant pleural effusions. Based on these results this type of DNA analysis had a sensitivity of 52 % and a specificity of 100 %. The mean (SD) numbers of flow cytometric S phase fractions of benign and malignant cases were 5. 32 (1. 67) % and 12. 45 (3. 93) % respectively. The mean numbers of S phase fractions of diploid malignant cases were higher than diploid benign cases. In each case the number of AgNORs was counted in 100 cells. The mean number of AgNOR dots per nucleus was 12. 57 (3. 64) for malignant pleural <b>effusion</b> <b>cells</b> and 3. 96 (1. 39) for benign pleural <b>effusion</b> <b>cells.</b> The mean number of AgNOR dots was 14. 45 (3. 36) for aneuploid malignant pleural <b>effusion</b> <b>cells</b> and 10. 57 (2. 82) for diploid malignant pleural <b>effusion</b> <b>cells.</b> The AgNOR numbers were higher in diploid malignant cells than in diploid benign cells. There was a significant correlation between the S phase fraction determined by flow cytometry and {{the mean number of}} AgNORs per nucleus in malignant cases. CONCLUSIONS [...] Both flow cytometry and the AgNOR methods provide comparable measurements in the diagnosis of pleural effusion. The study also indicates that the AgNOR method, which is rapid and easy to perform, may be a useful adjunct to flow cytometry, S phase fraction analysis and conventional cytology in the routine diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion...|$|R

40|$|A need {{exists to}} {{investigate}} {{changes in the}} transparency of a light-transmitting surface during simultaneous exposure to a contaminant and an atomic oxygen (AO) flux. This mechanism {{may be responsible for}} the degradation of the light-transmitting surfaces of both photovoltaic cells and photodiodes currently in use on many low-Earth-orbit spacecraft. To address this need, researchers from the Electro-Physics Branch of the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field built such a test system within their AO beam facility. This facility produces an effective AO flux of 1. 4 10 (exp 16) atoms/sq cm/sec and contains a three-axis positioning system that provides the motion capability necessary for test operations. During testing, a target surface is held directly within the AO beam and close to two contaminant <b>effusion</b> <b>cells.</b> The <b>effusion</b> <b>cells</b> are shielded from the AO beam, and the outgassing contaminant is constrained to move across the target surface when heat is applied to either of the reservoirs.

40|$|To date, {{cytogenetic}} {{studies on}} pancreatic carcinoma are rare, and {{little is known}} about the frequency of cytogenetic aberrations in primary carcinomas compared with metastatic tumour cells. We therefore evaluated the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in 12 primary pancreatic carcinomas and in effusion specimens from 25 patients with pancreatic cancer by using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a panel of four centromeric probes. Hyperdiploidy and chromosomal imbalances, predominantly affecting chromosome 8, were a constant finding in metastatic <b>effusion</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas concordant gain of chromosomes or relative loss of chromosome 18 characterized primary pancreatic carcinomas. The potential role of oncogenes located on chromosome 8 for pancreatic cancer progression was further investigated by double-hybridization studies of aneuploid <b>effusion</b> <b>cells</b> with a probe to 8 q 24 (MYC) and a centromeric probe to chromosome 8, which demonstrated amplification of the MYC oncogene in two of ten cases (20 %).

40|$|We present recent {{progress}} {{on the use of}} an integrated real-time sensing and control system for monitoring and controlling substrate temperature, layer composition, and <b>effusion</b> <b>cell</b> flux during MBE growth of HgCdTe epilayers for advanced IR detectors. Substrate temperature is measured and controlled in real-time using absorption-edge spectroscopy (ABES). This allows the substrate temperature to be maintained at + 1. 5 °C from the desired setpoint, even during actuation of <b>effusion</b> <b>cell</b> shutters which under conventional thermocouple-based control would produce a substantial (10 - 15 °C) temperature change. In situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) is used for monitoring HgCdTe layer composition in real-time. We describe the development of a comprehensive temperature- and composition-dependent SE dielectric function database which can be used for accurate and precise monitoring of Hg 1 -xCdxTe layer composition over a wide range of x-values, from 0. 2 to 0. 42. The composition changes inferred from the real-time SE measurements obtained during growth of a two-layer structure are in excellent agreement with actual composition vs. depth profiles obtained using post-growth SIMS analysis. Likewise, the accuracy and precision of SE measurements conducted over multiple growth runs are shown to be suitable for robust SE-based composition control. Changes in gas-phase concentration of Cd atoms produced by a CdTe <b>effusion</b> <b>cell</b> are detected using an atomic absorption method (optical- absorption flux monitoring – OFM). The OFM method allows changes in HgCdTe layer composition to be correlated directly with variations in Cd flux.

40|$|Purpose: Although {{existence}} of humoral immunity {{has been previously}} shown in malignant pleural effusions, {{only a limited number}} of immunogenic tumor-associated antigens (TAA) have been identified and associated with lung cancer. In this study, we intended to identify more TAAs in pleural effusion-derived tumor cells. Experimental Design: Using morphologically normal lung tissues as a control lysate in Western blotting analyses, 54 tumor samples were screened with autologous effusion antibodies. Biochemical purification and mass spectrometric identification of TAAs were done using established <b>effusion</b> tumor <b>cell</b> lines as antigen sources. We identified a p 48 antigen as of-enolase (ENO 1). Semiquantitative immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate expression status of ENO 1 in the tissue samples of 80 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and then correlated with clinical variables. Results: Using ENO 1 -specifc antiserum, up-regulation of ENO 1 expression in <b>effusion</b> tumor <b>cells</b> from 11 of 17 patients was clearly observed compared with human normal lung primary epithelial and non-cancer-associated <b>effusion</b> <b>cells.</b> Immunohistochemical studies consistently showed high level of ENO 1 expression in all the tumors we have examined thus far. Log-rank and Cox's analyses of ENO 1 expression status revealed that its expression level in primary tumors was a key factor contributing to overall- and progression-free survivals of patients (P < 0. 05). The same result was also obtained in the early stage of NSCLC patients, showing that tumors expressing relatively higher ENO 1 level were tightly correlated with poorer survival outcomes.

The {{study was designed to}} examine the effect of ex vitro chemo-sensitivity assay in xeno-free culture of autologous malignant <b>effusion</b> <b>cells</b> from patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Methods The 50 treatment-naive patients with lung adenocarcinoma complicated with malignant pleural or pericardial effusions were enrolled. Effusions of all cases had been controlled by closed drainage and 300 mL- 500 mL of which were retained under sterile condition from 25 cases (Chemo-sensitivity group). Primary malignant <b>effusion</b> <b>cells</b> were isolated from autologous effusions of the patients. Then, xeno-free culture (average 11 days) were intervened with 8 chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used in clinical practice and were determined by CCK- 8 assay. Optimum regimens were selected for chemotherapy {{based on the results of}} chemosensitivity test. As a contrast, chemotherapy regimens for the other 25 patients (Control group) were on the basis of physician’s clinical experience. Results After four cycles of chemotherapy, in Chemo-sensitivity group, 17 (68. 0 %) cases were determined for partial response (PR), 5 (20. 0 %) cases for stable disease (SD), and the objective response rate (ORR) was 68. 0 %, the disease control rate (DCR) was 88. 0 %. Meanwhile, in Control group, 9 (36. 0 %) cases were determined for PR, 7 (28. 0 %) cases for SD, and, the ORR was 36. 0 %, the DCR was 64. 0 %. There were significant differences between the two groups in ORR and DCR (P< 0. 05). To the end of follow-up, there were 21 cases of death in Chemo-sensitivity group as well as 22 cases in Control group. The mean progression-free survival (PFS) in Chemo-sensitivity group and Control group respectively were 10. 0 months and 5. 8 months, and the mean overall survival (OS) in the two groups were 30. 2 months and 21. 2 months respectively. There were also significant differences between the two groups in PFS and OS (P< 0. 05). Furthermore, the adverse reactions in both groups were mild and controllable. Conclusion Xeno-free culture of autologous malignant <b>effusion</b> <b>cells</b> from patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and ex vitro chemo-sensitivity assay are beneficial to the rational choices of chemotherapeutic agents used in patients with lung adenocarcinoma complicated with malignant effusions, which is a worthy trial in personalized cell culture for individualized cancer therapy and further studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{pleural space}} is a {{potential}} compartment between the lung and chest wall that becomes filled with fluid and inflammatory cells {{in a number of}} respiratory diseases. In an attempt to understand one aspect of the inflammatory process in the pleural space, we compared the responses in three different diseases (congestive heart failure [CHF], tuberculosis [TB], and cancer). Large concentrations of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) were detected in cancer and TB effusions, but not in CHF. Surprisingly, the concentration of IL- 8 correlated best with lymphocyte recruitment and not with neutrophil recruitment. Pleural fluid from cancer and TB patients was chemotactic for lymphocytes, and this activity was partly blocked by an anti-IL- 8 antibody in cancer and completely blocked in TB. To determine whether there was the potential for a chemotactic gradient into the pleural space, pleural <b>effusion</b> <b>cells</b> were analyzed for the expression of IL- 8. <b>Cells</b> in the <b>effusions</b> of cancer patients expressed IL- 8, whereas IL- 8 could not be detected from the cells of TB and CHF effusions.

Stimulated pleural macrophages were able to induce expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) for IL- 8 and IL- 8 protein production, and this activity was abrogated by blocking tumor necrosis factor-�.
