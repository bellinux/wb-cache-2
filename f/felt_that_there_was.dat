5|$|Fox Mulder's {{abduction}} was {{devised by}} Chris Carter {{towards the end}} of seventh season as a way of allowing the actor to leave the series. Duchovny fulfilled his contractual obligations after the seventh season and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not much else to do with the character following the previous seven years.|$|E
5|$|While the {{procession}} was an actual historic event, Matejko took many artistic liberties, such as including persons {{who were not}} in fact present or had died earlier. He did so because he intended the painting to be a synthesis of {{the final years of}} the Commonwealth. He also <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no real historic moment or location that fully captured the spirit of the Constitution, and so he, the artist, needed to create such a moment.|$|E
5|$|Glass Joe's French {{characteristics}} {{have been}} discussed by critics such as writer Sumantra Lahiri and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. IGN's Craig Harris felt that the NES game focused more on his weaknesses and that the Wii game emphasized his stereotypes. A member of the Retronauts podcast also {{felt that he was}} defined more by his weakness than his nationality until he learned more about French stereotypes. Chris Buffa felt that the stereotypes could be considered offensive while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing legitimately offensive.|$|E
60|$|I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{some things}} which some minds cannot understand; so, instead of answering, changed the subject.|$|R
25|$|Others <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> more {{pressing}} concerns, and {{wondered about the}} necessity for a library when literacy levels were so low.|$|R
50|$|Wolbe <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{four basic}} areas {{aside from the}} regular Gemara {{curriculum}} of the yeshiva that the yeshiva student should master.|$|R
5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. The management of London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and it was <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction. Most of the infrastructure was subsequently demolished, though three station cottages survive.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1988, he {{was put on the}} {{transfer}} list and came close to joining American club Portland Timbers, before injury put negotiations on hold. A £1million price tag also deterred a great deal of potential interest. In view of Whiteside's medical reports, Ferguson rejected bids of £500,000 from Osasuna of Spain and from Ron Atkinson's new club Sheffield Wednesday, before accepting a bid of £600,000 (with £150,000 to follow if Whiteside reached 50 games) from Everton in July 1989. This was to the dismay of some of the club's supporters, who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> still hope that he had a future at Old Trafford. Ferguson intended to build his own team having signed midfield duo Neil Webb and Mike Phelan, and also in the hunt for other players including Paul Ince, Gary Pallister and Danny Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Kevork Juskalian {{was among}} the {{earliest}} graduates of the Euphrates College in Kharpert, completing his studies around 1881. He served as a minor official of the local Turkish government in Mezire, a village near Kharpert. He was then invited {{to work in the}} Persian consulate in Mezire until he was recalled by the Turkish government to serve as supervisor of eleven villages in the region of Kharpert. Kevork Juskalian <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no secure future for him in Ottoman Turkey and subsequently fled to the United States with his family, arriving at Ellis Island on November 15, 1887. Consequently, the Juskalian family became some of the first Armenians to come to the United States. Kevork found a job at the Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works in Worcester, Massachusetts. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Armenian Church of Our Savior on January 18, 1891.|$|E
50|$|Daisy: Bret <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{too many}} secrets {{involving}} Daisy and her past with ex-boyfriend Charles, and he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{she may have}} needed him more than she wanted him.|$|R
50|$|Kyushindo was {{the central}} {{statement}} for Abbe's personal approach to martial arts. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> three fundamental principles within Kyushindo which should {{be reflected in the}} Martial arts and in his outside life.|$|R
50|$|He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{something}} {{deep in the}} Coptic {{music and}} he was fascinated by many Coptic hymns, beside his studies and appreciation to the classical music in 1991 he was thinking very strongly in both classical and Coptic music.|$|R
5|$|The Army's {{training}} program attracted criticism, {{both at the}} time and subsequently. In 1937, Brigadier General George C. Marshall felt that in merging instruction on command and staff duties, the Command and General Staff School had neglected the former in favor of the latter, with officers being prepared for staff duties in peacetime rather than the chaos of command in wartime. Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair conducted a survey of graduates in 1939 that found that most <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> too much emphasis on obsolete skills like equitation. For this reason, the staff rides were disliked. While most considered the map exercises the most valuable part of the curriculum, some noted that students spent time discovering for themselves things that they could have been told.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats worked well, with a random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no need to create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper {{on the back of the}} necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E
60|$|Her {{particular}} part of {{the country}} was a few hundred versts the other side of Tamboff, with some fifteen miles of agrarian disturbance between her and the nearest neighbour. Reginald <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some privacy which should be sacred from intrusion.|$|R
60|$|Then I gave up all hope. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> {{no time to}} gain my {{feet and}} escape; indeed I {{did not wish to}} do so, who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some {{failures}} which can only be absolved by death. I just knelt there, waiting for the end.|$|R
50|$|Some reviewers, while praising Caucasia {{as a good}} debut novel, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> some weaknesses. Clover Hughes {{review in}} The Observer noted, “Senna is not above {{bullying}} this sort of metaphor into work for her, and too often hangs bells and lights on anything resonant.|$|R
25|$|Overall, {{it was not}} <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a demand}} for such a machine, and horsedrawn {{artillery}} was considered adequate.|$|E
25|$|If Ehrenfest <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{little more}} he could teach his students, {{he would send}} them to other centers in Europe for more training. He would also {{encourage}} them to accept positions abroad.|$|E
25|$|Result: Guinness <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a 'Wow' factor {{standing}} outside the pub in Co. Cork, but although their idea needed work Guinness will sell up the 'legend' concept, so Spirit were declared the winners.|$|E
50|$|Prof Geremek {{was a great}} {{believer in}} the idea of Europe, though he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a need to create a clear European {{identity}} and the need for people to believe in the benefits that Europe can bring to them- not just as nations, but also as individuals.|$|R
50|$|During <b>that</b> period, he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{limitations}} in Urdu poetry. He absorbed {{the essence of}} Mir and Ghalib to express what he intended. He {{was fascinated by the}} lyrical mood of Meera and Kabir and widened his knowledge of poetry by studying T. S. Eliot, Gogol and Anton Chekhov.|$|R
30|$|Only a {{very small}} {{percentage}} of all students <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> discrepancies between the radiology teaching delivered by radiologists versus other clinicians (this is 7  % of 3 rd year students and none of the 5 th year students), with the differences noted in focus rather than content of taught sessions.|$|R
25|$|In the 1980s McGinty <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a {{conflict}} between wearing his Medal of Honor (which bears {{the image of the}} Roman goddess Minerva) and his new-found Christian faith. Some news agencies reported that McGinty wanted to return his Medal of Honor.|$|E
25|$|He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a Judeo-Masonic {{conspiracy}} {{against the}} programme of Christ, and among other statements asserted that Jews {{had a hand}} in the propagation of communism. As a result, Fahey was strongly opposed to the Irish Republican Army, which he claimed was a communist organisation.|$|E
25|$|The Theravāda Abhidhamma, {{like the}} rest of the Tipiṭaka, was orally {{transmitted}} until the 1st century BCE. Due to famines and constant wars, the monks responsible for recording the oral tradition <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a risk of portions of the canon being lost so the Abhidhamma was written down for the first time along with the rest of the Canon.|$|E
50|$|In May 1940, the {{committee}} discussed their plans with Major General Henry H. Arnold and Rear Admiral John Henry Towers. These American military leaders <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{plenty of good}} candidates for pilots available. Arnold even offered to provide the Committee {{with a list of}} failed candidates from American training efforts.|$|R
50|$|Wargroove {{is being}} {{developed}} by Chucklefish. The developers were inspired by handheld games with accessible tactical gameplay, such as Advance Wars (2001). Chucklefish <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no titles available on {{the current generation of}} gaming devices that represented this genre of game. High resolution pixel art was created for the game's graphics.|$|R
50|$|Zhen also {{touched on}} {{literary}} criticism with his Writings of the Orthodox School, which addressed literature from a Daoist perspective. Unlike other literary critiques of the time, which classified writings in {{to as many}} as 100 categories, Zhen <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only four major categories of literature: instruction, discussion, narration and poetry.|$|R
25|$|Within {{weeks of}} this announcement, Vauxhall {{said they would}} {{continue}} exporting Chevettes to Germany. At the time Opel had already started selling the Kadett D / Astra Mk1, but as it was <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> still a market for the previous rear-wheel drive model, the Chevette was sold through Opel dealers with a 1,256cc 53bhp N and a 57bhp S automatic. The only Vauxhall badging was on the hub caps and steering wheel.|$|E
25|$|Stalin <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a growing}} split in German circles about whether Germany should {{initiate}} {{a war with}} the Soviet Union. Stalin {{did not know that}} Hitler had been secretly discussing an invasion of the Soviet Union since the summer of 1940, and that Hitler had ordered his military in late 1940 to prepare for war in the east regardless of the parties' talks of a potential Soviet entry as a fourth Axis Power.|$|E
25|$|A second {{commercial}} licence {{was made}} available for single-licence areas such as Mildura, Griffith, and Darwin. Incumbent stations were permitted {{to apply for the}} new licence under Section 73 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, however only if the Australian Broadcasting Authority, at the time, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no other operator who would be interested or able to operate a new station in the area. The ABA initially denied all three stations the ability to operate the new licences.|$|E
60|$|This was {{too much}} for the doctor. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> tears in his eyes, so he walked away to the window to dry them, unseen. Had he had fifty names, each more sacred than the other, the most sacred of them all would hardly have been good enough for her.|$|R
5000|$|Keating: JTR - <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> have <b>been</b> weeks where JTR {{have really}} {{struggled}} ...|$|R
50|$|On the DVD commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone {{reveal that}} they find this episode {{unbearable}} to watch, mainly because they <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> too many ideas packed into one episode. They wished that they split the stories into two episodes and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the episode served as a reminder to keep future episodes simple.|$|R
