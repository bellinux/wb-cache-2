40|$|Differences in {{monitoring}} cost is a commonly observed {{feature of the}} credit markets of LDCs. Typically the <b>informal</b> <b>lender</b> (IL) has a lower ex-post monitoring cost compared to the formal lender (FL). This paper develops a model of credit market with costly state verification in which financial dualism is {{defined in terms of}} this difference {{in monitoring}} cost. It analyses the welfare impli-cations of formal and informal credit in terms of their effect on interest rates, expected output and total surplus under different contract forms. We conclude that informal loans induce low effort, result in lower expected output and may also result in lower total surplus. This paper thus contends the argument that higher mon-itoring cost of the FL is necessarily inefficient. Interestingly, it also follows from the analysis that informal interest-rate is higher than the formal interest-rate in spite of the lower monitoring cost faced by the IL...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides an}} explanation for the co-existence of formal and informal lenders in rural credit markets of developing countries. Furthermore, it justifies the complementary activities of the two lending sectors. We assume that formal lenders find it too costly to observe the output levels of borrowers. As a result, financial contracts issued by this sector are rigid in that if a borrower does not repay a certain amount, he is excluded from future loans. On the other hand, the <b>informal</b> <b>lender</b> 2 ̆ 7 s informational advantage allows him to disburse loans regardless of the borrower 2 ̆ 7 s outcome. In certain cases, his high opportunity cost of lending would prevent him from participating as a primary lender. He can still participate as a residual lender, disbursing loans to borrowers who have been excluded by the formal sector. We then relate the possible outcomes to a set of village-level variables and find that the presence of moneylenders significantly increases the lending space. ^ The empirical section attempts to test two different implications of the theoretical work: one, on the presence of informal lenders and two, on the role of informal lenders. The theory predicts that in villages with high income variation formal lenders should not exist alone. It also predicts that if informal lenders serve a residual role, then repayments to formal lenders should not fluctuate with income. For this purpose, we use two different data sets: cross-section and longitudinal sets from India. The results support the hypothesis that villages with high income variation are associated with higher share of informal lenders. Also, repayments to banks indicate that informal lenders serve an important role as residual lenders. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{model the}} role of the {{informal}} credit sector in developing countries. The informational advantage of <b>informal</b> <b>lenders</b> is portrayed as the ability to monitor borrowers.

The informational advantage of <b>informal</b> <b>lenders</b> is portrayed as the ability to monitor borrowers. Monitoring reduces the incentive problem and allows for contracts with lower collateral. This enables <b>informal</b> <b>lenders</b> to serve two types of clients: 1) Those who cannot post the collateral required by the formal sector; and 2) Those who are able but do not want to post collateral. The model is thus consistent with the conventional view of the informal sector as recipient of spillover demand (quantity rationed) from the formal sector. It also demonstrates an additional role of the informal sector- namely as provider of insurance as the lower collateral requirement implies greater consumption smoothing across states of nature...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{literature}} on rural finance emphasizes {{the important role}} played by various <b>informal</b> <b>lenders.</b> In Thailand, however, their share of total loans has declined from about 90 percent to 30 - 50 percent between 1965 and 1991, according to official figures (Thisyamondol et al. 1965; Siamwalla et al. 1990; Onchan 1992). This decline is largely explained by {{the rapid expansion of}} the loan portfolio of the BAAC, the Thai Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (Quinones and Encarnacion 1988). Researchers expect a further decline in the market share of <b>informal</b> <b>lenders</b> in the course of economic development. Their future role is seen “as a complement to formal finance”, operating in “specific niches ” of comparative advantage (Asian Development Bank 1990). According to ADB only the remote, backward areas will probably remain a strong-hold of <b>informal</b> <b>lenders,</b> where they serve the credit needs of the poorer segments of society. Their proximity to their clients reduces transaction costs in the predominantly unsecured credit-business. This chapter reports on a survey of the financial landscape in a Thai village located only 70 kilometers east of Bangkok (see also Steinwand 1991). Research was conducted from January to June 1990.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1990 s the savings {{groups have been}} {{introduced}} in the villages of Laos. This movement has offered new borrowing opportunities for the rural people. Based on household survey using a structured questionnaire in four study villages (N= 684) in Vientiane Municipality during 2007 - 08 we analyzed the role and performance of the savings group in rural financial markets, especially focusing on who borrows, from which sources, and for what purposes by comparing the savings group with <b>informal</b> and formal <b>lenders.</b> Two major findings are as follows. First, three types of lenders (savings groups, formal and <b>informal</b> <b>lenders)</b> have their own particular features, and thereby loan purposes differ significantly. Formal banks offer loans exclusively for production purposes, while <b>informal</b> <b>lenders</b> do for coping with emergencies. Savings groups fall between them. Second, though poor households are reluctant to be a savings group member, once they participate in they actively obtain loans from it. In contrast, though rich households actively participate in the group, they obtain loans less from it. Group members claim that {{the primary purpose of}} joining the savings group is to cope with emergencies. When the members obtain loans from the savings group, however, nearly 40 % of the loans are used for production purposes, mainly in agriculture. There exists a change between saving purposes and borrowing ones. It is assumed that in villages with the higher loan credit for production purposes, the savings groups show favorable performance, and thus a rapid growth...|$|R
40|$|Microcredit schemes {{have become}} a popular means of {{improving}} smallholders' access to credit and making long term investment possible. However, {{it remains to be}} explored whether the current microcredit schemes are more successful than earlier formal small scale lending in identifying successful borrowers. We studied shrimp farming in a rural region in Bangladesh where formal microlending is well established, but where more expensive informal microlending coexists with the formal schemes. Farmers - both those who exclusively use formal loans and those who also use informal loans - remain credit-constrained; both types overutilize labour {{in order to reduce the}} need for working capital. However, the credit constraint is actually milder for the informal borrowers: the implicit shadow price of working capital is substantially higher in the group that only takes formal loans than in the group that also uses informal loans. These results suggest that <b>informal</b> <b>lenders</b> - with their closer ties to the individual farmers - remain more successful in identifying those smallholder farmers that are most likely to use the borrowed funds successfully. <b>Informal</b> <b>lenders</b> have an information advantage that formal microlenders lack: the latter need to find routes to access this information in order for formal microcredit schemes to succeed. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the demand for credit and credit {{rationing}} conducted by formal, informal and emerging microfinance lenders in the four poor counties of China. Design/methodology/approach - This paper extends the existing studies on credit rationing in rural China by comparing the determinants of credit rationing by three different lenders, the formal lenders rural credit cooperatives (RCCs), the <b>informal</b> <b>lenders</b> and the new microfinance institutions (MFIs). Findings - MFIs are capable of reaching out to the even poorer households if they develop the loan products based on the income and expenditure flows of these households. Research limitations/ implications - The determinants of credit rationing by three types of institutions are estimated separately. Practical implications - RCCs in China shall change their policy of discrimination against female-headed households. RCCs shall also simplify the loan application procedures and assess the clients based on their repayment capacities rather than the age or assets alone. RCCs could learn from MFIs to use incomes from migrant workers as a criterion to assess the loan applicants. Social implications - gender equity for loan access.

40|$|Credit {{plays an}} {{important}} role in agricultural development and it is believed that expansion of credit programmes will have beneficial effects on agricultural production and incomes of small farmers. It is also a key to poverty alleviation, livelihood diversification, and increasing the business skills of small farmers. In the Philippines, small-scale and subsistence agriculture source their loans mostly from <b>informal</b> <b>lenders,</b> thus access to formal credit remains low. There is a need to examine further small farmers’ access to credit and investigate their preferences and perceptions regarding credit in order that their access can be improved and their needs through credit can be more effectively met. Determining the problems and the credit needs of small farmers are important considerations in designing appropriate credit systems for them. Accessibility of rural credit in the Philippines was examined, with the primary objective of exploring the use of and access to rural credit by small farmers. This research attempts to explore and understand the perceptions of small farmers toward rural credit, and to collect information in proposing an appropriate credit system for them. Two types of respondents were interviewed for the research; 45 individual farmers, and four key informants in New Corella, Davao del Norte. The research focused on how the farmers perceived the rural credit facilities, their preferences, their reasons for borrowing, and their problems in accessing credit. Qualitative data analysis was done for the information gathered. Access to credit by farmers was limited to the available credit services in the research area, thus farmers’ choices and preferences were not well served which led to borrowing from <b>informal</b> <b>lenders.</b> Credit restrictions such as commodity specific credit programmes, credit that requires collateral, and lengthy and complicated procedures restricted the farmers from accessing formal credit. It is recommended that accessibility to credit by small farmers could be improved by providing innovative financing schemes that address problems of farmers who lack collateral, and minimise long processing of documents and other requirements. In this way, farmers may be encouraged to better utilise formal credit and decrease their reliance on <b>informal</b> <b>lenders,</b> thus avoiding higher interest rates and thereby increasing their farm productivity and household incomes...|$|R

This study demonstrates that product differentiation, in conjunction with adverse selection problems and asymmetric and incomplete information, generate cost asymmetries which allow these traits to persist, even within monopolistically competitive financial markets with "horizontal" subsidies.

While weak institutions constrain formal banks, shallow pockets hamper <b>informal</b> <b>lenders.</b> In such economies, informal finance has two effects. By increasing the investment return it decreases borrowers' relative payoff following default, inducing banks to lend more liberally (disciplinary effect). By channeling bank capital it reduces banks' agency costs from lending directly to borrowers, limiting banks' extension of borrower credit (rent-extraction effect). Among other things, the model shows that informal interest rates are higher, borrower welfare lower, and informal finance more prevalent when the rent-extraction effect prevails, consistent with stylized facts in poor societies...|$|R
