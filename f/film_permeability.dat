The permeability of water swollen segmented polyurethane membranes {{has been determined}} for the solutes urea, glucose, sucrose, and raffinose at 26. 5 [degrees]C. The permeability of segmented polyurethane membranes; based on poly(oxyethylene glycol) grades 600, 1000, 1500, and 1540; was determined for the swollen unstrained films and for the swollen films at several strains. The free volume theory for diffusion through homogeneously swollen polymers was able to predict the observed changes in membrane permeability with strain for all solutes except urea. The free volume theory fails to predict the urea data accurately because the polyurethanes used absorb urea and therefore the urea can diffuse through the polymer {{as well as through}} the solvent, an eventuality not provided for in the free volume theory.

40|$|An {{in-house}} set-up {{was developed}} for determining the permeability of paint films towards carbon dioxide. The system implemented the so-called Wicke-Kallenback method, described in EN 1062 - 6. This method consists of a two-chamber permeation cell divided by a supported paint film. A carbon dioxide/nitrogen mixture stream (15 % CO 2 / 85 % N- 2) is fed to the retentate chamber and a nitrogen carrier stream is fed to the permeate chamber.

The permeability of the films to fumigants varies widely with material type and manufacturing technique. In addition, many factors such as field conditions, temperature, fumigant type, film stretching and gluing during the field application, and moisture under the film can potentially affect the permeability of the films.

Although VIF reduces permeability and improves efficacy of fumigants (Gilreath and Chellemi 1998, Noling et al. 2001), it has not met with widespread grower acceptance {{for a number of}} reasons, primarily higher cost and poor handling characteristics.

40|$|Controlled release {{coatings}} for oral pharmaceutics {{are often}} made of cellulose derivatives. Such coatings {{can be used}} to promote a prolonged therapeutic concentration in the blood by a slow drug delivery in the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, two polymers with different solubilities can be used in the same coating to give the desirable release characteristics. If a water-soluble polymer is present in the film this polymer can leak out from the coating and form pores that mediate drug release. In this thesis, specific focus has been aimed at films made from the water-insoluble ethyl cellulose (EC) and the water-soluble hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). Although EC and HPC can be co-dissolved in ethanol they tend to phase-separate during the spray-coating process, which results in distinct domains enriched in one polymer and depleted in the other. Due to this, the HPC-rich phase can serve as a template for the pores. Since phase separation is affected by the physicochemical properties of the polymers, the microstructure is likely to be affected as well. This in turn could influence drug release. Therefore, structure control is important for controlled mass transport through the films. The major aim was to investigate how different molecular weight (Mw) grades of the two cellulose derivative affects the film microstructures and mass transport properties in order to better understand the structure-release relation. The EC/HPC films produced contained 30 % w/w HPC using different Mw grades of either EC or HPC while keeping the other polymer fixed. In general, combined studies on both sprayed films, cast films and pellet coatings showed that the final structure can be shifted from a percolating bicontinuous structure to disconnected HPC-rich domains by use of different Mw grades. Disconnected domains will prevent extensive leakage of HPC and formation of pores, resulting in overall low <b>film</b> <b>permeability.</b> However, by the use of more rapid drying conditions this morphology can be changed to a more bicontinuous structure, which both increases the total polymer release and <b>film</b> <b>permeability.</b> On the other hand, when very rapid drying conditions are used, leading to an early arrest in phase separation and very small domains, this can also prevent HPC release and decrease the mass transfer rate through films. Decreasing <b>film</b> <b>permeability</b> was found for both freestanding sprayed films and pellet coatings with increasing Mw of EC. On the other hand, when different Mw grades of HPC were used, sprayed free films showed an optimum in water permeability in the middle Mw range and very low permeability for films with low Mw HPC. Moreover, a slow release rate of HPC was achieved by using a high Mw grade of HPC, which also caused a slow increase in permeability. The drug release behaviour from coated pellets was, however, very different. This was believed to be due to different manufacturing conditions for spraying of free films and pellet coatings, as well as differences {{in the evolution of the}} phase-separated structure for systems of EC/HPC with different Mw grades. Overall, it was concluded that the Mw grade used in the films affects the phase-separated structure and in turn the geometries and percolation of pores, which will influences the overall mass transport properties of film. In addition, the effect of manufacturing conditions will much depend on the Mw grades used. Therefore, combining the effects of the Mw and the manufacturing conditions can be useful as a tool for controlling structure formation and mass transport in films...|$|E

40|$|Bitter vetch protein films {{containing}} {{positively charged}} spermidine, {{alone or with}} low amounts of glycerol, showed high tensile strength that progressively decreased by increasing the plasticizer concentration. Accordingly, lower film elongation at break and higher Young’s module values were detected {{in the presence of}} the polyamine without or with small amounts of glycerol. These data suggest that spermidine not only acts as a plasticizer itself by ionically interacting with proteins, but that it also facilitates glycerol-dependent reduction of the intermolecular forces along the protein chains, consequently improving the film flexibility and extensibility. Thus, spermidine may be considered not only as a primary, but also as a secondary plasticizer because of its ability to enhance glycerol plasticizing performance. Such double behavior of the polyamine was confirmed by the <b>film</b> <b>permeability</b> tests, since spermidine increased the barrier properties to gases and water vapor, while glycerol emphasized this effect at low concentrations but led to its marked reversal at high concentrations.

40|$|The {{influence}} of oxidation {{state on the}} permeability of several probe molecules through conducting polymer membranes comprising composites of poly(aniline) and poly(styrenesulfonate) was examined in aqueous solution. Pure poly(aniline) membranes displayed a characteristic increase in permeability between reduced and half-oxidized states for neutrally charged phenol and negatively charged 4 -hydroxybenzenesulfonate. In contrast, positively charged pyridine experienced decreased permeability through the membrane when poly(aniline) was switched from the reduced to the half-oxidized state. This behavior {{can be explained by}} a combination of oxidation-induced film swelling and the anion-exchange character of the positively charged membrane. The membrane composition was modified to include a fixed negative charge by the addition of poly(styrenesulfonate) during synthesis.

In addition, increasing the fraction of poly(styrenesulfonate) in the membrane served to decrease <b>film</b> <b>permeability</b> for all species because of a densification of the membrane.
