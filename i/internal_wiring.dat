5|$|In 1929, while {{studying}} mathematics at Poznań University, Rejewski attended a secret cryptology course {{conducted by the}} Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfrów), which he joined in September 1932. The Bureau had had no success in reading Enigma-enciphered messages and set Rejewski {{to work on the}} problem in late 1932; he deduced the machine's secret <b>internal</b> <b>wiring</b> after only a few weeks. Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma messages. His contributions included the cryptologic card catalog, derived using the cyclometer that he had invented, and the cryptologic bomb.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise was {{refurbished}} for its space shots, {{with its}} shiny exterior dulled down and extra detail {{added to the}} frame. Compared to the newly built Reliant, the Enterprise was hated by the effects artists and cameramen; it took eight people to mount the model, and a forklift truck to move it. The Reliant, meanwhile, was lighter and had less complex <b>internal</b> <b>wiring.</b> The ships were filmed on a blue screen with special film that does not register the color; the resulting shots could be added to effects shots or other footage. Any reflection of blue on the ship's hull would appear as a hole on the film; the gaps had to be patched frame by frame for the final film. The same camera used to film Star Wars, the Dykstraflex, was used for shots of the Enterprise and other ships.|$|E

25|$|Those to whom {{goods were}} {{delivered}} were often equally dissatisfied. Instructions were sometimes in Spanish or Chinese, {{making it difficult}} to use the product. Some products were shipped with plugs and <b>internal</b> <b>wiring</b> meant for the U.S. market, making them unusable in Britain (in a few cases, the company did provide a power converter, the FTC conceded). Even products usable in Britain turned out not to have been manufactured for sale there, or in the European Union (EU) generally, meaning they were not covered by manufacturers' warranties.|$|E
25|$|Even {{minor changes}} in the weather, {{physical}} layout or even bumping the chassis containing the tunable capacitors can cause the tuning to vary. For this reason a variety of systems were used to decrease {{the sensitivity of the}} radiogoniometer to mis-tuning. Primary among these was the aperiodic aerial concept, which described the mechanical layout of the radiogoniometer's <b>internal</b> <b>wiring.</b> By winding the sense coil wiring around a vertical cylinder, and wiring the field coils in a similar arrangement {{as close as possible to}} the sense coil, the entire circuit became capacitively coupled. A single tunable capacitor on the output from the sense coil could then be used to tune the entire system.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{receipt of}} Moniz's monograph, Freeman {{reviewed}} it anonymously for the Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry. Praising {{the text as}} one whose [...] "importance can scarcely be overestimated", he summarised Moniz's rationale for the procedure as {{based on the fact}} that while no physical abnormality of cerebral cell bodies was observable in the mentally ill, their cellular interconnections may harbour a [...] "fixation of certain patterns of relationship among various groups of cells" [...] and that this resulted in obsessions, delusions and mental morbidity. While recognising that Moniz's thesis was inadequate, for Freeman it had the advantage of circumventing the search for diseased brain tissue in the mentally ill by instead suggesting that the problem was a functional one of the brain's <b>internal</b> <b>wiring</b> where relief might be obtained by severing problematic mental circuits.|$|E

A major cause of PCCP failure is the <b>internal</b> <b>wire</b> break, which will emit {{acoustic}} signal. In this paper, a hydrophone-based PCCP real-time monitoring and failure-prediction system was proposed. By applying wavelet energy normalization analysis to signal feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to signal recognition, a high prediction accuracy of 98. 33 % was achieved. The result showed that the hydrophone-based PCCP failure prediction system is much more effective and economic in real application compared with electromagnetic method and acoustic fiber optical...|$|R
