5000|$|Once a DC {{operating}} point {{is defined by}} the DC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> an AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> can be drawn through the Q point. The AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is a straight line with a slope equal to the AC impedance facing the nonlinear device, which is in general different from the DC resistance. The ratio of AC voltage to current in the device is defined by this line. Because the impedance of the reactive components will vary with frequency, the slope of the AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> depends on the frequency of the applied signal. So there are many AC <b>load</b> <b>lines,</b> that vary from the DC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> (at low frequency) to a limiting AC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> all having a common intersection at the DC {{operating point}}. This limiting <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> generally referred to as the AC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> is the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> of the circuit at [...] "infinite frequency", and can be found by replacing capacitors with short circuits, and inductors with open circuits.|$|R

The {{position}} of the summer <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is calculated from the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> rules and depends on many factors such as length of ship, type of ship, type and number of superstructures, amount of sheer, and bow height.

50|$|In the 1860s, after {{increased}} loss {{of ships}} due to overloading, a British MP, Samuel Plimsoll, {{took up the}} <b>load</b> <b>line</b> cause. A Royal Commission on unseaworthy ships was established in 1872, and in 1876 the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act made the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> mark compulsory, although the positioning of the mark was not fixed by law until 1894. In 1906, laws were passed requiring foreign ships visiting British ports to be marked with a <b>load</b> <b>line.</b> It was not until 1930 (the 1930 <b>Load</b> <b>Line</b> Convention) that there was international agreement for universal application of <b>load</b> <b>line</b> regulations.|$|R

50|$|The {{net tonnage}} {{calculation}} {{is based on}} a number of factors, one of which is the moulded draft d. The choice of the value to use for d can be complicated. For ships subject to the International Convention on <b>Load</b> <b>Lines,</b> the Summer <b>Load</b> <b>Line</b> draft is used, with the exception of cases where that is a timber <b>load</b> <b>line.</b> For passenger ships, the draft used is the deepest subdivision <b>load</b> <b>line</b> assigned in accordance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Otherwise, if a ship has been assigned a <b>load</b> <b>line</b> by its national government, the draft for that summer <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is used. If the ship has no <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> instead, a maximum draft assigned by its national government, that value is used, if it has been assigned a maximum. Finally, for a ship to which none of the above applies, the value of d is taken as 75 per cent of the moulded depth amidships.|$|R

The intersections of the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> with the transistor characteristic curves represent the circuit-constrained values of IC and VCE at different base currents.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} a <b>load</b> <b>line</b> {{is to ensure that}} a ship has {{sufficient}} freeboard (the height from the water line to the main deck) and thus sufficient reserve buoyancy. The freeboard of commercial vessels is measured between the lowest point of the uppermost continuous deck at side and the waterline and this must not be less than the freeboard marked on the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> certificate issued to that ship. All commercial ships, other than in exceptional circumstances, have a <b>load</b> <b>line</b> symbol painted amidships {{on each side of the}} ship. This symbol is also permanently marked, so that if the paint wears off it remains visible. The <b>load</b> <b>line</b> makes it easy for anyone to determine if a ship has been overloaded. The exact location of the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is calculated and verified by a classification society and that society issues the relevant certificates. This marking was invented in 1876 by Samuel Plimsoll.|$|R

50|$|Semiconductor {{circuits}} {{typically have}} both DC and AC currents in them, with {{a source of}} DC current to bias the nonlinear semiconductor to the correct operating point, and the AC signal superimposed on the DC. <b>Load</b> <b>lines</b> can be used separately for both DC and AC analysis.
