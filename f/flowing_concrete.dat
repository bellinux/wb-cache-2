40|$|ABSTRACT: A <b>flowing</b> <b>concrete</b> and two self-compacting {{concretes}} were manufactured, at given {{portland cement}} content (400 kg/m 3) and water-cement ratio (0. 45), {{in order to}} obtain the same 28 -day cube strength. Two mineral additions were used in producing SCC (ground limestone or fly ash). The dosage of a polycarboxylate-based superplasticizer was adapted to produce SCCs with a slump-flow of about 750 mm and a <b>flowing</b> <b>concrete</b> with a slump of 200 mm. Concrete specimens were wet cured at room temperature (20 °C). The compressive strength of SCCs were higher than that of the <b>flowing</b> <b>concrete.</b> This {{can be explained by the}} pozzolanic activity of fly ash in addition to the cement content; however, ground limestone is not a pozzolanic material and then its acton can be related with a change in the microstructure of the cement matrix caused by the small particles of limestone. The change in the microstructure can also explain why the steel-bond strength is much higher in the two SCCs than in the <b>flowing</b> <b>concrete.</b> The drying shrinkage of the SCCs is substantially the same of that of ordinary <b>flowing</b> <b>concrete,</b> whereas creep is slightly higher in fly-ash SCC than in limestone-SCC or <b>flowing</b> <b>concrete...</b>|$|E

SCC is used to facilitate and ensure proper filling and good structural performance of restricted areas and heavily reinforced structural members. SCC is a <b>flowing</b> <b>concrete</b> with high workability. To achieve <b>flowing</b> <b>concrete</b> low volume of coarse aggregates is used, but the reduction in volume of coarse aggregates require high volume of paste, i. e. cement and fine aggregates, and use of super-plasticizers.

40|$|Concrete is {{a mixture}} of cement, sand, gravel and water which dries hard and strong and is used as a {{material}} for building. Concrete has to be heavily vibrated for flow into very intricate forms or forms that have a lot of reinforcing bars. Hence to overcome these defects the self-compacting concrete is used.

It is easy to find that concretes with 50 – 100  MPa have been prepared with only 362 – 440  kg/m 3 of cement or binder when 20  % coarse aggregate is scattered to substitute the original concrete mixtures through some simple calculation, this can be never achieved with the conventional concrete placing process. The scattering-filling coarse aggregate can prepare concrete with very high coarse aggregate, although the “pre-placed aggregate” concrete process (Neville 1981) can prepare concrete with as low cement dosage as this process, but it can only prepare low or middle strength concrete. The scattering-filling aggregate method can produce consolidated concrete with less cement but higher strength and performances at the same time, the decrease on cement dosage not only give the concrete good cost competitive but also good environmental harmonization. The optimal volume percentage of the scattering aggregate in the concrete depends on the void ratio of coarse aggregate in the original concrete and the flowability of the concrete, the looser the aggregated packs and the more flowable, the more the scattering aggregate can be added, around 5 – 12  % of aggregate can be scattered in the pavement concrete. The scattering-filling aggregate process can be potentially apply in nearly all kind of conventional plastic and <b>flowing</b> <b>concrete,</b> is especially suitable to be used in pumped concrete for its high mortar content.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This article {{describes}} the applications and benefits of a recently developed smart building material namely Engineered cementitious composite (ECC), also known as flexible or bendable concrete. Conventional concretes have a strain capacity of only 0. 1 percent and are highly brittle and rigid. This lack of bendability is {{a major cause of}} failure under strain and has been a pushing factor in the development of an elegant material which is capable to exhibit an enhanced flexibility. An ECC has a strain capacity of more than 3 percent and thus acts more like a ductile metal rather than like a brittle glass. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight a probable success of ECC in terms of industrial and commercial use in Pakistan. With the introduction of flexible concrete in building technology, it is likely to have safer and more durable construction. The material is expected to display reduced detrimental impacts on the natural environment. A bendable concrete is composed of all the ingredients of a traditional concrete minus coarse aggregates or crushed stones and is reinforced with micromechanically designed polymer fibers. The mechanism of action of the micro-polymeric fibers in concrete has also been emphasized. The principles of mix designs of the mortar incorporating fibers to make an ECC have also been explained. It has also been mentioned in detail as how this technology can be used to enhance the flexibility of some modern concrete types like <b>flowing</b> <b>concrete,</b> self compacting concrete, and lightweight concrete. ECC is a green construction material. The possible benefits like environment friendliness, cost effectiveness, and durability have been also been elucidated in the paper...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Experiments were carried out to study the effect of workmanship and environmental conditions on bond strength for concrete patch repairs. Four repair materials, sand/cement mortar, acrylic modified cementitious mortar, SBR modified cementitious mortar, and <b>flowing</b> <b>concrete,</b> were tested with mainly three test methods (core pull-off test, patch compressive test, and patch flexural test). At {{the beginning of this}} project, slant shear tests were also carried out. In the study of the effect of workmanship, the following parameters were included: surface roughness, surface cleanliness, surface soundness, moisture condition, application method, bond coat mistiming, repair material mistiming, and curing methods. In the study of the effect of environmental conditions, four parameters were considered: high temperature curing followed by drying shrinkage, high temperature curing followed by thermal cycling, low temperature curing, and low temperature curing followed by freeze/thaw cycling. A rougher surface produces a higher bond strength, but the increase depends on individual repair material. Sand/cement mortar favours a rough surface, but polymer modified mortars are not very sensitive to surface roughness. Environmental conditions affect the bond strength development, but the effect varies with each repair material. Test results suggest that low temperature curing should be avoided for polymer modified cementitious mortars. In addition to the experimental study, theoretical analyses were carried out to evaluate the available bond test methods. The evaluation was concentrated on answering the following questions: (1) What kind of factors will influence conductinga bond test? (2) What are the response of each factor involved to a specific test method? (3) What kind of influences are crucial in ensuring the full development of the bond strength? (4) Which factors are important to achieve a durable repair? and (5) What kind of a test can be used to monitor the quality of these crucial factors?

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 ccess {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 26, 2015 - June 26, 2016 Cast-in-drilled-hole (CIDH) piles are often constructed to depths that are inaccessible to internal vibration of the concrete. Internal vibration is necessary to consolidate the concrete and, if not performed, then typically inspection pipes are necessary to detect the presence of voids in CIDH piles. Void detection is critical to assessing {{whether or not the}} CIDH pile will provide adequate support for the design loads. However, inspection pipes are often placed in line with congested reinforcement bars and can further congest the reinforcement. Highly congested reinforcement can cause concrete voids to occur. Because these CIDH piles are inaccessible and have congested reinforcement a highly workable concrete mixture is necessary to decrease the potential of concrete voids from occurring. <b>Flowing</b> <b>concrete</b> (FC) is required for CIDH piles. FC is a concrete mixture with a slump greater than 7. 5 inches (178 mm). Little research has been performed on the variables that influence FC workability. However, much attention and research has been performed regarding the workability of conventional concrete (CC) and self-consolidating concrete (SCC). In fact, proportioning methods for these concrete types are well established. This is not the case for FC mixtures. Research is needed to proportion FC mixtures and assess the influence of coarse aggregate (CA) type and mixture proportions FC workability. The research presented here proposes a new methodology for proportioning FC mixtures. This method uses a quantitative assessment of the coarse aggregate (CA) shape along with the combined aggregate void (AV) content to proportion FC mixtures. This research also provides information on the influence of various mixture constituents and proportions on workability: CA type, paste volume, fine aggregate (FA) to CA ratio (FA/CA), and paste volume to AV content ratio (PV/AV). Results from this study indicate that FC mixtures with adequate flowability, stability, and passing ability can be proportioned using this newly developed mixture proportioning method. Results also indicate that PV/AV significantly influences FC flowability and stability and more importantly a range of PV/AV can be identified to achieve adequate flowability and stability. In some cases, the results indicated that FA/CA significantly influences slump flow and in all cases FA/CA influences stability...|$|E
40|$|The latest {{literature}} on quality {{management in the}} construction industry asserts that ISO 9000, a standard established in 1987 and drastically upgraded in 2000, has not been embraced as a holistic approach to improve overall performance. It is felt that management’s insistence on “punch-list inspection” creates barriers to adopting Total Quality Management (TQM), a model that fosters a culture of constant improvement. This research project studies the efficacy of quality as a catalyst to eliminate wasted construction process resources caused by ineffective inter-organizational supply-chain. The literature review showed that process planning and simulation in constructions still builds on the reactive Input-Process-Output (IPO) model found unfit to model the proactive management of supply-chain based quality (SCQ). The need for a feed-forward control approach required the introduction of process resource (Input) quality and causality functions predicting the quality of the output. Thus, the developed model, affirming the importance of feed-forward over feed-back control, was built on measuring quality as a function of process waste generation along the construction supply-chain. Referred to as Supply-Chain Dynamic Quality Control (SC-DQC), it extends the output oriented process model to pursue a continuous improvement of the agile construction operations. A construction site at Kensington, NSW was selected, to test the model while evaluating improvements and barriers to its implementation in the real world of construction. After extensive field observations and discussions with the contractors, two universal material supplies were selected for experimental studies: 1) Concrete Placement and 2) Rebar Installation. Both test cases exhibited poor supply chain quality and information sharing, albeit with different consequences. In a first phase, feed-forward control technologies and methods were designed and field-tested to prove the hypotheses predicting technical feasibilities and measurable improvements. Ruggedized Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags were added (embedded) to the <b>flowing</b> <b>concrete</b> as five trucks emptied their drums into a pump hopper after laboratory pre-tests. A RFID reader not only detected fourteen out of the fifteen embedded tags, but a tag’s readability increased with the decreasing water-content indicating the curing of the concrete. While RFID tags attached to rebar bundles opened up new information channels along the supply chain, the significant improvements resulted from feed-forwarding ‘process intelligence’ into the rebar fabrication shop ensuring a high quality delivery process. The comparative field experiments proved the drastic effect of DQC on the work efficiency of placing rebar for the test beams. The high supply quality ensured by the Master Bundle (MSB) concept allowed the steel fixers to increase their productive time from 31 % to 77. 4 %. As expected, this radical change was accompanied by a drastic reduction of process waste from 41. 5 % to 6. 2 % and contributory work from 19. 7 % to 10. 5 %. The relevance of the presented research lies in complying scientific evidence that the DQC model, built on a proactive and holistic management philosophy, targets the elimination of process wastes caused by poor quality supply processes. The realization of the substantial improvements will rest on the industry’s ability to adopt mutually supportive relationships and agile communication across the supply chain...|$|E
