25|$|Bangalore {{was hit by}} {{a plague}} {{epidemic}} in 1898 that claimed nearly 3,500 lives. The crisis caused by the outbreak catalysed the city's sanitation process. Telephone lines were laid to help co-ordinate anti-plague operations. Regulations for building new houses with proper sanitation facilities came into effect. A health officer was appointed and the city divided into four wards for better co-ordination. Victoria Hospital was inaugurated in 1900 by Lord Curzon, the then Governor-General of British India. New extensions in Malleswaram and Basavanagudi were developed in the north and south of the pētē. In 1903, motor vehicles came to be introduced in Bangalore. In 1906, Bangalore {{became one of the first}} cities in India to have electricity from hydro power, powered by the hydroelectric plant situated in Shivanasamudra. The Indian Institute of Science was established in 1909, which subsequently played a major role in developing the city as a science research hub. In 1912, the Bangalore torpedo, a defensive <b>explosive</b> <b>weapon</b> widely used in World War I and World War II, was devised in Bangalore by British army officer Captain McClintock of the Madras Sappers and Miners.|$|E

2500|$|The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) is an {{international}} treaty that prohibits the use, transfer, and stockpiling of cluster bombs, a type of <b>explosive</b> <b>weapon</b> which scatters submunitions ("bomblets") over an area. The convention was adopted on [...] 2008 in Dublin, and was opened for signature on [...] 2008 in Oslo. It entered into force on [...] 2010, six months after it was ratified by 30 states.

50|$|In {{the common}} {{practice}} of states, <b>explosive</b> <b>weapons</b> are generally the preserve of the military, {{for use in}} situations of armed conflict, and are rarely used for purposes of domestic policing. Certain types of <b>explosive</b> <b>weapons</b> may be categorised as light weapons (e.g. hand-held under-barrel and mounted grenade launchers, portable launchers of anti-tank missile and rocket systems; portable launchers of anti-aircraft missile systems (MANPADS); and mortars of calibres of less than 100 mm). Many <b>explosive</b> <b>weapons,</b> such as aircraft bombs, rockets systems, artillery and larger mortars, are categorised as heavy weapons.|$|R

5000|$|A bomb, or more {{specifically}} a guided or unguided bomb (also called an aircraft bomb or aerial bomb), is typically an airdropped, unpowered <b>explosive</b> <b>weapon.</b> Mines and the warheads used in guided missiles and rockets are {{also referred to}} as bomb-type ammunition.|$|E
50|$|An explosion, {{whether or}} not by a weapon, causes the debris to act as {{multiple}} high velocity projectiles. An <b>explosive</b> <b>weapon,</b> or device may also be designed to produce many high velocity projectiles by the break-up of its casing, these are correctly termed fragments.|$|E

When a player is equipped with Pyrovision, gibs are replaced with gag items, including a unicycle wheel, among other things.|$|E
50|$|A bomb is an <b>explosive</b> <b>weapon</b> {{that uses}} the {{exothermic}} reaction of an explosive material to provide an extremely sudden and violent release of energy. Detonations inflict damage principally through ground- and atmosphere-transmitted mechanical stress, the impact and penetration of pressure-driven projectiles, pressure damage, and explosion-generated effects. Bombs have been in use since the 11th century in Song Dynasty China.|$|E

50|$|Protocol V on Explosive Remnants of War {{requires}} the clearance of UXO (unexploded ordnance), such as unexploded bomblets from cluster bombs and abandoned <b>explosive</b> <b>weapons.</b> At {{the cessation of}} active hostilities, Protocol V establishes a responsibility on parties that have used <b>explosive</b> <b>weapons</b> {{to assist with the}} clearance of unexploded ordnance that this use has created. Parties are also required, subject to certain qualifications, to provide information on their use of <b>explosive</b> <b>weapons.</b> Each party is responsible for the territory in their control after a conflict. The protocol doesn't apply to mines and other weapons covered by protocol II. The protocol came about {{as a result of a}} growing awareness during the 1990s that the protection against unexploded ordnance was insufficient. The protocol was adopted in 2003 and entered into force in 2006.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to stellar nuclear explosions, a man-made nuclear weapon {{is a type}} of <b>explosive</b> <b>weapon</b> that derives its destructive force from nuclear fission or from a combination of fission and fusion. As a result, even a nuclear weapon with a small yield is significantly more powerful than the largest conventional explosives available, with a single weapon capable of completely destroying an entire city.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{featured}} as an <b>explosive</b> <b>weapon</b> {{in the video}} game Call of Duty: World at War, {{in which it is}} seen in Map Pack 3 as the [...] "Monkey Bomb". It resides in the player's secondary grenade slot, and has an explosive element. After being activated, it bangs its cymbals and plays a song, attracting zombies which crowd around it, before subsequently exploding.|$|E
50|$|A {{cluster munition}} {{is a form}} of air-dropped or ground-launched <b>explosive</b> <b>weapon</b> that {{releases}} or ejects smaller submunitions. Commonly, this is a cluster bomb that ejects explosive bomblets that are designed to kill personnel and destroy vehicles. Other cluster munitions are designed to destroy runways or electric power transmission lines, disperse chemical or biological weapons, or to scatter land mines. Some submunition-based weapons can disperse non-munitions, such as leaflets.|$|E

50|$|In the 1964 {{edition of}} the DOD/AEC book The Effects of Nuclear Weapons, a section titled Radiological Warfare details {{some of the most}} common WMDs. The Fission {{products}} from a conventional nuclear <b>explosive</b> <b>weapon</b> are as much a radiological weapon as weapons solely designed for the purpose of mass radiological warfare. The standard high-fission thermonuclear weapon is automatically a weapon of radiological warfare, as dirty as a cobalt bomb.|$|E
50|$|The Monte Carlo {{method is}} {{a class of}} modern {{computation}} mathematics that analyses repeated simulations of random events. It often uses computer simulation to compute the results of physics systems. Tasneem Mohammad Shah's research applied the Monte Carlo method {{to the field of}} thermal radiative transfer and radionuclide enrichment technology. He also used the Monte Carlo method to solve problems in missile development affecting high-temperature combustion chambers and <b>explosive</b> <b>weapon</b> warhead.|$|E
5000|$|Still less {{sensitive}} {{materials such as}} blasting agents like ANFO, or shell fillings like Composition B, are so insensitive that the impulse from the detonator must be amplified by an explosive booster charge to secure reliable detonation. Some polymer bonded explosives [...] - [...] especially those based on TATB [...] - [...] are designed for use in insensitive munitions, which are unlikely to detonate even if struck by another <b>explosive</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E

50|$|Certain {{types of}} <b>explosive</b> <b>weapon</b> {{have been subject}} to {{prohibition}} in international treaties. The Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868 prohibits the use of certain explosive rifle projectiles. This prohibition has evolved into a ban on 'exploding bullets' under customary international humanitarian law binding on all States. The 1997 Mine Ban Treaty and the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions also prohibit types of explosive weapons, anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions, for states parties to these treaties.|$|E
