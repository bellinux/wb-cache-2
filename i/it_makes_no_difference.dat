5|$|The {{era that}} began when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC, and ended when Octavian {{returned}} to Rome after the Battle of Actium in 29 BC, {{can be divided}} into two distinct units. The dividing line between these two units is the assassination of Caesar in March 44 BC, although from a constitutional standpoint, there was no clear dividing line between these two periods. The forces which had supported Pompey during {{the early part of the}} first period were allied against Mark Antony and Octavian in 43 BC and 42 BC, and the constitutional means through which Caesar had held power before his assassination were used by Antony and Octavian to hold power after Caesar's assassination. From a constitutional standpoint, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> whether an autocrat holds the title of Roman Dictator, as Caesar had done, or of Triumvir, as Antony and Octavian had done. From a constitutional perspective, these twenty years formed a single unit, through which the constitutional evolution of the prior century accelerated at a rapid pace. By 27 BC, Rome had completed its transition from being a city-state with a network of dependencies, to being the capital of a world empire.|$|E

These slots are interchangeable, so {{in most cases}} <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> in which slot a cartridge is inserted. The physical connector is a 50 pin (2 x 25 contacts), standard 2.54mm (0.1 inch) pitch edge connector. Using these cartridge slots, {{a wide variety of}} peripherals could be connected.|$|E

25|$|Instead of a cost, tapping {{can also}} be {{the effect of a}} spell or ability. In such a case, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> if that {{permanent}} was already tapped. A creature that attacks also gets tapped, unless it has vigilance, but a defending creature does not. Unless stated otherwise, tapping does not stop continuous abilities (e.g. enchantments or equipments) or triggered abilities from taking effect, nor does it disallow the use of abilities that do not require tapping.|$|E
25|$|The {{proof of}} the {{independence}} result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements, including all statements that can be phrased {{in the language of}} Peano arithmetic, are provable in ZF if and only if they are provable in ZFC. Statements in this class include the statement that P = NP, the Riemann hypothesis, and many other unsolved mathematical problems. When one attempts to solve problems in this class, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> whether ZF or ZFC is employed if the only question is the existence of a proof. It is possible, however, that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from ZFC than from ZF.|$|E
25|$|For {{generating}} random permutations {{of a given}} {{sequence of}} n values, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> whether one applies a randomly selected permutation of n to the sequence, or chooses a random element from the set of distinct (multiset) permutations of the sequence. This is because, even though in case of repeated values there can be many distinct permutations of n that result in the same permuted sequence, {{the number of such}} permutations is the same for each possible result. Unlike for systematic generation, which becomes unfeasible for large n due to the growth of the number n!, {{there is no reason to}} assume that n will be small for random generation.|$|E

25|$|Afrikaans uses a diaeresis to mark vowels {{that are}} {{pronounced}} separately {{and not as}} one would expect where they occur together, for example voel (to feel) as opposed to voël (bird). The circumflex is used in ê, î, ô and û generally to indicate long close-mid, as opposed to open-mid vowels, for example in the words wêreld (world) and môre (morning, tomorrow). The acute accent is used to add emphasis {{in the same way as}} underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example Dit is jóú boek (It is your book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example appel (apple) and appèl (appeal) and in a few cases where <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are the in the sayings òf... òf (either... or) and nòg... nòg (neither... nor) to distinguish them from of (or) and nog (again, still).|$|E

The Mundaka Upanishad declares how man has been called upon, promised benefits for, scared unto and misled into performing sacrifices, oblations and pious works. Mundaka thereafter asserts this is foolish and frail, by those who encourage it and those who follow it, because <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> to man's current life and after-life, it is like blind men leading the blind, it is a mark of conceit and vain knowledge, ignorant inertia like that of children, a futile useless practice.

2500|$|Note {{that the}} {{definite}} integral starting from 1 is not defined for negative values of a, since {{it passes through}} a singularity, though since 1/x is an odd function, one can base the definite integral for negative powers at1.

In later years Le Sage responded in two different ways to charges that his ideas on gravitation were only the result of studying Cramer's papers. First, he argued that his first essay was written before he knew of the theories of his predecessors. Second, he argued {{that even if he}} knew about Cramer's theory, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference,</b> because Cramer's theory is too vague and scientifically not valuable. Le Sage did, however, accuse Cramer of plagiarising Fatio's theory. (Fatio himself had made the same accusation.) ...|$|E
