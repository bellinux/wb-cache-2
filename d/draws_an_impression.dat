40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the submitted thesis is presented Albrecht Dürer's engraving "Melencolia I" from the year 1514. This work is well known and very important for art history. At the end of the thesis is <b>a</b> small <b>drawing,</b> Caspar David Friedrich's selfportrait from from {{the beginning}} of nineteenth century. The both work can be described as melancolical. Dürer's engraving has Melancholy directly in the title, Friedrich's <b>drawing</b> creates <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> of melancholy. From complicated relationships between attributes and symbols on Dürer's work remains in the Friedrich only typical melancolical gesture of the hand, which support the head. My work deals with influency of Dürer's Melancholy in the art of the 16 th, 17 th and 18 th century. Dürer's understanding of melancholy as "melancholia artificialis", artist's melancholy, in the connection with genius found immediately after its origin a lot of variations and immitations...|$|R
6000|$|Late one {{afternoon}} Ralph stepped along the Strand {{to an interview}} with a lawyer upon business. The afternoon light was almost over, and already streams of greenish and yellowish artificial light were being poured into an atmosphere which, in country lanes, would now have been soft with the smoke of wood fires; and {{on both sides of the}} road the shop windows were full of sparkling chains and highly polished leather cases, which stood upon shelves made of thick plate-glass. None of these different objects was seen separately by Denham, but from all of them he <b>drew</b> <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> of stir and cheerfulness. Thus it came about that he saw Katharine Hilbery coming towards him, and looked straight at her, as if she were only an illustration of the argument that was going forward in his mind. In this spirit he noticed the rather set expression in her eyes, and the slight, half-conscious movement of her lips, which, together with her height and the distinction of her dress, made her look as if the scurrying crowd impeded her, and her direction were different from theirs. He noticed this calmly; but suddenly, as he passed her, his hands and knees began to tremble, and his heart beat painfully. She did not see him, and went on repeating to herself some lines which had stuck to her memory: [...] "It's life that matters, nothing but life--the process of discovering--the everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery itself at all." [...] Thus occupied, she did not see Denham, and he had not the courage to stop her. But immediately the whole scene in the Strand wore that curious look of order and purpose which is imparted to the most heterogeneous things when music sounds; and so pleasant was this impression that he was very glad that he had not stopped her, after all. It grew slowly fainter, but lasted until he stood outside the barrister's chambers.|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (Van Laar, 1961) the female genitalia {{of the species}} of Depressaria Hw. s. l. occurring in the Netherlands have been dealt with. In the present paper the male genitalia of these species will be treated. Although Hannemann (1953, 1954, 1958) already described the male genitalia of the species of Depressaria occurring in Europe, it {{was thought to be}} worth while to give here a survey of the male genitalia of the Dutch species, supplementing that of the female genitalia, in order to help students to discriminate between these rather uniform species. In view of the complexity of these structures the most efficient way seemed to present elaborate illustrations and abbreviate the descriptions. In the present work the classification used in the first paper is followed, viz., the division of Depressaria s. l. into a number of groups of generic status, of which Depressaria Haworth s. s., Agonopterix Hübner, and Levipalpus Hannemann are represented in the Netherlands. A sketch of the male genitalia in ventral aspect is given in fig. 1. The valvae are bent backward. More exactly, {{the right side of the}} <b>drawing</b> gives <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> of the situation as is generally found in Depressaria, the left side as is found in Agonopterix. For the structures of the genitalia the terminology of Pierce (1909) is used. Of certain species studied only limited material was available which made it difficult to get an insight of the variability of the genital characters within the species. Of certain species no male material from Dutch localities could be obtained; the genitalia of these species are described and figured after material from abroad. As to the wing venation, Agonopterix and Levipalpus show the sam...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} beading & boxing of <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> is {{to obtain an}} {{accurate}} cast with proper border & base thickness for fabrication of restorations. Beading is {{the protection of the}} formed border thickness of the final impressions & Boxing of <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> is building up vertical walls around it. Aim: The purpose of this hybrid technique of beading and boxing is to produce a smooth & aesthetically acceptable cast with accurate border thickness using a simple procedure. Materials & Methods: In this hybrid technique of beading and boxing <b>an</b> <b>impression,</b> <b>a</b> uniform layer of modeling wax was applied over the beading of a plaster-pumice mixture around an impression; after that, boxing & pouring of <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> was done to retrieve a cast. Results: Casts obtained by hybrid technique was more accurate in border thickness & more aesthetic in comparison to the cast obtained by wax technique of beading & boxing. Conclusion: Beading and boxing of <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> is done to protect the formed border thickness of <b>an</b> <b>impression,</b> regulate the height & size of the cast, avoid undue trimming of the cast and to eliminate distortion associated with slumping of the gypsum material when <b>an</b> <b>impression</b> is inverted. This hybrid technique of beading and boxing eliminates the need for applying separating media over the beading of a plaster-pumice mixture and by this technique retrieval of the cast from the impression is very easy and quick. The resulted cast will be very neat and clean with accurate thickness of the borders and base of the cast. This technique is suitable for impressions made from almost any type of impression material...|$|R
