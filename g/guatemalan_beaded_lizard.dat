5000|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (Heloderma charlesbogerti), {{also called}} the Motagua Valley beaded lizard, is a highly {{endangered}} species of beaded lizard, a venomous lizard endemic to the dry forests of the Motagua Valley in southeastern Guatemala, [...] an ecoregion known as the Motagua Valley thornscrub. It is the only allopatric beaded lizard species, separated from the nearest population (H. alvarezi) by 250 km of unsuitable habitat. The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is the rarest and most endangered species of beaded lizard and {{it is believed that}} fewer than 200 of these animals exist in the wild, {{making it one of the}} most endangered lizards in the world. In 2007, it was transferred from Appendix II to Appendix I of CITES due to its critical conservation status.|$|E
50|$|The Mexican {{beaded lizard}} H. horridum {{is found in}} Mexico, from Sonora to Oaxaca. The Rio Fuerte beaded lizard (H. exasperatum) is found from {{southern}} Sonora to northern Sinaloa. The Chiapan beaded lizard (H. alvarezi) {{is found in the}} northern Chiapas and the depression of the Río Lagartero in Huehuetenango to northwestern Guatemala. The ranges of these three species overlap, making them sympatric. The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (H. charlesbogerti) is the only allopatric one, separated from the nearest population (H. alvarezi) by 250 km of unsuitable habitat. The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is the most endangered of the species, if not of all lizards; it is found only in the dry valley of the Río Motagua in northeastern Guatemala; less than 200 are believed to exist in the wild.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> {{belongs to}} the family Helodermatidae which forms part of a clade of {{reptiles}} with toxin secreting glands. This species differs from other Heloderma species in coloration and size, being the smallest one. Home ranges and behavior of these lizards were investigated using radio-telemetry at the dry forests of Zacapa, Guatemala. The average home range for individuals {{was found to be}} 130 ha.|$|E
50|$|Adult <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> {{range from}} 57 to 91 cm in length. They are {{substantially}} {{larger than the}} Gila monster, which only reaches lengths of 30 to 56 cm. The snout-to-vent length of a <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> averages 33 to 48 cm. The average body mass of an adult <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is 800 g, about 45% heavier than the average mass of a gila monster, with large specimens exceeding 2000 g. Maximum weight known is 4000 g Although males are slightly larger than females, the lizards are not sexually dimorphic. Both males and females are stocky with broad heads, although the males' tend to be broader. The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard's</b> scales are small, beadlike, and not overlapping. Except for the lizard's underside, {{the majority of its}} scales are underlaid with bony osteoderms.|$|R

5000|$|H. charlesbogerti dwells in arroyos {{characterized}} by high densities of bird nests of doves and parakeets, whose eggs form the primary component of its diet. [...] These birds nest {{closer to the}} ground in these arroyos in trees with branches thick enough to support the weight of this heavy-bodied lizard. [...] It is known to prey upon insects, such as beetles and crickets. The eggs of the Guatemalan Spiny-tailed Iguana (Ctenosaura palearis), an endangered species endemic to the same region, are an important food source for the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard,</b> thereby possibly linking the status of the two.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{factors affecting}} shelter {{use by the}} Mexican <b>Beaded</b> <b>Lizard,</b> Heloderma horridum in a tropical dry forest of costal Jalisco, Mexico. Our study aimed to understand 1) how shelter (burrow) availability varies over the landscape, 2) if <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> choose to inhabit areas that have a high frequency of potential burrows, and 3) how the extreme seasonality of a tropical dry forest might influence microhabitat selection. We hypothesized {{that there would be}} a higher frequency of potential shelters in areas that had known <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> use. To test our hypothesis, we ran transects near 10 known burrow sites (5 wet season and 5 dry season) and 5 areas with no known Heloderma horridum activity, recording all potential burrows within a meter of each transect line. We found that <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> tended to choose burrows with sediment roofs and floors, with the remaining potential shelters having tree root or rock components as well. Significantly more potential burrows were found in areas of known use (3. 0 shelters/ 80 m transect) than in non-site areas (1. 4 shelters/ 80 m transect). A chi-squared analysis showed that <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> also prefer burrows with a west-facing entrance, most notably for dry season sites. Our results suggest that shelters (burrows) may be a limiting habitat feature for <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> and that these lizards are selective in their choice of shelter sites, a result that may also apply to other species that inhabit tropical dry forests...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> {{have one}} close living relative, the Gila monster (H. suspectum), {{as well as}} many extinct {{relatives}} in the Helodermatidae, whose genetic history may {{be traced back to the}} Cretaceous period. The genus Heloderma has existed since the Miocene, when H. texana ranged over most of North America. [...] Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia, and Australia, the wide geographical separation and unique features not found in the varanids indicate the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is better placed in a separate family.|$|R

50|$|The Mexican <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (Heloderma horridum) is {{the most}} famous of the four species of venomous <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> found principally in Mexico and {{southern}} Guatemala. They and their congener (member of the same genus) the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) are the only lizards known to have evolved an overt venom delivery system. The Mexican <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is larger than the Gila monster, with duller coloration, black with yellowish bands. As it is a specialized predator that feeds primarily upon eggs, the primary use of its venom is still a source of debate among scientists. However, this venom has been found to contain several enzymes useful for manufacturing drugs in the treatment of diabetes, and research on the pharmacological use of its venom is ongoing.|$|R

50|$|The venom glands of the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> are {{modified}} {{salivary glands}} {{located in the}} reptile's lower jaw. Each gland has a separate duct leading {{to the base of}} its grooved teeth. When biting, the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> hangs on its victim and chews to get its venomous saliva into the wound. Although its jaw grip is strong, its unsocketed teeth are easily broken off at their bases. The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard's</b> venom is a weak hemotoxin, and although human deaths are rare, it can cause respiratory failure. It consists of a number of components, including L-amino acid oxidase, hyaluronidase, phospholipase A, serotonin, and highly active kallikreins that release vasoactive kinins. The venom contains no enzymes that significantly affect coagulation. Almost all documented human bites (eight in the past century) have resulted from prodding captive lizards with a finger or bare foot.|$|R
40|$|By {{shuttling}} between {{cool and}} warm patches in their habitat, reptiles can maintain stable {{as well as}} suitable body temperatures� 2 ̆ 2 {{this is known as}} active thermoregulation. Nevertheless, active thermoregulation is physically challenging and behaviorally expensive for medium to large reptiles (3 ̆e 500 g). We contrasted Mexican <b>Beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> body temperature management between the wet and dry seasons, in a tropical deciduous forest, near Chamela, Jalisco, Mexico. Animals were tracked using radiotelemetry and monitored for habitat use patterns and behavior. Implanted Thermocron ibuttonTM temperature dataloggers were used to record body temperatures at 15 minute intervals (n = 6 lizards). Body temperatures of active <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> were found to correlate strongly with concurrent ambient temperature, in both the dry and wet seasons, indicating a conformist strategy to thermal management. Yet, shelters occupied by <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> showed ambient temperatures close to this species preferred body temperature. Thermal selectivity in refuge choice, as well as temporal patterns of refuge use, enabled <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> to regulate body temperature tightly. For instance, 54. 4 percent of dry-season and 30. 4 percent of wet-season body temperatures fell between 27. 1 and 29. 9 ˚C, which agrees with this species preferred body temperature� 2 ̆ 2 27. 5 to 31. 25 ˚C (n= 5 lizards). Rather than actively thermoregulate, <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> seem to manage body temperature through careful refuge selection and activity scheduling. Furthermore, homeothermy achieved using this strategy can be held for many days, a level of thermal stability that is impossible to maintain through active behavioral thermoregulation...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is a {{specialized}} vertebrate nest predator, feeding primarily on bird and reptile eggs. A semi-arboreal species, {{it is found}} climbing deciduous trees in search of prey when encountered above ground. [...] It occasionally preys upon small birds, mammals, frogs, lizards, and insects. Steve Angeli and Robert Applegate, noted captive breeders of the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard,</b> have remarked that captive specimens do best on a diet of small vertebrates primarily mice and rats. Confiscated wild-caught specimens {{can be made to}} feed by using egg on the prey item.|$|R
50|$|Ophanin, {{along with}} other {{specific}} snake toxins like triflin and ablomin, is also a helothermine-related venom protein (Helveprin) which was originally isolated from {{the skin of the}} Mexican <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard.</b>|$|R

50|$|Their base {{color is}} black and marked with varying amounts of yellow spots or bands, with the {{exception}} of H. alvarezi, which tends to be all black in color. The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> has a short tail which is used to store fat so it can survive during months of estivation. Unlike many other lizards, this tail does not autotomize and cannot grow back if broken. The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> has a forked, black tongue which it uses to smell, {{with the help of a}} Jacobson's organ; it sticks its tongue out to gather scents and touches it to the opening of the organ when the tongue is retracted.|$|R
50|$|Helothermine (or HLTx) is a toxin {{from the}} venom of the Mexican <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> Heloderma horridum horridum.

5000|$|Fewer than 200 lizards {{remain in}} the dry forest habitat of the Motagua Valley, and this species of <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (H. charlesbogerti) was facing {{extinction}} due to local extermination and loss of habitat for agricultural purposes. [...] A conservation effort has been launched known as Project Heloderma to preserve the semiarid habitat of the Motagua Valley by the Nature Conservancy and partners such as ZOOTROPIC, CONAP, the International Reptile Conservation Foundation, Lincoln Park Zoo, Zoo Atlanta, and the San Diego Zoo. This effort {{has been successful in}} getting the Guatemalan government to list the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species as an Appendix I animal, making it illegal to export the species.|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{resource}} scarcity {{in the tropical}} deciduous forest (TDF) forces many animals, including <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards,</b> to take refuge in the soil for extended periods of time. To investigate which characteristics may be ideal when resources are less abundant, we measured soil characteristics in habitats used by Mexican <b>Beaded</b> <b>Lizard’s</b> (Heloderma horridum) in the TDF of Jalisco, Mexico. Utilizing a Brownian Bridge Kernel Density Estimation to identify activity centers in both wet and dry season sites, fourteen soil samples were collected in areas where <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> have been observed or had a high probability of being observed. The soil characteristics measured include soil permeability, percent water content, sediment size distribution, and color. Measured habitat characteristics include percent canopy cover, slope, and height of primary vegetation. All samples were collected and measured in the dry season, March 2014. Results indicate that dry and wet season soils differ in sediment size, slope, percent water, and color indicating that soil used in the dry season is different from soil used in the wet. Another notable observation was that all dry season sites had oxidized soil (determined by red color), whereas the wet season sites showed no pattern with respect to soil color...|$|R

40|$|Tropical {{deciduous}} {{forests are}} characterized by drastic seasonal changes in precipitation. At our study site in Jalisco, Mexico, 80 percent of annual precipitation of 748 millimeters falls within a 4 -month wet season from July through October. We investigated {{the effect of this}} extreme seasonality on activity patterns in the Mexican <b>Beaded</b> <b>Lizard</b> (Heloderma horridum) within its tropical deciduous forest habitat. Seven H. horridum equipped with radiotransmitters and ibutton dataloggers were monitored periodically from May 2011 to July 2012 using radiotelemetry. Location of lizards were recorded using a GPS, coordinates were put into ArcGIS, which was used to calculate minimum distance traveled between relocations and minimum home range sizes of <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards.</b> Greater time spent on the surface during the wet season corresponded to higher average distance between re-locations. For example, one individual traveled a total distance of 263. 8 meters (home range: 1. 4 hectares; 4 relocations) in a one-month period during the dry season compared to 2, 442. 6 meters (home range: 21. 4 hectares; 10 relocations) traveled during the wet season. These results underscore the significance of seasonal effects on activity of the Mexican <b>Beaded</b> <b>Lizard,</b> and, potentially, for many other species that inhabit tropical dry forests...|$|R
