50|$|This maximalist {{position}} {{leads to}} philosophical difficulties, {{such as the}} question of what the truthmaker for an ethical, modal or mathematical truthbearer could be. Of course someone who is <b>deeply</b> enough <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> truthmakers and who simultaneously doubts that a truthmaker could be found for a certain kind of truthbearer will simply deny that that truthbearer could be true. Those who find the Parmenidean insight sufficiently compelling often take it to be a particularly enlightening metaphysical pursuit to search for truthmakers of these kinds of propositions.|$|R

25|$|There {{had always}} been close {{relations}} between the Armenians and the Lusignans, who, by the 12th century, were already established in the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus. Had {{it not been for}} their presence in Cyprus, the kingdom of Cilician Armenia may have, out of necessity, established itself on the island. In 1342, Levon's cousin Guy de Lusignan, was anointed king as Constantine II, King of Armenia. Guy de Lusignan and his younger brother John were considered pro-Latin and <b>deeply</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church in the Levant. As kings, the Lusignans attempted to impose Catholicism and the European ways. The Armenian nobles largely accepted this, but the peasantry opposed the changes, which eventually led to civil strife.|$|E
25|$|In {{the center}} were the conservationists, led by Theodore Roosevelt and his {{coalition}} of outdoorsmen, sportsmen, bird watchers and scientists. They wanted to reduce waste; emphasized {{the value of}} natural beauty for tourism and ample wildlife for hunters; and argued that careful management would not only enhance these goals but also increase the long-term economic benefits to society by planned harvesting and environmental protections. Roosevelt worked his entire career to put the issue high on the national agenda. He was <b>deeply</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> conserving natural resources. He worked closely with Gifford Pinchot and used the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902 to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000mi² or 930,000km²) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more Federal land, national parks, and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined.|$|E
25|$|Adams {{sought the}} gradual {{assimilation}} of Native Americans via consensual agreements, a priority shared by few {{whites in the}} 1820s. Yet Adams was also <b>deeply</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the westward expansion of the United States. Settlers on the frontier, who were constantly seeking to move westward, cried for a more expansionist policy that disregarded the concerns of a supposedly inferior civilization. Early in his term, Adams suspended the Treaty of Indian Springs after learning that the Governor of Georgia, George Troup, had forced the treaty on the Muscogee. Adams signed a new treaty with the Muskogee in January 1826 that allowed the Muskogee to stay but ceded most of their land to Georgia. Troup refused to accept its terms, and authorized all Georgian citizens to evict the Muskogee. A third treaty was signed in 1828, giving all of the Muskogee land to Georgia.|$|E

40|$|In 1925 the Finnish {{architect}} Eliel Saarinen (1873 ¨- 1950) {{was commissioned}} {{to design the}} campus for Cranbrook Educational Community in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (USA). The patrons were the newspaper magnate George Gough Booth and his wife Ellen Scripps Booth, by then also well known patrons of the American Arts and Crafts Movement. Eliel Saarinen moved to Cranbrook {{and all of his}} family was <b>deeply</b> <b>commited</b> <b>to</b> this project. Educated originally in sculpture, Loja Saarinen (1879 - 1968), the wife of Eliel, founded in 1928 the Studio Loja Saarinen to produce textiles for Cranbrook buildings. This weaving studio soon merged its activities into the programme of the Cranbrook Academy of Art (est. 1932) and Loja Saarinen headed the weaving department until 1942. Loja Saarinen has later been acknowledged as pioneering American textile artist. Her role in the Cranbrook project, however, remains ambiguous. This paper will look at her work as entrepreneurship and examine the Cranbrook community in a wider economic and social historical context. The concept of bourgeois modernity has been used to describe the complex networks of industrialists and artists that produced the framework for emerging modern architecture and design in Europe in the early 20 th century. Using this concept, I will examine Loja Saarinen as an economic actor and discuss the meanings of her studio in the Cranbrook project. This paper relates to my current research project on hand weaving as medium for woman designers. My academic framework is in art history, design history, economic and social history and gender studies...|$|R
500|$|Diefenbaker reinvigorated a moribund {{party system}} in Canada. Clark and Mulroney, two men who, as students, worked on and were {{inspired}} by his 1957 triumph, became the only other Progressive Conservatives to lead the party to election triumphs. Diefenbaker's biographer, Denis Smith, wrote of him, [...] "In politics he had {{little more than two}} years of success in the midst of failure and frustration, but he retained a core of <b>deeply</b> <b>committed</b> loyalists <b>to</b> {{the end of his life}} and beyond. The federal Conservative Party that he had revived remained dominant in the prairie provinces for 25 years after he left the leadership." [...] The Harper government, believing that Tory prime ministers have been given short shrift in the naming of Canadian places and institutions, named the former Ottawa City Hall, now a federal office building, the John G. Diefenbaker Building. It also gave Diefenbaker's name to a human rights award and an icebreaking vessel. Harper often invoked Diefenbaker's northern vision in his speeches.|$|R
25|$|This period {{marked a}} {{transformation}} in Azad's own life. Along with fellow Khilafat leaders Dr. Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari, Hakim Ajmal Khan and others, Azad grew personally close to Gandhi and his philosophy. The three men founded the Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi {{as an institution}} of higher education managed entirely by Indians without any British support or control. Both Azad and Gandhi shared a deep passion for religion and Azad developed a close friendship with him. He adopted the Prophet Muhammad's ideas by living simply, rejecting material possessions and pleasures. He began to spin his own clothes using khadi on the charkha, and began frequently living and participating in the ashrams organised by Gandhi. Becoming <b>deeply</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> ahimsa (non-violence) himself, Azad grew close to fellow nationalists like Jawaharlal Nehru, Chittaranjan Das and Subhas Chandra Bose. He strongly criticised the continuing suspicion of the Congress amongst the Muslim intellectuals from the Aligarh Muslim University and the Muslim League.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{readers of}} 18th-century {{literature}} now {{need to understand}} the history of the period more than most readers of other literature do. The authors were writing for an informed audience and only secondarily for posterity. Even the authors, who criticised writing that lived for only a day (like Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope, in The Dedication to Prince Posterity of A Tale of a Tub and Dunciad, among other pieces) were criticising specific authors, who are unknown to those without historical knowledge of the period. Poetry of all forms was in constant dialogue, and each author was responding and commenting upon the others. Novels were written against other novels (like the battles between Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding, who, along with Eliza Haywood, wrote a novel satirising Richardson's Pamela, and between Laurence Sterne and Tobias Smollett). Plays were written to make fun of plays or to counter the success of plays (like the reaction against and for Cato and, later, Fielding's The Author's Farce). Therefore, history and literature are linked in a way rarely seen at other times. On one hand, the metropolitan and political writing can seem like coterie or salon work, but on the other hand, it was the literature of people <b>deeply</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> sorting out a new type of government, new technologies and newly-vexatious challenges to philosophical and religious certainty.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, pray away," [...] {{answered}} Spike, {{his throat}} becoming dry and husky, for, strange to say, the submissive {{quiet of the}} Irish woman, {{so different from the}} struggle he had anticipated with her, rendered him more reluctant to proceed than he had hitherto been in all of that terrible day. As Biddy kneeled {{in the bottom of the}} stern-sheets, Spike looked behind him, for the double purpose of escaping the painful spectacle at his feet, and that of ascertaining how his pursuers came on. The last still gained, though very slowly, and doubts began to come over the captain's mind whether he could escape such enemies at all. He was too <b>deeply</b> <b>committed,</b> however, <b>to</b> recede, and it was most desirable to get rid of poor Biddy, if it were for no other motive than to shut her mouth. Spike even fancied that some idea of what had passed was entertained by those in the cutter. There was evidently a stir in that boat, and two forms that he had no difficulty, now, in recognizing as those of Wallace and Mulford, were standing on the grating in the eyes of the cutter, or forward of the foresail. The former appeared to have a musket in his hand, and the other a glass. The last circumstance admonished him that all that was now done would be done before dangerous witnesses. It was too late to draw back, however, and the captain turned to look for the Irish woman.|$|R

500|$|Murray never married, instead devoting {{her life}} to her work, and for this reason, Hutton drew {{comparisons}} between her and two other prominent female British scholars of the period, Jane Harrison and Jessie Weston.

500|$|In 1896, Taft became {{dean and}} Professor of Property at his alma mater, the Cincinnati Law School, a post that {{required}} him to prepare and give two hour-long lectures each week. He was devoted to his law school, and was <b>deeply</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> legal education, introducing the case system to the curriculum. [...] As a federal judge, Taft could not involve himself with politics, but followed it closely, remaining a Republican supporter. He watched with some disbelief as the campaign of Ohio Governor William McKinley developed in 1894 and 1895, writing [...] "I cannot find anybody in Washington who wants him". By March 1896, Taft realized that McKinley would likely be nominated, and was lukewarm in his support. He landed solidly in McKinley's camp after former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan in July stampeded the 1896 Democratic National Convention with his Cross of Gold speech. Bryan, both in that address and in his campaign, strongly advocated free silver, a policy that Taft saw as economic radicalism. Taft feared that people would hoard gold {{in anticipation of a}} Bryan victory, but he could do nothing but worry. McKinley was elected; when a place on the Supreme Court opened in 1898, the only one under McKinley, the president named Joseph McKenna.|$|E

5000|$|One of Rosenberg's {{most often}} cited essays is [...] "The Herd of Independent Minds," [...] where he {{analyzes}} the trivialization of personal experience inherent both in mass culture-making and superficial political commitment in the arts. In this work, Rosenberg exposes political posturing {{in both the}} mass media and among artistic elites (for instance, he claims the so-called socially responsible poetry of Stephen Spender was actually an avoidance of responsibility masquerading as [...] "responsible poetry.") [...] Rosenberg deplored the attempts at commercialization of authentic experience through techniques of psychological manipulation available to mass media producers. He wrote mockingly of mass culture's efforts to consolidate and control the intricacies of human needs:The more exactly he grasps, whether by instinct or through study, the existing element of sameness in people, the more successful is the mass-culture maker. Indeed, so <b>deeply</b> is he <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the concept that men are alike that he may even fancy that there exists a kind of human dead center in which everyone is identical with everyone else, and that if he can hit that psychic bull's eye he can make all mankind twitch at once.|$|R
500|$|Morton {{ranked as}} one of the strongest members of the {{so-called}} [...] "stalwart" [...] faction of the Republican party: those members most <b>deeply</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> protecting and preserving Republican governments in the South. [...] Not surprisingly, during the winter of 1876–77, Morton was among the most aggressive supporters of Hayes's right to the presidency in a close election. When Morton was placed on the Electoral Commission, the group that determined the outcome of the election, there was never any doubt that his vote would be cast for Hayes. After Hayes's supporters made overtures to southern Democrats, offering assurances that the president-elect would take no active role in propping up Republican governors in Louisiana and South Carolina, there were fears that Morton might cause difficulties. In one speech Morton {{made it clear that the}} Democrats must make guarantees of fair play and equal rights for southern blacks, before he would support Hayes's program. The guarantees were given, or at least promises were made. To the general surprise of many, Hayes's policy withdrew military support from the Republican governments in those two states, and Morton proved to be one of the president's strongest defenders, urging that his fellow Republicans show patience and give the so-called [...] "New Departure" [...] time to prove itself.|$|E

Reagan initially rejected the plan, until Israel sent information to the United States showing that the [...] "moderate" [...] Iranians were opposed to terrorism and had fought against it. Now having a reason to trust the [...] "moderates", Reagan approved the transaction, which was meant to be between Israel and the [...] "moderates" [...] in Iran, with the United States reimbursing Israel. In his 1990 autobiography An American Life, Reagan claimed that he was <b>deeply</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> securing the release of the hostages; it was this compassion that supposedly motivated his support for the arms initiatives. The president requested that the [...] "moderate" [...] Iranians do everything in their capability to free the hostages held by Hezbollah. Reagan always insisted in public after the scandal broke in late 1986 that purpose behind the arms-for-hostages trade was to establish a working relationship with the [...] "moderate" [...] faction associated with Rafsanjani to facilitate the reestablishment of the American-Iranian alliance after the soon to be expected death of Khomeini, to end the Iran-Iraq war and end Iranian support for Islamic terrorism while downplaying the importance of freeing the hostages in Lebanon as a secondary issue.
