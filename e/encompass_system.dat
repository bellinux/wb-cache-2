40|$|In the German {{healthcare}} industry, Business Intelligence systems play a cru-cial role. For {{one major}} health insurance company (discussed here as an alias - AK Healthcare), {{the deployment of}} Business Intelligence applications has supported sustained growth in turnover and market share {{in the past five}} years. In this article, these tools are classified within an appropriate conceptual framework which encompasses the organisation’s information infrastructure and associated processes. Different components of the framework are identified and examples are given - systems infrastructure, data provision/access control, the BI tools and technologies themselves, report generation, and in-formation users. The use and integration of Business Intelligence tools in the strategy development process is then analyzed. Finally, the key functions and features of these tools for strategic knowledge management are discussed. Research findings <b>encompass</b> <b>system</b> access, report characteristics, and end users profiles and capabilitie...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{the rise of}} the mobile {{internet}} and the usage of mobile devices has enabled ubiquitous traffic information. With the increased adoption of specific smartphone applications, the number of users of routing applications has become large enough to disrupt traffic flow patterns in a significant manner. Similarly, but at a slightly slower pace, novel services for freight transportation and city logistics improve the efficiency of goods transportation and change the use of road infrastructure. The present article provides a general four-layer framework for modeling these new trends. The main motivation behind the development is to provide a unifying formal system description that can at the same time <b>encompass</b> <b>system</b> physics (flow and motion of vehicles) as well as coordination strategies under various information and cooperation structures. To showcase the framework, we apply it to the specific challenge of modeling and analyzing the integration of routing applications in today's transportation systems. In this framework, at the lowest layer (flow dynamics) we distinguish app users from non-app users. A distributed parameter model based on a non-local partial differential equation is introduced and analyzed. The second layer incorporates connected services (e. g., routing) and other applications used to optimize the local performance of the system. As inputs to those applications, we propose a third layer introducing the incentive design and global objectives, which are typically varying over the day depending on road and weather conditions, external events etc. The high-level planning is handled on the fourth layer taking social long-term objectives into account.

40|$|Advanced {{application}} of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems as an on-site energy generation is subject {{not only to}} optimal system configuration, but also continuous operations management. This is vital in manufacturing plants where several types of energy forms are required dynamically. However, existing shortcomings and challenges have hindered the maximum utilisation of CHP technology as a potential on-site energy generation option. Consequently, this study {{on the one hand}} addresses optimal CHP configuration through integrated sizing and operational strategy selection. This is achieved through simulation of on-site energy system operation where comprehensive models of individual components and their potential operational strategies are formulated. Moreover, real-time operations management of CHP systems is developed and evaluated to enable optimal integration of controllable energy supply options into on-site energy systems. Thus, the concept of real-time optimisation is implemented to track a changing optimum. The proposed solution consists of two modules, i. e. the simulation module and optimisation module that can interact with the dynamic operating environments. The simulation module represents comprehensive modelling of individual components and the required interactivity with an operating environment. This also keeps the system operation history and provides look-ahead capability to impact past decisions and future system fluctuations. Moreover, the optimisation module guarantees economic dispatch of the energy system components in addition to unit commitment at short time intervals. The developed modules’ interaction decomposes the problem formulation to cope with concurrent computation and communication requirements. This will overcome the limitations of traditional optimisation techniques to simultaneously <b>encompass</b> <b>system</b> complexity and operational aspects in real-time. On the whole, the developed Real-time Integrated Simulation and Optimisation methodology (RISO) assures practical and intelligent control of potential components on a continuous basis. As a result, the proposed solution provides successful CHP system integration into the manufacturing plants to assure optimal configuration and operations management. Moreover, the generic and comprehensive control strategy facilitates the required foundation to integrate multiple and different types of on-site energy system technologies, such as intermittent renewable energy suppliers...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the potential strategic capability {{that can be}} improved from the deployment of business intelligence (BI) applications. AOK Niedersachsen (AOKN), a German health insurance company {{in the north of}} Germany (Lower-Saxony), is used as the case study for primary qualitative research and analysis. For many years, information and data have been considered even “factors of production” for companies; but data and information have become more complex, requiring processing and structural analysis to get the needed transparency in the company. Data from different operational sources must be extracted and structured to provide information for management accounting employees, top management, and end-users throughout an organization. In the healthcare industry, BI systems have played a crucial role for decades. For organizations such as AOKN, the application of BI tools and technologies can create and support sustainable capability. Several research questions are answered in this thesis through structured one-to-one interviews with different AOKN employees, and the resulting analysis of interview data. A qualitative approach to this case study is used, allowing the researcher to get in-depth information about a specific context. When case studies are conducted, the one-to-one interview is considered to be an optimal instrument and a significant source of evidence. BI technologies and tools are classified within an appropriate conceptual framework which integrates the complex BI demands and structures of AOKN, identifying different components as part of the framework - systems infrastructure, data provision, reporting, and information receiver. The framework is further enhanced by four factors of a competitive advantage model drawn from existing literature to develop capabilities. The use and integration of BI technologies and tools in the strategy development process are then analyzed. Different BI tools, that have an important function during the whole strategy process, are recommended for each strategy phase. The final area of research examines the possible addition of new functions and solutions to current BI technologies and tools to enhance the potential of these systems in gaining capabilities. Research findings <b>encompass</b> <b>system</b> access, report characteristics, and BI end users profiles and capabilities. To this end, a structured model gives examples of practical AOKN BI projects that have generated strategic capabilities for the organization. At the end, the conclusion chapter stresses the needs of contribution to knowledge (theory and practice) ...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} the redistributive outcomes of sickness benefits using a typology of social insurance institutions, including four different systems, {{after adjusting for}} sickness risk factors. The aim is to empirically observe if the expected redistributive pattern of the typology could be verified whether or not considering the variations in sickness risk across the countries. Data on household earnings and sickness benefits in ten countries and for different years {{were taken from the}} Luxembourg Income Study. We also used data on labor force demography and educational attainment. Gini coefficients were used for measuring earnings inequality. Relative changes in earnings inequality for sickness benefits were predicted by social insurance institutional dummies using multiple regression analyses.
