A £1 million public appeal was {{launched}} to help towards {{the cost of the}} re-build to accommodate a new [...] lifeboat.

40|$|M. Tech. Architecture (Applied) The aim of {{the thesis}} is to design a public {{swimming}} pool that re-connects street and river within a particular urban condition. The ground plane of the selected site is manipulated to facilitate a physical and visual connection with the river. Wetlands form {{part of the landscape}} surrounding the facility and on urban scale to assist in the cleaning and re-use of water from the canal. The proposal includes two pools accommodating different human interactions with water. The buildings are designed as a transitional space between inside and outside. The site was carefully selected based on the mix of current educational <b>facilities,</b> <b>offices</b> <b>and</b> residential <b>accommodation.</b> The site was developed using various layers namely: Private swimming, public swimming, spill out spaces, as well as spectator and passer-by contact. It is envisioned that the proposal will form part of the larger Tshwane 2055 framework aiming to revitalize the Pretoria CBD, although canalized, the Aapies River forms an important life giving artery adjacent to the Nelson Mandela Corridor. As part of the design proposal, it is envisioned that the canal be used as a floating walkway in future with follies linking specific sites and the river at strategic points. The proposed lap pool adheres to international standards. Both the pools step towards the canal, providing a different spatial and sensory experience. The design may serve as a guideline for future proposals along the canal. URBAN SWIMMING must inspire social growth and promote swimming as both a sport and a recreational activity...|$|R

50|$|Until 1996, Marischal College {{housed the}} Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, {{which had been}} there for many decades. From 1996, the {{department}} moved to Kings College campus and Foresterhill campus. Teaching no longer takes place at Marischal College, with many of the departments formerly based there having moved to King's College some decades previously. While graduations and other events (e.g. concerts) took place in the cathedral-like Mitchell Hall in the north wing, for many years much of the building (including the frontage to the street) was derelict. A restoration project was completed in 2011 and restored the building and its ornamentation. It is now occupied by Aberdeen City Council and forms the administrative headquarters for the city, replacing the ageing St. Nicholas House across the street. The project provided modernized public <b>facilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>office</b> <b>accommodation</b> for the Council as well as cosmetic rejuvenation, and involved the demolition and reconstruction of internal spaces while retaining and restoring the outer walls and windows. The University controls the north wing of the building containing the Marischal Museum and Mitchell Hall which was used in the past for graduation and other academic ceremonies. Graduations take place at Elphinstone Hall at King's College.|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the conflict management styles adopted in the Federal Polytechnic, Ede and the possible effects on the organizational performance of the institution since 1992. It focused on the causes, types, effects and strategies for managing conflicts {{with a view to}} suggesting ways of improving the performance and productivity of the school. The study employed descriptive research design and used questionnaire to collect data from 100 senior officer’s cadre of the institution. The research revealed that the major cause of organizational conflicts in the institution was related to communication and inter-group conflict was the main type observed. About 50 % of the respondents believed that conflicts interfere with organization operations by way of wasted resources. About 74 % believed that conflicts can be managed through collaboration and bargaining. It was established that gender, position held in the polytechnic, and experience influenced the opinion of senior staff officers on the causes, effects, and conflict management strategies in the polytechnic. To improve the relationship between management and other stakeholders, management should encourage the spirit of team work. Provision of basic <b>facilities</b> like <b>office</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>and</b> furniture should be improved. The beginning and end of year briefings used in the institution should be sustained and made inspiring and motivational in nature. Management should adopt an open policy strategy so that different groups can move closer, collaborate and make some compromises where possible so that the objectives of setting up the polytechnic will be achieved...|$|R
