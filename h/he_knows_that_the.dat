He is informed that Khori {{was a member of}} Terra Prime, an anti-alien movement. Meanwhile, in the Terra Prime headquarters on the Moon, John Frederick Paxton and Doctor Mercer discuss the child. After Mercer leaves, Paxton sends for Daniel Greaves and tells him to deal with Mercer. On Earth, Archer tells Samuels that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> minister was a former member of Terra Prime and convinces him to provide a case file on Khouri. Meanwhile, Ensign Mayweather gives his reporter ex-girlfriend, Gannet Brooks, a tour of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Clara {{volunteers to}} speak to Skaldak to try and calm him, {{relaying}} the Doctor's words to Skaldak, though <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Doctor is listening. The Doctor informs Skaldak he was encased in the ice for 5000 years. Skaldak laments {{the loss of his}} daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the knowledge that the Ice Warriors still live, just not on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes himself to be the only one of his kind left. The Doctor surmises that, thinking himself to be the last of his kind, Skaldak has nothing left to lose. He manages to grab and kill three members of the crew.|$|E

During the war between the Scythians and the Persian Empire, the Scythians came to dominate the Neuri. Strabo, younger contemporary of Pytheas, denies that any knowledge of {{the shores of the}} eastern Baltic existed. He had heard of the Sauromatai, but had no idea where to place them. Herodotus had mentioned these Sauromatai as a distinct people living near the Neuri. Pliny the Elder, however, is much better informed. The island of Baunonia (Bornholm), he says lies a days' sail off Scythia, where amber is collected. To him the limit of Germany is the Vistula. In contrast to Strabo, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Goths live around the Vistula, but these are definitely Germans.|$|E

But the tale he tells during the final recess is {{different}} from the one Kennan outlined in his letter: Raul successfully breaks into the Wizard fortress, but half-frozen and overwhelmed by their technology, cannot overcome them. He is forced to escape aboard one of their flying craft. Dobby manages to wrench one arm free, but no more, while Gernisavien is securely fastened. They know their only course of action with Raul's defeat is to have Dobby smash some chemicals together. The resulting explosion levels the mountain. Raul is safely away when it happens, but <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> explosion means that the quest is dead, for his friends perished with the key and knowledge necessary to reactivate the farcaster.|$|E

500|$|Al-Mir's {{trial began}} before the Damascus First Criminal Court on August 29, 2007.

[...] It accused al-Mir of conveying [...] "support for the approach and direction of March 14" [...] during the phone call. Al-Mir denied this, stating that he called Atallah only as head of the Democratic Left Movement. On November 8, the court adjourned his trial, postponing the verdict until November 28 {{as a result of the}} defense filing a petition to dismiss the judge in session.|$|E

2500|$|The {{iterated}} elimination (or deletion) of dominated strategies is {{one common}} technique for solving games that involves iteratively removing dominated strategies. [...] In the first step, at most one dominated strategy {{is removed from}} the strategy space of each of the players since no rational player would ever play these strategies. This results in a new, smaller game. [...] Some strategiesthat were not dominated beforemay be dominated in the smaller game. [...] The first step is repeated, creating a new even smaller game, and so on. The process stops when no dominated strategy is found for any player. This process is valid since it is assumed that rationality among players is common knowledge, that is, each player knows {{that the rest of the}} players are rational, and each player knows that the rest of the players know that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rest of the players are rational, and so on ad infinitum (see Aumann, 1976).|$|E
2500|$|Reverend Hale arrives, {{stating that}} he is {{interviewing}} all the people named in the proceedings, including Elizabeth. He mentions that Rebecca Nurse was also named, but admits that she is too pious to be a witch. Hale is skeptical about the Proctors' devotion to Christianity, noting {{that they do not}} attend church regularly and that their second child has not yet been baptized; John replies that this is because he has no respect for Parris. Challenged to recite the Ten Commandments, John fatefully forgets [...] "thou shalt not commit adultery". When Hale questions her, Elizabeth is angered that he doesn't question Abigail first. Unsure of how to proceed, Hale prepares to take his leave. At Elizabeth's urging, John tells Hale <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> girl's afflictions are fake. When Hale responds that many of the accused have confessed, John points out that they were bound to be hanged if they didn’t: Hale reluctantly acknowledges this point.|$|E

2500|$|Xu Yin (徐胤), the Army Inspector (監軍) of the Jin {{garrison}} at Badong (巴東), led marine forces towards Jianping (建平), while Yang Zhao (楊肇), the Inspector (刺史) of Jing Province (also under Jin control), led troops towards Xiling. Lu Kang gave orders as such: Zhang Xian {{to reinforce}} Jiangling's defences; Sun Zun (孫遵), the Commandant of Gong'an (公安), {{to patrol the}} south river bank and resist Yang Hu; naval commander Liu Lü (留慮) and General Who Guards the West (鎮西將軍) Zhu Wan (朱琬) to defend against Xu Yin. He personally led three armies to hold off Yang Zhao {{with the aid of}} the defensive structures they constructed earlier. However, Lu Kang's subordinates Zhu Qiao (朱喬) and Yu Zan (俞贊) defected to Yang Zhao's side instead. Lu Kang said, [...] "Yu Zan has been serving under {{me for a long time}} and he is very aware of my situation. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tribal soldiers in my army may be unwilling to follow my orders, so he'll definitely suggest to the enemy to take advantage of this weakness." [...] Hence, that night, Lu Kang immediately replaced the tribal soldiers in his army with other veteran soldiers whom he trusted more. The following day, as Lu Kang expected, Yang Zhao concentrated his attacks on the unit in Lu Kang's army which used to be made up of tribal soldiers, without knowing that they had been replaced. Lu Kang ordered his archers to retaliate, raining arrows on the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties.|$|E
2500|$|Fletch {{received}} generally positive {{reviews and}} has a 75% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 28 critics with the consensus: [...] "Quotably funny -- and fast-paced enough to smooth over the jokes that don't land -- Fletch {{is one of the}} best big-screen vehicles for Chevy Chase's brand of smug silliness". Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "The problem is, Chase's performance tends to reduce all the scenes to the same level, at least as far as he is concerned. He projects such an inflexible mask of cool detachment, of ironic running commentary, that we're prevented from identifying with him [...] [...] [...] Fletch needed an actor more interested in playing the character than in playing himself." [...] Vincent Canby in his review for The New York Times praised Chase's performance, writing, [...] "He manages simultaneously to act the material with a good deal of nonchalance and to float above it, as if he wanted us to know that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> whole enterprise is somewhat less than transcendental." [...] Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "In Fletch, the quick, smartly paced, gags somehow read as signs of vulnerability. Incidentally, they add greatly to the movie's suspense. Every minute you expect the hero's loose lip to be turned into a fat one." [...] In his review for the Chicago Reader, Dave Kehr wrote, [...] "Chase and Ritchie make a strong, natural combination: the union of their two flip, sarcastic personalities produces a fairly definitive example of the comic style of the 80s, grounded in detachment, underreaction, and cool contempt for rhetorically overblown authority figures." ...|$|E
2500|$|I Do Bidoo Bidoo {{is a dream}} {{project of}} Unitel Productions' big boss, Tony Gloria who is also behind {{successful}} movies like Working Girls and Crying Ladies. He also revealed that the film has been developed and finished for 5 years. The idea came up when he saw Mamma Mia! on the broadway more than 10 years ago. When Gloria noticed that the songs of APO were revived by various bands and became hits anew, he felt their songs would be great for a movie as it spans many generations, so he talked to APO member, Jim Paredes and signed them up to a contract. The contract expired two times before the project has been finalized. According to him, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Filipino audience is ready {{for this kind of}} musical extravaganza on the big screen, especially when the music comes very close {{to the heart of the}} Filipino just like the songs of Jim Paredes, Boboy Garovillo and Danny Javier who are collectively known as the Apo Hiking Society. Mr. Gloria, whose vision is shared, nurtured and upheld by Unitel’s new President Ms. Madonna Tarrayo, added, “I wanted to give back something we can be proud of - for the Filipino, by the Filipino.” The film is written and directed by the award-winning Chris Martinez who ably used APO Hiking music to move the story forward and punctuate pivotal scenes with the same. He is the mind behind successful comedy films like Kimmy Dora and [...] "Ang Babae sa Septic Tank". The APO songs in the movie was rearranged by award-winning composer and musical director Vincent de Jesus. De Jesus was the musical director of hit movies Crying Ladies, La Visa Loca, Ang Babae Sa Septic Tank, Kimmy Dora and theater musicals Zsa Zsa Zaturnnah Ze Muzikal, Himala and Care Divas.|$|E
