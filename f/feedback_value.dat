40|$|Abstract — In {{the present}} paper the authors have {{introduced}} a new symmetric key cryptographic method {{which is based on}} three way simultaneous feedback method applied along three dimensions on plain text. Nath et al already developed 3 dMWFES ver- 1 where they have used encryption methods in both x-axis and y-axis wise in different frames. In the present method the authors have made encryption along z-axis also. In the method the plain text is divided into a number of square matrices where the size of the matrix and number of frames are balanced. For example if plain text has 20 characters then the size of the matrix will (3 x 3) and no of framess will be 2 and 2 additional residual characters. The initial feedback is predetermined. The feedback is applied first x-axis wise and after that y-axis wise and finally z-axis wise. The forward and the backward feedback is applied to all 3 directions one after the other. The ASCII value of plain text, the key value, the forward <b>feedback</b> <b>value</b> and the backward <b>feedback</b> <b>value</b> calculated along three directions are used to generate the cipher text. The intermediate cipher text is taken modulo 256 to get the final cipher text. The decryption process is obtained by observing the pattern of cipher text and by evaluating the values of feedback arrays. 3 dMWFES ver- 2 is completely a new method and this can be used for encryption of any kind small or large message, password, and confidential information’s in sensor networks. The results of this method show that the present method is free from common attacks such as known plain text attack, differential attack or any kind of brute force attac...|$|E
