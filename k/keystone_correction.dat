50|$|<b>Keystone</b> <b>correction,</b> colloquially {{also called}} keystoning, is a {{function}} that allows multimedia projectors that are not placed perpendicular to the horizontal centerline of the screen (too high or too low) to skew the output image, thereby making it rectangular.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{projectors}} <b>keystone</b> <b>correction</b> {{technology is}} performed digitally (rather than optically) via the internal (LCD) panels or (DLP) mirrors of the projector, {{depending on the}} technology used. Thus, when applying <b>keystone</b> <b>correction</b> to an image, the number of individual pixels used is reduced, lowering the resolution and thus degrading {{the quality of the}} image projected. Home theater enthusiasts would argue that keystoning should not be used because of the impact it has on image quality. However, it is a useful technology in cases where the projector cannot be mounted {{directly in front of the}} screen, or on projectors utilizing lens shift technology where the projector must be mounted outside the frame of the screen.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{application of}} image geometry correction {{is a specific}} case known as keystone distortion correction derived from Keystone effect. Keystone distortion gets {{its name from the}} symmetric trapezoidal distortion resulting from misaligned projector placement in the vertical dimension (although the term is generally applied to the non-symmetric quadrilateral shape that occurs from an off-axis projection in both dimensions). <b>Keystone</b> <b>correction</b> capabilities are now included in most projectors currently available on the market, allowing users to move the image both vertically and horizontally. Even with this feature, the degree of adjustment available is limited, and image quality may suffer. <b>Keystone</b> <b>correction</b> is ideal for simple business (i.e. conference room) adjustments. For more complex distortion correction, an external processor is required.|$|E
50|$|Projector Stacking is an {{advanced}} form of <b>keystone</b> <b>correction.</b> In this application, {{two or more}} projectors are projected onto exactly the same surface. Since the two projectors cannot occupy exactly the same space, the output of each {{must be at least}} slightly corrected for Keystone Distortion.|$|E
50|$|Features include film grain, repair layers, local adjustments, <b>keystone</b> <b>correction,</b> {{black and}} white conversion, ability to print {{directly}} from Capture One, Profoto studio plug-in, Profoto capture and lighting integration, extension to iPad and iPhone with Capture Pilot, noise reduction, color correction, spot removal, HDR tools, lens tools and sharpening tools.|$|E
50|$|Calculation of {{the image}} {{geometry}} correction transformationThe image geometry correction transformation can be calculated by predictive geometry (i.e. calculating exactly where an image should land on a regular surface such as sphere or a cylinder), or by an automatic optical feedback system (i.e. a camera {{can be used to}} evaluate the alignment of test images), or by user iteration (i.e. movement of points by an operator). In all methods, the transformation is generally described as a 2-dimensional array. The number of points in the 2-dimensional array that are required to do an accurate Image Geometry Correction depends on the surface involved. In the case of <b>Keystone</b> <b>Correction,</b> 4 points are all that are required to completely describe any projection situation.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} for a projector {{to be placed in}} a position outside the line perpendicular to the screen and going through the screen's center, for example, when the projector is mounted to a ceiling or placed on a table top that is lower or higher than the projection screen. Most ceiling-mounted projectors have to be mounted upside down to accommodate for the throw of the image from the lens, with the image rotated right-side-up with software. <b>Keystone</b> <b>correction</b> is a feature included with many projectors that provides the ability to intentionally [...] "distort" [...] the output image to recreate the original rectangular image provided by the video or computer source, thus eliminating the skewed output that would otherwise result due to angled projection.|$|E
40|$|Introduction We {{demonstrate}} a self-calibrating system that employs uncalibrated cameras and microportable projectors to create novel interactive displays and presentations. 1 Three benefits {{of our system}} are detailed in the following sections. 2. Automatic <b>Keystone</b> <b>Correction</b> The image generated by an off-center projector appears distorted (Figure 1, left). Using an uncalibrated camera pointed at the presentation screen, our system automatically recovers the projector-to-screen homography and pre-warps the computer output to produce a keystone-corrected image (Figure 1, right). This allows the presenter to place the microportable projector anywhere in the room without sacrificing presentation quality. Automatic <b>keystone</b> <b>correction</b> is also attractive in a home theater application where the user could place a microportable projector on a bookshelf {{at the side of}} the room and project an undistorted movie on an adjacent wall. Figure 1 : Automati...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fully-automatic method for <b>keystone</b> <b>correction.</b> The two key concepts are: (1) {{a digital camera}} is used to observe the projected image; (2) the image to be displayed is prewarped so that the distortions induced by the projection system will exactly undo the keystone distortion. The result is that an arbitrarily mounted projector (in an unknown orientation) displays a perfectly aligned and rectilinear image, as shown in Figure 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} uncalibrated projector-camera {{system in which}} the {{information}} displayed onto a planar screen can be interactively warped according to an arbitrary planar homography. The user interacts with the system through a laser pointer, whose displacements on the screen plane are captured by the camera, interpreted as mouse drags, and used to control the warping process. Applications of our interactive warping system encompass arbitrary (pan/tilt/screw) <b>keystone</b> <b>correction,</b> visualization of undistorted information for a user being in a general position with respect to the screen (including virtual anamorphosis as a special case), and self-shadow avoidance by a nearly-parallel projection. ...|$|E
40|$|Front {{projection}} allows large displays to {{be deployed}} relatively easily. However, it is sometimes {{difficult to find a}} location to place a projector, especially for ad-hoc installations. Additionally, front projection suffers from shadows and occlusions, making it ill-suited for interactive displays. The GVU-PROCAMS system allows programmers to deploy projectors and displays easily in arbitrary locations by enabling enhanced <b>keystone</b> <b>correction</b> via warping on 3 D hardware. In addition, it handles the calibration of multiple projectors using computer vision to produce a redundantly illuminated surface. Redundant illumination offers robustness in the face of occlusions, providing a user with the experience of a rear-projected surface. This paper presents a stand-alone application (WinPVRP) and a programming system (GVU-PROCAMS) that easily allows others to create projected displays with enhanced warping and redundant illumination...|$|E
40|$|For typical multi-projector 3 D display systems, precise {{calibration}} of projectors {{is extremely}} important for ensuring projected images/videos to coincide exactly in the same region of the screen to obtain high quality 3 D display experience. Conventional calibration is achieved by adjusting the pose of projectors manually with the built-in <b>keystone</b> <b>correction</b> function, which is imprecise and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an auto-calibration approach using feature detection and matching technique via an uncalibrated camera to improve both the calibration efficiency and precision. The whole procedure can be finished in minutes, and the calibration error also hardly increase {{with the number of}} projectors. Whatâ€™s more, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, our approach is the first fast auto-calibration approach employed in the multi-projector 3 D display systems...|$|E
40|$|Multiprojector tiled {{displays}} offer a scalable path to high-resolution display systems, {{often in}} a large format. Such displays have been employed {{in a range of}} applications from scientific visualization to collaborative virtual environments. Images projected onto these systems have always looked less sharp than expected owing to the image warping required to achieve geometrical alignment of the partial images to form the seamless whole. Similar degradation of image quality accompanies <b>keystone</b> <b>correction</b> techniques and image warping onto nonplanar surfaces used in single projector applications. In this paper we discuss the underlying cause of the degradation of apparent image resolution, and we introduce a new class of warping techniques, called pixel-aligned warping, that tend to preserve image sharpness at the expense of strict adherence to underlying geometrical constraints that define the desired warp. We demonstrate how such techniques can be used to significantly improve the apparent sharpness of the final image. 1...|$|E
40|$|Motivated {{by these}} problems, we explore the {{potential}} of projectors in interactive information visualization and processing in this thesis. In particular, we make three contributions. First, we propose a computer vision solution for direct 3 D object exhibition and manipulation without the user wearing spectacles. In our approach, a new 3 D display interface is designed by projecting images on a hand-held foam sphere which can be moved freely by the user. By tracking {{the motion of the}} sphere and projecting motion-dependent images onto the sphere, a virtual 3 D perception can be created. Using this interface, the user will experience as if he is holding the real object in hands and be able to control the viewing angle freely. Second, we extend the projection on traditional rigid screen to projection on flexible surfaces. A new flexible display method is proposed, which can project information on a hand-held flexible surface (e. g. an ordinary white paper with a checker pattern at the back) that can be twisted freely. While the user twists the projection surface, the system recovers the deformation of the surface and projects well-tailored information onto the surface corresponding to the deformation. As a result, the viewer will see the information as if it was printed on the paper. Two applications, the flexible image projection and curvilinear data slicing are created to demonstrate the usefulness of the method. After the studies on fixed-position projection, we conduct an investigation on mobile projectors, which is becoming especially necessary with the rapid popularity of mobile projectors. We propose a hand-held movable projection method that can freely project keystone-free content onto a general flat surface without any markings or boundaries on the displaying screen. Compared with traditional static projection systems that keep the projector and screen in fixed positions, our projection scheme can give the user greater freedom of display control while producing undistorted images at the same time. The recent trend of human-computer interaction technologies has revealed {{the potential of}} the projector as an powerful interaction tool. More than a pure display tool, a projector has great strength that can change largely the way a traditional user interface works. Although some possibilities have been investigated in previous work, certain applications and approaches deserve further studies. For example, 1) Projection showing 3 D information: viewing 3 D models is usually achieved by projecting polarized light of different phases for left and right eyes, and the user is required to wear specially designed spectacles. The cost of building such a system is high. 2) Projection on flexible surface: most existing systems display information on flat rigid projection screens, extending it to non-planar flexible surfaces is an interesting and useful research direction; 3) Direct user-info interaction: existing systems using mouse and screen have limited freedom of control and low level of user experience. Direct manipulation of the display object by the hands of a user is more natural; 4) Mobile projector display: portable or embedded projectors {{are becoming more and more}} popular, but some fundamental problems, e. g. the <b>keystone</b> <b>correction,</b> are not fully studied. To verify the correctness of our methods, we built prototype systems using off-the-shelf devices and conducted extensive experiments, including both simulation and real experiments. The results show that the proposed methods are effective and good performance has been achieved. In particular, the real-time speed and low-cost requirement make it quite appealing in many application areas, such as education, digital games, medical applications etc. Capitalizing on the shrinking size, increasing portability, and decreasing cost of projectors, it is predictable that projector-based interactive processing will become more and more popular in the near future. We believe the research work in this thesis will provide a good foundation for further research and development on computer vision and projector-based applications. Li, Zhaorong.
