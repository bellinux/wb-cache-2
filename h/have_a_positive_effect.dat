5|$|Other major {{employers}} {{in the county}} include: BAE Systems, Sunseeker International, J.P. Morgan, Cobham plc and Bournemouth University. Dorset's three ports, Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and the smaller harbours of Christchurch, Swanage, Lyme Regis, Wareham and West Bay generate {{a substantial amount of}} international trade and tourism. Around 230 fishing vessels that predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset's ports. When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector. It is expected that this will continue to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on local businesses and tourism.|$|E
5|$|The West Pier was {{constructed}} during {{a boom in}} pleasure pier building in the 1860s, during which 22 new piers were erected across Britain. It was designed by architect Eugenius Birch as a place for seaside visitors to enjoy fresh sea air. Some wealthy residents in the nearby Regency Square objected to construction, complaining that the planned toll houses at the entrance would spoil {{the view of the}} sea from their homes. It was felt that the pier would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on property values in the town, so the pier was approved. Construction began in 1863 and the pier opened to the public on 6 October 1866.|$|E

A particular study performed by the National Institutes of Health partially supported by Mars Chocolate company showed high amounts of improvement in blood flow after drinking a flavanol-rich cocoa beverage. In the study, the subjects (27 people ages 18 to 72) drank a cocoa drink containing 900 milligrams of flavonols every day, which resulted in an improvement in blood flow and the function of endothelial cells that line blood vessels.|$|E

5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E

25|$|The final {{government}} regulation towards increased demand is recycled product labeling. When producers {{are required to}} label their packaging with amount of recycled material in the product (including the packaging), consumers {{are better able to}} make educated choices.

Standardized recycling labeling can also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on supply of recyclates if the labeling includes information on how and where the product can be recycled.|$|E

A study found that in a region of rural Bangladesh, 89.3% of infants were fed prelacteally, and only 18.8% of these infants were exclusively breastfed between three days and three months postpartum. 70.6% of infants who were not fed prelacteally were exclusively breastfed up to three months.

25|$|Packard was {{experiencing}} financial difficulties when DeLorean joined, {{because of the}} changing post-World War II automotive market. While Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler had begun producing affordable mainstream products designed to cater to the rising postwar middle class, Packard clung to their pre-World War II era notions of high-end, precisely engineered luxury cars. This exclusive philosophy was to take its toll on profitability. However, it proved to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on DeLorean's attention to engineering detail, and after four years at Packard he became McFarland's successor as head of research and development.|$|E

Duckworth was also an admirer of Nellie McClung and Agnes Macphail, two political activists who championed women's rights. Many decades later, Muriel told an interviewer that her mother's example helped lead her into social activism. Her mother cared passionately about what she did, Muriel said.

Animal {{research has demonstrated that}} probiotics have barrier enhancing, antibacterial, immune modulating and anti-inflammatory effects which may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> in the management of SIBO in humans. Lactobacillus casei {{has been found to be}} effective in improving breath hydrogen scores after 6 weeks of treatment presumably by suppressing levels of a small intestinal bacterial overgrowth of fermenting bacteria. The multi-strain preparation VSL#3 was found to be effective in suppressing SIBO. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei have all demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment and management of SIBO. Conversely, Lactobacillus fermentum and Saccharomyces boulardii have been found to be ineffective. A combination of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus has been found to be effective in suppressing bacterial overgrowth of abnormal gas producing organisms in the small intestine.|$|E
