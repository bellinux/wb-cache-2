Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.|$|E

Tancredi reveals {{he is really}} Scaroth, {{a member of the}} Jagaroth race. They had arrived on Earth 400 million years ago, but due an explosion in their craft, all of the others died and his own body was fragmented across time. Collectively, the fragments of Scaroth have manipulated humanity so that by the 20th century, they will have technology that will enable him to go back in time to stop the explosion. Tancredi is currently employing da Vinci to create copies of the Mona Lisa as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a <b>felt-tip</b> pen, and leaves a message to da Vinci to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} {{tools for}} a calligrapher are {{the pen and}} the brush. Calligraphy pens write with nibs that may be flat, round, or pointed.

However, works have also been created with <b>felt-tip</b> and ballpoint pens, although these works do not employ angled lines. There are some styles of calligraphy, like Gothic script, which require a stub nib pen.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} part of his career, Adams' pencils were embellished by inkers such as Whilce Portacio, Dick Giordano and Terry Austin. When Adams {{attempted}} to ink his own work before becoming a professional, he initially used a Croquille pen, but after meeting Mike Mignola, he was spurred to switch to a brush, which he used for approximately a year before returning to a Croquille. He eventually began to ink his own work, which he prefers to do. Beginning in the late 1990s, he began using the Staedtler Pigment Liner, a <b>felt-tip</b> pen. He prefers pens to brushes because pens feel [...] "looser", and cited this as his reason for using <b>felt-tip</b> pens when he inked [...] "Jonni Future".|$|E
500|$|The {{note was}} printed in neat, all-capital letters with a <b>felt-tip</b> pen. Its exact wording is unknown, because Cooper later {{reclaimed}} it, but Schaffner recalled that it indicated {{he had a}} bomb in his briefcase, and directed her to sit beside him. Schaffner did as requested, then quietly asked to see the bomb. Cooper cracked open his briefcase long {{enough for her to}} glimpse eight red cylinders ("four on top of four") attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery. After closing the briefcase, he dictated his demands: $200,000 in [...] "negotiable American currency"; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival. Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the cockpit: when she returned, he was wearing dark sunglasses.|$|E
500|$|Matt Groening's {{animated}} series The Simpsons, {{of which}} Kubrick was a fan, and Futurama frequently reference 2001, {{along with other}} Kubrick films. In the opening of Episode 8F06 of The Simpsons (Lisa's Pony) the 'Dawn of Man' scene from 2001 is recreated with primates that include Homer; while all the primates are inspired to new levels of intellect by the monolith, the Homer primate uses it as a back rest to take a nap. [...] The Simpsons had in the episode [...] "Deep Space Homer" [...] Bart throwing a <b>felt-tip</b> marker into the air; in slow motion it rotates, before a match cut replaces it with a cylindrical satellite. [...] In 2004 Empire magazine listed this as the third best film parody of the entire run of the show. The satellite docking sequence is also parodied as Homer Simpson floats through the spaceship eating potato chips. [...] In the Futurama episode [...] "Love and Rocket" [...] a sentient spaceship revolts {{in a manner similar}} to Hal. Games Radar listed this as number 17 in its list of 20 Funniest Futurama parodies, while noting that Futurama has referenced Space Odyssey on several other occasions.|$|E

On arrival, they were marked with <b>felt-tip</b> crosses on each cheek, and many were forced to walk between two parallel lines of officers who kicked and beat them. Most were herded into large cells, holding up to 30 people. Here, {{they were forced to}} stand for long periods, facing the wall with their hands up high and their legs spread. Those who failed to hold the position were shouted at, slapped and beaten. A prisoner with an artificial leg and, unable to hold the stress position, collapsed and was rewarded with two bursts of pepper spray in his face and, later, a particularly savage beating.|$|E
2500|$|Sparkman's {{body was}} {{discovered}} on September 12, 2009 by attendees of a family reunion paying a visit to Hoskins Cemetery in rural Clay County, Kentucky within Daniel Boone National Forest. [...] He had been reported missing from work three days earlier while working on the American Community Survey for the U.S. Census, covering a local five county area. Sparkman was reportedly found with a rope around his neck, tied to a tree while {{in contact with the}} ground, wearing only socks, with the word [...] "fed" [...] written on his chest [...] in <b>felt-tip</b> marker. It was reported in the media that the word had been written upside-down or from an upside-down point of view and therefore, the police eventually concluded, by Sparkman himself. [...] His census ID was taped to the side of his neck. He was gagged, with duct tape around his hands and feet and over his mouth and eyes. [...] Kentucky State Police criticized many media reports of the death, such as asserting that he was hanging from a tree when he was actually tied to a tree with a rope around his neck.|$|E

The hooded man claimed to be an escaped convict from a 2 words jail of either Colorado or Montana (police officer estimated he meant Deer Lodge, Montana), where he had killed a guard and stolen a car, explaining that he needed their car and money to go to Mexico. He had brought precut lengths of plastic clothesline and told Shepard to tie up Hartnell, before he tied her up. The killer checked, and tightened Hartnell's bonds after discovering Shepard had bound Hartnell's hands loosely. Hartnell initially believed it to be a weird robbery, but the man drew a knife and stabbed them both repeatedly. The killer then hiked 500 yards back up to Knoxville Road, drew the cross-circle symbol on Hartnell's car door with a black <b>felt-tip</b> pen, and wrote beneath it: [...] "Vallejo/12-20-68/7-4-69/Sept 27–69–6:30/by knife." ...|$|E
