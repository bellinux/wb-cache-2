5|$|Biotechnology in {{the general}} sense has been an {{important}} part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of brewing and agriculture, chemists and biologists became aware of the <b>great</b> <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> human-controlled biological processes. In particular, fermentation proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, from drugs like penicillin and steroids to foods like Chlorella and single-cell protein to gasohol—as well as a wide range of hybrid high-yield crops and agricultural technologies, the basis for the Green Revolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{abundance}} {{of water and}} fertility of soil has transformed this region into a rich and well-endowed land. The variety of agricultural products such as wheat, barley, oily seeds, rice, eucalyptus, medicinal herbs; the existence of many palm and citrus farms; having mountains suitable for raising olives, and of course sugar cane - from which Khuzestan takes its name - all show the <b>great</b> <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> this fertile plain. In 2005, 51,000 hectares of land were planted with sugar canes, producing 350,000 tons of sugar. The {{abundance of}} water supplies, rivers, and dams, also have an influence on the fishery industries, which are prevalent in the area.|$|E

To the chagrin of his boyars and his mother (who died within three days after {{learning}} about his decision), Sviatoslav decided to move his capital to Pereyaslavets {{in the mouth of}} the Danube due to the <b>great</b> <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> that location as a commercial hub. In the Primary Chronicle record for 969, Sviatoslav explains that it is to Pereyaslavets, the centre of his lands, [...] "all the riches flow: gold, silks, wine, and various fruits from Greece, silver and horses from Hungary and Bohemia, and from Rus' furs, wax, honey, and slaves".|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1872, Col. Alexander and Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield, {{commander}} of the Military Division of the Pacific, sailed from San Francisco, California, to Honolulu in the then-independent Kingdom of Hawaii on a secret mission to evaluate Hawaii's ports in terms of defensive capabilities and commercial facilities. Fellow civil war veteran Alfred S. Hartwell was their host, {{who was on the}} kingdom's supreme court at the time. They recognized the <b>great</b> <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> Pearl Harbor as a [...] "harbor of refuge in time of war," [...] and on May 8, 1873, recommended that the War Department acquire the harbor. Their suggestion resulted in the signing of the reciprocity Treaty of 1875 between the United States and Hawaii. As part of the treaty, Hawaii ceded the area of Pearl Harbor to the United States in return for trade agreements benefiting Hawaiian sugar planters. The treaty was signed on September 8, 1876, helping pave the way for eventual American annexation of the Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|Gloster's Chief Test Pilot Bill Waterton flew with Frost in {{the second}} seat; to the test pilot, this was a revelation: [...] "(Frost was)...very much the keen English public schoolboy type. Here was another {{delightful}} contrast to England, where I {{was never able to}} find a designer with spare time enough to fly in his own creation." [...] Frost considered it important {{to get a feel for}} the aircraft and its systems. He even tested the CF-100's ejection seat by becoming a test subject himself. Early flights revealed the <b>great</b> <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft but also showed the flaw in the spar was dangerous. With the crash of the second CF-100 prototype and early production CF-100s delivered to the RCAF without the final modifications to the spar, Frost was blamed for the delays and removed as CF-100 Project Designer in early 1952.|$|E

2500|$|While {{earlier version}} of fiber-based laser traps {{exclusively}} used single mode beams, M. Kreysing and colleagues recently showed that the careful excitation of further optical modes in a short piece of optical fiber allows the realization of non-trivial trapping geometries. By this the researchers were able to orient various human cell types (individual cells and clusters) on a microscope. The main advantage of the so-called [...] "optical cell rotator" [...] technology over standard optical tweezers is the decoupling of trapping from imaging optics. This, its modular design, and the high compatibility of divergent laser traps with biological material indicates the <b>great</b> <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> this new generation of laser traps in medical research and life science. Recently, the optical cell rotator technology was implemented {{on the basis of}} adaptive optics, allowing to dynamically reconfigure the optical trap during operation and adapt it to the sample.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is largely}} known to history for his direction, from 1831-1835, of the Paris Opera. The new government, after the July Revolution of 1830, wished to offload {{the costs and}} {{responsibilities}} of the Opera, which had been effectively state-controlled since its inception. [...] Véron saw the <b>great</b> <b>potential</b> <b>of</b> adapting the Opera to the bourgeois tastes of new audiences and applied for the franchise, which brought with it limited State subsidy. By bringing together the talents of designers (such as Duponchel), composers (such as Meyerbeer, Auber and Fromental Halévy), and librettists (such as Eugene Scribe and Casimir Delavigne), and developing great singers such as Adolphe Nourrit and Cornélie Falcon, he created the genre of Grand Opera. The first new production under Véron's management, Meyerbeer's Robert le diable (21 November 1831) began {{a new era in}} opera. When the government decided to further reduce subsidy of the Opera in 1835, Véron prudently withdrew, having made a substantial profit.|$|E
