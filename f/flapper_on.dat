40|$|This is a delightfully subversive {{take on the}} {{traditional}} Oxford college history. Neither a cosy anecdotal inside story, nor a straightforward account of women's struggle to enter the university, this history of St Hugh's College, Oxford looks both upstairs and downstairs, at dons and undergraduates but also at domestic staff. What did it mean for the would-be school teacher, the <b>flapper</b> <b>on</b> the motorcycle, the depression era grammar-school girl, and the student revolutionary of the 1970 s to re-invent themselves as educated women? Who remained excluded from this emancipated identity? What were the tensions between old and new generations of dons and undergraduates? And what of the first Principal's notorious belief in time-travel? In this innovative study, Schwartz explores the relationship between personal and collective identity {{in one of the}} first higher educational establishments run by and for women, during a period in which women's role both in society and university education changed beyond recognition. Based on new and original research, "A Serious Endeavour" offers a fresh and sometimes disquieting perspective on the history of gender and education in twentieth-century Britain, opening up new ways of thinking about the development of women's higher education...|$|E
40|$|The large-eddy {{simulation}} numerical approach {{based on}} the compressible hydrodynamic equations was used to simulate turbulent flow around a system of two flappers and a stationary foil. Detailed analysis of this flow was carried out with the simulated data. Results have been compared with the available experimental data.

Extensive studies were conducted of the unsteady outer flow's effect, produced by the two upstream <b>flappers,</b> <b>on</b> the boundary layer of the stationary foil. The unsteadiness in the outer flow was found to be small; consequently, the response of the boundary layer of the stationary foil occurred mainly in the first harmonic of the flapper's oscillation.

40|$|Fluid-suspended {{microorganisms}} {{have evolved}} different swimming and feeding strategies {{in order to}} cope with an environment dominated by viscous effects. For instance ciliated organisms rely on the collective motion of flexible appendices to move and feed. By performing a non-reciprocal motion, flexible filaments can produce a net propulsive force, or pump fluid, {{in the absence of}} inertia. Inspired by such fundamental concept, we propose a strategy to produce macroscopic pumping and mixing in creeping flow. We measure experimentally the net motion of a Newtonian viscous fluid induced by the reciprocal motion of a flapper. When the flapper is rigid no net motion is induced. In contrast, when the flapper is made of a flexible material, a net fluid pumping is measured. We quantify the effectiveness of this pumping strategy and show that optimal pumping is achieved when the length of the <b>flapper</b> is <b>on</b> the same order as the elasto-hydrodynamic penetration length. We finally discuss the possible applications of flexible impellers in mixing operations at low Reynolds numbers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{analysis}} {{has been conducted}} on the hydraulic bridge of the water hydraulic servo valve with annular clearance between sleeve and spool land as its first hydraulic resistance. Through some formula deductions, the simplified hydraulic bridge is drawn {{and the relationship between}} flapper displacement and differential pressure of spool ends, which is demonstrated by the subsequent simulation works, is extracted. By the CFD(computational fluid dynamics) simulation, firstly, the pressure distributions of the flapper face and the fore end face of the nozzle are obtained. Results show that the flapper has an annular area where the existing pressure is negative. Secondly, the relationship between flapper displacement and flow force acting <b>on</b> <b>flapper</b> is also acquired, which is much beneficial to the steady-state and dynamic analysis of the water hydraulic servo valve...|$|R

5000|$|Flipper1 {{the dolphin}} is {{at war with}} his evil sister Flapper2. Flapper read about her namesakes from the 1920s on the Internet, and has since taken to wearing a dress and a wig. Flipper thinks it's stupid because clothes and hair just slow you down while swimming, but Flapper insists [...] "It's all the rage, the guys at the Sealand data center love it!" [...] To prove his point to the High Court of Bickering, Flipper must collect all the Wikipedia archive CDs he can (the discs were created by spoiled rich children, so they're all CD-RWs, making it {{easy for him to}} replace the article <b>on</b> <b>Flappers</b> with a simple {{redirect}} to Dolphin). Unfortunately, Flipper lost one of his namesake limbs to a freak motorboat accident off the coast of Bermuda a few years back (don't ask), so he has called upon you and your crew of software pirates to aid in his quest. (Oh, and if you find a burned copy of Iron Orca's [...] "Killer Whale," [...] Flipper wouldn't mind adding it to his collection, but don't mention that to the judge.) To make things a little more interesting, Flapper has also hired her own team of software pirates to recapture Wikipedia archive CDs from you (she intends to remove any references to lack of clothing and hair from the Dolphin article), and moreover seize Flipper's CD collection to prove that he is a music thief, with bad taste at that (Flipper begs to differ on the latter point).|$|R
5000|$|To many outsiders, Minnesota's winters {{appear to}} be cold and inhospitable. Even among Minnesotans, a common {{expression}} {{is that there are}} only two seasons, Winter and Road Construction. This is due to long winters that damage road surfaces, and short summers in which a frenzy of repair work causes severe congestion. [...] A World War II newscaster, in describing the brutally cold conditions of the Russian front, stated that at least Minnesotans could understand it. [...] A New York journalist visited St. Paul and declared that the city was [...] "another Siberia, unfit for human habitation." [...] In response, the city decided to build a huge ice palace in 1886, similar to one that Montreal had built in 1885. They hired the architects of the Canadian ice palace to design one for St. Paul, and built a palace 106 feet (32.3 m) high with ice blocks cut from a nearby lake. [...] This began the tradition of the Saint Paul Winter Carnival, which spawned a legend with a mythical king, [...] "King Boreas". Each winter, King Boreas declares a ten-day celebration with feasting, fun, and frolic, along with the [...] "Queen of the Snows" [...] and singer [...] "Klondike Kate". Ice sculptures are featured, and periodically ice palaces are built; one was the setting of St. Paul native F. Scott Fitzgerald's story The Ice Palace, published in <b>Flappers</b> and Philosophers. <b>On</b> the tenth day of the festival, [...] "Vulcanus Rex", the King of Fire, storms the castle with his Vulcan Krewe, compelling Boreas to relinquish winter's hold on the land until he returns again.|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} reevaluate the 1920 s icon of {{assertive}} female sexuality, the flapper, as {{represented in the}} novels of four women writers. Although cultural images often designate, by their very construction, normal and alteritous social categories, I argue that the flapper's presence and popularity encourage rather than restrict this autonomy for even those female populations she appears to reject, notably lower-class women, non-white women, and homosexuals. Specifically, the flapper was predicated upon the cultural practices and beliefs {{of many of the}} very groups she was designed to exclude, and therefore her presence attests to the reality of these women's experiences. Moreover, her emphasis on the liberating potential of sexual autonomy could not be contained within her strictly defined parameters in part because of her success in outlining this potential. Each chapter then focuses upon images of black and white female sexuality in the novels, chosen for their attention to female sexual autonomy within and beyond the flapper's boundaries as well as the author's exclusion from the flapper's parameters. Nella Larsen's Passing suggests that the fluidity of female sexual desire cannot be contained within strict dichotomies of race, class, or sexual orientation, and women can manipulate and perhaps even transcend such boundaries. Fannie Hurst's Imitation of Life offers a critique of the <b>flapper's</b> excessive emphasis <b>on</b> sexual desirability as defined by conspicuous consumption, maintaining that lower-class white and black women can and should have access to sexual autonomy, while Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston similarly questions the denigration of working-class and non-white women in this model with her affirming view of Janie Woods, but also complicates the cultural presumption that any woman can find autonomy within a heterosexual relationship if such relationships are still defined by conventional notions of gender power. Finally, Willa Cather's last novel, Sapphira and the Slave Girl, contends modern black and white women have the right to control their own sexual needs within an unusual antebellum setting. Thus, all of these novel provide other models of sexual autonomy besides the white, middle-class, heterosexual flapper while harnessing the flapper's affirming and popular imagery...|$|R
