50|$|The brand was {{launched}} by CircusTrix in 2014 {{with the opening}} of a trampoline park in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong park was announced in January 2014 and opened in July of that year. It was Asia's first indoor trampoline park {{at the time of its}} launch. In its first two weeks of operation, Ryze Hong Kong saw around 16,000 customers. Ryze's second park was announced in September 2014 and was to be located near Edinburgh, Scotland. The facility is housed in the Mayfield Industrial Estate in Dalkeith and was officially opened in January 2015. In its first three weeks of operation, Ryze Edinburgh saw over 25,000 patrons at its facility. At that time, however, the location was forced to close temporarily after a series of injuries sustained at the facility were reported to the Midlothian Council. It was also discovered that Ryze Edinburgh did not have the proper indoor sports entertainment license, although they applied for one soon after. Ryze maintained that the injuries sustained at the facility represented 0.39% of the total customer base, an accident figure generally considered better than the industry average. Ryze Edinburgh reopened in April 2015 after securing the proper license and instituting several council-mandated and voluntary reforms. Ryze opened its third park in Kinning Park, Glasgow in April 2015. It was initially supposed to open in February but was delayed after issues at the <b>Edinburgh</b> <b>facility.</b> Ryze Glasgow uses an old warehouse that underwent a ₤1-million renovation prior to its opening. In 2016, Ryze announced plans for another trampoline park in Dundee. CircusTrix is also exploring options for further Ryze locations in places like Seoul, Taipei, Manchester, London, Amsterdam, and Düsseldorf.|$|E

5000|$|In 1815 {{the first}} steamships began to ply between the British ports of Liverpool and Glasgow. In 1826 the United Kingdom, a {{leviathan}} steamship, {{as she was}} considered {{at the time of}} her construction, was built for the London and <b>Edinburgh</b> trade, steamship <b>facilities</b> in the coasting trade being naturally of much greater relative importance in the days before railways. In 1823 the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company was inaugurated, though it was not incorporated until ten years later. The year 1824 saw the incorporation of the General Steam Navigation Company, which was intended not only to provide services in British waters, but also to develop trade with the continent. The St George Steam Navigation Company and the British and Irish Steam Packet Company soon followed. The former was crushed in the keen competition which ensued, but it did a great work in the development of ocean travel. Isolated voyages by vessels fitted with steam engines had been made by the Savannah from the United States in 1819, and by the first Royal William from Canada in 1833, and the desirability of seriously attacking the problem of ocean navigation was apparent to shipping men in the three great British ports of London, Liverpool and Bristol.|$|R

40|$|GNRH {{significantly}} inhibits {{proliferation of}} {{a proportion of}} cancer cell lines by activating GNRH receptor (GNRHR) -G protein signaling. Therefore, manipulation of GNRHR signaling may have an under-utilized role in treating certain breast and ovarian cancers. However, the precise signaling pathways necessary for the effect and the features of cellular responses remain poorly defined. We used transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approaches to characterize the effects of GNRHR activation in sensitive cells (HEK 293 -GNRHR, SCL 60) in vitro and in vivo, compared to unresponsive HEK 293. Analyses of gene expression demonstrated a dynamic response to the GNRH superagonist Triptorelin. Early and midphase changes (0. 5 – 1. 0 h) comprised mainly transcription factors. Later changes (8 – 24 h) included a GNRH target gene, CGA, and up- or downregulation of transcripts encoding signaling and cell division machinery. Pathway analysis identified altered MAPK and cell cycle pathways, consistent with occurrence of G 2 /M arrest and apoptosis. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway gene transcripts were differentially expressed between control and Triptorelin-treated SCL 60 cultures. Reverse-phase protein and phospho-proteomic array analyses profiled responses in cultured cells and SCL 60 xenografts in vivo during Triptorelin anti-proliferation. Increased phosphorylated NF-kB (p 65) occurred in SCL 60 in vitro, and p-NF-kB and IkB 3 were higher in treated xenografts than controls after 4 days Triptorelin. NF-kB inhibition enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of Triptorelin in SCL 60 cultures. This study reveals details of pathways interacting with intense GNRHR signaling, identifies potential anti-proliferative target genes, and implicates the NF-kB survival pathway as a node for enhancing GNRH agonist-induced anti-proliferation.
