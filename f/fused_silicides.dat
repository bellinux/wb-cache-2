40|$|The {{eddy-current}} {{technique was}} applied to measuring the thickness of a <b>fused</b> <b>silicide</b> coating on a refractory alloy slab. Phase and magnitude of the test signal were measured at four places in 13 different samples, and thickness of coating was computed {{on the basis of}} each of these quantities. These results were then compared with those obtained by conventional metallographic methods. Phase-based measurements were most reliable, and the maximum error between the metallographically determined thickness and the thickness as determined by the least squares fit to the phase measurements was less than 0. 01 mm (about 1 %). Photomicrography of a typical sample shows that a large source of error resides in the fact that two regions - an outer rough region and an inner uniform region - of the coating layer exist rather than the single region upon which the calculations were based...|$|R
40|$|A coated {{columbium}} {{alloy material}} system 0. 04 centimeter thick was developed which provides for increased reliability to the load bearing {{character of the}} system {{in the event of}} physical damage to and loss of the exterior protective coating. The increased reliability to the load bearing columbium alloy (FS- 85) was achieved by interposing an oxidation resistant columbium alloy (B- 1) between the FS- 85 alloy and a <b>fused</b> slurry <b>silicide</b> coating. The B- 1 alloy was applied as a cladding to the FS- 85 and the composite was <b>fused</b> slurry <b>silicide</b> coated. Results of material evaluation testing included cyclic oxidation testing of specimens with intentional coating defects, tensile testing of several material combinations exposed to reentry profile conditions, and emittance testing after cycling of up to 100 simulated reentries. The clad material, which was shown to provide greater reliability than unclad materials, holds significant promise for use in the thermal protection system of hypersonic reentry vehicles...|$|R
40|$|Study of {{short-time}} high-temperature diffusion treatments {{as part of}} {{a program}} of development of methods of reapplying <b>fused</b> slurry <b>silicide</b> coating in the field. The metallographic structure and oxidation behavior of R 512 E applied to Cb- 752 coated under simulated field repair conditions was determined. Oxidation testing in reduced pressure environment has shown that performance equivalent to furnace-processed specimens can be obtained in a two-minute diffusion at 2700 F...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} for field repair of coated columbian panels were studied, and the probable {{cause of damage}} were identified. The following types of repair methods were developed, and are ready for use on an operational system: replacement of <b>fused</b> slurrey <b>silicide</b> coating by a short processing cycle using a focused radiant spot heater; repair of the coating by a glassy matrix ceramic composition which is painted or sprayed over the defective area; and repair of the protective coating by plasma spraying molybdenum disilicide over the damaged area employing portable equipment...|$|R
40|$|A <b>fused</b> slurry <b>silicide</b> coating was {{developed}} to provide atmospheric reentry protection for the 90 Ta-lOW alloy. Overlaying the silicide with a highly refractory glass greatly improved total lifetime and reliability of the coating system. Low pressure, slow cycle lifetimes in excess of 100 cycles were consistently recorded for 1700 K - 13 and 1300 N/sq m test conditions. A minimum of 25 cycles was obtained for 1810 K - 1300 N/sq m conditions. About 50 simulated reentry cycles (variable temperature, pressure, and stress) were endured by coated 1 -inch miniature heat shield panels when exposed {{to a maximum of}} 1700 K and either internal or external pressure conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{various aspects}} of field repair of {{columbium}} alloy panels with protective coatings designed {{as part of the}} Space Shuttle thermal protection system are examined. The field repair of the coatings is accomplished by employing ceramic cement repairs, and reapplying the <b>fused</b> slurry <b>silicide</b> coating. Techniques are described which improve the practicality of these repairs by employing torch heating. The repair coating quality is demonstrated by testing which simulates flight temperature, pressure, stress and acoustic vibration conditions as a function of time. Conclusions on the present status of field repair coatings are presented and recommendations are given for appropriate future activities relative to the use on an operational Space Shuttle system...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{recession}} and interstitial contamination at 0. 08 -centimeter-diameter through-hole intentional defects in <b>fused</b> slurry <b>silicide</b> coated FS- 85 and Cb- 752 columbium alloys were studied {{to determine the}} tolerance of these materials to coating defects. Five external pressure reentry simulation exposures to 1320 C and 4. 7 x 1, 000 N/sq m (maximum pressure) resulted in a consumed metal zone having about twice the initial defect diameter for both alloys with an interstitial contamination zone extending about three to four initial defect diameters. Self-healing occurred in the 1. 33 x 10 N/sq m, 1320 C exposures {{and to a lesser}} extent in internal pressure reentry cycles to 1320 C and 1. 33 x 100 N/sq m (maximum pressure) ...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of a program}} of research to develop a reliable, high performance, <b>fused</b> slurry <b>silicide</b> coating for the Ta- 10 W alloy. The effort was directed toward developing new and improved formulations for use at 2600 to 2800 F (1700 to 1811 K) in an atmospheric reentry thermal protection system with a 100 -mission capability. Based on a thorough characterization of isothermal and cyclic oxidation behavior, bend transition temperatures, room- and elevated-temperature tensile properties, and creep behavior, a 2. 5 Mn- 33 Ti- 64. 5 Si coating (designated MTS) provides excellent protection for the Ta- 10 W alloy in simulated reentry environments. An extensive analysis of the oxidation behavior and characteristics of the MTS coating in terms of fundamental mechanisms also is presented...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{reported}} {{of a research}} program to develop a reliable high-performance, <b>fused</b> slurry <b>silicide</b> protective coating for a tantalum- 10 tungsten alloy for use at 1427 to 1538 C at 0. 1 to 10 torr air pressure under cyclic temperature conditions. A review of silicide coating performance under these conditions indicated that the primary wear-out mode is associated with widening of hairline fissures in the coating. Consideration {{has been given to}} modifying the oxidation products that form on the coating surface to provide a seal for these fissures and to minimize their widening. On the basis of an analysis of the phase relationships between silica and various other oxides, a coating having the slurry composition 2. 5 Mn- 33 Ti- 64. 5 Si was developed that is effective in the pressure range from 1 to 10 torr...|$|R
40|$|The R- 512 E (Si- 20 Cr- 20 Fe) <b>fused</b> slurry <b>silicide</b> {{coating process}} was {{optimized}} to coat full size (20 in x 20 in) single face rib and corrugation stiffened panels fabricated from FS- 85 columbium alloy for 100 mission space shuttle heat shield applications. Structural life under simulated space shuttle lift-off stresses and reentry conditions demonstrated reuse capability well beyond 100 flights for R- 512 E coated FS- 85 columbium heat shield panels. Demonstrated coating damage tolerance showed no immediate structural failure on exposure. The FS- 85 columbium alloy was selected from five candidate alloys (Cb- 752, C- 129 Y, WC- 3015, B- 66 and FS- 85) {{based on the}} evaluation tests which have designed to determine: (1) change in material properties due to coating and reuse; (2) alloy tolerance to coating damage; (3) coating emittance characteristics under reuse conditions; and (4) new coating chemistries for improved coating life...|$|R
