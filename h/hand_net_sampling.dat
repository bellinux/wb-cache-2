40|$|Bottom {{sediment}} removal, {{a widely}} used technique in restoration management of standing water bodies, {{has a strong}} influence on communities of aquatic organisms. As most information {{on the impact of}} sediment removal on the aquatic environment comes from studies on lakes, the aim {{of this study was to}} describe macroinvertebrate assemblage succession in a fishpond (Štěpánek fishpond, Bohemian-Moravian highlands, Czech Republic) littoral zone following restoration by sediment removal during the winter of 2003 / 2004. Semi-quantitative <b>hand</b> <b>net</b> <b>sampling</b> was undertaken one year before (2003) and in each of the following five years (2004 – 2008) after sediment removal. A significant decrease in both abundance (approx. 90 % of individuals) and diversity (approx. 30 % of taxa) of macroinvertebrates was detected immediately after pond restoration. The values gradually increased over subsequent years, reaching comparable abundance and diversity three years after sediment removal. A significant shift was recorded in the taxonomic and functional composition of the macroinvertebrate assemblage after sediment removal. Mayfly larvae were the dominant invertebrates before restoration, while chironomid larvae and oligochaetes dominated after sediment removal. Phytophilous taxa, grazers and scrapers, and swimming or diving invertebrates were common in 2003, whilst open-water taxa preferring mud and other mostly inorganic microhabitats, gatherers/collectors, and burrowing/boring invertebrates were relatively common after sediment removal. In 2008, the assemblage reverted towards the situation before sediment removal, probably connected with a lower water level and accelerated macrophyte bed succession. Principal Component Analysis on the species data confirmed the differences in invertebrate taxonomic structure among sampling years. Succession of the fishpond invertebrate assemblage in the years following sediment removal was mainly influenced by fish farming practice and local conditions, i. e. the presence of macrophyte beds, mesohabitat changes following restoration, and the presence of other water bodies in the surroundings...|$|E

40|$|Background Bulinus truncatus is the {{intermediate}} host of Schistosoma haematobium, {{which is a}} causative agent of urinary schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease that has been given high priority {{by the world health}} organization. Although schistosomiasis was eradicated from Iran decades ago, Bulinus truncatus has been reported in some regions of Khuzestan. In addition, in recent years, cases of urinary schistosomiasis have been described in Iran’s neighboring country Iraq. It is therefore possible that the disease may reemerge in the Khuzestan region in the future. Objectives This study aimed to determine whether Bulinus truncatus is present in parts of Khuzestan province, Iran. Materials and Methods Using a <b>hand</b> <b>net,</b> <b>samples</b> were taken from irrigation canals in 27 locations in Khuzestan province during October 2015. The collected materials were placed in a plastic container. The samples were then washed on a mesh screen. The snails were separated and dried at room temperature. Identification was carried out according to the morphological characteristics of the shell. A descriptive data analysis was subsequently conducted. Results Bulinus truncatus was detected in seven locations. In addition, Melanoides tuberculata, which is also considered medically important, and Physa acuta were detected. The prevalence of Bulinus truncatus, Melanoides tuberculata, and Physa acuta was 6 %, 5. 5 %, and 88. 5 %, respectively.

No black rockfish were collected from our nearshore sampling sites in either 2004 or 2005, although this habitat is listed as common for juveniles of this species. Blue rockfish settlement was detected from April thru July in 2004, and from May thru June in 2005. Peak settlement timing was in June of both years. Settlement for black rockfish ranged from March thru July both years, with peak settlement timing occurring in mid-May. Yellowtail and widow rockfish juveniles were rarely encountered, with settlement occurring in April and July respectively. Abundance, as estimated from catch per unit effort (CPUE) calculations, varied among years and habitats. Black rockfish were more abundant in 2004 than in 2005. Some of the highest densities were found around pilings, docks and other anthropogenic structures: CPUE decreased within rock, eelgrass, and sand habitats respectively. Growth was not significantly different among habitats for either black or blue rockfish. Growth rate differences were not significant among years for either black or blue rockfish. However, growth differences were significant between species (black 0. 50 mm d- 1 and blue. 54 mm d- 1 (two sample-t test, T stat = - 3. 19, df = 133 P-value <. 002). Additionally, this thesis presents a tank validation experiment that investigated the validity of traps as a quantitative measure of habitat quality. This trap validation study showed that as habitat complexity increases, trap efficiency decreases. Trap attractiveness is an important source of bias when used for juvenile rockfish abundance estimation. This study demonstrates abundance estimates may be inflated in areas of low habitat complexity in the natural environment, or under-estimate the relative abundance of rockfishes within complex habitats. This study identifies estuaries as Essential Fish Habitat for black rockfish juveniles along the central Oregon coast, and nearshore reef as EFH for blue rockfish juveniles. Results of this study also provide specific information on spatial and temporal patterns of recruitment, habitat selection and growth, previously unknown for Oregon's nearshore Sebastes species...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 In {{the summers}} of 1998 and 1999, aquatic {{invertebrate}} and plant communities were sampled from nineteen springs in the Warner Basin of southeastern Oregon. Across the landscape, these springs exhibited {{a broad range}} in water temperature (5 - 24 °C), pH, conductivity, elevation, and gradient. Within a particular spring, water temperature and chemistry fluctuated little diurnally or annually providing a constant environment for aquatic organisms. Benthic <b>hand</b> <b>net</b> <b>samples,</b> emergence traps, and hand-picking methods were employed to determine the invertebrate composition of each spring. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) invertebrate ordination showed a strong temperature and chemical gradient. For example, invertebrate communities on Abert Rim and Hart Mountain were similar because water temperature, chemistries, and elevation were similar. On the second NMS ordination axis, communities responded to topographic gradients. Differences {{in the presence of}} specific taxa in Abert Rim and Hart Mountain springs were related to topographic separation of these sub-basins. For example, only Abert Rim springs contained nemourid stoneflies, Malenka sp., and limniphilid caddisflies, Pseudostenophylax edwarsii. Hart Mountain springs were distinctive in the presence of certain dytiscid beetle and chironomid taxa. TWINSPAN analysis confirmed differences in invertebrate composition in Abert Rim and Hart Mountain springs and identified variation in invertebrate communities within sub-basins. When riparian and emergent plant taxa and plant-type variables were overlaid on the NMS invertebrate ordination, neither were related to invertebrate composition. However, there was a significant correlation between invertebrate taxa and percent open area and percent vegetative cover. Open water may be an important habitat attribute for more active invertebrates such as Labiobaetis sp., a mayfly, and Rhyacophila sp., a free-swimming caddisfly that were correlated with open water and faster-flowing springs in this study. Dixa sp., a midge, was prevalent in marshy systems. Longitudinal patterns of invertebrate taxa richness showed an increase as distance from the spring source increased, and may be related to increased temperature fluctuations as groundwater influences decrease. These springs make a significant contribution to the invertebrate diversity of the Warner Basin; forty-three taxa were collected in this study that have not been found in Warner Basin streams...|$|R

40|$|Methods for {{sampling}} ecological assemblages {{strive to}} be efficient, repeatable, and representative. Unknowingly, common methods may be limited in terms of revealing species function and so of less value for comparative studies. The global decline in pollination services has stimulated surveys of flower-visiting invertebrates, using pan traps and <b>net</b> <b>sampling.</b> We explore {{the relative merits of}} these two methods in terms of species discovery, quantifying abundance, function, and composition, and responses of species to changing floral resources. Using a spatially-nested design we sampled across a 5000 km 2 area of arid grasslands, including 432 hours of <b>net</b> <b>sampling</b> and 1296 pan trap-days, between June 2010 and July 2011. <b>Net</b> <b>sampling</b> yielded 22 % more species and 30 % higher abundance than pan traps, and better reflected the spatio-temporal variation of floral resources. Species composition differed significantly between methods; from 436 total species, 25 % were sampled by both methods, 50 % only by nets, and the remaining 25 % only by pans. Apart from being less comprehensive, if pan traps do not sample flower-visitors, the link to pollination is questionable. By contrast, <b>net</b> <b>sampling</b> functionally linked species to pollination through behavioural observations of flower-visitation interaction frequency. Netted specimens are also necessary for evidence of pollen transport. Benefits of net-based sampling outweighed minor differences in overall sampling effort.
