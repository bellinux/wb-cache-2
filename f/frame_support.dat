25|$|A Slide Away Bed {{is a type}} of {{sofa bed}} that slides to the wall to form a sofa. The {{mattress}} is hinged to form a seating surface and back support. The bed <b>frame</b> <b>support</b> is a telescoping frame that allows the bed platform to recess below the seating cushion. The primitive version of the slide away bed was co-invented by Manning Lane, Warren J. Hauck and Roy O. Sweeney of Cincinnati, Ohio.

The CAB ruled out the weather conditions and the airworthiness of the two planes as factors in the collision. The report stated the probable cause was the high rate of near head-on closure, and that at high altitude, there were human and cockpit limitations involved. Analysis of the approach angles concluded that a metal <b>frame</b> <b>support</b> on the F-100's windscreen [...] "interfered seriously" [...] with detection of the DC-7, and a supporting pillar on the DC-7's windshield may have hindered sighting the fighter. [...] The CAB accident report also cited a failure of Nellis Air Force Base and the CAA to take measures to reduce a known collision exposure; training exercises were allowed to be conducted {{for more than a year}} prior to the collision within the confines of several airways, even after numerous near-misses with military jets had been reported by airline crews.|$|E

50|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two track carriers of aluminum alloy. Each track support {{consists of}} two end portions and two intermediate portions. It is not a scissors bridge, it is transported in its entire length. The storage beam is mounted between the two tracking beams, which is connected to a hydraulic ram. The laying of the bridge is {{carried out by the}} hydraulically operated bar with which the whole bridge is moved over the guide <b>frame</b> (<b>support</b> bar). For laying, the storage beam is first extended and placed with the tip on the ground (thus, no support shield is necessary). Then the bridge is moved along the storage beam. After laying down the bridge, the storage beam is detached and is retracted.|$|E

Named after the Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette, this new 4-2-0 engine was the B&O's first locomotive to feature a leading truck {{and may have been}} the first standardized production model locomotive in the entire world. Innovations included positioning of cylinders outside and adjacent to the smokebox with pistons connecting to the face of the drive wheels instead of a crank axle, the four-wheel swiveling pilot truck, inside bar <b>frame</b> <b>support,</b> and placement of the two drivers ahead of the firebox (this supposedly offered greater power output as more of the locomotive's weight rested on the drivers and therefore increased tractive effort). The Lafayette established the configuration that American steam locomotives would follow {{until the end of the}} steam era.|$|E

5000|$|The MAPED F1 is a claymore shaped plastic bodied {{directional}} {{anti-personnel mine}} {{which is designed}} to wound or kill by fragmentation. It has been the standard directional anti-personnel mine of the French army since the late 70s. The mine body is flat on the back and convex on the front, it has a small aiming sight on the top left corner and plastic lugs in the bottom corners for attaching a pair of [...] "A" [...] <b>frame</b> <b>support</b> legs. The mine contains a plastic explosive charge to propel 500 steel ball fragments to a range of 50 meters in a 60' arc. It is battery powered and is normally actuated by breakwire, but tripwire and command actuation is also possible. The mine is surface mounted and it can be located visually or with metal detectors under most field conditions. The MAPED F1 can be defeated by blast overpressure from explosive breaching systems like the Giant Viper and MICLIC unless it is set up for command actuation.|$|E

Further representative of this burden is Tiny Tim's crippled condition. That he is crippled evokes the financial issues that many poor families faced in 19th-century England. Although his spirit is robust, Tiny Tim's life expectancy is questionable. His crutch and iron <b>frame</b> <b>support</b> his frail body - 'bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame', but more support is needed for Tim {{if he is to}} survive, as pointed out by the Ghost of Christmas Present in stave III: [...] "I see a vacant seat in the poor chimney corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the future, the child will die." [...] These are a microcosm of the impoverished population: without support or charity, their family will be reduced.|$|E
5000|$|LocomotivesEdward Thompson had {{set down}} strict {{guidelines}} for the incoming CME, relating directly to the upcoming design of an Express Passenger Pacific. The design was to draw heavily on the A1/1 Pacific Great Northern which had been rebuilt during Thompson's time in office. This would have created a cross between the A2/3 Pacifics, and Great Northerns 6'8" [...] driving wheels. By the time Peppercorn was in office, reports of Great Northerns persistent frame problems, hot axleboxes and steam leaks were all filtering back into the design office. The belief was that the problems were caused {{by a lack of}} <b>frame</b> <b>support</b> at the front end, largely due to the cylinders not being aligned with each other (an aspect of divided drive combined with equal length connecting rods). Thompson's guidelines would have produced another locomotive with the cylinders apart, so Peppercorn decided against it, and brought the cylinders in line, and arranged the locomotive as something of a merging of both Gresley's A4 and Thompson's A2/1, creating first the A2 class, and then the A1.|$|E
