25|$|The invading {{nation is}} never {{specified}} in the books; in fact, no {{nation in the world}} meets the criteria laid out in the series, most likely by deliberate intent of the author. Likewise, no parts of the war outside Ellie's immediate perspective are covered; the reader is not informed exactly how much of the country is under enemy control, or how well the war is going for the Australian military. However the invaders are described in the series as a coalition of highly populous South Asian nations seeing the vast underdeveloped spaces of Australia as a way to tackle their overpopulation (Most likely Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines) and the series features multinational colonies of enemy civilians being set up in conquered territory. Its important <b>for</b> <b>context</b> to note that at time the series was written starting around 1990 and peaking in 1995, 2000 and 2013 there was ever increasing waves of economic migrants and asylum seekers or 'boat people' attempting to reach Australia from neighbouring pacific countries leading to the controversial creation of foreign detention centres known as the Pacific Solution.|$|E

At Northolt, the coldest temperature of the year 2016 was set on 30 November. Snow also fell rather widely across the UK on 28 & 29 October 2008, causing traffic problems where it settled on the M4.

The first frosts of the winter are usually recorded between October & December, but they are quite unusual in September except on high ground when the surrounding ocean is at or near its warmest. It is not particularly unusual for September to be warmer than June, as it was in 1999.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} a typed calculus <b>for</b> <b>contexts</b> i. e., lambda terms with “holes”. In addition to ordinary lambda terms, the calculus contains labeled holes, hole abstraction and <b>context</b> application <b>for</b> manipulating first-class <b>contexts.</b> The primary operation <b>for</b> <b>contexts</b> is hole-filling, which captures free variables. This operation conflicts with substitution of the lambda calculus, and a straightforward {{mixture of the}} two results in an inconsistent system. We solve this problem by defining a type system that precisely specifies the variable-capturing nature of contexts and that keeps track of bound variable renaming. These mechanisms enable us to define a reduction system that properly integrates β-reduction and hole-filling. The resulting calculus is Church–Rosser and the type system has the subject reduction property. We believe that the context calculus {{will serve as a}} basis for developing a programming language with advanced features that call for manipulation of open terms...|$|R

[...] "The dreams of flight, of fast private transportation, of instant communication across continents, and of helpful machines, all stress liberation from hard physical labour at work or drudgery at home." [...] But once technologies are accepted and standardized, they often enslave or displace their users. Franklin argues that work could be made less prescriptive in workplaces that are less rigidly hierarchical if we adopted more holistic practices based on the way women traditionally work in running households for example, or in caring for children.|$|E

He interpolated the arias not with recitatives, but with three stanzas from Luther's hymn for Advent, [...] "". This main hymn for the first Sunday in Advent had already opened his cantata for the same occasion in 1714, , and he had used it as the base for his chorale cantata , in 1724. The hymn stanzas [...] "serve to anchor the cantata to some extent in the Advent story, and to give it liturgical purpose and a clear focus". John Eliot Gardiner terms it [...] "structurally unusual". Bach divided the cantata in two parts to be performed {{before and after the}} sermon, closing part I with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn. <b>For</b> <b>context,</b> he replaced stanza 7, which had closed the whole cantata, by stanza 6, and closed part II by the final stanza of Luther's hymn.|$|E
