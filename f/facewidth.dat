As a consequence of our proof, we derive that every Eulerian triangulation of the Klein bottle with <b>facewidth</b> at least four is 5 -colorable. ...|$|E
40|$|We obtain {{asymptotic}} formulas for {{the number}} of rooted 2 -connected and 3 -connected surface maps on an orientable surface of genus g with respect to vertices and edges simultaneously. We also derive the bivariate version of the large <b>facewidth</b> result for random 3 -connected maps. These results are then used to derive asymptotic formulas {{for the number}} of labelled k-connected graphs of orientable genus g for k ≤ 3. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} modern surface {{hardening}} technology is obtaining reproducible, precisely planned {{parameters of the}} carburized layer, minimizing the negative phenomena that result in dimensional changes after hardening and {{making it possible to}} determine the nature and magnitude of these changes. This concerns mainly the concept of single-piece flow in heat treatment applied for the purposes of mass production, employing a special autonomous 4 D Quenching chamber for high pressure gas quenching (HPGQ). The main components of the 4 D Quenching chamber include a system of cooling nozzles surrounding the processed item and providing a uniform inflow of cooling gas from all directions (3 D) and a table rotating together with the item processed, contributing to uniform cooling (4 D). Within the framework of this paper there was studied the impact of gear wheel quenching in a 4 D Quenching chamber using nitrogen at pressure of 6 and 10 bar on changes in geometry. Geometric measurements of <b>facewidth</b> of gear, hole diameter and outside diameter were performed before and after carburization and quenching. The results obtained allowed us to determine the impact of quenching pressure inside a 4 D Quenching chamber on dimensional changes in gear wheels analyzed. The thermo-chemical treatment resulted in a decrease in outside diameters and hole diameters measured and an increase in <b>facewidth</b> of gears...|$|E
30|$|In this phase, {{the thrust}} face {{thickness}} data of 30 nominal consecutive readingsis collected and plotted {{on the process}} monitoring chart. This data collectionwas performed in four iterations. In each iteration, the data set of thrust <b>facewidth</b> measurement readings is taken and analyzed for Cp and Cpk values and followed by the suitable corrective action. Thecorrective action was decided based on the cause-and-effect diagram. After thecorrective action was implemented, the next iteration was performed. Thisprocedure was continued until the Cp and Cpk values are {{greater than or equal}} to 1.33, i.e., up to 4 σ quality level as decided by the management of the enginemanufacturing plant.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the transmissible power level of the plastic spur gears, a non-standard tooth is designed, with a variable geometry along the gear <b>facewidth.</b> The variation of the tooth flank geometry, generated by a simple kinematics, {{is a consequence of}} a specific cutting-tool geometry and position. Due to the gear tooth complex geometry, the traditional numerical modeling and analysis of the 3 D surfaces is replaced by the solid modeling technique. The non-standard gear generation process is simulated and the virtual gears are further used to investigate the gear basis formats and other criteria of gear quality.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{research}} into the effects of rim and web thickness on the stress distribution along a spur tooth <b>facewidth</b> in the root area. Under the assumption of machining errors and assembly misalignments absence, the contribution of certain gear structure to non-uniform stress distribution has been analysed. The investigation has been performed {{by means of the}} 3 D FEM and the developed model of pinion-wheel system. The chosen values of rim thickness cover the corresponding ones for thin rim, and the values of web thickness are in accordance with the recommendations in practice. Two different gear structures have been taken into consideration i. e. the cases of middle and offset web position...|$|E
40|$|Aa apex graph is a graph {{which has}} a vertex whose removal makes the {{resulting}} graph planar. Embeddings of apex graphs having <b>facewidth</b> three are characterized. Surprisingly, there are such embeddings of arbitrarily large genus. This solves a problem of Robertson and Vitray. We also give an elementary proof of a result of Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas [5] that any embedding of an apex graph in a nonorientable surface has face-width at most two. 1 Introduction We follow standard graph theory terminology as used, for example, in [1]. Let Π be a (2 -cell) embedding of a graph G into a nonplanar surface S, i. e. a closed surface distinct from the 2 -sphere. Then we define the face-width fw(Π) (also called the representativity) of the embedding Π as the smallest number of (closed) faces of G in S whose union contains a noncontractible curve. It {{is not difficult to}} see (cf. [6, 7]) that a planar graph embedded in a nonplanar surface has face-width at most two. Robertson and Vitra [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two parts. In the first part, we give a simple geometric description of the set mathcal G(5, 5, 8) of toroidal triangulations, all of whose vertices have degree six, except for two of degree five and one of degree eight. The motivation for studying such family is provided by Gr"unbaum coloring application described below. Each such triangulation is described by a cut-and-glue construction starting from an infinite triangular grid. In particular, we show {{that the members of}} mathcal G(5, 5, 8) are obtained from a toroidal 6 -regular graph (three parameters) by cutting out a special disk, described with two parameters, and "stitching" along the cut. To achieve that, we develop some techniques and define some invariants to study the cycles of toroidal triangulations. We also introduce some special triangulated disks called "blocks" and show how to detect their presence in a triangulation. Then, we show the existence of a special path that identifies the "cut". Also, the graphs in mathcal G(5, 5, 8) are classified into several families, based on the existence of some special cycles, containing a vertex of degree eight. Each family is, further, described by a schema for gluing together a few blocks. The second part regards coloring. A Gr"unbaum coloring of a graph G which triangulates a surface is a 3 -edge-coloring of G in which every face is incident to three edges of different colors. In 1968 Gr"unbaum conjectured a generalization of the Four Color Theorem: every simple triangulation of every orientable surface has a Gr"unbaum coloring. In 2008 Kochol discovered counterexamples to Gr"unbaum 2 ̆ 7 s conjecture on every orientable surface of genus at least five. Gr"unbaum 2 ̆ 7 s conjecture is still believed to be true for the torus. We verify "weak" Gr"unbaum conjecture for three families of triangulations in higher surfaces that, to our knowledge, are the only known families of triangulations with unbounded <b>facewidth</b> that are not 4 -colorable. Also, as an application of our description, we propose a method by which to verify the Gr"unbaum 2 ̆ 7 s conjecture for mathcal G(5, 5, 8) ...|$|E
