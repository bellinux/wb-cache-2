50|$|In other words, <b>double</b> <b>top</b> {{twins and}} <b>double</b> bottom twins are with-trend signals, when the {{underlying}} short time frame <b>double</b> <b>tops</b> or <b>double</b> bottoms (reversal signals) fail. The price action trader predicts that other traders {{trading on the}} shorter time scale will trade the simple <b>double</b> <b>top</b> or <b>double</b> bottom, and if the market moves against them, the price action trader will take a position against them, placing an entry stop order 1 tick above the top or below the bottom, {{with the aim of}} benefitting from the exacerbated market movement caused by those trapped traders bailing out.|$|R

50|$|When {{the market}} reaches an extreme {{price in the}} trader's view, it often pulls back from the price only to return to that price level again. In the {{situation}} where that price level holds and the market retreats again, the two reversals at that level are known as a <b>double</b> <b>top</b> bear flag or a double bottom bull flag, or simply <b>double</b> <b>top</b> / <b>double</b> bottom and indicate that the retrace will continue.|$|R

50|$|Consecutive bars with {{relatively}} large bodies, small tails {{and the same}} high price formed at the highest point of a chart are interpreted as <b>double</b> <b>top</b> twins. The opposite is so for double bottom twins. These patterns appear on as shorter time scale as a <b>double</b> <b>top</b> or a <b>double</b> bottom. Since signals on shorter time scales are per se quicker and therefore on average weaker, price action traders will take a position against the signal when it is seen to fail.|$|R

50|$|Paris {{invented a}} {{specialized}} mandolin which {{was named for}} him (Sistema Ginislao Paris) and built by the workshops of Luigi Embergher. The Paris Ginislao mandolins feature a <b>double</b> <b>top</b> (a second hollow space within the instrument, created by a false back between the soundboard and the instrument's back). The <b>double</b> <b>top</b> is a feature that mandolin makers are now experimenting with in the 21st century, to get better sound. Mandolinists such as Avi Avital and Joseph Brent use them, and they are custom instruments, today.|$|R

50|$|The <b>double</b> <b>top</b> pattern {{shows that}} demand is outpacing supply (buyers predominate) {{up to the}} first top, causing prices to rise. The supply-demand balance then reverses; supply outpaces demand (sellers predominate), causing prices to fall. After a price valley, buyers again predominate and prices rise. If traders see that prices are not pushing past their level at the first top, sellers may again prevail, {{lowering}} prices and causing a <b>double</b> <b>top</b> to form. It is generally regarded as a bearish signal if prices drop below the neck line.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} trading strategies {{that can be}} employed {{to take advantage of}} this formation. Of course, first and second peaks are perfect point to place sell orders. After the <b>double</b> <b>top</b> has been confirmed and if prices are moving up again with low volume, it is an opportune point to sell. One can sell short with a stop (calculated loss) above the highest peak of the <b>Double</b> <b>top.</b> The next opportune point to sell would be after a Triple top has formed and a fourth top is being formed at the lower level.|$|R

50|$|The {{formation}} of triple tops is rarer {{than that of}} <b>double</b> <b>tops</b> in the rising market trend. The volume is usually low during the second rally up and lesser during the {{formation of}} the third top. The peaks may not necessarily be spaced evenly like those which constitute a <b>Double</b> <b>top.</b> The intervening valleys may not bottom out at exactly the same level, i.e. either the first or second may be lower. The triple top is confirmed when the price decline from the third top falls below the bottom of the lowest valley between the three peaks.|$|R

50|$|The terms double-top, sandwich-top, and composite-top all {{refer to}} a {{relatively}} new way to construct the soundboard of a guitar, developed by Matthias Dammann in Germany in the late 1980s. Other luthiers such as Robert Ruck, Fritz Mueller, Jim Redgate, Michel Bruck, Boguslaw Teryks and Gernot Wagner have since adopted the method. A <b>double</b> <b>top</b> usually consists of a material called Nomex sandwiched by two thin sheets of tonewood. A flame resistant meta-aramid (a polymer used to make synthetic fiber) material, Nomex was originally designed by DuPont Chemical Co. in the 1960s as a lightweight material {{for use in the}} aviation industry. Luthiers use the honeycomb sheet (calendered paper) version of the product: the low mass, strength, and ease of shaping make it ideally suited for guitar soundboards. Though the construction of a <b>double</b> <b>top</b> significantly differs from the traditional soundboard, a <b>double</b> <b>top</b> guitar often looks just like a traditional guitar. A thin soundboard is often incorporated and used to obtain the most vibration and to allow for optimal sound.|$|R
50|$|The <b>double</b> <b>top</b> is {{a feature}} that luthiers are experimenting with in the 21st century, to get better sound. However, mandolinists and luthiers have been experimenting with them for {{at least since the}} early 1900s.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the rules}} that are {{associated}} with <b>double</b> <b>top</b> formation also apply to the double bottom pattern. Volume should show a marked increase on the rally up while prices are flat at the second bottom.|$|R

50|$|Mark Dudbridge {{would join}} Taylor in the quarter-finals {{but in a}} very {{different}} match compared to his 6-0 whitewash in the first round. - Kevin Painter would lead 2-0 after nicking the first leg.

Painter missed a bull of his own in the 7th leg on a 118 checkout that would have made the score 5-2 and really the game out of Dudbridge's reach. Dudbridge hit the <b>double</b> <b>top</b> to reduce his deficit to 4-3.|$|R
