5|$|Stephen Gardiner was refused {{access to}} Henry <b>during</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> months. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; {{the day before}} the king's death his vast estates were seized, making them {{available}} for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward's reign in the Tower of London. Other historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion was based on non-religious matters, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on the Council, and that the radicalism of such men as Sir Anthony Denny, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, is debatable.|$|E
