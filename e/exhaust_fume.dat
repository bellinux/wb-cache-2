25|$|Scientists are {{now turning}} to {{nanotechnology}} {{in an attempt}} to develop diesel engines with cleaner exhaust fumes. Platinum is currently used as the diesel engine catalyst in these engines. The catalyst is what cleans the <b>exhaust</b> <b>fume</b> particles. First a reduction catalyst is employed to take nitrogen atoms from NOx molecules in order to free oxygen. Next the oxidation catalyst oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and water. Platinum is used in both the reduction and the oxidation catalysts. Using platinum though, is inefficient in that it is expensive and unsustainable. Danish company InnovationsFonden invested DKK 15 million in a search for new catalyst substitutes using nanotechnology. The goal of the project, launched in the autumn of 2014, is to maximize surface area and minimize the amount of material required. Objects tend to minimize their surface energy; two drops of water, for example, will join to form one drop and decrease surface area. If the catalyst's surface area that is exposed to the exhaust fumes is maximized, efficiency of the catalyst is maximized. The team working on this project aims to create nanoparticles that will not merge. Every time the surface is optimized, material is saved. Thus, creating these nanoparticles will increase the effectiveness of the resulting diesel engine catalyst—in turn leading to cleaner exhaust fumes—and will decrease cost. If successful, the team hopes to reduce platinum use by 25%.|$|E

Thirty-two rats were grouped into eight groups of four rats each.

Groups 4 - 6 were fed on supplemented diet and exposed to <b>exhaust</b> <b>fumes</b> for time intervals of 5 min, 1 h and 2 h, respectively at a distance of 2. 5 m from the generator. Group 7 was positive control not exposed to <b>exhausted</b> <b>fumes</b> and fed on diet supplemented with natural products. Group 8 was positive control not exposed to <b>exhaust</b> <b>fumes</b> and not on supplement diet. Normal cellular architecture was observed in supplement positive control groups compared with non supplement positive control groups indicated that the integrity of tissues were not compromised following food supplementation. However, large deposit of dark spots were seen in lungs of non supplemented groups on 1 h and 2 h exposure groups, respectively. The lungs also showed significant decrease in the Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) level on exposure for 5 min, 1 hour and 2 h (p&ang 0. 05) compared with their respective control groups. It was also observed that the level of Malondialdehyde (MDA) increased significantly (p&ang 0. 05) in non supplement groups compared with their control groups. Combination of natural products significantly reversed the effect of <b>exhaust</b> <b>fumes</b> on the level of GST (p< 0. 05) and MDA level (p&ang 0. 05 compared with non supplement groups. Supplementation of diet with natural products had no adverse effect on the integrity of the tissues under examination as demonstrated by histochemical analysis.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} airflow motions and associated pollutant distributions in fume hoods. Currently, most <b>exhaust</b> <b>fume</b> hoods are designed to use an airflow induced by a fan at the top to remove pollutants. Ambient fluids are drawn, flowing toward the opening and subsequently turning to the outlet at the roof. Pollutants are supposedly captured by the airflow and brought out from the cupboard. The present numerical study based on the finite-volume method and the standard k–e turbulence model simulates flow patterns and pollutant distributions in an <b>exhaust</b> <b>fume</b> hood with and without a manikin present. Subsequently, a push–pull air curtain technique is applied to a fume cupboard. To investigate the capturing performance of a push–pull fume cupboard, numerical approaches are used to simulate flow and concentration variations. Numerical results reveal that four characteristic flow modes exist for a variety of speed ratios of push–pull flows and openings. A concave curtain mode which has a fast pull flow and a weak push flow is suggested for the operation of a push–pull fume cup-board. According to ANSI-ASHRAE Standard 110 - 1995, the local concentration at the speci-fied point is < 0. 1 parts per million (p. p. m.). Meanwhile, we also examine concentration variations at 12 selected points in front of the sash, and all where the concentration is < 0. 1 p. p. m. A manikin is put in front of the sash to observe its effect. As a result, the flow and the concentration contours in a push–pull fume cupboard are not affected by a manikin. In terms of those predicted results, it turns out that a push–pull fume cupboard successfully captures pollutants and prevents an operator from breathing pollutants...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was {{to respond to the}} global concern for the rise of the emissions and the necessity of preventing them to form rather than dealing with their after-effects. Therefore, the production levels of four main emissions, namely NOx, CO 2, CO and UHC in gasoline engine of Nissan Maxima 1994 is assessed via 1 -D simulation with the GT-Power code. Then, a proper matching of turbine-compressor is carried out to propose a turbocharger for the engine, and the resultant emissions are compared to the naturally aspirated engine. It is found that the emission levels of NOx, CO, and CO 2 are higher in terms of their concentration in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>fume</b> of the turbocharged engine, in comparison with the naturally aspirated engine. However, at the same time, the brake power and the brake specific emissions produced by the turbocharged engine are respectively higher and lower than those of the naturally aspirated engine. Therefore, it is concluded that, for a specific application, turbocharging provides the chance to achieve the performance of a potential naturally aspirated engine while producing lower emissions.

A study was carried out to investigate heavy metals distribution and effect on the soft tissues of Albino rats placed in close proximity to busy roads in Abeokuta. A total of 45 rats were randomly allotted to 3 groups of fifteen rats each. Two groups were placed in close proximity to busy roads while the third group (Control) was kept in Forestry Nursery of the University of Agriculture, Abeokuta Ogun State for 8 weeks respectively. The various organs were removed, digested by standard procedures and analyzed for heavy metals (Fe, Cr, Mn, Zn, Pd and Co) with Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. The result show a significantly higher concentration of heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Pd and Co) (p< 0. 05) in the lung, heart and liver tissues of the rats at busy roads compared to control. Histopathological examination of internal organs (heart, lung, kidney and liver) of rats at busy roads revealed histopathological damage as compared to the control.

Its natural dispersal across barriers may have been prevented but as man has turned able to rapidly travel all over the world organisms are brought to sites where they were never before observed. Adding the increasing global warming organisms may find it necessary to move around even further. This might cause major disturbance to the biological diversity, and hybridization and homogenization is one of many scenarios that could disturb the native diversity. In Sweden more that 2 / 3 of all alien plant species have been introduced to disturbed areas and the major introduction mechanism is gardening.

40|$|Background: The article {{presents}} the results of the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the fine particles fraction emitted from 3 types of diesel fuels using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography. Material and Methods: Samples of diesel Eco, Verwa and Bio exhaust combustion fumes were generated at the model station which consisted of a diesel engine from the 2007 Diesel TDI 2. 0. Personal Cascade Sioutas Impactor (PCSI) with Teflon filters was used to collect samples of <b>exhaust</b> <b>fume</b> ultrafine particles. PAHs adsorbed on particulate fractions were analyzed by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (UHPLC/FL). Results: Phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene and chrysene present the highest concentration in the particulate matter emitted by an engine. The total contents of fine particles collected during engine operation on fuels Eco, Verwa and Bio were 134. 2 μg/g, 183. 8 μg/g and 153. 4 μg/g, respectively, which makes 75 %, 90 % and 83 % of the total PAHs, respectively. The highest content of benzo(a) pyrene determined in particles emitted during the combustion of fuels Eco and Bio was 1. 5 μg/g and 1 μg/g, respectively. Conclusions: The study of the PAH concentration in the particles of fine fraction below 0. 25 μm emitted from different fuels designed for diesel engines indicate that the exhaust gas content of carcinogens, including PAHs deposited on particulates, is still significant, regardless of the fuel. Application of ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection for the analysis of PAHs in the particles emitted in the fine fraction of diesel exhaust allowed to shorten the analysis time from 35 min to 8 min.
