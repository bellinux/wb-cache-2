40|$|Early stage phyllosoma larvae of the spiny rock lobster Jasus edwardsii were {{examined}} for swimming speed, <b>feeding,</b> oxygen <b>consumption</b> and nitrogen excretion as instantaneous performance indicators {{when exposed to}} different irradiance levels. Swimming speed was measured in recently hatched Stage I larvae while all other parameters were measured in larvae from hatch to mid-Stage V. The swimming speed of recently hatched Stage I phyllosoma increased logarithmically between light intensities of 2. 9 x 1014 and 1. 8 x 1016 quanta s- 1 cm- 2 indicating that, within this range, swimming activity was only suppressed at the lowest irradiance level. Larvae examined under dark (no light) conditions showed lower <b>feed</b> intake, oxygen <b>consumption</b> and nitrogen excretion than larvae under low (7. 7 x 1012 q s- 1 cm- 2) and high (3. 9 x 1014 q s- 1 cm- 2) light intensities, {{and this was a}} consistent pattern observed throughout development from hatch to Stage V. There was no difference in <b>feeding,</b> oxygen <b>consumption</b> and nitrogen excretion between larvae exposed to low and high light intensities. However, from mid-Stage I to mid-Stage V, the metabolic feeding efficiency (<b>feed</b> intake:oxygen <b>consumption</b> ratio) was consistently higher in larvae exposed to low light intensity than in phyllosoma assessed in the dark and under high irradiance. A light intensity of about 7. 7 x 1012 quanta s- 1 cm- 2 and no higher than 3. 9 x 1014 quanta s- 1 cm- 2 is recommended to stimulate feeding and optimise metabolic feeding efficiency in early larval stages of J. edwardsii...|$|R

5000|$|Under current practice, normal parent poultry {{breeding}} stock potentially face welfare problems. Intensive selection for production traits, especially growth rate, {{is associated with}} increased nutritious requirement and thus <b>feed</b> <b>consumption,</b> but also reproductive dysfunctions and decreased sexual activity in broiler breeders. A first resulting serious welfare problem is the subsequent severe feed restriction which is applied during rearing, {{in order to prevent}} health problems and to reach better egg production. This severe feed restriction has negative effects on bird welfare as it causes chronic stress resulting from hunger. The use of normal fast growing broiler breeder hens require dedicated programmes of feed restriction, both to maximise egg and chick production and secondly to avoid metabolic disorders and mortality in broiler breeders. The negative correlation between muscle growth and reproduction effectiveness is known as the [...] "broiler breeder paradox". Using dwarf broiler breeder hens is a good alternative, because dwarf hens combine relatively good reproductive fitness with ad libitum feeding.|$|E
50|$|In 1983 Brumbaugh, Bargar and Oetting {{reported}} a third recessive allele at the C pigment locus, {{to which they}} assigned the symbol ca. This allele in homozygous individuals produces a kind of partial albinism. Concomitant electron microscope studies of both retinal and feather melanocytes showed that both mutant alleles c and ca are citochemically tyrosinase negative, possess hypertrophied Golgi systems and contain numerous vesicles {{that appear to be}} incompletely formed, unpigmented granules. Retinal melanocytes possess a few pigmented granules, more in recessive white (c) cells than in albino (ca) cells. At the ultra-structural level, small, spherical, poorly pigmented granules were seen in autosomal albino retinal melanocytes. This explains the gradual but slight darkening of the eyes as a bird matures. Both variants are citochemically tyrosinase negative. Late embryonic mortality is higher in ca/ca homozygous individuals. Albinos exhibit shorter down length, reflecting a general state of immaturity and retardation of neonatal development, higher incidence of subcutaneous haemorrhage and inflammation, increased incidence of yolk sac protrusion and slower growth rate and smaller body size than colored chickens. Mortality in albinos is also significantly higher, <b>feed</b> <b>consumption</b> and feed utilization is reduced.|$|E

The acute oral LD50 for Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix) is 31 mg a.i./kg bw with a NOAEL = 3.1 mg a.i./kg. The acute oral LD50 for house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is 41 mg a.i./kg bw with a NOAEL = 3 mg a.i./kg and a NOAEL = 6 mg a.i./kg. The LD50s for pigeon (Columba livia) and canary (Serinus canaria) are 25-50 mg a.i./kg.

According to the European Food Safety Authority, imidacloprid poses a potential high acute risk for herbivorous and insectivorous birds and granivorous mammals. Chronic risk has not been well established. The hypothesis that imidacloprid has a negative impact on insectivorous bird populations is supported by a study of bird population trends in the Netherlands, where correlation has been identified between surface-water concentrations of imidacloprid and population decline. At imidacloprid concentrations of more than 20 nanograms per litre, bird populations tended to decline by 3.5 per cent on average annually. Additional analyses in this study revealed that spatial pattern of bird population decline appeared only after the introduction of imidacloprid to the Netherlands, in the mid-1990s, and that this correlation is not linked to any other land usage factor.|$|E

Pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) is a native Amazonian fish species from the Osteoglossidae family and an obligated air breather. A short duration transport trial (6 h) was undertaken comparing closed polyethylene bags filled with atmospheric air (Air group) and bags filled with pure oxygen (Oxi group). Dissolved oxygen was the only water parameter that presented a difference between fish groups, and was saturated in the oxi group as expected. There was no mortality in either group after transport. Fish feeding was observed 36 h after transport for all fish, and normal <b>feeding</b> <b>consumption</b> was observed at 72 h. In both groups physiological responses were similar. Cortisol did not show any significant alteration during the sampled period.

40|$|Aquaculture in New Zealand is an {{important}} growing export industry and around 66 % of its total production is exported, which is worth NZ $ 400 million every year. Based on the growth strategy of this industry, {{the aim is to}} achieve an annual production of U. S $ 1 billion by 2025. In New Zealand, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, is a leading cultivated species with significant exports, along with King salmon and the New Zealand GreenshellTM mussel. Pacific oysters are native to Japan, but now are well established {{in many parts of the}} world including New Zealand. Most of the culturing for Pacific oyster in New Zealand is conducted using wild seed, the majority of which are gathered in the Kaipara Harbour on the north-western coast of the North Island. However, this source is highly unreliable, for example recent outbreaks of Ostreid herpesvirus- 1 (OsHV- 1) led to mass mortality of Pacific oyster larvae in 2010 leaving huge losses within this industry. To overcome these natural disasters and seasonal constraints, use of cryopreserved larvae has been suggested by many scientists. With this method of storing, larvae can be thawed to meet hatchery demands at any time. However, the degree of success using cryopreservation technique is highly variable due to lack of optimum protocols which are highly species specific. Furthermore, little is known about the freezing and cooling effects on the viability of larvae and their subsequent development. Previous studies have been focused on high survival rates just after post-thawing but recently the need to study the effect of cryopreservation on the larval quality over a longer time frame has been recognized. Before cryopreservation techniques can be applied to oyster larvae, a good understanding of the basic larval development process is necessary under normal conditions. There is lack of literature available on the detailed larval development under normal hatchery conditions for Pacific oysters. Therefore, the present study is the first to comprehensively describe the various stages of development from D-stage through to settlement of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas larvae under hatchery practices. To supplement this project, details of the effect of 2 cryoprotectant solutions (CPA) on the larval development from D-stage through to settlement is provided. To achieve the above aims, we used a multi-technique approach involving light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, immunochemistry and direct visual observations. The findings indicate that these complementary techniques provide the best approach to investigate the larval stages of Pacific oysters. Both cryopreserved and normal (controls) larvae were assessed for survivability, <b>feeding</b> <b>consumption,</b> shell length, shell morphology, organogenesis and neurogenesis at regular intervals. The methodology of this study included a larval rearing process conducted at Cawthron Aquaculture Park, Nelson. Larval samples were isolated and fixed every alternate day and later transported to Auckland University of Technology on dry ice for further analysis. Raw data for parametric analyses was also supplied by Cawthron Aquaculture Park. Normal larvae (controls) show a linear downfall in survivability with lowest percentage survivability after 19 dpf, when the pediveligers were approaching metamorphosis. <b>Feeding</b> <b>consumption</b> also varied over the total larval period under investigation and was considerably low after 20 dpf. Shell length show a linear increase before showing some constancy near metamorphosis. Shell morphological observations revealed the presence of a prodissoconch I shell at D-stage with flat hinge and a pitted punctuate region further developing prodissoconch II shell characterised by comarginal growth lines at 5 days post fertilisation (dpf). After progressing to umbo (7 - 15 days old) stage, larvae exhibited well developed umbo and a special feature called postero dorsal notch which is characteristic of the members of Family Ostreidae. Later the larvae developed into pediveligers at day 17 - 19 and finally secrete dissoconch layer during transition from larval period to spat. D-stage larvae exhibited limited organogenesis with development of alimentary canal. With progression of larval days, a protruding velum with well beating cilia and velum retractor muscles were present. Further development led to appearance to posterior and anterior adductor muscles. An important mantle rejection technique called pseudofeces was also observed. In pediveligers development of functional foot and eye spot occurred along with gill rudiment. During settlement, velum was retracted inside the shell indicating metamorphosis. The larval density during settlement period was quiet low because of accidental exposure to higher dose of UV than normal and secondly it indicates healthy competitive settlement behaviour. During cryopreservation study, larvae were exposed to 2 treatments 10 % ethylene glycol + 1 % polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP- 40) + either 0. 2 M or 0. 4 M trehalose. Three different cooling rates of 0. 5, 1, 2 ˚C min- 1 between - 10 and - 35 ºC post-holding were investigated. Results show that there were significant differences in survivability, shell length <b>feeding</b> <b>consumption</b> and organogenesis between controls and both the treatments. Comparison between the treatments (0. 2 M and 0. 4 M trehalose), revealed that larvae exposed to 0. 4 M especially with the cooling rate of 1 ˚C min- 1 performed exceptionally well. Whereas larvae exposed to 0. 2 M trehalose exhibit severe abnormalities with 100 % mortality by day 15. <b>Feeding</b> <b>consumption</b> was significantly lower than controls and shell size was considerably small. Shell was more or less oblong giving them oval appearance at early umbo stage rather than circular shape. Organogenesis was the worst effective with severe damage to digestive diverticulum and velum. Moreover, larvae at 5 - 7 days post fertilisation exhibit D-stage instead of progressing towards umbo stage. All the internal deformities were indicative of larval death near future. 0. 4 M cryopreservation treatment show somewhat satisfactory results at cooling rate of 1 ˚C min- 1, the survivability and <b>feeding</b> <b>consumption</b> were significantly lower than controls but the survived larvae (658 ± 570) show almost similar development but delayed organogenesis and smaller shell size. This delay of organogenesis and other developmental characteristics were indicative of cryoinjuries sustained at the cellular level. However, the degree of cryoinjury was worse in 0. 2 M exposed larvae. These results indicates future potential to cryopreserve Crassostrea gigas larvae using 0. 4 M trehalose as cryopreservative agent provided optimum cooling rate which can enhance larval survivability. Finally, documentation of larval development in normal as well as in cryopreserved larvae of Crassostrea gigas in this project increased our understanding of biology of Pacific oyster larvae and fills the existing gap bridging the cryopreservation studies on relevant species. This study is {{an important}} step to reduce the commercial hatchery cultivation cost for this species as it will be easier to distinguish healthy larvae from the abnormal ones...|$|R
40|$|The Anoa is {{potential}} to be developed as a meat-producing animal. Studies on its preference to certain feed types and form is essential as an initial effort to conserve and cultivate anoa as livestock using feed processing technology. This study was aimed to evaluate the anoa’s feed preference to feed physical form, which was processed through feed processing/preserving technology. Latin square design with 3 treatments, and 3 replications {{was used in this}} study. The treatments were three different feed form, i. e. fresh, hay and wafers. Three anoas used as replications. Eating behaviour (eating, rumination upon standing, lying and wallowing), total <b>feed</b> <b>consumptions,</b> total dung, protein and crude fibre content of feed were observed. The results showed that the anoa’s feed in the ex situ area could be prepared in the form of wafers with protein content, crude fibre and total digestible nutrient of 8. 11, 23. 11 and 72. 85 %, respectively. Total digestible nutrients of wafer-shaped feed was higher than fresh and dry feed (72. 85 vs 62. 25, 60. 88 %). It could be recommended that wafer feed could be applied in anoa ex situ conservation and cultivation.
