They {{interact with each}} other via the flows of utility, waste and material, hence creating a lot of options and economic trade-offs among them. To obtain the optimal solutions for the trade-offs, site-wide bottlenecks must be located accurately. Then the three systems could be debottlenecked and optimized simultaneously.

40|$|On {{the heels}} of steep {{refinery}} rationalisation in the Atlantic Basin, 2012 was a year of significant rebound for Europe’s ailing refining sector.

40|$|Ethylene {{pricing and}} profitabillty {{has been on}} a roller coaster for the past 5 years, and it appears that the near term {{scenario}} will not change. Overly ambitious capacity building which occurred in the late 1970 s, combined with industrial stagnation in the early 1980 s produced overcapacity, miserable profits and the industry shakeout which was experienced in the mid 1980 s. This was followed by a gradual but continuous increase in demand accompanied by no significant new capacity. The result was firm pricing, high capacity utilization, spot shortages and exceptionally good profitability between 1987 - 1989. These profits only encouraged producers to <b>debottleneck</b> existing capacity, and buyers to build ethylene inventory in the face of increasing prices. The net result this time was eroding margins {{during the second half of}} 1989, which have only temporarily been halted by bad weather and plant operating problems.

40|$|Many {{projects}} to rationalize and optimize {{the supply chain}} of complex corporates are ongoing in United States and Europe. The leitmotif is the high potential margins that may come from a high level optimization of decentralized productions and distribution networks, but also the need to raise the decision-making level from plantwide's purpose to the enterprise wide level. Actually, the global crisis of these last years is strongly pushing towards global optimization since the single production sites, although optimized, present relevant economic losses and the net operating margins are very small with respect to several years ago, especially in chemical and process industries. Thus, the corporate optimum, which almost never corresponds to the optimum of the single production sites, is a promising way to significantly improve the profits {{as well as to}} <b>debottleneck</b> inefficiencies highlighting and exploiting hidden potentialities.

The energy-saving methods proved to be applicable also to the real mill and the steam-saving potential was 3. 8 GJ/ADt or 30 %. Lignin extraction trials with bench scale equipment showed that lignin extraction was fully viable at the studied mill. A full-scale lignin separation plant according to the LignoBoost concept, combined with energy savings was simulated in a computer environment and compared to installation of a new recovery boiler.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the model based of an {{industrial}} low-density polyethylene (LDPE) tubular reactor. As the LDPE industry becomes more competitive, manufacturers {{have to come out}} with solutions to <b>debottleneck</b> the reactor output while abiding to the stringent product specification. In other words, {{they have to deal with}} maximization of the production (maximization of the monomer conversion for a given feed flow rate) and minimization of unwanted product (ethyl, butyl, vinyl and vinylidene groups), while maintaining the polymer product quality with regards to its molecular weight distribution (MWD). To achieve these goals, understanding the effects of operating variables manipulation as well as the dynamic behavior of tubular reactor is essential to develop high performance tubular reactor. In this study, the dynamic model of a tubular reactor for the production of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is simulated using MATLAB R 2015 a® in order to predict the temperature profile and monomer conversion percentage along the tubular reactor. The model consists of feed stream, reactor jacket, initiator injector and outlet stream. Several operating variables are involved, notably the feed flow rates, the inlet pressure and temperature with varying parameters to analyze the effect on the reactor productivity. Plots of reactor temperature profile and monomer conversion percentage are presented and from the result, it can be concluded that feed temperature gives significant impact as it effects monomer conversion rate...|$|R

This percentage usually increases in upgrade, revamp, or <b>debottleneck</b> project. For lump sum turnkey projects, the contractor?s main focus is in plant capital, installation, and commissioning costs, and the ?afterstartup? costs, such as power consumption, maintenance, or-stream time, spare parts consumption, etc., may not always receive equal consideration in equipment selection. Thus the end user may not be getting the best value {{over the life of}} the plant. Contractors, working in alliances with end users and mechanical equipment suppliers, can add long-term value by considering these and other evaluation parameters during the procurement process.

40|$|With {{survey data}} from the IGU and others {{continuing}} to demonstrate the continuing widespread adoption of hub pricing for European gas, and trading volumes growing strongly overall, this paper revisits the issue of hub price correlation. Following from her ground-breaking paper of October 2013 where {{for the first time}} in the public domain the analysis of OTC trading data revealed strong trends towards price convergence at the European gas trading hubs, Beatrice Petrovich in this paper extends the analysis with data to October 2013. Focussing on price and volatility correlations between Europe’s gas trading hubs, Beatrice identifies those whose trends, either temporarily or on a more sustained basis, are out of line with the ‘core group’ of North West continental hubs. Applying a forensic focus, the underlying causes of such anomalies are, where possible, identified. This involved extensive discussions with system operators, market participants and analysis of infrastructure flow data. The emerging picture is a positive one in terms of supporting the thesis that European gas hub prices respond to supply and demand forces. However as flow patterns across the European geography change, for example due to LNG being diverted away from Europe towards Asia and with the opening of North Stream, new ‘pinch points’ or bottlenecks emerge which can cause hub prices to de-link. Whether, in a European context, the appropriate incentives are in place to resolve such bottlenecks in a cost effective manner is beyond the scope of this paper. It may be worth reflecting however that despite being a liberalised gas market since the 1980 s, the US still has need to reconfigure and <b>debottleneck</b> its gas transmission system as its geographic loci of demand and supply continue to change and evolve. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cooling {{water systems}} are {{generally}} designed {{with a set}} of heat exchangers arranged in parallel. This arrangement results in higher cooling water flowrate and low cooling water return temperature thus reducing cooling tower efficiency. Previous research on cooling water systems has focused mainly on heat exchanger network thus excluding the interaction between heat exchanger network and the cooling towers. The studies completed on cooling water system in which the interaction between the cooling tower and the heat exchanger network was taken into consideration were limited to systems with single cooling tower. The main aim {{of this study was to}} develop a design methodology for synthesis and optimization of cooling water systems with multiple cooling towers. The design intends to <b>debottleneck</b> the cooling towers by reducing the circulating water flowrate. The study focuses mainly on cooling systems consisting of multiple cooling towers that supply a common set of heat exchangers. In this work the mathematical optimization technique was developed for optimization and synthesis of cooling water system. The heat exchanger network was synthesized using the mathematical optimization technique. This technique is based on superstructure in which all opportunities for cooling water reuse are explored. The cooling tower model was used to predict the thermal performance of the cooling towers while taking the thermal conditions of the associated heat exchanger network into account. The propose technique debotlleneck the cooling towers by decreasing the circulating water flowrate. This implies that a given set of cooling towers can manage an increased heat load. From the case studies, 22 % decrease in circulating water flowrate was realized. The blowdown and makeup were also decreased by 7 %. Furthermore, the cooling tower effectiveness was also improved by 4 %. A decrease in the overall circulation water has an added benefit of decreasing the overall power consumption of the circulating pumps. There is also a potential for the reduction of makeup and blowdown water flowrate. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Chemical Engineeringunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{exchanger}} network pinch {{sets the}} limitations of heat recovery for existing network topologies. Improving the heat recovery within a pinched-network is independent of the areas of individual exchangers present in the network, rather the topology of the network must be altered. Such {{a change in the}} topology can be very capital intensive and in many cases seems not easy to implement. This research aims to overcome the Network Pinch through proposing process operation changes, avoiding network topology alterations; hence, <b>debottlenecks</b> the heat-integrated systems towards further energy savings beyond the maximum heat recovery limitations. A new graphical representation is recently proposed to simulate existing preheat trains/networks with all energy equipment. The recent graphical representation is employed in this work to identify the pinching matches that limit heat recovery. Therefore, such graphs are key tools to identify potential process changes by which the Network Pinch is overcome. New graphs are constructed involving hot stream temperatures against cold stream temperatures. Existing exchangers are described by straight lines, with slopes related to flows of process streams and heat capacities. Exchanger matches touching the line where hot outlet stream temperature equals cold inlet stream temperature are pinching matches; this condition corresponds to absolute maximum heat recovery (ΔT = 0). Potential process changes within a distillation unit are identified to relax the Network Pinch and further heat recovery is maximised. The slope of such an exchanger match is decreased or the location of the pinching match is altered keeping the same slope. These changes are translated into process changes within the crude oil distillation unit. Accordingly, the process changes are determined based on which match is pinched besides its location within the network. An illustrative example shows that process changes overcome the Network Pinch and energy recovery is increased by 14 % beyond the maximum level achieved for the existing process conditions. Capital investments imposed are minor compared with substantial energy cost savings...|$|R
40|$|The {{release of}} sodium during the {{combustion}} of black liquor {{is a significant}} source of fume formation in a kraft recovery boiler, affecting efficiency in a pulp and paper mill. The fume is deposited on the surface of heat exchanger tubes in the upper furnace, causing fouling and corrosion, especially to the superheaters. This thesis reports on work done to develop improved understanding of fume formation. The mechanisms of sodium release during each stage of black liquor combustion are influenced by the surface temperature. The addition of boron to the black liquor, which <b>debottlenecks</b> the recausticizing plant by a reduction in lime usage, also influences the characteristics of black liquor combustion, such as combustion time and swelling. Previously, no effective measurement technique has been available to quantify sodium concentration in the plume of a burning black liquor droplet with or without boron, or to record the distribution of surface temperature through the time history of a burning droplet. This thesis reports on the adaptation of two techniques for the measurement of the release of atomic sodium and the temperature history, and their application to investigate several aspects of the release of atomic sodium during combustion of black liquor in a flat flame environment. The simultaneous employment of a planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique with an absorption technique has been adapted to allow quantitative measurement of the release of atomic sodium. The absorption technique has been employed to correct for both fluorescence trapping due to absorption and attenuation by high concentration of the atomic sodium in the plume, and for collisional quenching by the other major gas components present in the flat flame. An independent assessment was performed using kinetic calculations, based on measured total sodium that is residual in a particle obtained at different stages in the combustion process. These independent assessments were used to provide greater insight in to the release process and to cross-check. The influence of both the initial diameter of the droplet and addition of boron to the black liquor on the temporal release and the release rate of atomic sodium during the combustion have been performed using the present PLIF technique. The second technique, two-dimensional two-colour optical pyrometry, has been adapted to measure the distribution of surface temperature and the swelling (change in surface area) of a burning black liquor droplet. The influence of surface temperature or the change in the external surface area of the droplet on the release of atomic sodium during the combustion of black liquor has been assessed through concurrent use of both adapted techniques. The highest concentration of atomic sodium was measured in the final stage of combustion that of smelt coalescence, where it is an order of magnitude greater than in the other stages combined. While the extensive release of atomic sodium at high temperature in this final combustion stage occurs in only a relatively small percentage of droplets in a kraft recovery boiler, the effect could still be significant in fume formation. This is because the extensive release is expected to occur in the very small droplets, predominantly generated by splitting or physical ejection. Small droplets will have a very short combustion time and so could remain in suspension within hot gases for sufficient time for extensive release of sodium. These measurements outcomes can be used to support the future development of sub-models for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in order to better understand and optimise fume formation in a kraft recovery boiler.

Finally a recommendation will be made from the analyses and the data available. To simulate the plant the system first needs to be studied, including data on the throughput rates of equipment such as the mixers and packaging machines. Breakdowns and interruptions were determined and a detailed methodology for the data gathering is given. A Literature study was performed giving a brief overview and history on simulation. It also shows possible forms of practical application as wells as the advantages to be gained through simulation. Three weeks were spent gathering and analysing. The data gathered includes the mix times for each different type of batch, including the separate mixing steps’ times and the speed at which the KP (cartridge packaging machine) produces cartridges from this mix. Additional data gathered includes the breakdown times for each separate machine as well as additional mix times from the mix houses’ log books. The data was analysed and recommended mixing times were given and speeds for cartridges that was not measured was calculated by using the straight line method. With the data the bottlenecks in the system was determined and once the bottlenecks were determined the material handling speed of the plant was determined. It was found that the bottleneck depends on the mix type and the mixing time associated with this mix type as well as the product size of the product being produced. In general the KP is the bottleneck for all cartridges of 29 x 200 mm and smaller, but depending on mix types all cartridges of 29 mm diameter and smaller was found to be close to being the bottlenecks with a calculated time of 3 – 6 min/h idle time on the KP at most. For most cartridge sizes the bottleneck was found to be the mix time and the maximum speed that a plant can produce (for V 6 mix) was calculated to be 74 boxes per hour. The analysis of the breakdowns for December found that the average breakdown time for all the KP’s are 5. 22 min/h of the total operating time (less lunch times etc). The breakdown times were analysed and a statistic distribution was estimated using the Arena Input Analyser. An in depth analysis of the model is given with all the logic explained. The detailed steps for expanding the model is given and explained. Once the model was validated for a moth’s sales the different model setups were run. With the results available they are interpreted and analysed with a conclusion given. The recommendation to analyse the long term cost of replacing the existing KPs versus the cost of maintaining these KPs is given after simulation proved that mix time is the true bottleneck for most sizes and a faster KP will not improve the plant production rate.

In the case of liquefied natural gas (LNG), transcontinental demands always show steady increment. Since LNG is a source of clean energy and a feedstock to chemical productions, process <b>debottlenecking</b> of existing LNG plants offers economic benefits. In this research, the first objective was to perform process <b>debottlenecking</b> of a published flow sheet of a small scale LNG plant by using Aspen HYSYS. “Bottlenecks” or unit operations which reach bottlenecked conditions were identified by increasing the inlet flow rate. Simulation results showed that, LNG heat exchanger 2 was the single bottlenecked unit operations identified due to the occurrence of temperature cross. The bottlenecks removal was then performed by transferring duty of this active bottleneck to an additional cooler installed. Five different modifications were designed which installation of a cooler at different stream in the flow sheet and applied. Modification 5 showed the highest percentage of LNG production with 5298. 68 % increment from the existing plant. Production revenue for this modification is RM 2552098. 60 after takes into consideration the highest cost of its additional cooling duty which is RM 400000. 00. General economic benefits for this work need to be further analyzed so that the importance of process <b>debottlenecking</b> of LNG plant become more comprehensive...|$|E
