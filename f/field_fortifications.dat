5|$|About 28,000 pillboxes {{and other}} {{hardened}} <b>field</b> <b>fortifications</b> were {{constructed in the}} United Kingdom of which about 6,500 still survive.|$|E
5|$|The <b>field</b> <b>fortifications</b> {{constructed}} throughout Britain included {{large numbers}} of hardened field defences: mostly {{in the form of}} pillboxes.|$|E
5|$|Commonwealth's cavalry, {{including}} the Winged Hussars, significantly restricted Russian mobility, {{forcing them to}} stay in their trenches. In a series of fierce engagements, Commonwealth forces gradually overran the Russian <b>field</b> <b>fortifications,</b> and the siege reached its final stages by late September. On 28 September 1633, Commonwealth forces took the main Russian supply points, and by 4 October the siege had broken.|$|E

50|$|Fortification {{is usually}} {{divided into two}} branches: {{permanent}} <b>fortification</b> and <b>field</b> <b>fortification.</b> Permanent fortifications are erected at leisure, with all the resources that a state can supply of constructive and mechanical skill, and are built of enduring materials. Field fortifications—for example breastworks—and often known as fieldworks or earthworks, are extemporized by troops in the field, perhaps assisted by such local labour and tools as may be procurable and with materials {{that do not require}} much preparation, such as earth, brushwood and light timber, or sandbags (see sangar). An example of <b>field</b> <b>fortification</b> was the construction of Fort Necessity by George Washington in 1754.|$|R
25|$|Roman {{discipline}} (cf. decimation (Roman army)), {{organization and}} systematization sustained combat effectiveness {{over a longer}} period. These elements appear throughout the legion in training, logistics, <b>field</b> <b>fortification</b> etc.|$|R
5|$|When Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, {{it came to}} be seen as {{unlikely}} that there would be any attempted landing as long as that conflict was undecided — from the British point of view at the time, the matter hung in the balance. In July 1941, construction of <b>field</b> <b>fortifications</b> was greatly reduced and concentration given to the possibility of a raid in force rather than a full-scale invasion.|$|E
5|$|British anti-invasion {{preparations}} of the Second World War entailed {{a large-scale}} division {{of military and}} civilian mobilisation {{in response to the}} threat of invasion by German armed forces in 1940 and 1941. The British army needed to recover from the defeat of the British Expeditionary Force in France, and 1.5 million men were enrolled as part-time soldiers in the Home Guard. The rapid construction of <b>field</b> <b>fortifications</b> transformed much of the United Kingdom, especially southern England, into a prepared battlefield. The German invasion plan, Operation Sea Lion, was never taken beyond the preliminary assembly of forces. Today, little remains of Britain's anti-invasion preparations; only reinforced concrete structures such as pillboxes are commonly found.|$|E
5|$|Kościuszko's {{force was}} {{assigned}} to protect the front's southern flank, touching up to the Austrian border. At the Battle of Dubienka (July 18, 1792) Kościuszko repulsed a numerically superior enemy, skilfully using terrain obstacles and <b>field</b> <b>fortifications,</b> and came {{to be regarded as}} one of Poland's most brilliant military commanders of the age. With some 5,300 men, he defeated 25,000 Russians led by General Michail Kachovski. Despite the tactical victory, Kościuszko had to retreat from Dubienka, as the Russians crossed the nearby Austrian border and began flanking his positions.|$|E
50|$|Simple MRL types {{still have}} a {{reputation}} of having a devastating morale effect on ill-disciplined or already shaken troops. The material effect depends on circumstances, as well-covered <b>field</b> <b>fortification</b> provide much protection.|$|R
50|$|The Baggush Box was a British Army <b>field</b> <b>fortification</b> {{built in}} the Western Desert near Maaten Baggush, 35 mi east of Mersa Matruh during the Western Desert Campaign of World War II.|$|R
50|$|A defense line may {{be based}} on natural {{difficult}} terrain features, such as rivers or marshes, mountain ranges, or coastlines; temporary <b>field</b> <b>fortification</b> works such as trenches; and more permanent fortifications such as fortresses.|$|R
5|$|Luna, repenting for his blunder {{during the}} end of the first phase during Philippine Revolution, which ended at the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, then {{prepared}} himself for the second phase. Upon his release in December 1897, Luna studied <b>field</b> <b>fortifications,</b> guerrilla warfare, organization, and other aspects of military science under Gerard Leman, who would later be the commanding general of the fortress at Liège. He also read extensively about the discipline when he was at the Ateneo de Madrid. The second phase of the revolution began with the return of Emilio Aguinaldo to Cavite in 1898. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, he was given a letter of recommendation to Aguinaldo and a revolver by Felipe Agoncillo. He returned to the Philippines in July 1898.|$|E
5|$|The New Englanders {{saw that}} the only {{possible}} place to crack the defences was on the city's northeastern side, where the walls were weakest. Their plan was to land their main force on the Beauport shore east of the Saint Charles River, and have it cross the river in the fleet's boats, along with the field guns. When the landing force was on the heights west of Quebec, the fleet would attack the city and land a second force there. Frontenac had expected the land attack to come from Beauport, and {{the banks of the}} river had already been built up with <b>field</b> <b>fortifications</b> on the southwestern side. He proposed to fight only a skirmishing action there, holding his regulars in reserve for a European-style battle on the open ground west of Quebec.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of whether the defences would have been effective in invasion is vexed. In mid-1940, the preparations relied heavily upon <b>field</b> <b>fortifications.</b> The First World War made it clear that assaulting prepared defences with infantry was deadly and difficult, but similar preparations in Belgium had been overrun by well-equipped German Panzer divisions in the early weeks of 1940 and with so many armaments left at Dunkirk, British forces were woefully ill-equipped to take on German armour. On the other hand, while British preparations for defence were ad hoc, so were the German invasion plans: a fleet of 2,000 converted barges and other vessels had been hurriedly made available and their fitness was debatable; in any case, the Germans could not land troops with all their heavy equipment. Until the Germans captured a port, both armies would have been short of tanks and heavy guns.|$|E
50|$|The Norcon pillbox {{is a type}} of {{hardened}} <b>field</b> <b>fortification</b> {{built in}} Britain during the invasion crisis of 1940-1941. It was a small circular pillbox named after the company that manufactured it as a private commercial venture.|$|R
50|$|The sudis (plural sudes) is a Latin {{word meaning}} stake. It {{was the name}} given to stakes carried by Roman legionaries for {{employment}} as a <b>field</b> <b>fortification,</b> sometimes also called vallus. It is frequently, but incorrectly, called a pilum murale meaning 'wall spear'.|$|R
50|$|Instead <b>field</b> <b>fortification</b> rose to {{dominate}} defensive action. Unlike the trench warfare which dominated World War I, these defences were more temporary in nature. This was an advantage because {{since it was}} less extensive it formed a less obvious target for enemy force to be directed against.|$|R
5|$|To enter Northern Greece, the German {{army had}} to cross the Rhodope Mountains, which offered few river valleys or {{mountain}} passes capable of accommodating the movement of large military units. Two invasion courses were located west of Kyustendil; another was along the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border, via the Struma river valley to the south. Greek border fortifications had been adapted for the terrain and a formidable defence system covered the few available roads. The Struma and Nestos rivers cut across the mountain range along the Greek-Bulgarian frontier and both of their valleys were protected by strong fortifications, {{as part of the}} larger Metaxas Line. This system of concrete pillboxes and <b>field</b> <b>fortifications,</b> constructed along the Bulgarian border in the late 1930s, was built on principles {{similar to those of the}} Maginot Line. Its strength resided mainly in the inaccessibility of the intermediate terrain leading up to the defence positions.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarians entered Valjevo on 15 November, {{prompting}} wild public celebrations in Vienna. Franz Joseph praised Potiorek for {{seizing the}} town; {{cities across the}} empire made Potiorek an honorary citizen and Sarajevo even named a street after him. Valjevo's capture led the Austro-Hungarians {{to believe that they}} {{were on the verge of}} defeating Serbia and that the Serbian Army was no longer a coherent fighting force, but the scorched earth tactics employed by the Serbs during their withdrawal complicated the Austro-Hungarian advance. Although the Austro-Hungarians were right in assuming that the Serbian Army was exhausted, its defensive positions along the Kolubara had been prepared months in advance. Putnik's carefully timed withdrawals had ensured that the losses of the Serbian Army were lighter than if it had stood and fought pitched battles with the Austro-Hungarians. Moreover, the geography of northwestern Serbia favoured defensive operations since the approaches to the Kolubara did not offer any cover to armies invading from the direction of Austria-Hungary and the river itself was surrounded by mountainous terrain. In October, the Serbs had fortified the Jeljak and Maljen mountain ranges in anticipation of an Austro-Hungarian attack. This gave them an advantage over the Austro-Hungarians as it placed them in control of all roads leading to Kragujevac. The Serbs also established a series of <b>field</b> <b>fortifications</b> blocking the approach to Niš. The extensive series of fortifications and the difficulty of the terrain which they faced left the Austro-Hungarians with no choice but to conduct operations in the gruelling Serbian countryside with almost no lines of communication.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the engagement, the Polish-Lithuanian forces {{constructed}} additional <b>field</b> <b>fortifications,</b> {{and retreated}} behind them, {{to reduce the}} length of the walls they would have to defend; while retreating to the fourth line of defences on 30 July they defeated another enemy assault.|$|E
50|$|Barricade, {{from the}} French barrique (barrel), is any object or {{structure}} {{that creates a}} barrier or obstacle to control, block passage or force the flow of traffic in the desired direction. Adopted as a military term, a barricade denotes any improvised <b>field</b> <b>fortification,</b> such as on city streets during urban warfare.|$|R

50|$|An abatis, abattis, or abbattis is a <b>field</b> <b>fortification</b> {{consisting}} of an obstacle formed (in the modern era) {{of the branches}} of trees laid in a row, with the sharpened tops directed outwards, towards the enemy. The trees are usually interlaced or tied with wire. Abatis are used alone or in combination with wire entanglements and other obstacles.|$|R
25|$|Many of the Victorian fortifications exist, {{as do many}} German ones in a demilitarised form, {{having been}} {{stripped}} of metal in a scrap metal drive after World War II. Earthwork <b>field</b> <b>fortifications</b> and trenches have been filled in and a few concrete emplacements buried.|$|E
25|$|Grave was an {{important}} town on the Maas and had been captured in 1586 by Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma and from then was under Spanish control.

50|$|Redoubt No. 2, {{also known}} as Fort No Name, is a {{historic}} archaeological site located near Stafford, Stafford County, Virginia. The site was the central of the three, perhaps four, Federal defensive fortifications ordered constructed in early (February) 1863 during the American Civil War to protect the approaches to the Union supply depot at Aquia Creek Landing, Stafford, Virginia. Redoubt No.2 is an earthen <b>field</b> <b>fortification</b> that is nearly 95 feet square.|$|R
50|$|Among Pasley's works, {{besides the}} aforementioned, were {{separate}} editions of his Practical Geometry Method (1822) {{and of his}} Course of Elementary Fortification (1822), both of which formed part of his Military Instruction; Rules for Escalading Fortifications not having Palisaded Covered Ways (1822; new eds. 1845 and 1854); descriptions of a semaphore invented by himself in 1804 (1822 and 1823); A Simple Practical Treatise on <b>Field</b> <b>Fortification</b> (1823); and Exercise of the Newdecked Pontoons invented by Lieutenant-Colonel Pasley (1823).|$|R
25|$|Kościuszko, an {{experienced}} engineer {{who had only}} recently designed the fortifications of West Point in the United States, had to secure the Bug at about 50km of its length, on one end touching the Austrian border.

25|$|M-30 howitzers were {{primarily}} employed for indirect fire against enemy personnel. They {{were also used}} against <b>field</b> <b>fortifications,</b> for clearing minefields and for breaching barbed wire. Their HE-fragmentation shells presented a danger to armoured vehicles. Fragments created by the explosion could penetrate up to 20mm of armour, - enough against thinly armoured vehicles. The shells could also damage chassis, sights or other elements of heavier armoured vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The ceasefire {{would take}} {{hold on the}} next day, {{although}} the Cossacks would demand a ransom, {{at the same time}} selling the besieged some badly needed supplies; in the end a ransom of 40,000 talars was paid, the Cossack and Tatar <b>field</b> <b>fortifications</b> were mostly abandoned by the 23rd, and by the 25th the besieging army left the vicinity of Zbarazh. The Polish-Lithuanian army left on the evening of that day, reaching Tarnopol on the 28th.|$|E
5000|$|The art {{of setting}} out a {{military}} camp or constructing a fortification traditionally {{has been called}} [...] "castramentation" [...] {{since the time of}} the Roman legions. Fortification is usually divided into two branches: permanent <b>fortification</b> and <b>field</b> <b>fortification.</b> There is also an intermediate branch known as semi-permanent fortification. Castles are fortifications which are regarded as being distinct from the generic fort or fortress in that they are a residence of a monarch or noble and command a specific defensive territory.|$|R
2500|$|The Tett turret {{is a type}} of {{hardened}} <b>field</b> <b>fortification</b> {{built in}} Britain during the invasion crisis of 1940–1941. It was a small circular pillbox named after its inventor H.L. Tett and manufactured as a private commercial venture by Burbridge Builders Ltd of Surrey. It comprised a revolving concrete turret mounted on a ball race that allowed it to be turned easily. The turret was set above a pit; in early designs, the pit was formed by a standard section of concrete pipe [...] in diameter.|$|R
2500|$|A Pickett-Hamilton fort {{is a type}} of {{hardened}} <b>field</b> <b>fortification</b> {{built in}} Britain during the invasion crisis of 1940–1941.
