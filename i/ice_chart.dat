40|$|Ice mapping is {{important}} for numerous applications such as ship navigation and mining in the Arctic regions. The need for ice mapping is increasing to support operations in the Arctic regions. We propose an automatic SAR ice concentration estimation method using convolutional neu-ral network (CNN) followed by a stochastic fully connected random field (SFCRF). CNN can generate the proper fea-tures for robust ice concentration estimation. The low boundary accuracy of CNN is overcome by introducing SAR image structure information into the CNN output using SFCRF. This method uses ice charts as training data {{to take advantage of}} the abundant <b>ice</b> <b>chart</b> archives, which makes it appealing for operational ice mapping purposes.

Both methods yield the same result from one scale to the next, but subsequent scales develop diverging solutions when distributions are strongly non-Gaussian.

40|$|Spatial {{intensity}} variation {{introduced by}} illumination changes is a challenging problem for image segmentation and classification. Many techniques {{have been proposed}} which focus on removing this illumination variation by estimating or modelling it. There is limited research on developing an illumination invariant classification technique which does not use any preprocessing. A major focus {{of this research is}} on automatically classifying synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. These are large satellite images which pose many challenges for image classification including the incidence angle effect which is a strong illumination variation across the image. Mapping of full scene satellite images of sea-ice is important for navigational purposes for ships and also for climate research. The images obtained from the RADARSAT- 2 satellite are dual band, high quality images. Currently, sea <b>ice</b> <b>chart</b> are produced manually by ice analysts at the Canadian Ice Service. However, this process can be automated to reduce processing time and obtain more detailed pixel-level ice maps. An automated classification algorithm to achieve sea ice and open water separation will greatly help the ice analyst by providing sufficient guidance in the initial stages of creating an ice map. It would also help the analyst to improve the accuracy while finding ice concentrations and remove subjective bias. The existing Iterative Region Growing by Semantics (IRGS) algorithm is not effective for full scene segmentation because of the incidence angle effect. This research proposes a "glocal" (global as well as local) approach to solve this problem. The image is divided in a rectangular grid and each rectangle is segmented using IRGS. This is viewed as an over-segmentation of the original image. Finally, IRGS is used globally to glue together the over-segmented regions. This method yields acceptable results with the denoised images. The proposed technique can also be used for general image classification purposes. Extensive testing was done to investigate the best set of parameters for the proposed approach. Images were simulated with the SAR illumination variation and multiplicative speckle noise. The technique was effective for general classification and attained accurate results for full scene SAR segmentation...|$|E

In this experiment, an onboard VTR system is used to record sea ice conditions around SOYA while she sails in the pack ice region of the Okhotsk sea. This paper presents the measured sea ice data obtained from late January to early February 1994. A VTR camera is mounted at the mast in order to obtain images of ice conditions in the forward direction of SOYA. These are processed to obtain the sea ice compactness data. Another VTR camera is used to obtain information on ice and snow thickness distribution. The data are collected for 7 days and a data base system for Okhotsk sea ice, which consists of sea ice compactness, ice and snow thickness together with the measured position by the Global Positioning System at time intervals of one minute, is newly developed. The following results are obtained in this paper. Ice compactness data are compared with the values from ice charts which are mainly derived from remote sensing data by satellite (GMS, LANDSAT and NOAA) and distributed by the Maritime Safety Agency. It is found that the typical spatial variation of the order of 10 km, which is clearly shown by onboard observation, is not expressed by the <b>ice</b> <b>chart</b> although the averaged ice compactness shows relatively good agreement. The histograms of ice thickness data clearly have three peaks. The first peak is within 20 and 25 cm, which is mainly observed at the ice edge region with low ice compactness. The next peak is within 30 and 35 cm, which is thought to be a typical value of ice thickness near the coast of Hokkaido during this period. The last one is within 45 and 50 cm, which is observed prominently off the east coast of Sakhalin near lat. 47 °N. It is also found that the ice thickness increases with latitude at the rate of 4. 14 cm/degree. At present the only limited data are available for ice thickness. Therefore this data base is thought to be effective both for ground truth for microwave remote sensing data and for validation for simulation of the heat flux balance in the sea ice region...|$|E

The algorithm uses statistical and polarimetric properties of the backscattered radar signals to segment the SAR image into a specified number of classes. This number was determined in advance from visual inspection of the SAR image and by available in situ measurements. The segmentation result was then compared to <b>ice</b> <b>charts</b> drawn by <b>ice</b> service analysts. The comparison revealed big discrepancies between the charts of the analysts, and between the manual and the automatic segmentations. In the succeeding analysis, the automatic segmentation chart was labeled into ice types by sea ice experts, and the SAR features used in the segmentation were interpreted in terms of physical sea ice properties. Utilizing polarimetric information in sea <b>ice</b> <b>charting</b> will increase the efficiency and exactness of the maps. The number of classes used in the segmentation has shown to be of significant importance. Thus, studies of automatic and robust estimation {{of the number of}} ice classes in SAR sea ice scenes will be highly relevant for future work...|$|R
