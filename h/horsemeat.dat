5|$|Characteristics differ {{between various}} groups of Icelandic horses, {{depending}} on the focus of individual breeders. Some focus on animals for pack and draft work, which are conformationally distinct from those bred for work under saddle, which are carefully selected {{for their ability to}} perform the traditional Icelandic gaits. Others are bred solely for <b>horsemeat.</b> Some breeders focus on favored coat colors.|$|E
5|$|Stocks were {{increased}} by animals transferred from other zoos {{that had been}} forced to close. Initially the zoo was given favourable food rationing quotas, but certain foods became unavailable and the price of others increased dramatically. Bananas were impossible to obtain and the supply of fish was problematic. As a result, the keepers were forced to experiment. The sealions became casualties of the food shortage when their keepers attempted to feed them strips of beef soaked in cod liver oil. Although they seemed to thrive on this diet, their digestive systems were unable to cope with the unusual food, and they eventually died of stomach ulcers. The lions' new diet was green-coloured <b>horsemeat,</b> and the monkeys were fed on boiled potatoes. The birds-of-paradise (lack of millet), and the penguins (lack of fish), were unable to adapt to their make-do diet and also succumbed. Vegetables were not in short supply however, as the garden staff grew lettuce, cabbage and carrots in the kitchen gardens.|$|E

25|$|The {{probable}} date of c. 1400 BC {{ascribed to}} the giant chalk horse carved into the hillside turf at Uffington, in southern England, {{is too early to}} be directly associated with Epona a millennium and more later, but clearly represents a Bronze Age totem of some kind. The West Country traditional hobby-horse riders parading on May Day at Padstow, Cornwall and Minehead, Somerset, which survived to the mid-twentieth century, even though Morris dances had been forgotten, may have deep roots in the veneration of Epona, as may the British aversion to eating <b>horsemeat.</b> At Padstow formerly, {{at the end of the}} festivities the hobby-horse was ritually submerged in the sea.|$|E
25|$|Reinforced {{with the}} Fifth Cavalry, General Crook {{took to the}} field. Hooking up briefly with General Terry, he soon moved {{out on his own}} but did not find a large village. Running short on supplies, his column turned south and made what became called the <b>Horsemeat</b> March toward mining {{settlements}} to find food. On September 9, 1876, an advance company from his column en route to Deadwood to procure supplies stumbled across a small village at Slim Buttes, which they attacked and looted. Crazy Horse learned of the assault on the village and the next day led a counter-attack, which was repulsed. After reaching Camp Robinson, Crook's forces disbanded.|$|E
25|$|When Genghis Khan's {{grandson}} Kublai Khan (1215–1294) invaded Moscow, {{he and his}} warriors introduced minced <b>horsemeat</b> to the Muscovites. This {{was later}} called steak tartare. The city states {{of what is now}} Germany took to this ground meat product and created many of their own dishes by adding capers, onions and even caviar to the blend and selling it on the streets. It is not known when the first restaurant recipe for steak tartare appeared. While not providing a clear name, the first description of steak tartare was given by Jules Verne in 1875 in his novel Michael Strogoff. There are certain similarities between steak tartare and the German dishes Labskaus and Mett. Other similar raw, chopped meats appeared in the 20th century, such as the Italian carpaccio, which itself was invented in 1930 at Harry's Bar in Venice. Similarly, one of the oldest references to a Hamburgh Sausage appeared in 1763 in the cookbook entitled Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse (1708–1770). Hamburgh Sausage is made with minced meat and a variety of spices, including nutmeg, cloves, black pepper, garlic, and salt, and is typically served with toast. A wide variety of traditional European dishes are also made with minced meat, such as meatloaf, the Serbian pljeskavica, the Arab kofta, and meatballs.|$|E
500|$|The highest {{price paid}} at auction for a Thoroughbred {{was set in}} 2006 at $16,000,000 for a two-year-old colt named The Green Monkey. [...] Record prices at auction often grab headlines, though they do not {{necessarily}} reflect the animal's future success; in the case of The Green Monkey, injuries limited him to only three career starts before being retired to stud in 2008, and he never won a race. Conversely, even a highly successful Thoroughbred may be sold by the pound for a few hundred dollars to become <b>horsemeat.</b> The best-known example of this was the 1986 Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand, exported to Japan to stand at stud, but was ultimately slaughtered in 2002, presumably for pet food.|$|E
500|$|During the 17th century, {{the smaller}} Mareyeuse type {{was used for}} {{transporting}} fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris, a distance of almost 200 miles, in under 18 hours. [...] This journey is remembered annually in the Route du Poisson race. Only mares pulled small carts full of ice and fish on the relay-style trip. By 1884, the Boulonnais was called the [...] "largest and most valuable {{of that kind of}} horse in France". At that time, they were used to move heavy blocks of building stone in Paris, with six to eight horses drawing blocks of several tons. During the 20th century, the larger Boulonnais type was utilized by the French army, and highly regarded for its ability to pull artillery and supply wagons. Falling demand for the breed means that today it is bred mainly for <b>horsemeat.</b> In 2010, 60 percent of Boulonnais horses bred in France were intended for slaughter, and 80 percent of these were exported, mainly to Italy, to be fattened before being sent to slaughterhouses. However, the sector is in crisis due to falling prices, controversy and the importation of cheap meat; despite a resurgence following the Mad Cow scares of the 1990s, the consumption of horse meat has fallen sharply, although the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region remains the largest consumer of horse meat in France.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, without careful thought, foals bred without a {{potential}} market for them {{may wind up}} being sold at a loss, and in a worst-case scenario, sold for [...] "salvage" [...] value—a euphemism for sale to slaughter as <b>horsemeat.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Crook {{soon began}} running short {{of food and}} {{supplies}} and ordered his men to go on half rations. Many {{of the men were}} forced to subsist on <b>horsemeat</b> and was thereafter known as [...] "General Crook’s <b>Horsemeat</b> March." [...] Without grain and adequate forage, horses and mules had weakened and many collapsed in the steady rain and mud. [...] Crook had already given orders to shoot abandoned animals for food, and for several days his saddened, ragtag army would exist on a diet of mule and <b>horsemeat.</b> [...] "The horses commenced to play out. [...] As fast as the poor brutes fell the quartermaster had them killed and issued as rations, so the soldiers had nothing but played-out horses to eat from there on into the Hills. [...] It looked funny to see a soldier ride his horse until it dropped exhausted, and then get off and shoot it and cut up its carcass up and issue meat to the soldiers of different companies. [...] Gen. Crook would not take any advantage of his command. [...] If they starved, he starved with them." [...] But the soldiers were nearing total exhaustion; wet, hungry, disheartened by constant hardships. [...] One officer wrote that he saw: [...] "men who were very plucky sit down and cry like children because the could not hold out." [...] Years later, Colonel Andrew S. Burt reminisced with Crawford about the hardships they had shared on this grueling march: hunger, marching in the rain, sleeping on wet, muddy ground, eating horse meat. [...] He vividly recalled Jack squatting on the ground before a campfire, [...] "gnawing at a horse’s rib flesh from the coals and glad to get the rib." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{some parts}} of Asia and the Middle East, the riding of stallions is widespread, {{especially}} among male riders. [...] The gelding of stallions is unusual, viewed culturally as either unnecessary or unnatural. In areas where gelding is not widely practised, stallions are still not needed in numbers as great as mares, and so many will be culled, either sold for <b>horsemeat</b> or simply sold to traders who will take them outside the area. [...] Of those that remain, many will {{not be used for}} breeding purposes.|$|E
2500|$|During the Great Sioux War of 1876 Crawford was {{civilian}} scout {{with the}} 5th Cavalry Regiment and war {{correspondent for the}} Omaha Bee with General George Crook’s Yellowstone and Big Horn Expedition. Captain Jack is credited with carrying dispatches on a highly perilous route of 400 miles alone to Fort Fetterman, and he {{took part in the}} <b>Horsemeat</b> March of 1876, one of the most grueling marches in American military history. Crawford {{played a significant role in}} the Battle of Slim Buttes (1876) and made a daring ride of more than three hundred miles in six days to carry dispatches of the victory to Fort Laramie for the New York Herald. One of his most famous exploits included delivering a bottle of whiskey to Buffalo Bill Cody, while on campaign. Cody wrote of the incident in An Autobiography of Buffalo Bill: ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 24, Strahorn sought {{adventure}} and fame in the Great Sioux War of 1876 as a war correspondent for the New York Times, Chicago Tribune and the Rocky Mountain News. Strahorn was embedded with General George Crook’s Big Horn and Yellowstone Expedition {{for over a year}} and reported the people and events of the Great Sioux War to the public. [...] “I insisted that I was going in to fight. It was my business as a correspondent to get the news, and I couldn’t think of getting it from the rear.” At the time, war correspondents rode into battle with the troops. [...] General Cook said, “Strahorn worked as well with his rifle as with his pen.” [...] Strahorn was commended by Secretary of War for distinguished bravery and gallantry in action against hostile Indians during the Great Sioux War. Strahorn fought and reported the <b>Horsemeat</b> March, Battle of Powder River, Battle of the Rosebud, Battle of Slim Buttes, Dull Knife Fight and Battle of Wolf Mountain. [...] Strahorn also reported the Battle of the Little Big Horn and witnessed the surrender of Crazy Horse at Fort Robinson on May 6, 1877.|$|E
2500|$|General George S. Patton, {{commander}} of the U.S. 3rd Army, was a lifelong horseman who competed in Modern Pentathlon at the 1912 Olympic Games. He had been tipped off by Alois Podhajsky of the Spanish Riding School {{that a significant number}} of Lipizzans and Thoroughbreds, as well as Arabian horses were at Hostau. When Hostau fell behind Soviet lines, captured German officers, under interrogation by U.S. Army Captain Ferdinand Sperl, reported the location of the stud farm and asked the Americans to rescue the horses before they fell into Soviet hands, because it was feared they would be slaughtered for <b>horsemeat.</b> Patton issued orders, and on April 28, 1945, Colonel Charles H. Reed, Sperl's superior officer, with members of Troops A, C and F of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, conducted a raid behind Soviet lines and accepted the surrender of the Germans at Hostau. Reed later said that the surrender was [...] "more a fiesta than a military operation, as the German troops drew up an honor guard and saluted the American troops as they came in." [...] Being one of the relatively few horses at Hostau who was broke to ride, Witez II carried a rider throughout the evacuation and came through sound.|$|E
2500|$|Promptly upon {{taking the}} village, Captain Mills sent two bareback riders to tell General Crook {{that he had}} a village and was trying to hold and needed assistance. When Crook {{received}} word from Mills’s three messengers he could scarcely contain his anger at Mills. Crook was primarily interested in feeding his men and ordered Mills to avoid a fight should he encounter a large village, and instead, [...] "cut around it" [...] and go into the Black Hills to get supplies. [...] Crook also told Mills that he expected to bivouac his exhasted men and therefore Mills could not expect any immediate support. [...] Crook’s Officers debated the propriety of Mills’s attack on a hostile village of uncertain size, a controversy intensified by Custer’s defeat under like circumstances. The question was especially provocative since Mills had opened the engagement with a small supply of ammunition. Strahorn reported, [...] "Crook was very much disappointed because Mills didn’t report his discovery last night, and there was plenty of time to have got the entire command there and so effectively surrounded the village that nothing would have escaped. [...] But the General is also pleased, all things considered." [...] Staff officers in telling the receipt of this news said Crook pushed the cavalry on with all possible haste, the infantry to follow more leisurely. [...] But the tidings reaching Crook so electrified the immortal infantry that they forgot all about hunger, cold, wet and fatigue. [...] Fortunately for Mills, Crook’s column was not far behind. Crook assembled a relief contingent of about 250 men and 17 officers, plus surgeons Bennett A. Clements and Valentine T. Mcgillycuddy. [...] John Frederick Finerty, war correspondent for the Chicago Times, joined the advance column. Despite the hardships of the <b>Horsemeat</b> March, the troopers were excited by the prospects of a battle.|$|E
