25|$|Nintendo {{designed}} the 64DD as an <b>enabling</b> <b>technology</b> {{for the development}} of new genres of games, which was principally accomplished by its three main design features: its dual storage strategy of cartridges and disks; its new real-time clock (RTC); and its Internet connectivity. The dual storage strategy of the Nintendo 64 plus the 64DD combines the traditional high speed cartridges, which are low-capacity, non-writable, and expensive but very fast along with the introduction of proprietary mass storage disks, which are large-capacity, rewritable, and cheap but only moderately fast.|$|E
25|$|Knowledge {{representation}} and reasoning {{are a key}} <b>enabling</b> <b>technology</b> for the Semantic web. Languages based on the Frame model with automatic classification provide a layer of semantics {{on top of the}} existing Internet. Rather than searching via text strings as is typical today {{it will be possible to}} define logical queries and find pages that map to those queries. The automated reasoning component in these systems is an engine known as the classifier. Classifiers focus on the subsumption relations in a knowledge base rather than rules. A classifier can infer new classes and dynamically change the ontology as new information becomes available. This capability is ideal for the ever changing and evolving information space of the Internet.|$|E

2500|$|A key <b>enabling</b> <b>technology</b> of LIGA is the synchrotron, {{capable of}} {{emitting}} high-power, highly collimated X-rays. This high collimation permits relatively large distances between the mask and the substrate without the penumbral blurring that occurs from other X-ray sources. [...] In the electron storage ring or synchrotron, {{a magnetic field}} constrains electrons to follow a circular path and the radial acceleration of the electrons causes electromagnetic radiation to be emitted forward. [...] The radiation is thus strongly collimated in the forward direction and can be assumed to be parallel for lithographic purposes. [...] Because of the much higher flux of usable collimated X-rays, shorter exposure times become possible. [...] Photon energies for a LIGA exposure are approximately distributed between 2.5 and [...]|$|E

[...] The new test surface was designed to provide large extents of laminar flow and be shaped so boundary layer instabilities grow relatively slowly and smoothly. These characteristics should facilitate good boundary layer imaging of the roughness and step-height experiments performed in next phase. The experiments were intended to influence future laminar flow airfoil manufacturing standards for surface quality and assembly tolerances.|$|E

2500|$|Governments' {{grant of}} limited {{monopolies}} to inventors under a developing patent system (the Statute of Monopolies in 1623) {{is considered an}} influential factor. The effects of patents, both good and ill, {{on the development of}} industrialisation are clearly illustrated {{in the history of the}} steam engine, the key <b>enabling</b> <b>technology.</b> In return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as James Watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines, thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development. However, monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance, or even overbalance, the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors. Watt's monopoly prevented other inventors, such as Richard Trevithick, William Murdoch, [...] or Jonathan Hornblower, whom Boulton and Watt sued, from introducing improved steam engines, thereby retarding the spread of steam power.|$|E
