5|$|Busoni gave many (but not all) of {{his works}} opus numbers; some numbers apply {{to more than one}} work (after the {{composer}} dropped some of his earlier works from his acknowledged corpus). Nor are the composer's numbers all in temporal order. The musicologist Jürgen Kindermann <b>has</b> <b>prepared</b> a thematic catalogue {{of his works}} and transcriptions which is also used, {{in the form of the}} letters BV (for Busoni Verzeichnis, German:Busoni Index: sometimes the letters KiV for Kindermann Verzeichnis are used) followed by an identifier, to identify his compositions and transcriptions. The identifier B (for Bearbeitung, German: arrangement) is used for Busoni's transcriptions and cadenzas– e.g. BV B 1 refers to Busoni's cadenzas for Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4.|$|E

5|$|Globally, {{there were}} 87 million {{unwanted}} pregnancies in 2005, of those 46 million resorted to abortion, of which 18 million were considered unsafe, resulting in 68,000 deaths. The {{majority of these}} deaths occurred in the developing world. The United Nations considers these avoidable with access to safe abortion and post-abortion care. While abortion rates have fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010–2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44, a total of 56 million abortions per year. The United nations <b>has</b> <b>prepared</b> recommendations for health care workers to provide more accessible and safe abortion and post-abortion care. An inherent part of post-abortion care involves provision of adequate contraception.|$|E

His play Romeo and Juliet Intensive was nominated for a 2011 AWGIE Award.|$|E
5|$|Walter (John Noble) <b>has</b> <b>prepared</b> {{himself to}} reveal to Peter (Joshua Jackson) the truththat {{he is from}} the {{parallel}} universewhen they are called to a case. Two teenagers were found dead, evidently killed by shapeshifter agents from the parallel universe. Exploring the nearby area, they find a third unformed shapeshifter which Walter takes to the lab to study. At the same time of the teenagers' death, they find a carrier signal in the local television. With biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic's help, they determine that the signal emanated from the parallel universe during a brief moment that the two universes were in sync, and that the next point of synchronization would occur the next afternoon. Recalling Thomas Jerome Newton's (Sebastian Roché) previous attempt to bring a building from the parallel universe into the prime, the Fringe team believes they must stop this next attempt.|$|E

25|$|The Media Awareness Network of Canada (MNet) <b>has</b> <b>prepared</b> {{a number}} of {{statements}} about the portrayals of American Indians, First Nations of Canada and Alaskan Natives in the media. Westerns and documentaries have tended to portray Natives in stereotypical terms: the wise elder, the aggressive drunk, the Indian princess, the loyal sidekick, obese and impoverished. These images have become known across North America. Stereotyped issues include simplistic characterizations, romanticizing of Native culture and stereotyping by omission—showing American Indians in a historical rather than modern context.|$|E
25|$|The bird skin {{collection}} contains approximately 20,500 specimens representing at least 2,300 species. These are mostly study skins, {{but in recent}} years the division <b>has</b> <b>prepared</b> a large proportion of new specimens as flat skins or spread wings with associated skeletons. In 1992, the division also received a collection of approximately 3,000 skins. The skin collection has grown by 23% in the last five years. Also wide-ranging taxonomically, it represents 27 orders, 129 families, and 850 genera. Rarities include skins of ivory-billed woodpeckers and extinct dusky seaside sparrows, passenger pigeons, and Carolina parakeets.|$|E

25|$|Legal writing values precedent, as {{distinct}} from authority. Precedent means the way things have been done before. For example, a lawyer who must prepare a contract and who <b>has</b> <b>prepared</b> a similar contract before will often re-use, with limited changes, the old contract for the new occasion. Or a lawyer who has filed a successful motion to dismiss a lawsuit may use the same or a very similar form of motion again in another case, and so on. Many lawyers use and re-use written documents in this way and call these re-usable documents templates or, less commonly, forms.|$|E
