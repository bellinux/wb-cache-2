40|$|Long above {{elbow and}} elbow {{disarticulation}} amputations pose {{a problem in}} fitting as the residual limb is nearly the same length as the upper arm on the sound side. Although these problems have been recognized for some time, no currently available elbows offer a complete solution. Conventional fittings, whether they einploy an elbow system attached {{to the end of}} the socket or use outside hinges, either make the limb geometry unnatural or restrict the ability to provide humeral rotation and a powered joint.

40|$|The {{subjective}} {{responses and}} gait patterns of unilateral <b>knee</b> <b>disarticulation</b> amputees wearing <b>prostheses</b> fitted {{first with the}} Multiflex foot {{and then with the}} Quantum foot were studied. Nine amputees were included in the trial. A questionnaire asked the amputees about their preference for one of the feet. Gait analysis was performed measuring temporal parameters and goniometry of hips, knees and ankles in the sagittal and frontal planes. There was a slight preference for the Quantum foot. Preference seemed not to be related. to physical characteristics of the amputees nor to gait parameters. There were no differences in gait as far as the temporal factors were concerned. The main differences in the range of motion of the joints were in the frontal plane: the eversion-inversion movement of the ankle and the adduction-abduction movement of the hip. During walking at comfortable speed with the Multiflex foot the ankle and hip range of motion averaged 2. 1 and 3. 1 degrees respectively, less than during walking with the Quantum foot...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dysvascularity is {{the main}} cause of lower limb amputations in Scotland and there is an {{insignificant}} proportion (1. 7 %) of <b>knee</b> <b>disarticulations</b> (KD), despite the benefits of the amputation. Objectives: The outcomes of <b>knee</b> <b>disarticulation</b> and its associated surgical techniques will be evaluated based on healing, reamputations, functional outcomes, prosthetic ambulation, and gait biomechanics, to determine whether a greater rate of <b>knee</b> <b>disarticulations</b> can be justified among dysvascular patients. Study design: Systematic review Methods: Key electronic databases were searched for the relevant literature based on a pre-specified eligibility criterion. Results: The 17 articles included in this review were appraised for their quality, and key findings extracted. Conclusion: Healing rates are favourable, but {{there is a need for}} appropriate amputation level selection to prevent reamputations. <b>Knee</b> <b>disarticulation</b> patients have better maintenance of independent living status than transfemoral patients, but overall prosthetic ambulation rates are inconsistent.

30|$|<b>Knee</b> <b>disarticulation</b> {{has been}} {{described}} for treatment and also remains a salvage option for failed Brown procedures.

Alternatively, if the femur was severely hypoplastic, a femoro-fibular arthrodesis was performed to effectively lengthen the femur, creating a longer lever arm for improved prosthetic fitting.

40|$|Background and aim: If {{a person}} does not become ambulant after an amputation, a <b>knee</b> <b>disarticulation</b> (KD) shouldbe {{considered}} and the person may then benefit from a cosmetic KD prosthesis. The features of a cosmetic KD prosthesis are, however, seldom described. The aim of this clinical note is to describe {{the development of a}} cosmeticKD prosthesis. Technique: A non-ambulant person with bilateral KD formulated, together with her physiatrist, the criteria for a cosmetic KD prosthesis. On the basis of these, a lightweight, natural-looking, well-fitting, easy-to-put-on and take-off KD prosthesis, with no thigh lengthening during sitting, was made. This prosthesis was fixed on a wheelchair and does not impede transfer. Discussion: A newly constructed cosmetic prosthesis for non-ambulant persons with a KD is described in detail.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the natural course of phantom limb complex without any treatment after lower limb amputation. Methods: The study design was consisted of a combination of retrospective review and cross-sectional interview. 101 patients with lower limb amputation were included into the study. Patients were divided into three groups according to the amputation level: i) from hip <b>disarticulation</b> to <b>knee</b> <b>disarticulation</b> (including <b>knee</b> <b>disarticulation)</b> (25 patients, mean age: 55. 9, 19 males, 6 females) ii) transtibial amputation (below knee to ankle including ankle disarticulation) (41 patients, mean age: 58. 6, 33 males, 8 females) iii) below ankle to toe amputation (35 patients, mean age: 58. 7, 26 males, 9 females). The patients were evaluated on both early postoperative period (EPP) and sixth months after the surgery (ASM). The data related amputation including amputation date, level, cause, stump pain (SP), phantom limb pain (PLP), components of PLP, phantom sensation (PS) were recorded based on the information obtained from patients' and hospital files. Results: Statistically significant differences were found for pain intensity (VAS) between groups for SP and PLP at EPP (p <  0. 001, p =  0. 036; respectively). The mean VAS score in Group I for SP and PLP was higher than other groups. This differences for SP and PLP did not continue at ASM assessment (p =  0. 242, p =  0. 580; respectively).

40|$|Advancement in {{prosthetic}} knee design {{have led}} to the introduction of microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees (MPKs). MPKs incorporate sensors that are able to measure prosthetic loading, the knee angle, and knee angular velocity. Based on the sensor information, MPKs determine the optimal level of knee damping. This is in contrast to non-microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees (NMPKs) whose levels of knee damping are more or less fixed. Because of the variable knee damping, MPKs are thought to be beneficial for individuals with a transfemoral amputation or <b>knee</b> <b>disarticulation.</b> To increase our understanding of the influence of a transfemoral amputation or <b>knee</b> <b>disarticulation</b> on the gait pattern, we performed a systematic review focusing on the adaptation strategies of the intact and prosthetic leg. We found several adaptation strategies that seem {{to be related to the}} absence of active ankle function of the prosthetic ankle and foot. In addition, we quantified muscle activation pattern during walking. The results of this experiment are in line with the results of the systematic review. In the second part of the thesis we tested the hypothesis that the use of an MPK is beneficial. We tested this in a randomized cross-over trial. Ten participants were measured twice, once with their own NMPK and once with the Rheo Knee II (an MPK). In addition, we included a control group of non-amputees. The measurements included biomechanical analysis of several tasks including level walking at different walking speeds, starting and stopping of gait and recovery strategies after evoked balance perturbations. The results showed a limited impact of the Rheo Knee II on level walking at different speeds and the starting and stopping of gait. On the balance perturbation experiments, we found that the use of the Rheo Knee II enabled participants to use strategies that are also used by individuals without an amputation to cope with the balance disturbances. We also investigated the influence of the Rheo Knee II on quality of life, balance confidence and functional status which was limited.

Three sensors were placed at the residuum/socket interface of a <b>knee</b> <b>disarticulation</b> amputee and simultaneous measurements were obtained during pilot amputee walking test. The pressure and shear peak values as well as their temporal profiles are presented and discussed. In particular, peak pressure and shear of approximately 58 kPa and 27 kPa, respectively, were recorded. Their temporal profiles also provide dynamic coupling information at this critical residuum/socket interface. These preliminary amputee test results suggest strong potential of the developed sensor system for exploitation as an assistive technology to facilitate socket design, socket fit and effective monitoring of lower limb residuum health...|$|R
