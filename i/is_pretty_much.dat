He enjoyed the basic premise, {{involving}} the idea that aliens were active in the development of humanity—comparing it to Stanley Kubrick’s film [...] and Ridley Scott’s movie Prometheus. However, Handlen, since he was reviewing the series retrospectively, was slightly disappointed that the plot was dropped in subsequent season.

500|$|Harry and the Potters {{with its}} strong persona or theme {{is as much}} a {{performance}} art project as it is a rock band. Musically, they sound much like other indie rock music with the exception that the band adheres to a novel conceit: the Harry Potter books will inspire the lyrics. As Joe said in a 2005 interview, [...] "We try to take the themes from the books and amplify them."

Entertainment Weeklys Chris Willman wrote that Wainwright's [...] "delicate upper range is nicely attuned {{to some of}} the ballads, but anything that requires belting <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> a loss". Mark Edwards of The Times called Wainwright's performance an acquired taste, stating his [...] "trademark delivery" [...] is [...] "lazy and somewhat slurred". Dave Hughes' review pointed out Wainwright's [...] "problem with the brassy high notes in an otherwise energetic take on 'That's Entertainment'", but admits it would be unfair to hold this against him since Garland's live performance was not perfect either.

The gameplay of the Flash game has the player attempt to open a metal door by quickly clicking on it. As the door begins to open, Clover is revealed on the other side, and the player begins clicking on her breasts. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku was perplexed by the Flash game, stating that: [...] "as it <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the antithesis of everything presented in Virtue's Last Reward, I truly wonder how this Flash game is supposed to convince anyone to play the full title.

He concluded his reviewing with [...] "It's a good job, then, that bopping along to this – and warming yourself up in the process – <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> impossible to resist." [...] A reviewer for Popjustice was divided on the song's lyrics; though he found the line [...] "beating like a disco drum" [...] fantastic, he remained unconvinced by the line, [...] "who's that chick", which he labelled as being stupid.

The idea for the episode was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience [...] " [...] I got in trouble for saying the f-word in front of my mother."
