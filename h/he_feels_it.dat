5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> was not necessary to delve into {{the validity of the}} conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Peter {{practices}} his web slinging in his bedroom, when Aunt May walks in. He {{stops and}} she suggests he takes their neighbor Mary Jane Watson to the upcoming Fall Formal. Peter cringes {{at the idea}} and heads off to school. There, it is announced football practices will be held that day and Harry wants to try out. Peter passes on joining him as <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> will reveal his abilities. When he hears Flash Thompson planning on specifically going after Harry during tryouts, he decides to keep him safe and try out anyway. They each do good at tryout - Harry impresses the coach and the other player, while Peter does the same using his extra abilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{poor man}} {{falls to his}} knees, and asks that {{as an act of}} mercy to be {{executed}} instead as <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> is better for him to die than to lose the eyesight. The Khan is adamant and the servants take Ali away to blind him.|$|E

5000|$|The album's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to frontman Steven Wilson's view of the music industry; while many aspire to be a musician for fame and glamorous lifestyle, <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it's</b> a [...] "stupid dream" [...] because it actually leads {{to a life of}} hard work and struggle.|$|R

25|$|The MacAdam Shield-Shovel {{currently}} {{stands in}} Canadian First World War historiography as an invention which was poorly conceived given that its intended purpose was never fully realized. One historian {{is of the}} opinion that the MacAdam Shield Shovel must be recognized for what <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> represents: a serious attempt to improve the well-being of Canadian troops. Others feel the device is simply indicative of Sir Sam Hughes' greed and arrogance who often put his own well-being ahead that of his troops. It is also an illustration of the economic nationalism whereby locally developed technologies were ardently believed by their proponents inherently superior because they were products of the country.|$|E
25|$|Jack misses {{his mother}} but begins {{to settle into}} his new life. He bonds with his new family, meets Leo's dog Seamus and makes friends with a boy his age. Believing his long hair will give Joy the {{strength}} she needs to recover, Jack has his grandmother cut it for him so he can send it to her. Joy returns home and apologizes, thanking Jack for saving her life again. At Jack's request, they visit Room one last time, escorted by police. Jack is confused; <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> has shrunk {{and that it is}} a different place with the door open. He and Joy say their goodbyes to Room and leave.|$|E

50|$|Four intellectually {{disabled}} men share a {{house and}} are looked after by Jack (Tony Goldwyn), their social worker. The four men {{try to make sense}} of a mixed-up world, dealing with everything from runaway rodents to helping Norman, who has a new girlfriend (Mare Winningham). Jack's life with his wife is put on hold, and <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it's</b> time to let them go.|$|R

25|$|Sheldon was {{interested}} in physics from an early age, and was a child prodigy, although due to his behavioral quirks and his lack of humility about his superior intellect, he was bullied by classmates and neighbors. Sheldon entered college {{at the age of}} eleven, and at age fourteen he graduated from college summa cum laude. (To this day, the college he went to for undergraduate studies has yet to be revealed, but <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> is superior to the others' alma maters.) From then, he worked on his doctorate, was a visiting professor at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, was the youngest person at the time to receive the Stevenson Award, and has appeared on the cover of Journal of Physical Chemistry A. Sheldon is now a theoretical physicist doing research at Caltech.|$|E
25|$|Kyo's {{father and}} {{the former head of}} the Tengu Clan. He married Yuri, who was eleven years his junior, and through their marriage, Sho and Kyo were born. He is rarely present in the family and acts {{indifferent}} towards his sons. Kyo believes that he doesn't love or care for him, his brother, and his mother. Kyo initially believes that his father murdered his mother after they engaged in a heated argument, but this turns out to be false, and Yoh actually feels guilty for his wife's death because <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> was his fault. Despite this, neither Kyo or Sho have any sympathy for their father. He is determined to have one of his sons marry Misao and father an heir for the clan. He is very fond of Misao, whom he remembers from her childhood.|$|E
25|$|Suda's {{style of}} writing and {{direction}} {{has been compared to}} the works of Quentin Tarantino. A defining part of Suda's original work has been its balance of humor, dark or mature themes, violence and sexuality. His focus on death is because <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> needs a rationale behind it, and so he focuses on those closely tied with death such as assassins. In his action titles, he considered the reasons behind each character's wish to fight and the reason for their deaths. His portrayal of death in his games was influenced by his time as an undertaker. Sexuality, while a big part of many of Suda's works, is not an important element from his perspective, and when used he is attempting to express a core part of the overall story and theme. Another recurring theme in his work from The Silver Case onwards is the focus on the criminal elements in society, in addition to people with equally valid views coming into conflict with each other. Following the serious tone of The Silver Case, Flower, Sun, and Rain saw a stylistic shift to a more light and casual tone. This approach of switching styles for each successive original project would be repeated by Suda throughout his career: when talking about the contrast between Lollipop Chainsaw and Killer is Dead he described is as a yin-yang effect.|$|E

60|$|The priests {{tried to}} show us, through a small screen, a {{fragment}} of the genuine Pillar of Flagellation, to which Christ was bound when they scourged him. But we could not see it, because it was dark inside the screen. However, a baton is kept here, which the pilgrim thrusts {{through a hole in}} the screen, and then he no longer doubts that the true Pillar of Flagellation is in there. He can not have any excuse to doubt <b>it,</b> for <b>he</b> can <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> with the stick. <b>He</b> can <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> as distinctly as <b>he</b> could <b>feel</b> any thing.|$|R
500|$|It is {{the subject}} of {{conversation}} in the I'm Alan Partridge episode [...] "To Kill a Mocking Alan", where <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> [...] "really encapsulates the frustration of a Sunday."

500|$|Aronofsky {{preferred}} {{to use one}} camera whenever possible, only using a second camera if the scene was more about the setting and could be shot from two distinctly different axes. Libatique said Aronofsky preferred the eyeline match, [...] "Darren is big on eyelines, and if you sacrifice an eyeline on an angle, <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> nullifies the shot and de-emphasizes the performances." [...] Aronofsky originally intended to have Jackman's characters always moving in an [...] "unusual" [...] left-to-right direction across the frame, but the plan was complicated by the spacecraft needing to move upward toward a light source.|$|E

50|$|Arthur is shaken, but at {{the same}} time relieved. He can see that Dicky and Emmeline were healthy, that they must have lived in peace. <b>He</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it's</b> better that they died while still in a savage state and did not have to return to civilization. He has a dream-vision of the pair; they ask him to come to Palm Tree, the island where they lived, and promise he will see them again.|$|R
500|$|Some Eastern Catholic Churches {{are governed}} by a patriarch who is elected by the synod of the bishops of that church, others are headed by a major archbishop, others are under a metropolitan, and others are {{organised}} as individual eparchies. [...] Each church has authority over the particulars of its internal organisation, liturgical rites, liturgical calendar {{and other aspects of}} its spirituality, subject only to the authority of the Pope. The Roman Curia has a specific department, the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, to maintain relations with them. [...] The pope does not generally appoint bishops or clergy in the Eastern Catholic Churches, deferring to their internal governance structures, but may intervene if <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> necessary.|$|E
500|$|Specifically, the band's most {{prominent}} influences include blues musicians such as Son House, Blind Willie McTell and Robert Johnson, garage rock bands such as The Gories and The Sonics, the Detroit protopunk sound of bands like the MC5 and The Stooges, {{in addition to}} groups like The Cramps, The Velvet Underground, and the early Los Angeles punk blues band The Gun Club. Jack has stated on numerous occasions that the blues is the dominant influence on his songwriting and {{the roots of the}} band's music, stating that <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> is so sacred that playing it does not do it justice. Of The Gun Club's music in particular, Jack said, [...] "'Sex Beat', 'She's Like Heroin To Me', and 'For The Love Of Ivy'...why are these songs not taught in schools?" [...] Heavy blues rock bands such as the Rolling Stones and AC/DC have also influenced the band, particularly Led Zeppelin, as Jack has claimed that he [...] "can't trust anybody who doesn't like Led Zeppelin." ...|$|E
500|$|USA Today {{referred}} to it as a good coffee table book. Chicago Tribune journalist Rick Kogan describes this as a massive undertaking with the natural foibles of the human element in it selections and accuracy, and by nature of its attempt to serve as a historical compilation an immediately dated product due to the dynamic nature of the city. [...] However, <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>it</b> is sure to amaze its audience. A Chicago Sun-Times reviewer describes it as a scholarly product that is [...] "easily the most comprehensive reference book on the Chicago region ever published". The State Journal-Register, the Springfield, Illinois newspaper, reviewers complain that downstate cities and regions are neglected in the book. A Daily Herald review describes it as a book accurately [...] "billed as the city's most definitive historical reference book". [...] The Peoria Journal Star notes that although there are complaints about omissions and underserved topics, the online version should quell the demands for further knowledge.|$|E

50|$|Peter Colt, a British {{professional}} {{tennis player}} {{in his thirties}} whose ranking has slipped from 11th to 119th in the world, has never really had to fight for anything, as his wealthy family allowed him to easily pursue his tennis ambitions.
