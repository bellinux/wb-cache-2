5|$|On offense, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{were led}} by quarterback Maurice DeShazo, who {{completed}} 164 of his 296 pass attempts {{during the regular season}} for 2,110 yards, 13 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions. DeShazo's success during the season helped him become the No. 4 all-time passing leader in Virginia Tech history, finishing his career with 5,720 passing yards. DeShazo's favorite passing target was wide receiver Antonio Freeman, who finished the season having caught 38 passes for 586 yards and five touchdowns. The Gator Bowl was Freeman's final collegiate game, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> DeShazo's. Freeman finished his career as the No. 1 receiver in Virginia Tech history in terms of yardage (bowl games were not counted in statistics until 2003) with 2,207 receiving yards. Freeman also was the team's leading punt returner, having returned 39 kicks for 467 yards and a touchdown, and received second-team All-Big East honors.|$|E

The Derg government turned back the Somali invasion, and made deep strides against the Eritrean secessionists and the TPLF as well. By the end of the seventies, Mengistu presided over the second largest army in all of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as a formidable airforce and navy.|$|E
25|$|The Sma, {{who holds}} that Shmita {{nowadays}} {{is only a}} Rabbinic obligation, holds that the Biblical promise of bounty for those who observe the Shmita (Leviticus 25:20â€“22) only applies when the Biblical obligation is in effect, and hence that the Biblical promise of bounty is not in effect today. However, the Chazon Ish, who holds that the Biblical obligation of Shmita observance remains in effect today, holds that the Biblical promise of bounty follows it and Divine bounty is promised to Jews living in the Land of Israel today, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> promised in ancient times. However, he holds that Jews should generally not demand miracles from Heaven and hence that one should not rely on this promise for one's sustenance, but should instead make appropriate arrangements and rely on permissible leniencies.|$|E
25|$|The {{occupation}} {{period was}} difficult on Scouting, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> on Japanese daily life. The participant patch (usually embroidered or woven) {{for the first}} National Scout Rally was printed on paper, because of the financial situation of that time. Period pieces of Scouting memorabilia from that time are rare and highly prized. Japan was re-admitted as a full member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1950, remarkable and unique {{in the history of}} nations in which Scouting has been interrupted. Within ten years of World War II, Scout membership had grown to 80,000. In 1957, the first Wood Badge course by that name was held in Japan. In 1959, Japan held the Second Nippon Jamboree, shortly after the conclusion of the 10th World Scout Jamboree in the Philippines.|$|E

25|$|Bryansk Front {{was under}} the command of Gen. Andrey Yeryomenko. During the balance of August and most of September he ordered his forces, {{including}} the relatively fresh 50th Army, into repeated clashes with the German XLVII Motorized Corps over its possession of a bridgehead over the Desna anchored on the towns of Pochep and Pogar. This was also an attempt to disrupt 2nd Panzer Army as it prepared to strike southwards towards Kiev. These operations had little effect on the German forces and also severely weakened the Front <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to face its greatest test. As of Sept. 30, strength returns for 50th Army showed 61,503 personnel, 780 guns and mortars (of which 149 were antitank guns), but only 7 tanks. It was still one of the stronger armies before Moscow, but not so strong as it had been when formed.|$|E
25|$|Hudson River School {{paintings}} {{reflect the}} themes of discovery, exploration, and settlement in America in the 19th century. The detailed and idealized paintings also typically depict a pastoral setting. The works often juxtapose peaceful agriculture and the remaining wilderness, which was fast disappearing from the Hudson Valley <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> coming to be appreciated for its qualities of ruggedness and sublimity. The school characterizes the artistic body, its New York location, its landscape subject matter, and often its subject, the Hudson River. In general, Hudson River School artists believed that nature {{in the form of}} the American landscape was an ineffable manifestation of God, though the artists varied in the depth of their religious conviction. Their reverence for America's natural beauty was shared with contemporary American writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The artist Thomas Cole is generally acknowledged as the founder of the Hudson River School, while painters Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt were the most successful painters of the school.|$|E
25|$|The Scots Greys {{continued}} {{their pursuit of}} the Panzer Army Africa for the next month and a half. The main problem for the regiment faced as it chased after Rommel's retreating army was the condition of its tanks. Some tanks were repairable, others had to be replaced from whatever was available. By {{the end of the}} month, the Scots Greys were fielding 6 Grant, 17 Sherman, and 21 Stuart tanks. Beginning in the second week of December, the Eighth Army became engaged in what would develop into the Battle of El Agheila. On 15 December 1942, the Scots Greys became engaged in tank battle with elements of the 15th Panzer Division near the village of Nofilia. Due to breakdowns and losses along the way, the Scots Greys were reduced to 5 Grants and 10 Shermans. Leading the 4th Armour Brigade's advance, the Scots Greys entered the village, over-running the infantry defenders, capturing 250 men of the 115 Panzergrenadier Regiment. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> completing the capture of the prisoners, the Scots Greys encountered approximately 30 panzers of the 15th Panzer Division. The tank engagement was inconclusive, with each side losing 4 tanks, although the Scots Greys were able to recover 2 of their damaged tanks. The Germans withdrew as the 2nd New Zealand Division moved to the south, outflanking the 15th Panzer Division.|$|E

25|$|Guns. As in Europe, {{firearms}} were integrated gradually {{into local}} armies, working {{in tandem with}} the spear, bow and war-club. They sometimes compared unfavorably with traditional weapons such as poisoned arrows, or the quick charges of motivated cavalry and spearmen. As noted above, the Portuguese were unsuccessful in the Zambezi region for decades because in the right circumstances, hard-driving spearmen could overwhelm musketeers. Deployment of guns was not as organized as that in Europe, where squares of gunmen drilled to deliver massed fire. A loose skirmishing formation was more common, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> with the bow. Guns were valued not only for their bullets but the psychological effect of their noise and smoke. They also figured prominently in the armament of small groups of royal or elite troops. One exception to this pattern appears to be Dahomey, where arquebusiers were drilled in a standardized fashion, and delivered volleys of fire with a counter-marching maneuver. Over time, most native kingdoms gradually began to use more guns, and these were eventually to change the landscape considerably. Formerly dominant kingdoms like Benin found their hegemony weakened, as new powers arose. The smaller riverine states of the Niger Delta for example began to arm their massive war-canoes with guns and cannon obtained from European sources, and began to carve out new commercial empires that nibbled away the power of the older states. This process was to accelerate in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|As the {{language}} of the ruling ethnicity, some type of Nubian dialect would have been the most important language. Just like in Makuria, this language was written in a variant of the Coptic alphabet. However, while this topic is still understudied it seems that there were differences between the Old Nubian and Alodian alphabet. Erman, who studied several Alodian inscriptions, suggested that the Alodian script had five unique letters, while Monneret states that it had six. The latter also assumes that those derived from Meroitic letters. The fact that Alodia used its own dialect for writing and even developed new letters for it differs it from Makuria, where the spoken language, Old Dongolawi, was never put into writing. Except of Nubian, Greek played an important role as well. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for Alodia's northern cousin, Greek was probably a very prestigious language, used predominantly for liturgy and other religious matters. Both is spectaculary proven by the tomb stone of king David, which was written in surprisingly accurate Greek. Due to the sparse sources it's not possible to say much definite about the niveau of the Greek language among the common people. Perhaps one can draw parallels to Makuria though: There the niveau decayed over the centuries, leading to a hybrid language with a mixture of Greek and Nubian words, structured into one sentence after Nubian grammar rules. Coptic, as a language of communication with Christian Egypt, was only of limited relevance due to geographic reasons, but nevertheless do sparse written remains exist.|$|E
