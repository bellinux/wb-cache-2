In spite of the merger, the High School section remains boys-only, while the College section remains co-educational, which admit students from Nanyang Girls' High School under the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Programme.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hwa Chong Institution {{offers the}} <b>Integrated</b> <b>Programme</b> that extends to Nanyang Girls High School (NYGH), an all-girls junior high school, {{under the name}} Hwa Chong Affiliate Programme. Under the programme, a supermajority of NYGH {{students}} graduate to the College (pre-university) section of HCI for their pre-university education. All students of HCI's high school section also move on automatically to the college section and undertake the GCE Advanced Level examination, unless they fail to meet requirements (students must have an MSG of 3.00 and below {{at the end of}} Secondary 4) or specifically applied to leave.|$|E
5|$|Secondary 1 (age 13) {{students}} first {{enter the}} high school section and study there for four years, before proceeding to the college section where they prepare to take the GCE 'A' Levels final examinations. The high school section uses the Mean Subject Grade grading system in tests and exams. The school-wide <b>Integrated</b> <b>Programme</b> offered enables students to skip the GCE 'O' Levels, typically taken by Secondary 4 students in Singapore. The Hwa Chong Diploma was introduced in 2008 and is awarded to the best performing 30% of its graduating cohort. It is awarded {{on top of the}} 'A' Levels certificate, and is an added qualification to university applications.|$|E

5|$|Under HCI's <b>Integrated</b> <b>Programme,</b> the Sabbatical Programme {{is offered}} whereby {{students}} from Secondary 1 to 4 go on one week sabbatical courses in each {{term in the}} first semester (Terms 1 and 2). The programme is unique in allowing {{the majority of the}} school populace to put aside formal curricular lessons for a week in pursuit of their passions or interests. Sabbaticals offered are of a wide variety, in categories as defined by the school: Arts & Aesthetics, Chinese Studies, Humanities, English & Literature, Leadership, Technology, Science and Math, Camps and Student Exchange; they are essentially courses for students to opt for, such as beginner guitar and songwriting lessons, professional music production, Model United Nations training camps, football friendlies with other schools, et cetera. Also, the school requires students to use the specifically designed Online Bidding System - the i-ComP - to organise their sabbatical plans. Students who accumulate demerit points as a result of various offences are penalised in their sabbatical bidding or are recommended for corrective work order.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} effectiveness, definitions, {{and components}} of <b>integrated</b> care <b>programmes</b> for chronically ill patients {{on the basis}} of systematic reviews. DESIGN: Literature review from January 1996 to May 2004. MAIN MEASURES: Definitions and components of <b>integrated</b> care <b>programmes</b> and all effects reported on the quality of care. RESULTS: Searches in the Medline and Cochrane databases identified 13 systematic reviews of <b>integrated</b> care <b>programmes</b> for chronically ill patients. Despite considerable heterogeneity in interventions, patient populations, and processes and outcomes of care, <b>integrated</b> care <b>programmes</b> seemed to have positive effects on the quality of patient care. No consistent definitions were present for the management of patients with chronic illnesses. In all the reviews the aims of <b>integrated</b> care <b>programmes</b> were very similar, namely reducing fragmentation and improving continuity and coordination of care, but the focus and content of the programmes differed widely. The most common components of <b>integrated</b> care <b>programmes</b> were self-management support and patient education, often combined with structured clinical follow-up and case management; a multidisciplinary patient care team; multidisciplinary clinical pathways and feedback, reminders, and education for professionals. CONCLUSION: <b>Integrated</b> care <b>programmes</b> seemed to have positive effects on the quality of care. However, <b>integrated</b> care <b>programmes</b> have widely varying definitions and components and failure to recognize these variations leads to inappropriate conclusions about the effectiveness of these programmes and to inappropriate application of research results. To compare programmes and better understand the (cost) effectiveness of the programmes, consistent definitions must be used and component interventions must be well described...|$|R

40|$|Background. Over {{the last}} decade, few {{randomized}} controlled trials of high methodological quality {{have been carried}} out {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} interventions for patients with hand eczema. Little to no attention has been paid to the feasibility of these interventions. This process evaluation was carried out to gain insight in the barriers to and facilitators for implementation of an intervention for hand eczema. The aims of this process evaluation were to examine the feasibility and the satisfaction of the patients and the professionals with the <b>integrated</b> care <b>programme,</b> and the perceived barriers to and facilitators for the use of the programme. Methods. Eligible for this study were patients with moderate to severe chronic hand eczema who completed the <b>integrated</b> care <b>programme.</b> This programme is an intervention provided by a multidisciplinary team, consisting of a dermatologist, a specialized nurse, and a clinical occupational physician. Data were collected from the patients and the healthcare professionals, by means of semistructured telephone interviews, questionnaires, and a patient tracking system. Implementation, satisfaction and expectations were investigated. Results. Ninety-three patients completed the <b>integrated</b> care <b>programme.</b> Compliance with the <b>integrated</b> care <b>programme</b> was good. The results indicate good satisfaction of both patients and healthcare professionals with the <b>integrated</b> care <b>programme.</b> However, with regard to the process and feasibility of the <b>integrated</b> care <b>programme,</b> there is room for improvement. The clinical occupational physician was only involved in a very limited number of cases, the protocol was not flexible, and the intervention period was too compact. Most of the perceived barriers in the present study are at the organizational level. Conclusion. Satisfaction with the <b>integrated</b> care <b>programme</b> was high among both patients and healthcare professionals. The involvement of the clinical occupational physician in the treatment, when indicated, should be optimized. With the multidisciplinary approach and good communication as a basis for the programme, and a more flexible protocol to avoid unnecessary consultations by the healthcare professionals, integrated care could be a useful treatment from a process evaluation perspective. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S...|$|R
