500|$|As a man, Richardson {{was on the}} {{one hand}} deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, [...] "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't really quite like other people." [...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in The New Yorker that Richardson [...] "made me feel that I have known this man all my life and that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> anyone who more adroitly buttonholed me while keeping me firmly at arm's length." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> Mr. Stanton {{up to that}} time, {{though we}} had held {{frequent}} conversations over the wires the year before, when I was in Tennessee. Occasionally at night he would order the wires between the War Department and my headquarters to be connected, and we would hold a conversation {{for an hour or}} two. On this occasion the Secretary was accompanied by Governor Brough of Ohio, whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met,</b> though he and my father had been old acquaintances. Mr. Stanton dismissed the special train that had brought him to Indianapolis, and accompanied me to Louisville.|$|R

2500|$|In Diana Wynne Jones' Charmed Life (1977), two {{orphaned}} children receive magical education {{while living}} in a castle. The setting is a world resembling early 1900s Britain, where magic is commonplace. Diana Wynne Jones has stated in {{answer to a question}} on her webpage: [...] "I think Ms Rowling did get quite a few of her ideas from my books – though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> her, so I {{have never been able to}} ask her. My books were written many years before the Harry Potter books (Charmed Life was first published in 1977), so any similarities probably come from what she herself read as a child. Once a book is published, out in the world, it is sort of common property, for people to take ideas from and use, and I think this is what happened to my books." ...|$|E
2500|$|Magennis has {{had several}} {{memorials}} erected in his honour. When Magennis first won the VC, {{he was treated}} rather shabbily by the Unionist-dominated Belfast City Council because he was from a working class Roman Catholic family. Although the public collected £3,600 in appreciation of his heroism, the council refused {{to give him the}} freedom of the city. The only official recognition was a small photograph tucked away in the robing room of the council chamber. The first memorial was only erected in 1999 after a long campaign by his biographer George Fleming and Major S.H. Pollock CD (Canada). The memorial, a bronze and stone statue, was officially unveiled in Belfast on 8 October 1999. The ceremony was conducted in the grounds of Belfast City Hall in the presence of Magennis's son Paul, by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Bob Stoker. Magennis's former commanding officer, Ian Fraser, was reported as saying: [...] "Jim gave me bother from time to time. He liked his tot of rum, but he was a lovely man and a fine diver. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> a braver man. It was a privilege to know him and it's wonderful to see Belfast honour him at last." [...] A wall mural commemorating James Magennis on the 60th anniversary of VJ day was unveiled on 16 September 2005 by Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist Party Member of Parliament representing East Belfast, including Tullycarnet.|$|E

60|$|With all the {{pressure}} {{brought to bear}} upon them, both President Lincoln and General Halleck stood by me {{to the end of}} the campaign. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> Mr. Lincoln, but his support was constant.|$|R
60|$|I {{liked being}} with him. He was {{a type of}} person <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> {{before in my life}} and one whom I {{thoroughly}} appreciated. I sat and watched him during an interval of the conversation.|$|R

6000|$|... "Prescott," [...] {{she said}} coldly, [...] "is a {{dangerous}} man; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> anybody so insinuating and plausible. When {{he speaks to}} you, it's very hard to disbelieve him; his manner's convincing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it so, Macumazahn? Oh, then I {{have heard}} of her, though, as it chances, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> her before. No wonder that my sister Nandie is jealous, for she is {{beautiful}} indeed." ...|$|E
60|$|Any {{one more}} disagreeably {{unpleasant}} than this woman <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met.</b> When <b>I</b> told Walkirk what <b>had</b> happened <b>I</b> could not restrain my burning indignation, and I declared I would not remain another {{hour on the}} island with her. He listened to me with grave concern.|$|R
6000|$|I {{confess to}} {{a feeling of}} {{profound}} astonishment. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> Mrs. Harris before, but as she was an intimate friend of Mrs. Cameron, and quite evidently a woman of culture, I could not think her so practised a joker as to be [...] "putting all this on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seemed to}} me that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> so {{fascinating}} and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.|$|R
60|$|I don't think, to be candid, {{my mother}} liked much any joke that was against herself. Indeed, when I {{come to think}} of it, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> a woman who did, nor man, either.|$|E
60|$|With {{those words}} Mr. Dark {{pocketed}} his large snuff-box, gave a last wink with his bright eye, and walked rapidly away, whistling, {{to catch the}} London coach. From that time to this he and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> again.|$|E
60|$|To the {{foregoing}} desultory {{notes on the}} French military character, let me append a few traits which I picked up verbally {{in one of the}} French provinces. They may have already appeared in print, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> with them.|$|E
6000|$|Where was I? Not only in what spot of the world, but in {{what year}} of our Lord? For all these objects were of past days, {{and of a}} distant country.

"Bernard whistled, {{and looked}} at me in the same queer way that he looked at me when he once had said laughingly that he {{believed}} if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> him <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> married George, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> answered that if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been sure he did not exist {{it might have been a}} good thing for me to marry George.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} lunch {{with me at}} Sandwich," [...] he protested; [...] "and, after the humblest apology on my part, you won't forgive me for what I did this morning. Do {{you expect me to}} believe that I am not the special object of your antipathy? <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> with you! At my age, a man gets angry when he is treated cruelly and doesn't deserve it. You don't {{understand}} that, I dare say." ...|$|R
60|$|As far as I remember, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> Mr. Carnegie. But I {{know that}} if I did {{he would tell me}} that he found it quite {{impossible}} to keep up with Mr. Rockefeller. No doubt Mr. Rockefeller has the same feeling.|$|E
60|$|No {{collector}} or {{curator of}} a museum should have any moral scruples whatever; and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> one who had; though I have been informed by deeply-shocked informants of four nationalities that the Germans are the most flagrant pirates of all.|$|E
60|$|What {{she meant}} was that, if I refused, she would exert the full bent of her natural genius {{to make life}} a Hades for me. She held me with her {{glittering}} eye. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> anyone who can give a better imitation of the Ancient Mariner.|$|E
60|$|Evidence of my {{literary}} success, if {{you look}} at it that way, may have lain in an invitation to dine at Andrew Carnegie's, but a suspicion that I was being patronized made me hesitate. It was only after I learned that Burroughs and Gilder were going that I decided to accept, although I could not see why the ironmaster should include me in his list. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> him and was not eager for his recognition.|$|R

As {{able to take care of}} herself. All sorts of considerations that <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> shown to a sillier woman I never dreamt of showing to her. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> anyone so mentally brilliant before or so helpless and headlong.

6000|$|... "I {{had never}} met any one like you before. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> any one like you since.

6000|$|... "Yes, it {{has made}} her very happy," [...] said Joscelyn gravely. [...] "And {{it has made}} me happy, too. I love Aunty Nan, Mrs. Morrison, and I owe her much. In all my life <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> a woman so purely, unselfishly good and noble and true." ...|$|E
60|$|Alas for my poor Bart! I {{had met him}} but twice, and yet {{he was a man}} {{very much}} after my heart. I have always had a regard for the English for the sake of that one friend. A braver man and a worse swordsman <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>met.</b>|$|E
