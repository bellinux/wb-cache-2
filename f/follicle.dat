5|$|Retinoids are {{medications}} which reduce inflammation, normalize the <b>follicle</b> cell life cycle, {{and reduce}} sebum production. They are structurally related to vitamin A. The retinoids appear {{to influence the}} cell life cycle in the <b>follicle</b> lining. This helps prevent the accumulation of skin cells within the hair <b>follicle</b> that can create a blockage. They are a first-line acne treatment, especially for people with dark-colored skin, and are known to lead to faster improvement of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair <b>follicle.</b> In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair <b>follicle.</b> However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair <b>follicle,</b> thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair <b>follicle.</b> If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair <b>follicle,</b> the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair <b>follicle,</b> this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} LH matures {{the egg and}} weakens {{the wall of the}} <b>follicle</b> in the ovary, causing the fully {{developed}} <b>follicle</b> to release its secondary oocyte. The secondary oocyte promptly matures into an ootid and then becomes a mature ovum. The mature ovum has a diameter of about 0.2mm.|$|E
40|$|The {{degeneration}} rate {{of ovarian}} preantral <b>follicles</b> in goats, {{and the distribution}} in the follicular classes (primordial, primary or secondary) was assessed. Ovaries from adult goats were collected at a local slaughterhouse. To evaluate the morphology of the caprine preantral <b>follicles</b> in situ, one fragment from each ovary was fixed individually in Carnoy for 12 h, sectioned serially at a thickness of 7 Î¼m and stained with Periodic Acid Shiff-hematoxylin. Preantral <b>follicles</b> were then classified according to the stage of development. Preantral <b>follicles</b> were classified individually either as morphologically normal; as Type 1 degenerated <b>follicles</b> (only the oocyte was degenerated); or as Type 2 degenerated <b>follicles</b> (when degeneration occurred at both oocyte and granulosa cells). The total examined was 235 primordial, 195 primary and 101 secondary <b>follicles.</b> The distribution of degenerated <b>follicles</b> as primordial, primary and secondary <b>follicles</b> was 8. 5, 14. 3 and 16. 8 %, respectively. When Types 1 and 2 degenerated <b>follicles</b> were pooled, secondary <b>follicles</b> were significantly more degenerated than primordial and primary <b>follicles.</b> When degeneration Types 1 and 2 was compared in each follicular class, a higher (P< 0. 05) percentage of Type 1 degeneration was observed in primordial and primary <b>follicles.</b> Conversely, secondary <b>follicles</b> were significantly more affected by Type 2 degeneration. When the follicular classes were taken together, a significantly higher percentage of Type 1 degenerated preantral <b>follicles</b> was observed when compared with Type 2 degenerated <b>follicles</b> (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, a low percentage of degenerated preantral <b>follicles</b> was observed and secondary <b>follicles</b> were more affected by degeneration than primordial <b>follicles.</b> Thus, primordial <b>follicles</b> constitute a large and potentially valuable source of oocytes for reproductive programs after in vitro growth and maturation...|$|R

40|$|In the intact rat, on estrus, the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) surge {{recruits}} {{nearly twice}} the correct number of <b>follicles</b> for ovulation, then, on metestrus, the excess <b>follicles</b> undergo atresia. In contrast, in the long-term hemicastrate rat, the FSH surge recruits fewer antral <b>follicles</b> on estrus, {{but there is little}} atresia on metestrus. To determine if fewer <b>follicles</b> are recruited by the FSH surge of long-term hemicastrates because the pool of <b>follicles</b> capable of responding to the FSH is smaller than in intact rats, preantral, antral, atretic, and healthy <b>follicles</b> were counted in ovaries of rats killed on each day of the estrous cycle. In general, there were only half as many healthy preantral <b>follicles</b> per rat in hemicastrates compared with intacts. There were an equal number of large antral <b>follicles</b> per rat in hemicastrates compared with intacts. Thus, compensatory hypertrophy did not extend to preantral <b>follicles</b> but was evident in large preovulatory <b>follicles.</b> These results suggest that fewer <b>follicles</b> are recruited on estrus in hemicastrate rats because fewer <b>follicles</b> are at the appropriate stage of development to respond to the FSH surge...|$|R
5|$|Through the {{influence}} of a rise in <b>follicle</b> stimulating hormone (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few ovarian follicles are stimulated. These follicles, which were present at birth and have been developing {{for the better part of}} a year in a process known as folliculogenesis, compete with each other for dominance. Under {{the influence}} of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant <b>follicle</b> in the ovary will continue to maturity.

The enzymatic retrieval with collagenase treatment returned more <b>follicles</b> than the mechanical retrieval, while the percentage of morphologically normal <b>follicles</b> was higher with mechanical retrieval than with enzymatic retrieval. After 4 days of culture, mechanically retrieved, preantral <b>follicles</b> yielded more <b>follicles</b> with normal morphology than enzymatically retrieved <b>follicles,</b> which resulted in improved follicular growth. The mRNA expression of FSHR, LHR Cx 43, DNMT 1 and FGFR 2 genes was significantly higher after culture of the <b>follicles</b> retrieved mechanically.

5|$|Scientists {{initially}} {{hypothesized that}} acne represented {{a disease of}} the skin's hair <b>follicle,</b> and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum. During the 1880s, bacteria were observed by microscopy in skin samples affected by acne and were regarded as the causal agents of comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne. During the mid-twentieth century, dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) could completely explain the disease. This led to the current understanding that acne {{could be explained by}} a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin <b>follicle</b> by excessive dead skin cells, followed by bacterial invasion of the hair <b>follicle</b> pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are found}} in hair-covered areas, where they are {{connected}} to hair follicles. One or more glands may surround each hair <b>follicle,</b> and the glands themselves are surrounded by arrector pili muscles. The glands have an acinar structure (like a many-lobed berry), in which multiple glands branch off a central duct. Relative to keratinocytes {{that make up the}} hair <b>follicle,</b> sebaceous glands are composed of huge cells with many large vesicles that contain the sebum. These cells express Na+ and Clâ ion channels, ENaC and CFTR (see Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 in reference).|$|E

40|$|Compensatory ovarian and gonadotropic {{responses}} to unilateral ovariectomy (ULO) {{were examined in}} the rabbit doe, an induced ovulator. On Days 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15 and 20 after ULO, ovaries from 3 hemiovariectomized does and 1 sham-hemiovariectomized doe were examined macro- and microscopically for number, size and signs of atresia of <b>follicles.</b> The number of surface <b>follicles</b> increased initially to 7 or 8 <b>follicles</b> 2 days after ULO, followed by an increase to 10 or more <b>follicles</b> by Day 15 (control ovaries had 5. 7 Â± 0. 4 <b>follicles).</b> Total numbers of antral <b>follicles</b> {{and the proportion of}} <b>follicles</b> which were atretic did not vary relative to day after ULO. However, distributions of antral <b>follicles</b> in classes of 0. 2 -mm increments were significantly different between sham-ovariectomized and hemiovariecromized does after Day 2 due to shifts of <b>follicles</b> into larger size classes. Peripheral serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but not lutein-izing hormone (LFJ), increased temporarily during the 48 h after ULO. Follicular compensation after ULO in the doe entailed nonlinear increases in numbers of preovulatory <b>follicles,</b> due to increased growth within the antral population of <b>follicles,</b> probably the result of an acute surge of FSH.

5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles.

40|$|Copyright Â© 2003 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction. Bovine ovarian antral <b>follicles</b> exhibit {{either one}} or the other of two {{patterns}} of granulosa cell death in atresia. Death can commence either from the antrum and progress toward the basal lamina (antral atresia) or the converse (basal atresia). In basal atresia, the remaining live antrally situated cells appeared to continue maturing. Beyond that, little is known about these distinct patterns of atresia. Healthy (nonatretic) <b>follicles</b> also exhibit either {{one or the}} other of two patterns of granulosa cell shape, follicular basal lamina ultrastructure or location of younger cells within the membrana granulosa. To examine these different phenotypes, the expression of the steroidogenic enzymes cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P 450 (SCC) and 3 Ã-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 Ã-HSD) in granulosa cells and concentrations of steroid hormones in follicular fluid were measured in individual histologically classified bovine antral <b>follicles.</b> Healthy <b>follicles</b> first expressed SCC and 3 Ã-HSD in granulosa cells only when the <b>follicles</b> reached an approximate threshold of 10 mm in diameter. The pattern of expression in antral atretic <b>follicles</b> was the same as healthy <b>follicles.</b> Basal atretic <b>follicles</b> were all < 5 mm. In these, the surviving antral granulosa cells expressed SCC and 3 Ã-HSD. In examining <b>follicles</b> of 3 â 5 mm, basal atretic <b>follicles</b> were found to have substantially elevated progesterone (P < 0. 001) and decreased androstenedione and testosterone compared to healthy and antral atretic <b>follicles.</b> Estradiol was highest in the large healthy <b>follicles,</b> lower in the small healthy <b>follicles,</b> lower still in the antral atretic <b>follicles,</b> and lowest in the basal atretic <b>follicles.</b> Our findings have two major implications.

5|$|Reproductive {{success is}} {{strongly}} affected by insects that infest the flower spikes and fruiting structures. Infestation {{of the flower}} spikes is not as severe as in other Banksia species: one study found less than 10% of B.telmatiaea inflorescences to be infested, compared to over 50% for B.attenuata (Candlestick Banksia), B.littoralis and B.menziesii (Menzies' Banksia), and over 90% for B.grandis (Bull Banksia). Also, whereas other species were attacked by a range of insects, the inflorescence of B.telmatiaea was attacked only by the tortrix moth Arotrophora arcuatalis (Banksia Boring Moth), which burrows into the woody axis, rendering the spike barren. On the other hand, the same study observed heavy infestation of fruiting structures, with over 90% of spikes with follicles found to contain at least one larva of an unidentified species of moth of the genus Xylorycta. These larvae burrow from <b>follicle</b> to <b>follicle</b> to eat the seed, resulting in 100% seed loss for infested spikes.|$|E
