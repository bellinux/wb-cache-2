Fully elaborated N-glycan structures accelerate folding by 4 -fold and stabilize the β-sandwich structure by 3. 1 kcal/mol, relative to the nonglycosylated protein. The N-glycan's first saccharide unit accounts for the entire acceleration of folding and for 2 / 3 of the native state stabilization. The remaining third of the stabilization is derived from the next 2 saccharide units. Thus, the conserved N-linked triose core, ManGlcNAc 2, improves both the kinetics and the thermodynamics of protein folding. The native state stabilization and decreased activation barrier for folding conferred by N-glycosylation provide a powerful and potentially general mechanism for enhancing folding in the secretory pathway...|$|E

40|$|Expression of {{the cell}} surface {{glycoprotein}} MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) is induced in dangerous, abnormal or 'stressed' cells, including cancer cells, virus-infected cells and rapidly proliferating cells. MICA is recognized by the activating <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> NKG 2 D, providing a mechanism by which immune cells can identify and potentially eliminate pathological cells. Immune recognition through NKG 2 D is implicated in cancer, atherosclerosis, transplant rejection and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Despite {{the wide range of}} potential therapeutic applications of MICA manipulation, the factors that control MICA expression are unclear. Here we use metabolic interventions and metabolomic analyses to show that the transition from quiescent cellular metabolism to a 'Warburg' or biosynthetic metabolic state induces MICA expression. Specifically, we show that glucose transport into the cell and active glycolytic metabolism are necessary to upregulate MICA expression. Active purine synthesis is necessary to support this effect of glucose, and increases in purine nucleotide levels are sufficient to induce MICA expression. Metabolic induction of MICA expression directly influences NKG 2 D-dependent cytotoxicity by immune cells. These findings support a model of MICA regulation whereby the purine metabolic activity of individual cells is reflected by cell surface MICA expression and is the subject of surveillance by NKG 2 D receptor-expressing immune cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{signaling}} lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM; CD 150) is the <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> for {{measles virus}} (MV). To assess {{the importance of}} the SLAM-MV interactions for virus spread and pathogenesis, we generated a wild-type IC-B MV selectively unable to recognize human SLAM (SLAM-blind). This virus differs from the fully virulent wild-type IC-B strain by a single arginine-to-alanine substitution at amino acid 533 of the attachment protein hemagglutinin and infects cells through SLAM about 40 times less efficiently than the isogenic wild-type strain. Ex vivo, this virus infects primary lymphocytes at low levels regardless of SLAM expression. When a group of six rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) was inoculated intranasally with the SLAM-blind virus, no clinical symptoms were documented. Only one monkey had low-level viremia early after infection, whereas all the hosts in the control group had high viremia levels. Despite minimal, if any, viremia, all six hosts generated neutralizing antibody titers close to those of the control monkeys while MV-directed cellular immunity reached levels at least as high as in wild-type-infected monkeys. These findings prove formally that efficient SLAM recognition is necessary for MV virulence and pathogenesis. They also suggest that the selectively SLAM-blind wild-type MV can be developed into a vaccine vector...|$|E

We sacrificed 25 male FcγRIIB-/-yaa mice at various disease stages, and grouped them according to activity and chronicity indices for lupus nephritis. Glomerular morphology and localization of electron dense deposits containing IgG were further determined by immune electron microscopy. Renal DNase I and pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. DNase I protein levels was assessed by immunohistochemistry and zymography. Our results demonstrate early development of electron dense deposits containing IgG in FcγRIIB-/-yaa mice, before detectable levels of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies. Similar to NZB/NZW F 1, electron dense deposits in FcγRIIB-/-yaa progressed from being confined to the mesangium in the early stage of lupus nephritis to be present also in capillary glomerular basement membranes. In the advanced stage of lupus nephritis, renal DNase I was lost on both transcriptional and protein levels, which has previously been shown in NZB/NZW F 1 mice and in human disease.

CD 300 a, an ITIM bearing type I transmembrane protein, is expressed on many hematopoietic cells, including subsets of lymphocytes. Results We have taken two approaches to further define the {{mechanism by which}} CD 300 a acts as an inhibitor of <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> signaling. First, we have expressed in Jurkat T cells a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domains of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 2 DL 2 fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments of CD 300 a (KIR-CD 300 a) to explore surrogate ligand-stimulated inhibition of superantigen stimulated T cell receptor (TCR) mediated cell signaling. We found that intact CD 300 a ITIMs were essential for inhibition and that the tyrosine phosphorylation of these ITIMs required the src tyrosine kinase Lck. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD 300 a ITIMs created docking sites for both src homology 2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP) - 1 and SHP- 2. Suppression of SHP- 1 and SHP- 2 expression in KIR-CD 300 a Jurkat T cells with siRNA {{and the use of}} DT 40 chicken B cell lines expressing CD 300 a and deficient in several phosphatases revealed that SHP- 1, but not SHP- 2 or the src homology 2 domain containing inositol 5 ’ phosphatase SHIP, was utilized by CD 300 a for its inhibitory activity.

More recently poliovirus like receptor 4 (PVRL 4), also known as nectin 4, {{has been identified}} as a receptor for MV, CDV and PPRV on the basolateral surface of polarised epithelial cells. PVRL 4 is also up-regulated by MV in human brain endothelial cells. Utilisation of PVRL 4 as a receptor by phocine distemper virus (PDV) remains to be demonstrated as well as confirmation of use of SLAM. We have observed that unlike wild type (wt) MV or wtCDV, wtPDV strains replicate in African green monkey kidney Vero cells without prior adaptation, suggesting the use of a further receptor. We therefore examined candidate molecules, glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and the tetraspan proteins, integrin b and the membrane bound form of heparin binding epithelial growth factor (proHB-EGF),for receptor usage by wtPDV in Vero cells. We show that wtPDV replicates in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing SLAM and PVRL 4. Similar wtPDV titres are produced in Vero and VeroSLAM cells but more limited fusion occurs in the latter. Infection of Vero cells was not inhibited by anti-CD 46 antibody. Removal/disruption of GAG decreased fusion but not the titre of virus. Treatment with anti-integrin b antibody increased rather than decreased infection of Vero cells by wtPDV. However, infection was inhibited by antibody to HB-EGF and the virus replicated in CHO-proHB-EGF cells, indicating use of this molecule as a receptor...|$|E

The disulfide bonds in both proteins are cleaved at the cell surface by the small redox protein, thioredoxin. A thioredoxin kinetic trapping mutant cleaved a single disulfide bond in isolated and cell surface gp 120, but not the gp 160 precursor, {{and the extent of}} the reaction was enhanced when gp 120 was bound to CD 4. The target gp 120 disulfide and its mechanism of cleavage were determined by mass spectrometry analysis of the gp 120 -thioredoxin complex. The Cys 32 sulfur ion of thioredoxin attacks the Cys 296 sulfur ion of the gp 120 V 3 domain Cys 296 -Cys 331 disulfide bond, cleaving the bond. There are 20 possible disulfide bond configurations and, notably, the V 3 domain disulfide has the same unusual &# 150;RHStaple configuration as the Cys 130 -Cys 159 disulfide bond cleaved in CD 4. Considering that V 3 sequences largely determine the chemokine receptor preference of HIV we propose that cleavage of the V 3 domain disulfide, which is facilitated by CD 4 binding, regulates chemokine receptor binding. A conformational change in the V 3 domain as a result of cleavage of the Cys 296 -Cys 331 bond may result in dissociation of chemokine receptor from gp 120, which allows refolding of gp 41 and viralmembrane fusion. Strategies to prevent cleavage of the gp 120 V 3 disulfide bond or the conformational change in the domain following cleavage will inhibit HIV infection...|$|E

40|$|The {{vertebrate}} {{immune system}} has evolved to become particularly good at protecting an organism from extrinsic pathogens such as bacterial and fungal infections. Today {{the cutting edge}} of medicine is trying to manipulate the immune system of cancer patients into attacking their own cancerous cells. This can be facilitated through the use of monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatments targeted towards tumor cell receptors or ligands that are responsible for the flourishing of particular types of cancers. It has been postulated that mAb treatments may work by stimulating the patient’s immune system to kill cancerous cells through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). This process may be responsible in part for the efficacy of these antibody treatments. Curiously, the response of tumors to mAbs varies amongst patients. One hypothesis for this stratification amongst patients is that polymorphisms within <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> genes can influence the affinity of the immune cells to the mAb and hence may control how well the immune system attacks cancer cells. Our study focuses on the relationship between the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies currently used in the clinic for treatment of solid and hematological cancers and polymorphism of the immunoglobin G fragment C receptor. Using 14 studies as evidence, it appears {{that there is not a}} clear cut answer for a relationship between FcγR polymorphisms and efficacy of mAb treatment. Perhaps this is due to the many different kinds of combinational therapies which are used in the clinic. However the trend seems to be that the FcγRIIIa- 158 V/V genotype does improve response to treatment and can provide a longer progression-free survival (PFS) of lymphoma and breast cancer patients. For the FcγRIIa- 131 polymorphism, it appears H-carriers can have a longer median PFS than other patients regardless of tumor response status. We did find that mAb treatments do not correspond with FcR polymorphisms in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Furthermore we find that “stable disease” classification can be linked with longer PFS and could therefore potentially be considered a good prognostic indicator for clinical benefit. Further research needs to be done, potentially with larger patient cohorts and proper controls to come to a definitive answer on if the FcR polymorphisms are a useful predictor of tumor response to mAb treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{hemagglutinin}} (H) protein of {{measles virus}} (MeV) interacts with a cellular receptor which constitutes the initial stage of infection. Binding of H to this host cell receptor subsequently triggers the F protein to activate fusion between virus and host plasma membranes. The search for MeV receptors began with vaccine/laboratory virus strains and evolved to more relevant receptors used by wild-type MeV. Vaccine or laboratory strains of measles virus have been adapted {{to grow in}} common cell lines such as Vero and HeLa cells, and were found to use membrane cofactor protein (CD 46) as a receptor. CD 46 is a regulator that normally prevents cells from complement-mediated self-destruction, and is found {{on the surface of}} all human cells, with the exception of erythrocytes. Mutations in the H protein, which occur during adaptation and allow the virus to use CD 46 as a receptor, have been identified. Wild-type isolates of measles virus cannot use the CD 46 receptor. However, both vaccine/laboratory and wild-type strains can use an <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> called signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family member 1 (SLAMF 1; also called CD 150) and a recently discovered epithelial receptor known as Nectin- 4. SLAMF 1 is found on activated B, T, dendritic, and monocyte cells, and is the initial target for infections by measles virus. Nectin- 4 is an adherens junction protein found at the basal surfaces of many polarized epithelial cells, including those of the airways. It is also over-expressed on the apical and basal surfaces of many adenocarcinomas, and is a cancer marker for metastasis and tumor survival. Nectin- 4 is a secondary exit receptor which allows measles virus to replicate and amplify in the airways, where the virus is expelled from the body in aerosol droplets. The amino acid residues of H protein that are involved in binding to each of the receptors have been identified through X-ray crystallography and site-specific mutagenesis. Recombinant measles “blind” to each of these receptors have been constructed, allowing the virus to selectively infect receptor specific cell lines. Finally, the observations that SLAMF 1 is found on lymphomas and that Nectin- 4 is expressed on the cell surfaces of many adenocarcinomas highlight the potential of measles virus for oncolytic therapy. Although CD 46 is also upregulated on many tumors, it is less useful as a target for cancer therapy, since normal human cells express this protein on their surfaces...|$|E

Elevated inflammation, a common risk factor across diseases of aging, may {{play a key role}} in the relationship between anxiety and physical disease. However, the neurobiological mechanisms linking anxiety with elevated inflammation remain unclear. In this review, we present a neurobiological model of the mechanisms by which anxiety promotes inflammation. Specifically we propose that exaggerated neurobiological sensitivity to threat in anxious individuals may lead to sustained threat perception, which is accompanied by prolonged activation of threat-related neural circuitry and threat-responsive biological systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, autonomic nervous system (ANS), and inflammatory response. Over time, this pattern of responding can promote chronic inflammation through structural and functional brain changes, altered sensitivity of <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors,</b> dysregulation of the HPA axis and ANS, and accelerated cellular aging.

Likewise, Nef induced CXCR 4 degradation was critically dependent on the three lysines in the C-terminal -SSLKILSKGK- motif. Nef directly recruits the HECT domain E 3 ligases AIP 4 or NEDD 4 to CXCR 4 in the resting state. This mechanism was confirmed by ternary interactions of Nef, CXCR 4 and AIP 4 or NEDD 4; by reversal of Nef effect by expression of catalytically inactive AIP 4 -C 830 A mutant; and siRNA knockdown of AIP 4, NEDD 4 or some ESCRT- 0 adapters. However, ubiquitinylation dependent lysosomal degradation {{was not the only}} mechanism by which Nef downregulated CKRs. Agonist and Nef mediated CXCR 2 (and CXCR 1) degradation was ubiquitinylation independent. Nef also profoundly downregulated the naturally truncated CXCR 4 associated with WHIM syndrome and engineered variants of CXCR 4 that resist CXCL 12 induced internalization via an ubiquitinylation independent mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The spatiotemporal {{kinetics}} {{of proteins}} and other substrates regulate cell fate and signaling. In {{this study we}} consider a reaction-di¤usion model of interaction of membrane receptors with two-step kinase cascade. The receptors activate the "upstream " kinase, which may freely di¤use over cell volume and activate the "downstream " kinase, also freely di¤using. Both kinase species and receptors are inactivated by uniformly distributed phosphatases. The positive feedback, key to considered dynamics, arises since the upstream kinase activates receptors. Such mutual interaction is characteristic for <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors,</b> in particular B-cell receptors. Based on the proposed model we demonstrated that cell sensitivity (measured as a critical value of phos-phatase activity by which a cell may be activated) increases with decreasing motility of receptor-interacting kinases and with increasing polarity of receptors distribution. These two e¤ects are cooperating, the e¤ect of receptors localization {{at one of the}} cell poles grows with the decreasing kinase di¤usion, and vanishes in the in 8 ̆ 5 nite di¤usion limit. As the cell sensitivity increases with decreasing di¤usion of receptor-interacting kinase, the overall activity of the downstream kinase increases with its di¤usion. In conclusion, the analysis of the proposed model shows that, for the 8 ̆ 5 xed substrate interaction rates...|$|R
40|$|Transmembrane adaptor {{proteins}} play {{an important}} role in signal transduction cascades emanating from <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> leading to cellular effector mechanisms. Despite the lack of enzymatic function, their sequence contains interaction motifs which organize other proteins in time and space and initiates building of the signaling complexes. Functionally the most important and for the longest time known TRAPs are the ones associated with immune receptors. Their deficiency has severe impacts on the signal transduction and knock-out mice show dramatic phenotypes. The deficiency of Lat - the first discovered TRAP, which is not constitutively associated with immune receptors - has comparable effects on signaling in lymphocytes. The difference between the first group of TRAPs and Lat is not only the type of association with receptors, but also the lack of tyrosine - based activation motifs (ITAMs) in Lat, but Lat contains several other binding motifs also based on the phosphorylation of tyrosine. The group of TRAPs similar to Lat up today contains eight members, but all of them, except of Lat, has only very mild or undetectable phenotype in the knock-out mice. In this work I searched the protein databases for proteins with the characteristics of TRAP using the bioinformatic tools. Based on our [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) pouch young, {{like other}} marsupials, are born {{underdeveloped}} and immunologically naïve, and {{are unable to}} mount an adaptive immune response. The mother’s milk provides nutrients for growth and development {{as well as providing}} passive immunity. To better understand immune response in this endangered species, we set out to characterise the genes involved in passive immunity by sequencing and annotating the transcriptome of a devil milk sample collected during mid-lactation. At mid-lactation we expect the young to have heightened immune responses, as they have emerged from the pouch, encountering new pathogens. A total of 233, 660 transcripts were identified, including approximately 17, 827 unique protein-coding genes and 846 immune genes. The most highly expressed transcripts were dominated by milk protein genes such as those encoding early lactation protein, late lactation proteins, α-lactalbumin, α-casein and β-casein. There were numerous highly expressed immune genes including lysozyme, whey acidic protein, ferritin and major histocompatibility complex I and II. Genes encoding immunoglobulins, antimicrobial peptides, chemokines and <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> were also identified. The array of immune genes identified in this study reflects the importance of the milk in providing immune protection to Tasmanian devil young and provides the first insight into Tasmanian devil milk...|$|R
40|$|Although acute liver {{failure is}} a rare disease, its {{presence}} is associated with high morbidity and mortality in affected patients. While a contribution {{of the immune system}} to the outcome of toxic liver failure is anticipated, functionally relevant <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> for liver <b>cell</b> damage need to be better defined. We here investigate the relevance of the chemokine receptor CXCR 3, which is important for hepatic <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration, in a model of experimental acute liver failure. Liver injury was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) in CXCR 3 -/-, CCR 1 -/-, CCR 5 -/- and wild-type mice. In this model, CXCR 3 -/- mice displayed augmented liver damage compared with all other mouse strains as assessed by liver histology and serum transaminases 24 and 72 h after injury. Phenotypically, CXCR 3 -/- mice had significantly reduced intrahepatic NK and NKT cells after injury at all investigated time points (all P≤ 0. 05), but strongly elevated expression levels of IL 1 -Β, TNF-α and IFN-γ. In line with a functional role of innate <b>immune</b> <b>cells,</b> wild-type mice depleted for NK cells with an anti-ASIALO GM 1 antibody before liver injury also displayed increased liver injury after CCl 4 challenge. CXCR 3 -/- and NK cell-depleted mice show reduced apoptotic liver cells (TUNEL assay), but more necrotic hepatocytes. Functionally, the augmented liver cell necrosis in CXCR 3 -/- and NK cell-depleted mice was associated with increased expression of high mobility group 1 (HMGB 1) protein and a consecutive enhanced infiltration of neutrophils into the liver. In conclusion, the results demonstrate a primarily unexpected beneficial role of CXCR 3 in acute toxic liver injury. These findings should be taken into account when planning trials with CXCR 3 antagonists. © 2012 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Lung {{surfactant}} proteins A and D {{belong to}} a group of soluble humoral pattern recognition receptors, called collectins, which modulate the immune response to microorganisms. They bind essential carbohydrate and lipid antigens found on the surface of microorganisms via low affinity C-type lectin domains and regulate the host's response by binding to <b>immune</b> <b>cell</b> surface <b>receptors.</b> They form multimeric structures that bind, agglutinate, opsonise and neutralize many different pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria, yeast, fungi and viruses. They modulate the uptake of these microorganisms by phagocytic cells as well as both the inflammatory and the adaptive immune responses. Recent data have also highlighted their involvement in clearance of apoptotic cells, hypersensitivity and a number of lung diseases...|$|R
50|$|The {{ability of}} {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs {{to access the}} cancer cells is inhibited by the heavy glycosylation in the extracellular domain of MUC1. The glycosylation creates a highly hydrophilic region which prevents hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drugs from passing through. This prevents the drugs from reaching their targets which usually reside within the cell. Similarly, the glycosylation {{has been shown to}} bind to growth factors. This allows cancer cells which produce a large amount of MUC1 to concentrate growth factors near their receptors, increasing receptor activity and the growth of cancer cells. MUC1 also prevents the interaction of <b>immune</b> <b>cells</b> with <b>receptors</b> on the cancer cell surface through steric hindrance. This inhibits an anti-tumor immune response.|$|R
