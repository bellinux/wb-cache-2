40|$|International audienceAlthough {{groundwater}} arsenic {{constitutes a}} major hazard {{to the health}} of the people of Southeast Asia, the exact mineralogical origin of the arsenic in these fluvial aquifers is still under debate. Fe(III) oxides are the dominant hosts of mobilizable arsenic in the sediments, with the role of secondary Fe(II) -bearing phases like mackinawite, siderite, vivianite, magnetite, and carbonate green rust (fougerite) still unclear. Based on published field data from Chakdaha (India), the importance of the phases for arsenic mobility is evaluated quantitatively using models of growing complexity. Arsenic heterogeneity can be explained by the presence of two contrasted redox zones in the aquifers, with Fe(III) oxides being the dominant sorbent for arsenic in the less reduced zones and Fe(II) sulfides and/or Fe(II) carbonates being the solid-phase hosts for arsenic under more reduced conditions below <b>impermeable</b> <b>soils</b> or close to rivers where sulfate is reduced. A 1 D reactive transport model which simulates the transition between the two environments has been developed and compared to field data.

In this study we evaluate {{the performance of a}} sub-irrigation system for maize cultivated on a lowland soil in the Central Lowland of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, where cultivation of flooded rice predominates. The approach combines Darcy's equation and the models of van Genuchten (1980) and Vogel et al. (2001) to represent the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Marine clay is an <b>im{{permeable}}</b> <b>soil,</b> {{meaning it}} holds water, {{as opposed to}} permeable soil that allows water to rapidly drain, like a gravel or sand. It is also an expansive soil, such as the marine clay which predominates in almost all countries of the world, which when shrinking or expanding, can damage foundations and structures. The shrink and swell movements are due to changes in soil moisture. Providing uniform soil moisture next to and under your foundation is the only best thing to reduce or minimize the damaging effects of expansive soil. These soils are highly saturated, soft, sensitive and normally consolidated. These usually have low density and low shear strength.

40|$|Geologic {{data were}} used to map {{potential}} radon-hazard areas in Utah. The first statewide map identified rock uranium ^ sources, but did not systematically evaluate populated areas underlain by unconsolidated valley fill. Subsequent indoor testing identified high radon levels in some of this valley fill. Detailed geologic studies and targeted indoor surveys were performed in six areas with high indoor-radon levels. Initially, these studies assigned hazard potentials to Quaternary geologic units, assuming that each unit was relatively homogeneous. Indoor-radon levels were used for model validation. Later studies used overlays of specific geologic factors (uranium content, permeability, and ground-water depth) to derive a composite hazard map, with hazard categories independent of geologic units. Soil-gas radon concentrations were used for validation with exclusion isolines, a semiquantitative analysis technique that minimizes the effect of factors which differentially reduce soil-gas radon concentrations. Hazard-potential maps derived from overlays effectively identify potential hot spots, and do not rely upon either geologic or artificial political boundaries to constrain hazard interpretations. The overlay method was used to revise the statewide radon-hazard-potential map, and assessments of hazard potential from detailed field investigations correlate well with those on the revised statewide map. Central Utah has the highest radon-hazard potential, primarily due to uranium-enriched Tertiary volcanic rocks.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} hydrologic effects of {{urbanization}} in two Portland, Oregon streams through {{a comparison of}} three hydrologic metrics. Hydrologic metrics {{used in this study}} are the mean annual runoff ratio (Qa), mean seasonal runoff ratio (Qw and Qd), and the fraction of time that streamflow exceeds the mean streamflow during the year (TQmean). Additionally, the relative change in streamflow in response to storm events was examined for two watersheds. For this investigation urban development is represented by two urbanization metrics: percent impervious and road density. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to evaluate the relationship between the hydrologic metrics and the amount of urban development in each watershed. The effect of watershed size was also investigated using nested watersheds, with watershed size ranging from 6 km 2 to 138 km 2. The results indicate that annual and seasonal runoff ratios have difficulty capturing the dynamic hydrologic behavior in urban watersheds. TQmean was useful at capturing the flashy behavior of the Upper Fanno watershed, however it did not perform as well in Kelley watershed possibly due to the influence of <b>impermeable</b> <b>soils</b> and steep slopes.

It was found that more than 5 % of the study area (total size 16. 8 km 2) was used for farming in backyard gardens and larger open spaces. The proportion of habitats containing Anopheles larvae was 1. 7 times higher in agricultural areas compared to other areas (95 % confidence interval = 1. 56 - 1. 92). Significant geographic predictors of the presence of Anopheles larvae in gardens included location in lowland areas, proximity to river, and relatively <b>impermeable</b> <b>soils.</b> Agriculture-related predictors comprised specific seedbed types, mid-sized gardens, irrigation by wells, as well as cultivation of sugar cane or leafy vegetables.

Food production in southwest Nigeria traditionally occurs on upland ecosystems through rain-fed cultivation. The major means of sustaining soil fertility in this region is through bush-fallowing and application of fertilisers—domestic waste, animal manure and inorganic fertilisers.

The aim {{of this study was to}} relate electrokinetic removal of heavy metals from a contaminated, aged sediment sludge to the metal speciation in the sludge. Metal speciation was determined by a Tessier-based sequential extraction method. Two electro-remediation experiments were conducted in the laboratory in order to investigate removal of metals. The studies were done in a cell designed for a predictive laboratory test of feasibility of electro-remediation of soil. Maximum removal percentages during the experiment using a constant current of 1 mA/cm 2 over ∼ 180 h with a corresponding potential gradient of 0. 5 V/cm were larger than 15 % for Cd (21 %), Cu (15 %), and Zn (23 %); Ni and Pb showed removal less than 10 %; Cr demonstrated no removal. Removal of non-contaminant metals Mn and Ca exceeded that of heavy metals. The removal rates were compared to metal speciation in the non-treated sludge, measured by the sequential extraction. It was observed that the electrokinetic removal did not directly relate to the metal distribution over the fractions within the sludge. The aging of metals and other geochemical characteristics of the contaminated sludge affected the removal of heavy metals. Therefore, sequential extraction alone does not provide a predictive tool for the effectiveness of electro-remediation. Additional geochemical information is needed...|$|R

It then runs alongside the canal, on its western side, disappearing briefly into a culvert, until it flows into the Wom Brook just below Longford.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the long}} history of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Tanzania, extent of its {{suitable}} habitat in the country remains unclear. In this study we investigated potential effects of temperature, precipitation, elevation, soil type, livestock density, rainfall pattern, proximity to wild animals, protected areas and forest on the habitat suitability for RVF occurrence in Tanzania. Presence-only records of 193 RVF outbreak locations from 1930 to 2007 together with potential predictor variables were used to model and map the suitable habitats for RVF occurrence using ecological niche modelling. Ground-truthing of the model outputs was conducted by comparing the levels of RVF virus specific antibodies in cattle, sheep and goats sampled from locations in Tanzania that presented different predicted habitat suitability values. Habitat suitability values for RVF occurrence were higher in the northern and central-eastern regions of Tanzania {{than the rest of the}} regions in the country. Soil type and precipitation of the wettest quarter contributed equally to habitat suitability (32. 4 % each), followed by livestock density (25. 9 %) and rainfall pattern (9. 3 %). Ground-truthing of model outputs revealed that the odds of an animal being seropositive for RVFV when sampled from areas predicted to be most suitable for RVF occurrence were twice the odds of an animal sampled from areas least suitable for RVF occurrence (95 % CI: 1. 43, 2. 76, p < 0. 001). The regions in the northern and central-eastern Tanzania were more suitable for RVF occurrence than the rest of the regions in the country. The modelled suitable habitat is characterised by <b>impermeable</b> <b>soils,</b> moderate precipitation in the wettest quarter, high livestock density and a bimodal rainfall pattern. The findings of this study should provide guidance for the design of appropriate RVF surveillance, prevention and control strategies which target areas with these characteristics...|$|R
