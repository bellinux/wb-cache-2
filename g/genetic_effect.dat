25|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to search for one or more genes contributing to thrift. Modern tools of genome wide association studies have revealed many genes with small effects associated with obesity or type 2 diabetes but all of them together explain only between 1.4 and 10% of population variance. This leaves a large gap between the pregenomic and emerging genomic estimates of heritability of obesity and Type 2 diabetes: sometimes called the 'missing heritability'. The reasons for this discrepancy are not completely understood. A likely possibility is that the missing heritability is explained by rare variants of large effect that are found only in limited populations. These would be impossible to detect by standard whole genome sequencing approaches even with hundreds of thousands of participants. The extreme endpoint of this distribution are the so-called 'monogenic' obesities where most of the impact on body weight can be tied to a mutation in a single gene that runs in a single family. The classic example of such a <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> is the presence of mutations in the leptin gene.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{quantitative}} genetics assumes that an individual’s phenotype {{is determined by}} both genetic and environmental factors. For many animals, part of the environment is social and provided by parents and other interacting partners. When expression of genes in social partners affects trait expression in a focal individual, indirect <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> occur. In this study, we explore the <b>effects</b> of indirect <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> on the magnitude and range of phenotypic values in a focal individual in a multi-member model analyzing three possible classes of interactions between individuals. We show that social interactions may not only cause indirect <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> but can also modify direct <b>genetic</b> <b>effects.</b> Furthermore, we demonstrate that both direct and indirect <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> substantially alter the range of phenotypic values, particularly when a focal trait can influence its own expression via interactions with traits in other individuals. We derive a function predicting {{the relative importance of}} direct versus indirect <b>genetic</b> <b>effects.</b> Our model reveals that both direct and indirect <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> can depend to a large extent on both group size and interaction strength, altering group mean phenotype and variance. This may lead to scenarios where between group variation is much higher than within group variation despite similar underlying genetic properties, potentially affecting the level of selection.

The objectives of this study were to estimate variances of additive, dominance and imprinting <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> and to evaluate predictions of genetic merit based on genomic data for average daily gain (DG) and backfat thickness (BF) in Danish Duroc pigs. MethodsCorrected phenotypes of 8113 genotyped pigs from breeding and multiplier herds were used. Four Bayesian mixture models that differed in the type of <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> included: (A) additive <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> (AD) additive and dominance <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> (AI) additive and imprinting <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> and (ADI) additive, dominance and imprinting <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> were compared using Bayes factors. The ability of the models to predict genetic merit was compared with regard to prediction reliability and bias. ResultsBased on model ADI, narrow-sense heritabilities of 0. 18 and 0. 31 were estimated for DG and BF, respectively. Dominance and imprinting <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> accounted for 4. 0  to  4. 6 and 1. 3  to  1. 4  % of phenotypic variance, respectively, which were statistically significant. Across the four models, reliabilities of the predicted total genetic values (GTV, sum of all <b>genetic</b> <b>effects)</b> ranged from 16. 1 (AI) to 18. 4  % (AD) for DG and from 30. 1 (AI) to 31. 4  % (ADI) for BF. The least biased predictions of GTV were obtained with model AD, with regression coefficients of corrected phenotypes on GTV equal to 0. 824 (DG) and 0. 738 (BF). Reliabilities of genomic estimated breeding values (GBV, additive <b>genetic</b> <b>effects)</b> did not differ significantly among models for DG (between 16. 5 and 16. 7  %); however, for BF, model AD provided a significantly higher reliability (31. 3  %) than model A (30. 7  %). The least biased predictions of GBV were obtained with model AD with regression coefficients of 0. 872 for DG and 0. 764 for BF. ConclusionsDominance and genomic imprinting effects contribute significantly to the genetic variation of BF and DG in Danish Duroc pigs.

40|$|Social {{interactions}} between individuals {{living in a}} group can have {{both positive and negative}} effects on welfare, productivity, and health of these individuals. Negative effects of social interactions in livestock are easier to observe than positive effects. For example, laying hens may develop feather pecking, which can cause mortality due to cannibalism, and pigs may develop tail biting or excessive aggression. Several studies have shown that social interactions affect the genetic variation in a trait. Genetic improvement of socially-affected traits, however, has proven to be difficult until relatively recently. The use of classical selection methods, like individual selection, may result in selection responses opposite to expected, because these methods neglect the effect of an individual on its group mates (social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects).</b> It has become clear that improvement of socially-affected traits requires selection methods that take into account not only the direct effect of an individual on its own phenotype but also the social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> also known as indirect <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> of an individual on the phenotypes of its group mates. Here, we review the theoretical and empirical work on social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> with a focus on livestock. First, we present the theory of social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects.</b> Subsequently, we evaluate the evidence for social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> in livestock and other species, by reviewing estimates of genetic parameters for direct and social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects.</b> Then we describe the results of different selection experiments. Finally, we discuss issues concerning the implementation of social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> in livestock breeding programs. In our opinion, this review demonstrates that selection for socially-affected traits, using methods that target both the direct and social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> is a promising, but sometimes difficult to use in practice, tool to simultaneously improve production and welfare in livestock...|$|R
40|$|Assessing {{the impact}} of the social {{environment}} on health and disease is challenging. As social effects are in part determined by the genetic makeup of social partners, they can be studied from associations between genotypes of one individual and phenotype of another (social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> SGE, also called indirect <b>genetic</b> <b>effects).</b> For the first time we quantified the contribution of SGE to more than 100 organismal phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression measured in laboratory mice. We find that genetic variation in cage mates (i. e. SGE) contributes to variation in organismal and molecular measures related to anxiety, wound healing, immune function, and body weight. Social <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> explained up to 29 % of phenotypic variance, and for several traits their contribution exceeded that of direct <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> (effects of an individual's genotypes on its own phenotype). Importantly, we show that ignoring SGE can severely bias estimates of direct <b>genetic</b> <b>effects</b> (heritability). Thus SGE may be an important source of "missing heritability" in studies of complex traits in human populations. In summary, our study uncovers an important contribution of the social environment to phenotypic variation, sets the basis for using SGE to dissect social effects, and identifies an opportunity to improve studies of direct <b>genetic</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
