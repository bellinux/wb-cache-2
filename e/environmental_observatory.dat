40|$|The Rur {{observatory}} {{is part of}} the Terrestrial <b>Environmental</b> <b>Observatories</b> (TERENO) Initiative of the German Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft. The {{main goal}} of the infrastructure measure TERENO will be to create observation platforms on the basis of an interdisciplinary and long-term aimed research program for the investigation of consequences of Global Change for terrestrial ecosystems and the socioeconomic implications. Rur observatory is also part of the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS-D) initiative. The region encompasses the catchment basins of the Rur and Erft rivers, which are located in the Belgian-Dutch-German border region near the cities of Aachen and Cologne. The site can be separated into two main regions. The southern part covers the bedrock of the Eifel mountains, with a high longterm annual precipitation of 850 – 1300 mm. This region consists of Devonian and Carboniferous sedimentary rocks with low permeability and small groundwater storage volumes, causing water runoff primarily linked to the fissure system. The northern region is characterized by soils evolved from loess, which accumulated on Tertiary and Quaternary depositions of the Rivers Rhine and Meuse. It has a relatively low annual precipitation of 650 – 850 mm. In accordance with this hydrogeological and climatic division, the land use types are clearly distinguishable. Forest and grassland characterize the south, whereas in the north, fertile agricultural land predominates. The advantage of the REC test region is the already installed multiple sensor systems of the TERENO (Terrestrial <b>Environmental</b> <b>Observatories)</b> initiative, which can be used for SMAP Cal/Val. Despite of the cosmic ray probe network and the precipitation radar systems, in-situ data were made available from three highly instrumented test sites, namely Selhausen, Wüstebach, and Rollesbroich...|$|R

40|$|LONG-TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH (LTER) {{facilitates}} {{the understanding of}} long-term environmental processes and episodic changes at local to global scales. The <b>Environmental</b> Long-Term <b>Observatories</b> Network of Southern Africa (ELTOSA) is a regional LTER network of country <b>Environmental</b> <b>Observatories</b> Networks (EON) encompassing the natural environments and their socio-economic context. EON involves the documentation, analysis and information dissemination concerning long-term (decades to centuries), large-scale (ecosystem, biome, continental, global) ecological and socio-economic processes. These are elucidated through multidisciplinary research and monitoring over a network of institutionally operated field observation sites. Basic functions concern fieldwork, data management and sharing, analyses and interpretation, and information dissemination, all operated {{in such a way}} as to benefit most from cooperation among professionals and with resource managers at all levels. Requirements for continuity include programmatic tenure and funding, data archiving, data sharing, training, and networking. EON involves networking at four scales. First, the level of the EON centre inter-connects specific study plots over time and space, and facilitates collaboration between researchers and students using the centre. Second, the country network level inter-connects several institutions and programmes with common goals and activities. Third, the regional network level, such as ELTOSA, promotes subcontinental programmes, synergy, and complementarity. Fourth, the global network (ILTER, International Long-Term Ecological Research Network) facilitates planning and information exchange concerning such programmes across the world. This position paper describes the current status and character of ELTOSA, sets out to solicit programmatic support from funders and policy-makers, and intends to serve as a discussion focus for its further dynamic development.
