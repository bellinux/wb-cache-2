The increase is not only for industry and large-scale applications but also for small or housing scale systems. For the latter case, the PV system components especially battery and module commonly used are usually the ones which are widely available and easily bought in traditional markets or shops. Therefore, the present study will investigate the performance of battery and module for a PV system which are mainly available in the traditional shops and commonly used for small scale system.

5000|$|The term [...] "flooded" [...] is {{used because}} {{this type of}} battery {{contains}} a quantity of electrolyte fluid so that the plates are completely submerged. The electrolyte level should be above the tops of plates {{which serves as a}} reservoir to make sure that water loss during charging does not lower the level below the plate tops and cause damage. Flooded batteries will decompose some water from the electrolyte during charging, so regular maintenance of <b>flooded</b> <b>batteries</b> requires inspection of electrolyte level and addition of water. Major modes of failure of deep-cycle batteries are loss of the active material due to shedding of the plates, and corrosion of the internal grid that supports active material. The capacity of a deep cycle battery is usually limited by electrolyte capacity and not by the plate mass, to improve life expectancy.|$|R

It examines six in-depth case studies undertaken in urban agglomerations (Dordrecht, Hull, Geraardsbergen, Karlstad, Wroclaw and Nice) in different European countries (The Netherlands, UK, Belgium, Sweden, Poland and France). The case studies reveal the ways in which multiple levels of governance are involved in <b>enhancing</b> urban <b>flood</b> resilience. Coordination between the governance levels is achieved by pro-active policy entrepreneurs, the use of bridging concepts, clear rules and by the provision of resources.

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) {{power systems}} offer the {{prospect}} of allowing a utility company to meet part of the daily peak system load using a renewable resource. Unfortunately, some utilities have peak system- load periods that do not match the peak production hours of a PV system. Adding a battery energy storage system to a grid-connected PV power system will allow dispatching the stored solar energy to the grid at the desired times. Batteries, however, pose system limitations in terms of energy efficiency, maintenance, and cycle life. A new control system has been developed, based on available PV equipment and a data acquisition system, that seeks to minimize the limitations imposed by the battery system while maximizing the use of PV energy.

In addition, a close and complex relationship exists between land use change and climate change (Tu 2009; Karlsson et al. 2016; Yan et al. 2016). The link between climate fluctuations/change and land use change is an extremely important layer of complexity in managing flooding in a catchment.

40|$|The Venetian–Friulian Plain is {{the northernmost}} {{alluvial}} environment facing the Adriatic Sea and {{it represents the}} transition from theMediterranean domain to the Alps and the temperate regions {{of central and eastern}} Europe. The investigated area consists of the alluvial systems of Brenta, Piave and Tagliamento rivers, forming distinct alluvial megafans fed bymountain basins of 1567, 3899 and 2580 km 2, respectively. The database of radiocarbon dates related to theHolocene alluvial evolution of the Venetian–Friulian Plain consists of 136 samples, 65 of them classified as change-after dates. We analyzed statistically the database with the aim of detecting periods of <b>enhanced</b> <b>flooding</b> activity. The individual calibration probability intervals of each radiocarbon age were summed, producing a cumulative probability density function (CPDF) plot for each alluvial systemand for thewhole database. Each change-after CPDF plot has been subtracted to its correspondent CPDF plot of the entire sub-dataset, obtaining a relative cumulative probability function (RCPF) curve. The analysis of these curves evidences that statistically significant information are available between about 8. 5 and 0. 8 ka cal BP. In particular, nine periods of <b>enhanced</b> <b>flooding</b> activity have been identified: 8. 4 – 8. 3, 7. 5 – 7. 2, 6. 9 – 6. 2, 5. 5 – 5. 3, 4. 7 – 4. 5, 2. 3 – 2. 1, 1. 9 – 1. 7, 1. 6 – 1. 4 and 1. 3 – 0. 8 ka cal BP. In the interval 8. 5 – 0. 8 ka cal BP, some sub-periods are not statistically significant because of the relatively fewchange-after dates available. Notably, between 4. 5 and 2. 3 ka cal BP no interval has been recognized, even if some important flooding deposits are documented in the stratigraphic and geomorphological record. Meta-analyses revealed quite a good correlation of several flooding periods occurred in the study area with the flooding record of the Lake Iseo (northern Italy), as well as with positive peaks in the Ice Rafted Debris (IRD) curve for the North Atlantic, namely Bond events 1, 3, 4 and 5. Comparison with other flood sequences obtained in Great Britain, Spain, Poland and Germany with the same statistical approach used in this work confirms the presence of some common intervals. In particular, synchronous periods of hydrological crisis are recorded in NE Italy and Great Britain at 7. 5 – 7. 3, 6. 9 – 6. 5, 6. 3 – 6. 2, 4. 7 – 4. 5, 2. 3 – 2. 1, 1. 5 – 1. 4, 1. 3 – 1. 1, 0. 9 – 0. 8 ka cal BP. Two of them, 4. 7 – 4. 5 and 0. 9 – 0. 8 ka cal BP, occurred also in the Iberian Peninsula. These results suggest that during the middle and late Holocene <b>enhanced</b> <b>flooding</b> activity in NE Italy is recurrently connected to events or phases of climatic deterioration at regional and continental scale, with minor influence of local forcings...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA stratigraphic and chronological {{study of}} the upper level of Renella Cave (Apuan Alps, Central Italy) reveals that two episodes of flowstone {{accumulation}} bracket a thick clastic layer deposited between ca 8. 2 and 7. 1 ka. This layer, which represents a period of <b>enhanced</b> cave <b>flooding,</b> is substantially in phase with an interval of depleted oxygen isotope values previously recorded in a stalagmite from nearby Corchia Cave, interpreted to have resulted from an increase in local precipitation. These data confirm that {{during this period of}} time the region experienced relatively wetter conditions, including an increase in high-magnitude events capable of invading the higher passages of Renella Cave. The timing of the clastic phase occurred when the Eastern Mediterranean experienced deposition of sapropel layer S 1, which is thought to reflect the stagnation of sea water produced largely by <b>enhanced</b> <b>flood</b> activity along the Nile in response to increased monsoon intensity in northern equatorial Africa. Recent estimates suggest that S 1 may have lasted from ca 10. 8 to ca 6. 1 ka cal BP. Combined evidence from Renella and Corchia Cave indicates that the period corresponding to the wettest phase in the Apuan Alps was much shorter than this, and suggests that there is no straightforward connection between increased advection of water vapour from the Atlantic between 8. 2 and 7. 1 ka, as recorded in the Corchia and Renella records, and monsoon-driven enhancement of Nile discharge and S 1 deposition in the eastern Mediterranean...|$|R
