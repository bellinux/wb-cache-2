Methods: PC 12 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of <b>isoquercitrin</b> for 4, 8 and 12 hours and incubated with 6 -OHDA for 24 hours to induce oxidative cell damage. Results: A significant cytoprotective activity was observed in <b>isoquercitrin</b> pre-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner. There was a significant increase (P < 0. 01) in the antioxidant enzymes namely superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione in <b>isoquercitrin</b> pretreated cells compared to cells incubated with 6 -OHDA alone. <b>Isoquercitrin</b> significantly reduced (P < 0. 01) lipid peroxidation in 6 -OHDA treated cells.

Flavonoids are natural molecules known for having beneficial effects on brain health through diverse molecular pathways. Cytoskeletal changes occurring during neuritogenesis and synapse formation often involve Rho GTPases. Here we hypothesized that the flavonoid <b>isoquercitrin</b> promotes neuronal differentiation through Rho signalling. Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed time lapse imaging of NG 108 - 15 cells during incubation with/without <b>isoquercitrin.</b> <b>Isoquercitrin</b> stimulated extensive neurites enriched in the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin- 1. Neurite extension was augmented by the ROCK inhibitor Y- 27632 suggesting an inactivation of RhoA/Rho kinase as the mechanism. To test this, we first measured the dose-dependent effect of <b>isoquercitrin</b> on RhoA activity and found a 47 % reduction in RhoA activity at concentrations which induced neurites ($ 40 mM). Secondly, we tested the ability of <b>isoquercitrin</b> to rescue the neural phenotype in a model of RhoA-induced neurite retraction and found that 40 mM <b>isoquercitrin</b> added to cultures previously treated with the RhoA activator calpeptin produced significantly more neurite length/cell than calpeptin alone.

Serine/threonine kinases are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention in oncology {{due to their}} role in cellular phosphorylation and altered expression in cancer. Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, inhibits multiple cancer cell lines and is used as an anticancer drug in Phase I clinical trial.

Esterification of <b>isoquercitrin</b> was accomplished by direct chemoenzymatic reaction using Novozym 435 (lipase from Candida antarctica), which accepted C 5 - to C 12 -dicarboxylic acids; the shorter ones, such as oxalic (C 2), malonic (C 3), succinic (C 4) and maleic (C 4) acids were not substrates of the lipase. Lipophilicity of monocarboxylic acid derivatives, measured as log P, increased with the chain length. Esters with glutaric and adipic acids exhibited hydrophilicity, and the dodecanedioic acid hemiester was more lipophilic. All derivatives were less able to reduce Folin–Ciocalteau reagent (FCR) and scavenge DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) than isoquercitrin; ABTS (2, 2 ′-azinobis-(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid)) radical-scavenging activity was comparable. Dodecanoate and palmitate were the least active in FCR and ABTS scavenging; dodecanoate and hemiglutarate were the strongest DPPH scavengers. In contrast, most derivatives were much better inhibitors of microsomal lipoperoxidation than isoquercitrin; butyrate and hexanoate were the most efficient. Anti-lipoperoxidant activity of monocarboxylic derivatives, except acetates, decreased with increasing aliphatic chain. The opposite trend was noted for dicarboxylic acid hemiesters, <b>isoquercitrin</b> hemidodecanedioate being the most active. Overall, IQ butyrate, hexanoate and hemidodecanedioate are the most promising candidates for further studies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHelping neurons to {{compensate}} for proteotoxic stress and maintain function over time (neuronal compensation) has therapeutic potential in aging and neurodegenerative disease. The stress response factor FOXO 3 is neuroprotective in models of Huntington’s disease (HD), Parkinson’s disease and motor-neuron diseases. Neuroprotective compounds acting in a FOXO-dependent manner could thus constitute bona fide drugs for promoting neuronal compensation. However, whether FOXO-dependent neuroprotection is a common feature of several compound families remains unknown. Using drug screening in C. elegans nematodes with neuronal expression of human exon- 1 huntingtin (128 Q), we found that 3 ß-Methoxy-Pregnenolone (MAP 4343), 17 ß-oestradiol (17 ßE 2) and 12 flavonoids including <b>isoquercitrin</b> promote neuronal function in 128 Q nematodes. MAP 4343, 17 ßE 2 and <b>isoquercitrin</b> also promote stress resistance in mutant Htt striatal cells derived from knock-in HD mice. Interestingly, daf- 16 /FOXO is required for MAP 4343, 17 ßE 2 and <b>isoquercitrin</b> to sustain neuronal function in 128 Q nematodes. This similarly applies to the GSK 3 inhibitor lithium chloride (LiCl) and, as previously described, to resveratrol and the AMPK activator metformin. Daf- 16 /FOXO and the targets engaged by these compounds define a sub-network enriched for stress-response and neuronally-active pathways. Collectively, these data highlights the dependence on a daf- 16 /FOXO-interaction network as a common feature of several compound families for prolonging neuronal function in HD...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{consumption}} {{and use of}} dietary supplements containing concentrated phytochemicals (e. g. flavonoids) increased dramatically. Flavonoids, as foreign compounds (xenobiotics), have great potential to modulate the activity of cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs), xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes involved in the activation and detoxification of food and environmental carcinogens. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the effects of model glycosylated and deglycosylated flavonoids on CYPs in rat liver and small intestine, as the two main organs responsible for xenobiotic metabolism, after p. o. administration by gastric gavages. The effects of two glycosylated flavonoids (<b>isoquercitrin,</b> rutin) and their aglycone (quercetin) on CYPs were determined using Western blotting technique and specific activity assays with alkyl-resorufin derivatives. In liver microsomes, a considerable increase of all the measured marker activities (EROD, MROD, PROD) was observed only after <b>isoquercitrin</b> treatment. To evaluate the effects of flavonoids on CYPs along small intestine, the tissue was dissected into proximal (near pylorus), middle and distal parts. Of all the tested compounds, <b>isoquercitrin</b> was the most efficient CYP inducer, namely in the middle part of small intestine. Obtained data demonstrate the different effects of flavonoid glycosides and aglycone on CYP expression in rat liver and small intestine. Since these phytochemicals are xenobiotics, and thus they can increase the human risk of cancer development, their consumption in large quantities should be carefully considered...|$|E

Some species of this genus as O. puberula and O. quixos {{have been described}} in the literature, showing antibacterial activity. And Ocotea macrophylla showed anti-inflammatory activity with inhibition of COX- 1, COX- 2, and LOX- 5. The {{purpose of this study}} was the phytochemical investigation of the plant species Ocotea notata from Restinga Jurubatiba National Park, Macaé, RJ, Brazil, and the search for antimycobacterial fractions and compounds. The crude extract was evaluated for antimycobacterial activity and presented 95. 75 ± 2. 53 % of growth inhibition at 100 [*]µg/mL. Then, it was subjected to a liquid-liquid partition and subsequently was chemically investigated by HPLC, revealing the major presence of flavonoids. In this process the partition fractions hexane, ethyl acetate, and butanol are shown to be promising in the antimycobacterial assay. In addition, ethyl acetate fraction was chromatographed and afforded two flavonoids identified by MS and NMR as afzelin and <b>isoquercitrin.</b> The isolated flavonoids afzelin and <b>isoquercitrin</b> were evaluated for their antimycobacterial activity and for their ability to inhibit NO production by macrophages stimulated by LPS; both flavonoids <b>isoquercitrin</b> (Acet 22) and afzelin (Acet 32) were able to inhibit the production of NO by macrophages.

40|$|International audienceThe regioselective {{behaviour}} of the Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) towards two flavonoid glycosides, rutin and <b>isoquercitrin,</b> in the acetylation {{reaction was}} investigated through molecular modelling. A protocol constituted by a Monte Carlo-based docking procedure and classical force fields calculations {{was applied to}} find probable binding modes of the substrates inside the catalytic cavity and optimize the corresponding complexes. The analysis of these complexes allowed identifying productive ones (that means, those able {{to lead to the}} formation of the ester product) according to three parameters: (1) protein distortion; (2) stability of hydrogen bond interactions with the oxyanion hole residues; (3) localization of hydroxyl groups with regard to the region comprised between the catalytic histidine and serine residues. Results showed that the aglycon part of both rutin and <b>isoquercitrin</b> was localized at the entrance of the binding pocket, stabilized by hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. The sugar part of the flavonoidswas placed close to the pocket bottom. In particular, only the primary 6 " -OH of the <b>isoquercitrin</b> glucose and the secondary 4 '" -OH of the rutin rhamnosewere expected to be acetylated, as theywere the only ones to stabilize simultaneously near to the catalytic histidine and the acetate bound to the catalytic serine. These findings are in accordance with experimental data and give a suitable explanation, at an atomic level, of the regioselectivity of CALB in the flavonoid glycosides acetylation...|$|E
