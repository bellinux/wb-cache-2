40|$|Background: The {{environment}} and the design of auditing regulation can vary significantly between countries, which can affect the form, content {{and quality of the}} audit report. The purpose of the International Standards on Auditing, ISA, is to facilitate the work for auditors on an international basis. Sweden today follows the RS 600 which is based on ISA 600, which contains standards for when an auditor use work performed by other auditor. In October 2007, came a revised and redrafted version of ISA 600 that will be enforced in Sweden in the audit of the financial year beginning on 1 January 2011. To what degree the new requirements will affect the group audit is clearly dependent on how the reporting, evaluation and instructions between the <b>group</b> <b>auditor</b> and other auditor has been carried out previously. Aim: The aim with this paper is to explain the reporting between the <b>group</b> <b>auditor</b> and other auditor in an international corporate group. The aim is also to study the factors that can influence the final outcome of this report and why they affect the outcome. Furthermore, the paper will discuss the report process changes that could take place between the <b>group</b> <b>auditor</b> and other auditor after the introduction of ISA 600. Definitions: This paper has a geographic delimitation to Sweden. The paper is delimited to only consider auditing of corporate groups whose parent is located in Sweden and subsidiaries are located abroad. This means that respondents are bounded to the group auditors. Completion and results: Factors affecting reporting between auditors in an international corporate group turned out primarily to be language and communication differences, differences in accounting standards and determination of the materiality level. The risks are considered minimized through documentation reviews and both internal- and external quality controls. An understanding of social and cultural differences is a key factor {{to be able to have}} successful cross cultural collaborations. Education, experience and practise are the solutions to understand this issue. This paper demonstrates that cross-cultural training is not given at the accounting firms, which are proposed to be a beneficial investment. The instructions and contact with other auditors are expected to be put earlier after the introduction of ISA 600, also that the report itself will be more detailed...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a process-based {{investigation}} {{of the sources of}} variation in expert-like task behavior between individuals who would otherwise be considered as members of a homogenous <b>group.</b> <b>Auditor</b> expertise is explored by means of a model based on behavior automaticity, a widely recognized indicator of expertise in the performance of a task. The model’s three major features are: first, quantitative measures of the effects on task automaticity due to differences between auditors in the accessibility of their knowledge, its rate of utilization in a task, and the particular mix of behaviors that characterize their task strategies; second, a hierarchical presentation of the underlying phenomena that determine how relative expertise in a task is perceived that, in classic reductionist fashion, explains higher level perceptions in terms of lower level phenomena, patterns among which can lead to a richer characterization of relative expertise than is permitted by use of the unidimensional criterion of behavior automaticity; third, identification of specific aspects of the observer-observed system through which assessments of behavior are made, together with guidance for quantifying and incorporating them into expertise evaluations. The submersion of information through aggregation in assessments based on norms and higher level phenomena; strong, weak, and non-complementary phenomena; and the assurances and cautions that are associated with each of these are discussed and illustrated...|$|E

Thus, this paper seeks to empirically examine the effect of auditor switching and corporate governance on financial performance of Malaysian PLCs. Secondary data on a total number of 100 PLCs from years 2009 to 2013 are used. The results reveal that the effect of auditor switching on performance does not vary with duality role and the board size. However, the independent director does not cause a good firm performance. Nonetheless, auditors do not have a direct effect on financial performance since they are not directly involved with the management of the firms which negates the results of previous study. Therefore, this paper has vital impact in that regulators and the public need to be educated through awareness campaigns to emphasize on the auditors' roles as agents in understanding the impact of the association between corporate governance and financial performance. Furthermore, auditor switching should embrace not only rotation of audit partners, but rotation of audit firms as well in view that this will help in infusing discipline from the top {{to the bottom of the}} audit firms and the companies...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to further contribute to the auditor switching literature by examining the reasons client companies in South Africa switch auditors, where the topic has not previously been studied and following a period of rapid and significant change in the auditing profession. Using previous literature as a foundation, forty-four variables that contribute to auditor switching are presented and tested based on empirical data elicited by means of a questionnaire survey of sample companies that experienced auditor switching during the period 1 January 1998 to 30 June 1999 as obtained from Practitioners in the KwaZulu-Natal Region. The factors motivating auditor switching were based on a questionnaire response of seventy-five companies (response rate 67 %). The empirical study also tested whether or not the switch variables thus identified are statistically related to auditor switching. The findings of this study revealed that audit fees are both the most frequently cited reason for switching auditors and found to be statistically significant at the 0. 05 level of significance. Dissatisfaction over the overall quality of services provided by the auditor, lack of communication including the lack of responsiveness to client needs, poor working relationship with audit partner followed as switch factors but were not found to be statistically significant at 0. 05 level.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the consequences, in Denmark between 1984 and 2006, of {{the implementation}} of the European EU Eighth Directive on the qualification of statutory auditors. Although the Eighth Directive envisaged one <b>group</b> of statutory <b>auditors</b> in each Member State, there were two <b>groups</b> of <b>auditors</b> in Denmark, and {{the implementation of the}} Directive triggered a long conflict between the two groups about the education of the second-tier auditors. The analysis is {{based on the work of}} Abbott ((1988)) on professional jurisdictional disputes and shows how the local implementation of the Eighth Directive on auditor qualifications disturbed the balance of the 'system of professions' in Denmark and gave rise to an intra-professional conflict over the statutory audit jurisdiction. The jurisdictional dispute dragged on for two decades because of the complexity of the Danish regulatory system, where audit regulation takes place in overlapping committees between the profession, the state and the educational institutions. It was finally settled by educational differentiation of the two groups, and we discuss the implications of this settlement for the process of audit harmonisation in Europe. ...|$|R

40|$|Internal control {{evaluation}} {{is an area}} in which IAs and EAs interface. IAs review internal controls which are evaluated, and often relied upon, by EAs. It is now mandatory for UK listed companies to report in their annual reports whether they are complying with the Cadbury Code and, if not, why not. IAs are likely {{to be involved in the}} preparation of the internal control report since they are responsible for reviewing internal control. EAs have the responsibility of reviewing the internal control report. So, cooperation between the two <b>groups</b> of <b>auditors</b> is important. Both should be interested in any systematic differences which may exist between their judgement patterns. This study investigated this similarity assumption. Specifically, it examined whether IAs made similar judgements to EAs by means of a mailed questionnaire using a pre-answered internal control questionnaire (ICQ) for a payroll internal control system. This is, to the researcher's knowledge, the first empirical study to investigate such possible differences in the UK, and it must be treated as preliminary and exploratory. The answers to 8 internal control procedures (ICPs) were varied to produce 8 different cases. Each auditor received 8 cases which comprised: (a) 6 cases which were similar for all the EAs and IAs and (b) 2 cases which were similar for a pair of auditors (one EA and one IA). The 2 cases further contained: (i) 1 case which followed a 1 / 4 replicate of 2 8 design and (ii) 1 case which was the repeat of the case in (1). The 6 similar cases were able to test for "judgement consensus" amongst all auditors; that is to find out whether the auditors gave a similar rating to the 6 cases. One of the 6 cases had all the 8 ICPs present and this represented the "ICQ approach" as the case was presented using an ICQ. In addition to that, the same case was presented in two other ways to test for similarity of judgements of auditors using different techniques/approaches of evaluation. The first was the "control objectives" (CO) approach which is a control matrix with the 8 ICPs presented on the rows and 5 "control objectives" presented as columns. The auditors were required to match the ability of each ICP to achieve the 5 control objectives and they were then required to rate the ability of the overall internal control system to achieve the control objectives. The second presentation was the "control risk" (CR) approach which also had all the 8 ICPs presented on the rows and one column for the control risk rating. The auditors were required to rate the extent of "control risk" for each ICP. "Control risk" is the ability of each ICP to prevent or detect material errors from occurring. The auditors were also required to rate the "control risk" for the overall internal control system, that is the ability of the overall internal control system to prevent or detect "material errors" from occurring. There were two purposes for the 2 similar cases: (a) the case which followed the experimental design was to determine the judgement model of EAs and IAs as a group and (b) the repeat case was to test for "judgement consistency" amongst individual auditors, that is to find out whether the individual auditor gave a similar rating to the 2 cases. A judgement model, based on Kempthorne's 1 / 4 replicate of 28 design was determined for each <b>group</b> of <b>auditors</b> using 64 EAs' and 64 IAs' ratings. In this design, all main effects and all 28, two-cue interactions were estimable. Three-cue interactions were not intended to be measured as previous studies had indicated that they account for no or negligible interaction. The purpose of this design was so that the effects of a number of different variables could be investigated simultaneously. The judgement model was analysed by means of analysis of covariance with the personal profiles of auditors (experience, educational and position level) as covariates and the ICPs as the other independent variables. Overall, the findings indicate that there was no significant difference in judgement consensus between and within each group of EAs and IAs. The two groups were also consistent in their ratings when given similar cases to evaluate. Visually, it can be seen that EAs tend to give higher ratings to all the cases. In other words there may be a tendency for EAs to place a higher degree of reliance upon particular controls than would IAs, but it was found to be not statistically significant. There was also no significant difference found between both <b>groups</b> of <b>auditors</b> using different techniques or approaches of evaluation. They were closest in their ratings when they used the "ICQ" approach, followed by the "CO" approach and then the "CR" approach. The final judgement models of both <b>groups</b> of <b>auditors</b> were also quite similar. Both <b>groups</b> of <b>auditors</b> considered the same five ICPs (which consist of two "accounting" and three "administrative" control procedures). Consistent with previous studies, the two separation of duties procedures were found to be important in influencing the auditor's judgement. Comparing the research findings with the US results (Bailey, 1981; Landry, 1987 and Moore, 1993), it appears that there is greater judgement consensus between UK's IAs and EAs than between US's IAs and EAs. This is likely to be accounted for by a greater degree of similarity of professional qualifications and background of UK's IAs and EAs than may have been the case in the US. However, this belief deserves further study. Another implication of the findings is that there is an even stronger justification for IAs and EAs to rely on each other's work in the UK than would appear to be the case in the US. Thus, a directors' internal control report (the preparation of which IAs have had a significant input) can be relied upon more confidently by EAs...|$|R

The purpose of auditing the UMLS is to detect such inconsistencies and to suggest how to resolve them while observing the requirement of fully representing the content of each source in the UMLS. A software tool, called the Neighborhood Auditing Tool (NAT), that facilitates UMLS auditing is presented. The NAT supports “neighborhood-based” auditing, where, at any given time, an auditor concentrates on a single-focus concept and one {{of a variety of}} neighborhoods of its closely related concepts. Typical diagrammatic displays of concept networks have a number of shortcomings, so the NAT utilizes a hybrid diagram/text interface that features stylized neighborhood views which retain some of the best features of both the diagrammatic layouts and text windows while avoiding the shortcomings. The NAT allows an auditor to display knowledge from both the Metathesaurus (concept) level and the Semantic Network (semantic type) level. Various additional features of the NAT that support the auditing process are described. The usefulness of the NAT is demonstrated through a group of case studies. Its impact is tested with a study involving a select <b>group</b> of <b>auditors...</b>|$|R

We wanted to observe how different <b>groups</b> of <b>auditor</b> concern about gifts and relations with the clients, why we classified the auditors in six different dependent variables such as gender, education, experience, firm size, fee size and province. The results showed that fee size affects the auditors’ tendency to accept gifts and have a relationship with the clients. Auditor tends to accept more gifts and have a closer relationship with clients who generate smaller fee. The study also showed that firm size affects the auditor’s tendency to have relationship with their clients. The big four are better inclined to have closer relationship with their clients than smaller firms...|$|R

Prior studies indicate that prestigious auditors or underwriters (e. g., Big 6 auditors) are associated with IPO underpricing. I extend existing literature by incorporating market share as a refined measure of auditor (underwriter) reputation. In particular, I define a differentiated auditor (underwriter) as the market leader that possesses significantly higher market share than their competitors in the client industry. I hypothesize {{that the impact of}} auditor (underwriter) reputation in the IPO setting depends on whether the audit firm (underwriter) has successfully differentiated itself from competitors within client industries. My results show that as audit firm (underwriter) industry market share increases without differentiation, the IPO underpricing increases. It appears that this <b>group</b> of <b>auditors</b> (underwriters) intentionally engages in high-risk IPOs in order to gain fee advantages. In contrast, differentiated auditors (underwriters) are related to lower IPO underpricing because their reputation assist in reducing information asymmetry between issuers and investors. My study is important because it shows that the benefits previously thought to be attributable to a very large set of auditors and underwriters stems primar...|$|R
