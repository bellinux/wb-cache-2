[...] Intense prolonged exercise produces metabolic waste heat, and this is removed by sweat-based thermoregulation. A male marathon runner loses each hour around 0.83 L in cool weather and 1.2 L in warm (losses in females are about 68 to 73% lower). People doing heavy exercise may lose two and half times as much fluid in sweat as urine. This can have profound physiological effects. Cycling for 2 hours in the heat (35nbsp&°C) with minimal fluid intake causes body mass decline by 3 to 5%, blood volume likewise by 3 to 6%, body temperature to rise constantly, and in comparison with proper fluid intake, higher heart rates, lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs, reduced skin blood flow, and higher systemic vascular resistance. These effects are largely eliminated by replacing 50 to 80% of the fluid lost in sweat.|$|E

5000|$|In this variation, the <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> while {{standing}} (or {{sitting on a}} device with a low backing—that allows the shoulders full range of movement). With respect to gravity, the weight is still lifted in the same manner. With respect to the body, the weight is instead held over the head rather than over the face.|$|E
50|$|It {{can also}} be {{executed}} by using a weight, such as a barbell, to provide resistance to {{the action of the}} calf muscles. The <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> from a seated position while the weight rests on the upper leg, just above the knee. The person engaged in this exercise lifts the weight by pushing down on the balls of the feet.|$|E
50|$|ER is {{more likely}} to occur when strenuous <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> under high {{temperatures}} and humidity. Poor hydration levels before, during, and after strenuous bouts of exercise have also been reported to lead to ER. This condition and its signs and symptoms are not well known amongst the sport and fitness community and because of this it is believed that the incidence is greater but highly underreported.|$|E
40|$|Self-selected {{exercise}} {{seems to}} promote positive affective responses {{due to the}} perceived autonomy associated with it. The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the magnitude of differences in Feeling Scale (FS) responses during self-selected and imposed exercise sessions. The PRISMA Statement was adopted for this meta-analysis. The search used PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases. A total of 10 studies that compared the effects of self-selected and imposed exercise sessions on acute FS responses were included. The screening strategy included: exclusion of studies that were duplicated between databases, abstract screening, and text screening. The standardized mean difference (SMD) between self-selected and imposed exercise sessions categorized in five intensities (equal intensity: both <b>exercises</b> <b>were</b> <b>performed</b> at the same intensity, below lactate/ventilatory threshold (LT/VT) : imposed <b>exercise</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> at an intensity below the LT/VT, at LT/VT: imposed <b>exercise</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> at the LT/VT intensity, above LT/VT: imposed <b>exercise</b> <b>was</b> <b>performed</b> at an intensity above the LT/VT, and different intensity: both <b>exercises</b> <b>were</b> <b>performed</b> at different intensities and the intensity of imposed session was not reported relative to LT/VT) and an overall SMD <b>were</b> calculated. Self-selected <b>exercise</b> <b>was</b> used as the reference condition. The subtotal SMD values were as follows: -. 10 (equal intensity), -. 36 (below LT/VT), -. 57 (at LT/VT), - 1. 30 (above LT/VT), and -. 09 (different intensity). The overall SMD was -. 41. These results have shown that the differences in the exercise intensity used in imposed exercise sessions influenced the affective responses considering that higher intensities of imposed session provided higher effect size in favor of self-selected exercise...|$|R

50|$|Standing calf raises are {{executed}} {{with one}} or both feet. They are frequently done on a raised surface with the heel lower than the toes to allow a greater stretch on the working muscles. The <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> by raising the heel as far as possible. Weights or other methods of providing resistance are commonly used, but the exercise is also effective with body weight alone.|$|E
50|$|The {{individual}} {{begins in}} a push-up {{position on a}} smooth surface. The body is propelled forward using only the arms which are never bent beyond 90 degrees. The feet are dragged behind the individual, the body held in a straight line. This exercise is best performed on a smooth floor while wearing socks or with a folder towel placed under the feet. If performed on a carpeted surface, sneakers should be worn and the toes pointed backwards while the <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{inverted}} fly (also {{known as}} a bent-over lateral raise, reverse fly or rear delt fly) works the posterior deltoid. This movement {{is the opposite of}} a chest fly. The <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> with the torso parallel to the ground, facing down, with the hands in front of the face. Arms are moved through the transverse plane in an arc until parallel to the ground (or the limit of the range of motion of the shoulder is reached), then returned to the starting position and repeated.|$|E

5000|$|The handstand push-up (press-up) - {{also called}} the {{vertical}} push-up (press-up) or the inverted push-up (press-up) - {{is a type of}} push-up exercise where the body is positioned in a handstand. For a true handstand, the <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> free-standing, held in the air. To prepare the strength until one has built adequate balance, the feet are often placed against a wall, held by a partner, or secured in some other way from falling. Handstand pushups require significant strength, as well as balance and control if performed free-standing.|$|E
5000|$|Testing is a {{distinct}} variety of the latihan directed toward receiving guidance or insight on a particular issue. Some question or request for clarification is acknowledged, and then the <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> with openness to the issue. The original word for testing used by Muhammad Subuh was [...] "terimah," [...] which is Indonesian for [...] "receiving". Many {{people who have been}} practicing the latihan for some time claim to be able to recognize indications or intuitions [...] "from their inner feeling" [...] in response to questions that are put forward.|$|E
50|$|Spine chin-ups — in the supine position, {{the arms}} are held {{perpendicular}} to the body as the grip the bar; instead of the chin, the chest is pulled towards the bar. This <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> in the horizontal (transverse) plane, whereas other chin-up variations are performed in the vertical (coronal) plane. As a result, this variation recruits the trapezius and teres major muscles {{much more than a}} vertical chin-up would, and is more commonly known as the supine row. Advanced versions popular amongst gymnasts are performed completely off the ground in some type of front lever.|$|E

25|$|The Brandt–Daroff <b>exercises</b> may <b>be</b> {{prescribed}} by the clinician {{as a home}} treatment method, usually in conjunction with particle-repositioning maneuvers or {{in lieu of the}} particle-repositioning maneuver. The <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> a form of habituation exercise, designed to allow the patient to become accustomed to the position which causes the vertigo symptoms. The Brandt–Daroff <b>exercises</b> <b>are</b> <b>performed</b> in a similar fashion to the Semont maneuver; however, as the patient rolls onto the unaffected side, the head is rotated toward the affected side. The <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> typically <b>performed</b> 3 times a day with 5–10 repetitions each time, until symptoms of vertigo have resolved for at least 2 days.|$|R
50|$|Breakdowns: Breakdowns were {{developed}} by Fredrick Hatfield and Mike Quinn to work {{the different types of}} muscle fibers for maximum stimulation. Three different exercises that work the same muscle group are selected, and used for a superset. The first exercise uses a heavy weight (~85% of 1 rep max) for around five reps, the second a medium weight (~70% of 1 rep max) for around twelve reps, and finally the third <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> with a light weight (~50% of 1 rep max) for twenty to thirty reps, or even lighter (~40% of 1 rep max) for forty or more reps. (Going to failure is discouraged.) The entire superset is performed three times.|$|E
50|$|Crunches are {{executed}} while {{lying on}} the back with the {{feet flat on the}} ground together or 12 inches apart (whichever is more comfortable), knees bent at a 90 degree angle, and arms on the ribcage or chest. One crunch is completed when the upper body is lifted until both arms touch the thighs and then lowered until the shoulder blades touch the ground. The arms must be in constant contact with the chest or rib cage; the buttocks must be in constant contact with the ground. The <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> with the heels of the feet kept in constant contact with the ground. The Marine is given two minutes to complete as many crunches as possible.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} {{physical}} fitness {{to benefit the}} health of an individual, an unknown response in the person called a stimulus will be triggered by the exertion. When <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed</b> with the correct amount of intensity, duration and frequency, {{a significant amount of}} improvement can occur. The person may overall feel better but the physical effects on the human body take weeks or months to notice and possibly years for full development. For training purposes, exercise must provide a stress or demand on either a function or tissue. To continue improvements, this demand must eventually increase little {{over an extended period of}} time. This sort of exercise training has three basic principles: overload, specificity, and progression. These principles are related to health but also enhancement of physical working capacity.|$|E

Rather we now suggest that the physical manifestation of any increasing perception of fatigue may simply be an alteration in the subconsciously regulated pace at which the <b>exercise</b> <b>is</b> <b>performed.</b> Hence the novel suggestion is that the conventional understanding of fatigue is flawed because it makes no distinction between the sensation itself and the physical expression of that sensation which, we suggest, is the alteration in the subconsciously regulated pacing strategy consequent on changing motor unit recruitment/derecruitment by the CNS.|$|E
