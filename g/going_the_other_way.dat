25|$|The {{main problem}} caused by locks is that, {{each time a}} lock goes through one fill-empty cycle, a lockful of water (tens of {{thousands}} up to millions of litres) is released to the lower pound. In more simplistic terms, on a canal where only one boat will fit into a lock, a boat travelling from the summit pound to the lowest pound is accompanied on its journey by one 'personal' lockful of water. A boat <b>going</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> also transfers a lockful {{of water from the}} summit pound to the lowest pound. To prevent the canal from running dry, some method must be used to ensure that the water supply at the canal summit is constantly replenished at the rate that the water is being drained downwards. This is, of course much more of a problem on an artificial canal crossing a watershed than on a river navigation.|$|E

An exception was the privately owned Parramatta line built by Charles Edward Jeanneret in 1881 to Redbank Wharf (Duck River) where the steam tram remained until 1943. Service began with C-class saloon cars, followed by D-class combination cars. In contrast to other cities that started with combination cars and toastracks, then quickly abandoned them for drop-centre and saloon cars, Sydney started by <b>going</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> Footboard trams continued to be introduced, notably E-class, K-class, and the double-bogie cars O-class and P-class trams required the conductor to collect fares from the footboard of the car, as those trams had no corridor. Revered though those trams were, they were deathtraps for conductors. On average, each day one conductor fell or was knocked off the footboard by passing motor vehicles. The majority suffered a fractured skull. In the three years 1923, 1924, 1925, there were 282, 289, and 233 accidents respectively to conductors on NSW tramways. From 1916 to 1932, there were 4,097 accidents to tram employees, and from 1923 to 1931 there were 10,228 accidents to passengers having falls when alighting or boarding. [...] 63 of the falls were fatal. [...] Of the more than 100 falls reported of conductors, one quarter died from their injuries. [...] It was not until the 1930s with the introduction of the R-class that the drop-centre saloon tram, widely used elsewhere in Australia, came to Sydney. Even so, footboard trams continued in wide use until the late 1950s, despite calls as early as 1934 by the tram union for them to be modified.|$|E

[...] A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens ABSTRACT: During the 1990 s, the U. S. Land Combat Systems (LCS) Industry went through a challenging period of consolidation as defense budgets declined and demand for ground combat equipment waned. Increasingly, joint ventures and partnerships have been formed between and among domestic and foreign LCS firms to maximize cash flow as well as share the risks and rewards of program development. In this regard, the U. S. Army's transformation vision is being closely watched as the worldwide LCS Industry seeks to capitalize on this potentially lucrative initiative. The vision requires that LCS firms become even more flexible and adaptable, but also forces them to fundamentally reexamine core capabilities.

Taking a phenomenological approach, we calculate observable consequences of novel particle models during two different stages in the development of our universe. First, we explore the possibility that nonminimally coupled multifield inflation can generate a large primordial isocurvature fraction and account for the "low-multipole anomaly" in the Cosmic Microwave Background. Second, we consider the effects of dark matter that inelastically self-interacts to determine the effect on the structure and abundance of Milky Way satellites and dwarf galaxies. The disparity of time and energy scales examined in this thesis serves to highlight the range of ways to use observables in the sky as a probe of new particle physics that may be elusive at current experiments on the ground. by Katelin Schutz.
