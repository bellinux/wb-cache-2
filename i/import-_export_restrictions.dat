40|$|Prices for {{commodities}} such as {{minerals and}} metals have increased significantly {{over the past few}} years. At the same time, there has also been an increase in <b>restrictions</b> on the <b>export</b> of raw materials which has led policy makers and business people to address free trade of raw materials. This paper provides information on the present situation regarding the use of <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> and international disciplines on these measures. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions</b> are maintained to achieve diverse policy objectives, including environmental protection or conservation of natural resources, promotion of downstream processing industries, controlling inflationary pressures, and for fiscal receipts reasons. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions</b> take various forms such as <b>export</b> duties, quantitative <b>restrictions,</b> and licensing requirements. The number of countries applying export duties over the period 2003 - 2009 was higher than in previous years and that such duties were introduced primarily by developing and least developed countries. Under the current WTO rules, unlike quantitative <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> which are in principle prohibited, there is no substantive discipline on export duties, although there have been efforts to revise this at the multilateral and bilateral levels. The WTO accession process imposes several disciplines. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions</b> have also been discussed during the DDA negotiations in both NAMA (Non-Agricultural Market Access) and agriculture negotiations. Several regional trade agreements (RTAs) went beyond the WTO by including prohibition of <b>export</b> duties. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions,</b> by creating a differential between the price available to domestic processors and the price charged to foreign processors, provide domestic processing industries with an advantage. Although several governments apply <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> to achieve diverse policy objectives, not all rely on such restrictions. Alternative policy options with different trade impacts are used. In view of the significant impacts of <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> on global supply chains, transparency on the use and implementation of such measures should be substantially improved. transparency, quantitative <b>restrictions,</b> accession, <b>export</b> licensing, food security, conservation of natural resources, subsidy, raw materials, terms-of-trade, fiscal receipts, trade policy review, Doha Development Agenda, regional trade agreements, <b>export</b> <b>restrictions,</b> <b>export</b> duties, social objectives, tariff escalation, non-agricultural market access, WTO disciplines...|$|R

40|$|Barriers {{to trade}} {{come in a}} variety of forms. This paper {{examines}} one such barrier, <b>export</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and how it impacts trade and global supply in selected strategic metals and minerals. The metals and minerals examined in the paper are of particular interest for a number of reasons: they are generally geographically concentrated in a few countries, many are used in the production of high-technology goods in strategic sectors and there are few substitutes for these raw materials given the present state of technology. For all these reasons, importing countries are dependent on a reliable supply of these raw materials. <b>Export</b> <b>restrictions</b> may be applied for a number of reasons: protection of the environment, preservation of natural resources, protection of downstream industries, or as a response to a number of different market imperfections. This paper examines the motivations for using <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> and finds varying impacts on trade and global supply. In one case, the <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> put into place did not fulfill their objective of environmental protection. In another, the presence of <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> in one country put pressure on other exporters to apply restrictions suggesting the potential for competitive policy practices in restricting exports. In a third case study, <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> were seen to impact investmen...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, the Chinese {{government}} opted to restrict the export of selected minerals on environmental and health grounds, subsequently leading to an uproar in countries and regions that rely heavily on imports from China to develop their renewable industry sector. This paper places {{the focus on the}} law and policy of the Chinese <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> of critical minerals, and its implications for the global renewables energy industry. The paper critically assesses how such <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> have been dealt with under the dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Drawing on this WTO jurisprudence, we posit that litigation on <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> of the kind imposed by China poses a threat to the legitimacy of the WTO.

40|$|The use of <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{has become}} more and more common in recent years, evidencing the {{substantial}} loopholes existing in the WTO regulation on the matter. As a result of this deficient legal framework, the WTO membership experiences important losses of welfare and increasing political tensions. The multilateral negotiations for an updated discipline on <b>export</b> <b>restrictions,</b> {{in the context of the}} Doha Development Round, are blocked. Consequently, members have established a set of preferential bilateral and multilateral agreements to relieve the negative effects of these measures. Likewise, some recent WTO members have committed to stricter regulations as part of their Accession Protocols. Nevertheless, these methods have evidenced some important flaws, and the multilateral scene remains the optimum forum to address <b>export</b> <b>restrictions.</b> This Working Paper proposes a number of measures to improve the legal framework of the quantitative <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> and <b>export</b> duties, as well as their notification procedures...|$|R

Most recently, China's <b>restrictions</b> of its <b>exports</b> of certain minerals and rare earth metals have led to heated debates. The United States (US), European Union (EU), and Mexico have already filed a WTO dispute case against China on this matter. This paper describes the policy objectives and the global welfare implications of <b>export</b> <b>restrictions.</b> It summarizes the relevant WTO regulation, and offers a detailed analysis of the China-Raw Materials case which is before the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). It argues that although <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> is arguably an area of ‘under-regulation' or ‘regulatory deficiency' in the WTO law, it is strongly biased against the late accession Members, including China. Yet, the way that China institutes its <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> raises serious questions about its role in the multilateral trading system, which it relies on for its economic prosperity. Hence, this is an area where China is likely to feel the implications of its so-called ‘WTO-plus' commitments on its domestic and trade policie...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{proliferation}} of natural resource trade has caused rising demand in supply of resource products, leading to “widespread anxiety over the security of access to natural re-source. ” In context of this, <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> have been frequently imposed on resource products, most of which come from the developing world. Recently, known as China − Rare Earths, a case against China’s measures related to the exportation of rare earths was brought to WTO and a panel has been established by request of Japan. It is another sign for the increasingly heated topic of <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> during recent decades subsequent to the high profile case China − Raw Materials. Against this backdrop, it is thus vital for exporting countries to seek justifications provided in GATT/WTO when facing challenges to their <b>export</b> <b>restrictions.</b> This thesis aims to elaborate {{on the issue of}} applying current possible exception clauses to alleged unlawful <b>export</b> <b>restrictions,</b> in accordance with present articles under GATT 1994 and available case laws.

40|$|In {{light of}} the growing {{international}} competition among states and globally operating companies for limited natural resources, <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> on raw materials have become a popular means for governments to strive for various goals, including industrial development, natural resource conservation and environmental protection. For instance, China as a major supplier of many raw materials has been using its powerful position to both economic and political ends. The European Union (EU), alongside economic heavyweights such as the US, Japan and Mexico, launched two high-profile cases against such <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> by China at the WTO in 2009 and 2012. Against this background, this paper analyses the EU’s motivations in the initiation of trade disputes on <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> at WTO, particularly focusing on the two cases with China. It argues that the EU's WTO complaints against <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> on raw materials are {{to a large extent}} motivated by its economic and systemic interests rather than political interests. The EU is more likely to launch a WTO complaint, the stronger the potential and actual impact on its economy, the more ambiguous the WTO rules and the stronger the internal or external lobbying by member states or companies. This argumentation is based on the analysis of pertinent factors such as the economic impact, the ambiguity of WTO law on <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> and the pressure by individual member states on the EU as well as the role of joint complaints at the WTO and political considerations influencing the EU’s decision-making process...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan (RUK) became {{major players in}} the {{international}} trade of agricultural products. Especially with regard to grain, the increase of RUK exports certainly helped to improve global food security. However, in 2010 the RUK countries introduced <b>export</b> <b>restriction</b> measures on grains further to major harvest failures due to severe droughts. Due to the importance of the RUK countries for world grain markets, the <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> had adverse effects on international food security by adding to instable world grain markets and contributing to spikes in international food prices; however it is not clear to which extent. By replicating the harvest situation of 2010 in RUK, this paper provides a model-based quantitative assessment of the impact of different grain <b>export</b> <b>restriction</b> measures (bans, tariffs, quotas) in RUK on food security by quantifying their impact on world and domestic grains market quantities and prices. For the quantitative analysis AGLINK-COSIMO, a recursive-dynamic, partial equilibrium, supply-demand model, has been applied. Scenario results indicate that if the RUK countries apply ad hoc <b>export</b> <b>restrictions</b> as a response of lower domestic grain availability, the resulting effects on international and domestic grains markets depend on both the specific <b>export</b> <b>restriction</b> measure and the country profile. Results show that especially for a country like Ukraine, i. e. a country usually exporting large shares of its grains production, the introduction of ad hoc export bans or very restrictive export quotas do not only over privilege domestic consumers but have also severe negative effects on the international grains markets by contributing significantly to price increases and thus have adverse effects on global food security.
