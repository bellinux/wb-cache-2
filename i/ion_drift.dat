The model uses a collision frequency that is dependent upon the ion velocity and neutral gas thermal velocity.

For argon <b>ions</b> <b>drifting</b> in argon, the model gives close agreement with experimental data for the mobility {{for a wide range of}} electric fields when implemented with an energy dependent cross section.

Followups on the claims (R. L.

Ambient pressure methods allow for higher resolving power and greater separation selectivity {{due to a}} higher rate of ion-molecule interactions and is typically used for stand-alone devices, as well as for detectors for gas, liquid, and supercriticial fluid chromatography. As shown above, the resolving power depends on the total voltage drop the ion traverses. Using a drift voltage of 25 kV in a 15 cm long atmospheric pressure drift tube, a resolving power above 250 is achievable even for small, single charged ions. This is sufficient to achieve separation of some isotopologues based on their difference in reduced mass μ.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{incoherent}} scatter radar observations of high-altitude <b>ion</b> <b>drifts</b> and other plasma parameters made February 24, 1972, at Chatanika, Alaska (L = 5. 7), {{during a period of}} magnetic disturbance. For this experiment, conducted between 0909 to 1303 UT (2309 to 0303 AST), the radar line of sight was held fixed in the magnetic meridian plane so that the observed north-south <b>ion</b> <b>drifts</b> could be interpreted in terms of a westward electric field that ranged in magnitude from − 10 to + 35 mV m− 1. The results confirm many effects found previously through other experimental techniques. Southward <b>ion</b> <b>drifts</b> predominated during the 4 -hour observation period. Several times the westward electric field inside large regions of enhanced electron density was substantially smaller than the field outside these regions. In addition, on several occasions these walls or bands of ionization were found to drift southward at about the same speed as the E⊥ × B drift in the surrounding plasma. The plasma inside the enhanced region, however, did not share the drift motion but remained relatively stationary with respect to the radar. The present observations of F 2 layer densities and temperatures indicate an unusual increase in electron density just before the onset of a large substorm. Finally, measurements of the height and peak density of the auroral E layer show significant variations in the intensity and average energy of the electron flux. These variations appear to be related to auroral breakup and a transition to steady precipitation of moderately soft electrons...|$|R
40|$|The {{divertor}} magnetic geometry has {{a significant}} effect on the poloidal flow and resulting flow shear of turbulence in the outer region of L-mode tokamak plasmas, as determined via two-dimensional measurements of density fluctuations with Beam Emission Spectroscopy on DIII-D. Plasmas with similar parameters, except that in one case the <b>ion</b> {del}B <b>drift</b> points towards the divertor X-point (lower single-null, LSN), and in the other case, the <b>ion</b> {del}B <b>drift</b> points away from the divertor X-point (upper single-null, USN), are compared. Inside of r/a= 0. 9, the turbulence characteristics (amplitude, flow direction, correlation lengths) are similar in both cases, while near r/a= 0. 92, a dramatic reversal of the poloidal flow of turbulence relative to the core flow direction is observed in plasmas with the <b>ion</b> {del}B <b>drift</b> pointing towards the divertor X-point. No such flow reversal is observed in plasmas with the <b>ion</b> {del}B <b>drift</b> pointing away from the divertor X-point. This poloidal flow reversal results in a significantly larger local shear in the poloidal turbulence flow velocity in plasmas with the <b>ion</b> {del}B <b>drift</b> pointing towards the divertor X-point. Additionally, these plasmas locally exhibit significant dispersion, with two distinct and counter-propagating turbulence modes. Likewise, the radial correlation length of the turbulence is reduced in these plasmas, consistent with biorthogonal decomposition measurements of dominant turbulence structures. The naturally occurring turbulence flow shear in these LSN plasmas may facilitate the LH transition that occurs at an input power of roughly one-half to one-third that of corresponding plasmas with the <b>ion</b> {del}B <b>drift</b> pointing away from the X-point...|$|R
