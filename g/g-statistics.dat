However, exploitation of these tests depends on some conditions. Even though these conditions are met there are still problems in interpretation of the results because the obtained data are general and limited.

40|$|Summary {{functions}} such as {{the empty}} space function F and the nearest neighbour distance distribution function G are often used as test statistics for point patterns. Van Lieshout and Baddeley recently proposed an alternative statistic, the J-function, which is defined as J = (1 - G) /(1 - F). Theoretical advantages of the J-function over the F- and <b>G-statistics</b> are that it measures the type, strength and range of interaction, and {{that it can be}} evaluated explicitly for a larger class of models. In this simulation study we investigate empirically how the power of tests based on J compares to that of tests based on F and G...|$|E
40|$|Presence of {{solution}} cavities {{of different}} sizes poses major engineering problems {{in some areas of}} Abu Dhabi City Municipality (ADM) underlain by soluble rocks such as gypsum, calcarenite, or mudstone. This is especially critical if they are located at a relatively shallow level and are likely to cause settlement or sudden soil collapse. The Gachsaran Formation, which is composed of interlayered mudstone and gypsum, underlies all of the ADM and is known to be vulnerable to cavity formation in the area. The mudstone and gypsum beds within {{the upper part of the}} Gachsaran Formation are prone to dissolution. Numerous sinkholes have been reported, particularly in the zone between Abu Dhabi International Airport and Mafraq. Many geotechnical and geological reports and surveys were reviewed for extracting information related to geological and hydrogeological conditions causing cavities in the ADM. Information associated with cavities was cataloged and reviewed based on available data from an existing geotechnical borehole database maintained by the ADM. Cavity data obtained from borehole information was analyzed to examine cavity distributions based on the following factors: lithology, geographic clusters, cavity density, cavity size, depth to cavity, and depth to bedrock. All cavities were grouped into geographic clusters and lithological clusters for point-pattern analysis. Most cavities (87 percent) occur in mudstone or gypsum, or at an interface between these two rock types, which compose part of the Gachsaran Formation. The dissolution of carbonate and evaporites within this formation causes the formation of subsurface voids in the ADM area. Geographically, majority of cavities occurred in the Shakhbout City area, hence pattern analysis including average nearest neighbor analysis, Moran’s I for measuring spatial autocorrelation, and <b>G-statistics</b> for measuring high/low clustering were conducted in this area using spatial statistics tools in ArcGIS. Average nearest neighbor analysis and Moran’s- I show that cavities are strongly clustered in this area with a high confidence level (3 ̆e 99 percent). General <b>G-statistics</b> identified a high clustering (hot spot) of cavities with relatively high values of depth to cavity, depth to bedrock, and number of cavities per borehole. No highly clustered large cavities were detected by the General <b>G-statistics.</b> Additionally, distances to the first through the 9 th nearest neighbors were determined for cavities in different lithological materials and geographical clusters. Outcome of these spatial correlation and statistical analysis can be used to conduct risk assessment and the probability of occurrences of future cavities...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Texture {{is one of}} {{the chief}} {{characteristics}} of an image. In recent years, local texture descriptors have garnered attention among researchers in describing effective texture patterns to demarcate facial images. A feature descriptor titled Local Texture Description Framework-based Modified Local Directional Number pattern (LTDF_MLDN), capable of encoding texture patterns with pixels that lie at dissimilar regions, has been proposed recently to describe effective features for face images. However, the role of the descriptor can differ with different classifiers and distance metrics for diverse issues in face recognition. Hence, in this paper, an extensive evaluation of the LTDF_MLDN is carried out with an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Nearest Neighborhood Classifier (NNC) which uses Euclidian, Manhattan, Minkowski, <b>G-statistics</b> and chi-square dissimilarity metrics to illustrate differences in performance with respect to assorted issues in face recognition using six benchmark databases. Experimental results depict that the proposed descriptor is best suited with NNC for general case and expression variation, whereas, for the other facial variations ELM is found to produce better results...|$|E
40|$|Impact {{of genetic}} {{similarity}} on imputation accuracy Nab Raj Roshyara 1, 2 * and Markus Scholz 1, 2 Background: Genotype imputation {{is a common}} technique in genetic research. Genetic similarity between target population and reference dataset is crucial for high-quality results. Although several reference panels are available, it is often not clear {{which is the most}} optimal for a particular target dataset to be imputed. Maximizing genetic similarity between study sample and intended reference panels may be the straight forward method for selecting the genetically best-matched reference. However, the impact of genetic similarity on imputation accuracy has not yet been studied in detail. Results: We performed a simulation study in 20 ethnic groups obtained from POPRES. High-quality SNPs were masked and re-imputed with MaCH, MaCH-minimac and IMPUTE 2 using four different HapMap reference panels (CEU, CHB-JPT, MEX and YRI). Imputation accuracy was assessed by different statistics. Genetic similarity between ethnic groups and reference populations were measured by F-statistics (FST) originally proposed by Wright and <b>G-statistics</b> (GST) introduced by Nei and others. To assess the predictive power of these measure...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} of aneuploidy in cultured mammalian cells {{has been}} studied using two chemical agents, diethylstilboestrol dipropionate and Colcemid, which act on the mitotic spin-dle, in order to investigate different methods of scoring and statistical analysis. Two cell lines, one human and the other Chinese hamster, were each exposed to one test agent, and metaphase preparations scored (a) counting all the chromo-somes and (b) counting only the chromosomes of a selected group within the karyotype, to assess {{which would be the}} more rapid means of scoring metaphases for aneuploidy. Both the numbers of aneuploid cells and, where appropriate, the total numbers of chromosomes lost and gained were analys-ed using regression analysis, <b>G-statistics</b> and x 2 or Fisher's exact test. The results indicate that counting selective chromo-somes may in certain circumstances be advantageous, but will result in many more metaphases being required to be scored. Regression analysis to demonstrate dose response is suitable for the analysis of strong positives, but it is suggested that with weak inducers of aneuploidy, the additional tests cited above, using either the number of aneuploid cells or the ac-tual number of chromosomes lost and gained are more sen-sitive measures of the effects...|$|E
40|$|The ‘ellipsoidal distribution’, {{in which}} angles {{are assumed to}} be {{distributed}} parallel to the surface of an oblate or prolate ellipsoid, has been widely used to describe the leaf angle distribution (LAD) of plant canopies. This ellipsoidal function is constrained to show a probability density of zero at an inclination angle of zero; however, actual LADs commonly show a peak probability density at zero, a pattern consistent with functional models of plant leaf display. A ‘rotated ellipsoidal distribution ’ is described here, which geometrically corresponds to an ellipsoid in which small surface elements are rotated normal to the surface. Empirical LADs from canopy and understory species in an old-growth coniferous forest were used to compare the two models. In every case the rotated ellipsoidal function provided a better description of empirical data than did the non-rotated function, while retaining only a single parameter. The ratio of <b>G-statistics</b> for goodness of fit for the two functions ranged from 1. 03 to 3. 88. The improved fit {{is due to the fact}} that the rotated function always shows a probability density greater than zero at inclination angles of zero, can show a mode at zero, and more accurately characterizes the overall shape of empirical distributions. © 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Abstract — Key value {{data sets}} {{of the form}} {(x,wx) } where wx> 0 are prevalent. Common queries over such data are segment f-statistics Q(f,H) = x∈H f(wx), {{specified}} for a segment H of the keys and a function f. Different choices of f correspond to count, sum, moments, capping, and threshold statistics. When the data set is large, we can compute a smaller sample from which we can quickly estimate statistics. A weighted sample of keys taken with respect to f(wx) provides estimates with statistically guaranteed quality for f-statistics. Such a sample S(f) {{can be used to}} estimate <b>g-statistics</b> for g 6 = f, but quality degrades with the disparity between g and f. In this paper we address applications that require quality estimates for a set F of different functions. A naive solution is to compute and work with a different sample S(f) for each f ∈ F. Instead, this can be achieved more effectively and seamlessly using a single multi-objective sample S(F) of a much smaller size. We review multi-objective sampling schemes and place them in our context of estimating f-statistics. We show that a multi-objective sample for F provides quality estimates for any f that is a positive linear combination of functions from F. We then establish a surprising and powerful result when the target set M is all monotone non-decreasing functions, noting that M includes most natural statistics. We provide efficient multi-objective sampling algorithms for M and show that a sample size of k lnn (where n is the number of active keys) provides the same estimation quality, for any f ∈M, as a dedicated weighted sample of size k for f.

40|$|Leaf angle {{distribution}} {{is a key}} parameter to characterize canopy structure and {{plays a crucial role}} in controlling energy and mass balance in soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer system. Several leaf angle distribution functions found in literature have been proposed to account for the non-random distribution of leaf inclination angle with one or two parameters. In this paper, these leaf angle distribution functions (Beta distribution function, ellipsoidal function, rotated-ellipsoidal function, Verhoef's algorithm and de Wit's functions) were compared with field data collected in the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) project and two sites within Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Sydney, Australia. All functions performed reasonably well. However, the comparison showed that the two-parameter functions including the Beta distribution function and Verhoef's algorithm commonly were more consistent predictors than one-parameter functions. <b>G-statistics</b> and chi(2) test applying to the estimates of leaf angle distribution demonstrated that Beta function presented more robustness over other functions, even the ellipsoidal leaf distribution function which has been widely used. Furthermore, the predictions of leaf angle distribution by these functions were used to calculate extinction coefficient and to separate foliage into sunlit and shaded parts. The results suggested that, ellipsoidal function may be suitable to be retrieved with remotely-sensed data and to compute extinction coefficient and fraction of sunlit foliage because this function requires only a single parameter, namely the ratio of the horizontal semi-axis length to the vertical semi-axis length of an ellipsoid. Finally, the comparison of three approaches (Nilson's, Fuchs' and Ross-Goudriaan's algorithms) for computing extinction coefficient indicated that, {{there was no significant difference}} between the three approaches.

40|$|Abstract Background Large cell neuroendocrine {{carcinoma}} (LCNEC) of the lung, a subtype {{of large}} cell carcinoma (LCC), {{is characterized by}} neuroendocrine differentiation that small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) shares. Pre-therapeutic histological distinction between LCNEC and SCLC {{has so far been}} problematic, leading to adverse clinical outcome. We started a project establishing protein targets characteristic of LCNEC with a proteomic method using formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, which will help make diagnosis convincing. Methods Cancer cells were collected by laser microdissection from cancer foci in FFPE tissues of LCNEC (n = 4), SCLC (n = 5), and LCC (n = 5) with definite histological diagnosis. Proteins were extracted from the harvested sections, trypsin-digested, and subjected to HPLC/mass spectrometry. Proteins identified by database search were semi-quantified by spectral counting and statistically sorted by pair-wise <b>G-statistics.</b> The results were immunohistochemically verified using a total of 10 cases for each group to confirm proteomic results. Results A total of 1981 proteins identified from the three cancer groups were subjected to pair-wise G-test under p p -values: aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A 1 (AL 1 A 1) (p = 6. 1 × 10 - 4), aldo-keto reductase family 1 members C 1 (AK 1 C 1) (p = 9. 6 x 10 - 10) and C 3 (AK 1 C 3) (p = 3. 9 x 10 - 10) and CD 44 antigen (p = 0. 021). These p -values were confirmed by non-parametric exact inference tests. Interestingly, all these candidates would belong to cancer stem cell markers. Immunohistochmistry supported proteomic results. Conclusions These results suggest that candidate biomarkers of LCNEC were related to cancer stem cells and this proteomic approach via FFPE samples was effective to detect them. </p...|$|E
