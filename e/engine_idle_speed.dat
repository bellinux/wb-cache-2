5000|$|To limit power, all forced {{induction}} {{cars were}} {{fitted with a}} 34 mm diameter air restrictor before the turbocharger inlet, limiting the air flow to about 10 cubic meters per minute. The restriction was intended to limit power output to 300 hp although some WRC engines were believed to produce around 330-340 hp. [...] Engine development did not focus on peak power output but towards producing a very wide powerband (or power curve). Typically, power output in excess of 300 hp was available from 3000 rpm to the 7500 rpm maximum, with a peak of 330-340 hp at around 5500 rpm. At 2000 rpm (the <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> in [...] "stage" [...] mode) power output was slightly above 200 hp.|$|E

Because of the many vacuum-driven components and electrical connections in the system, CEC-equipped engines have developed a reputation of being hard to tune.

5000|$|With TPT, {{each test}} case can {{specifically}} {{react to the}} system's behaviour during the testing process in real time - for instance to react on the system exactly when a certain system-state occurs or a sensor signal exceeds a certain threshold.

5000|$|Idle speed (idling, or idle) is the {{rotational}} speed {{the engine runs}} on when the engine is uncoupled to the drivetrain and the throttle pedal isn't depressed (generally measured in revolutions per minute, or rpm, of the crankshaft of a combustion engine). The idle differs in two ways engine idle and vehicle idle. At idle speed, the engine generates enough [...] power to run reasonably smoothly and operate its ancillaries (water pump, alternator, and, if equipped, other accessories such as power steering), but usually not enough to perform useful work, such as moving an automobile. For a passenger-car <b>engine,</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> is customarily between 600 rpm and 1,000 rpm. For buses and trucks it is approximately 540 rpm. In case of many single-cylinder motorcycle engines, idle speed is set between 1200-1500 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Neutral / No gear (N): This {{disengages}} all gear trains {{within the}} transmission, effectively disconnecting the transmission from the driven wheels, allowing {{the vehicle to}} coast freely under its own weight and gain momentum without the motive force from the engine. Coasting in idle down long grades (where law permits) should be avoided, though, with many transmission designs as the transmission's lubrication pump is commonly driven by the input (engine) side, which may not provide sufficient fluid flow at <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> for high-speed travel. Similarly, emergency towing (with the driven wheels of the disabled and non-running vehicle on the ground) with an automatic transmission in neutral is not permitted by the manufacturer for many vehicles. Manufacturers understand emergency situations and list limitations of towing a vehicle in neutral (usually not to exceed 55 mph and 50 miles). This is the only other selection in which the vehicle's engine may be started.|$|E
50|$|This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, {{operated}} by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever {{behind the steering wheel}} to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the camshaft by a belt, the position of the butterfly valve in the carburettor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to standstill.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A model-based {{approach}} for the <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control of ultra-lean burn engines is presented.

Controller is designed using MPC theory and facilitated by successive online linearizations of the nonlinear discrete-time model at each sampling instant. Simul-taneously, the approximations due to the discretization of the non-linear engine model are explicitly considered by designing the con-trol within a previously proposed control design framework to ob-tain appropriate stability guarantees of an exact (unknown) dis-crete-time engine model.

50|$|The IAC {{actuator}} is an electrically controlled device, {{which gets}} its {{input from the}} vehicle's ECU. The actuator is fitted such that it either bypasses the throttle or operates the throttle butterfly valve directly. The actuator consists of a linear servo actuator servomotor that controls a plunger which varies air flow through the throttle body. The position of the servomotor and hence the amount of air bypass is controlled digitally by the engine ECU. This allows the <b>engine's</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> to be maintained constant. The linear servo is most commonly {{a combination of a}} DC motor, lead-screw and a digital optical encoder.|$|R
50|$|SU {{carburettors}} do {{not have}} a conventional choke flap, which in a fixed-jet carburettor enriches the mixture for starting the engine from cold by restricting the air supply upstream of the venturi. Instead a mechanism lowers the jet assembly, which has the same effect as the needle rising in normal operation - namely increasing the supply of fuel so that the carburettor will now deliver an enriched mixture at all engine speeds and throttle positions. The 'choke' mechanism on an SU carburettor usually also incorporates a system for holding the throttle plate slightly open to raise the <b>engine's</b> <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> and prevent stalling at low speeds due to the rich mixture.|$|R

Though the literal power band covers {{most of the}} operating RPM range, particularly in first gear (as there is no lower gear to shift down to, and no [...] "flat spot" [...] in which the engine does not produce any power), the effective band changes in each gear, becoming the range limited at the upper end by either the limiter, or a point roughly located between peak power and the redline where power drops off, and {{at the lower end}} the <b>engine's</b> <b>idling</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R

Therefore, shutting down the <b>engine</b> during <b>idling</b> phases can improve its overall efficiency. For driver acceptance a fast restart of the engine must be guaranteed. A fast engine start can be performed using a powerful electric starter and an appropriate battery which are found in hybrid electric vehicles, for example. However, these devices involve additional cost and weight. An alternative method is to use a tank with pressurized air that can be injected directly into the cylinders to start the engine pneumatically. In this paper, pneumatic engine starts using camshaft driven charge valves are discussed. A general methodology for an air-optimal charge valve design is presented which can deal with various requirements. The proposed design methodology is based on a process model representing pneumatic engine operation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of the Continuous Action Reinforcement Learning Automata (CARLA) methodology to PID controller parameter tuning. The PID controller parameters are initially set using the standard Zeigler-Nichols methods. The CARLA then selects parameters stochastically based on a distribution that converges to a Gaussian around the optimal parameter values. The CARLA adaptively tunes the controller parameters on-line, to minimise a performance criterion such as the sum of time error square. The method has the benefit of producing a controller with improved performance over the Zeigler-Nichols settings that is robust to noise and to the system non-linearities. Minimal system modelling is requires since it can be applied on-line optimising the parameters for the actual system. The method is demonstrated on various different systems in simulation. It is also demonstrated as a practical example for parameter tuning of a PID controller of an <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control system for a Ford Zetec 1. 8 engine during load change disturbances.
