25|$|Fifteen-year-old Tina Gray is stalked {{through a}} boiler room and {{attacked}} by a disfigured man wearing a blade-fixed glove. She awakens from the nightmare, but her mother points out four mysterious slashes on <b>her</b> <b>nightgown.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} side of the house, Pam leads Vic into the garden toward a pond with a statue of Ellen in it. She {{suddenly}} disappears. When Vic looks down into the pond, he sees what he believes to be Pam's dead body. He attempts to pull her out of the water, but the body vanishes and he is left clutching only <b>her</b> <b>nightgown.</b> He panics and runs back toward the house. Looking back, he sees the statue come to life and has a heart attack. Vic tries to draw the attention of Emery (who is inside the house), but Emery again believes this to be an apparition and refuses to open the window. Nick arrives and tries to open the window, but it will not open and the glass cannot be broken. Vic collapses and dies in full view of Emery and Nick. Out in the woods, Mrs. Waterman is stopped and knocked unconscious by the ghost of Kevin Bollinger.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{portrait}} of Sigmund Freud in close-up, then shows a picture of Farmer's mother. The song's lyrics are subtitled. Still images of Farmer are then shown in silhouette wearing a white and transparent nightgown. With each line of the song, an image of Farmer appears. When the chorus begins, Farmer turns blue and begins to dance {{in front of a}} backdrop featuring stars and the moon. Three children are shown looking at Farmer. After another verse, which again features still images of Farmer, shots of the singer jumping are intercut with shots of her singing along with the track with her arms clutched to her breast. Afterwards Farmer and the three children are shown holding placards with the words [...] "Maman a tort". Following another verse the singer's decapitated head is pictured on a plate on a table in front of the children who are holding knives and forks. The singer is again shown in blue and cries before being slapped in the face. A low-angle shot of Farmer shows her readjusting the strap of <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> and is intercut with images of her in silhouette. The video ends with a portrait of Freud.|$|E
50|$|Olga Erteszek (June 15, 1916 - September 15, 1989) was a Polish-American {{undergarment}} {{designer and}} lingerie company owner. She {{is famous for}} <b>her</b> <b>nightgowns</b> with full flowing skirt width and generous sweep.|$|R
5000|$|In another episode, viewers {{reported}} Cynthia Koh had accidentally exposed {{her white}} panties under <b>her</b> red <b>nightgown</b> as she {{jumped on the}} bed.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked so}} pitiful and {{pleading}} in <b>her</b> white <b>nightgown</b> against the shadowy lumber-hole {{that he was}} quite worried. She continued to beseech him not to disturb her.|$|R
500|$|On February 14, 1950, Ruth, who was {{pregnant}} with their second child, came {{too close to the}} gas heater in their Lower East Side apartment, and <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> caught on fire. Greenglass extinguished the blaze, but she suffered severe burns. She was taken to Gouverneur Hospital for skin grafts. He suffered second degree burns to his right hand. He was already aware that the UK and US intelligence agencies had discovered that a Los Alamos theoretical physicist, Klaus Fuchs, had spied for the USSR during the war. Through Fuchs' confession, they found that one of his American contacts had been a man named Harry Gold from Brooklyn, New York. [...] Gold had passed Fuchs' information on to a Soviet agent, performing the role of courier, and Anatoli Yakovlev would then pass the information on to his controllers in the USSR. Through Gold, the FBI's trail led to Greenglass and the Rosenbergs, who had allegedly also used Gold as a courier. When Fuchs was first captured, Julius allegedly gave the Greenglasses $5,000 to finance an escape to Mexico. Instead, they went to the Catskills and used the money to seek legal advice.|$|E
2500|$|Around noon August 23, 1917, Lee Sparks and Rufus Daniels, two Houston police officers, {{broke up}} a craps game {{on a street}} corner in Houston's predominantly-black San Felipe {{district}} by firing warning shots. Sparks, searching for the fleeing suspects, entered the house of local resident Sara Travers. He did not find the suspect but, after exchanging words with Travers, struck her and dragged her outside in <b>her</b> <b>nightgown.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, May 3, {{sometime}} before 9 p.m., Virgil Starks, age 37, a farmer and welder, {{was in his}} modest, yet modern ranch-style house on his 500-acre farm off Highway 67 East, almost [...] northeast of Texarkana. He turned on his favorite weekly radio show and his wife, Katie, age 36, gave him a heating pad for his sore back. He sat in his armchair in the sitting room, which was just off {{of the kitchen and}} the bedroom. While Katie was in her bedroom lying on the bed in <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> she heard something from the backyard and asked Virgil to turn down the radio. Seconds later, while Virgil was reading the May 3rd edition of the Texarkana Gazette, two shots were fired into {{the back of his head}} from a closed double-window [...] away. Katie did not hear the gunshots; instead, she heard what [...] "sounded like the breaking of glass". She thought Virgil dropped something and went to see what happened. As she entered the doorway to the living room, she saw Virgil standing up and then suddenly slump back into his chair. She saw blood then ran to him and lifted up his head. When she realized he was dead, she ran to the phone to call police.|$|E
60|$|She rushed, passionately, {{through the}} open door into the moonlight. In her bare feet, clad only in <b>her</b> flowing <b>nightgown,</b> she stood like a spirit among the dark vines and lacy shadows of the old veranda.|$|R
60|$|The door clicked and opened: Olive {{entered in}} <b>her</b> long white <b>nightgown.</b> She {{hurried to the}} bed.|$|R
6000|$|In <b>her</b> batiste <b>nightgown</b> she was {{standing}} at the bureau engaged in the invariable rites of wishing that she had a real dressing-table with a triple mirror, of bending toward the streaky glass and raising her chin to inspect a pin-head mole on her throat, and finally of brushing her hair. In rhythm to the strokes she went on: ...|$|R
60|$|Her fingers {{dropped from}} the {{frilling}} of <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> and her fierce black eyes flashed at me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You darling!' thought Thyme. With {{a shudder}} of delight {{she dropped her}} {{notebook}} back into the drawer, flung off <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> and flew into her bath.|$|E
6000|$|RAINA (her eyes dilating). Ah! (She {{throws the}} cloak on the ottoman, and comes eagerly to Catherine in <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> a pretty garment, but evidently {{the only one}} she has on.) ...|$|E
60|$|She slowly {{replaced}} all her simple maiden underlinen with garments which, {{while still}} simple, were wrought with beautiful French embroidery, tucks, and drawnwork. She crocheted fine edgings on the inexpensive knitted underwear she wore in winter. She made little corset covers and chemises of fine but fairly inexpensive lawns, and, with simple flowered designs and perfect laundering, <b>her</b> <b>nightgowns</b> were always sweetly fresh and dainty. In some publication she ran across a brief printed {{note to the}} effect that French women were just beginning to wear fascinating beruffled caps at the breakfast table. It meant nothing to her that in her case she must first prepare the breakfast. Promptly appeared in the house a yard of dotted Swiss muslin, and Saxon was deep in experimenting on patterns for herself, and in sorting her bits of laces for suitable trimmings. The resultant dainty creation won Mercedes Higgins' enthusiastic approval.|$|R
50|$|This {{painting}} received mixed reviews. The {{most obvious}} break with tradition was Rossetti's choice of placing Mary in bed - <b>her</b> long <b>nightgown</b> suggestive of a newly-wed bride - woken by the angel, who is normally depicted appearing as Mary prays. Also controversial were Gabriel's lack of wings (the flames {{at his feet}} suggest a Classical influence) and his obvious nakedness, glimpsed through {{the side of his}} robe. Note also the dove's halo, and the differences between Mary's and Gabriel's haloes, which may have arisen because Mary's was painted in 1850, whereas Gabriel's was not added until 1853.|$|R
5000|$|One day, {{looking in}} the mirror, Kitty notices she has grown whiskers. She points them out to her mother, but her mother ignores her. Kitty grows pointed ears and grey fur {{but none of the}} adults in her life seem to notice. Waking up one morning with talons Kitty goes downstairs and is mesmerized by some birds she sees. Fully {{transforming}} into a grey tabby she chases the birds and then goes to visit her neighbour who feeds her milk. Returning home, she is locked out and sees her parents clutching <b>her</b> discarded <b>nightgown,</b> believing she has been kidnapped.|$|R
60|$|The full July moon, {{streaming}} {{through the}} open door, discovered touchingly the hopeless misery of Mariposilla. She was in <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> gazing piteously into the illuminated face of the unsympathetic doll above the chimney shelf.|$|E
60|$|As he roars it Amy peeps in anxiously. She is in <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> and {{her hair}} is down and her feet are bare, and she does not look so very much more than five. Alice is unable to resist the temptation.|$|E
60|$|She undressed in {{a tremor}} of misgiving. She put her thin, pretty kimono over <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> braided her hair, and curled on the bed, condemning herself {{for having been}} so supercilious to the rat who {{had never had a}} chance.|$|E
50|$|Bernadette {{became famous}} in the New York Metropolitan Areas as the 4 year old living {{trademark}} of the company. It was Theresa’s idea to use their daughter Bernadette, starting {{at the age of}} 4, with <b>her</b> white <b>nightgown</b> and sausage curls, in television commercials for the sofas as the company’s living trademark. The commercial - shown 40,000 times in various forms - {{was one of the first}} local advertisements to run on television and was said to be the first to feature a child. Theresa assisted Bernard answering the phones and stuffing cushions in the young company, which eventually became a retailer and manufacturer of fine convertible furniture - Castro Convertibles.|$|R
50|$|Flashbacks in {{the third}} season pick up Maura's family saga from the second season, now {{focusing}} on her somewhat strained childhood in the 1950s. Unable to express herself and perennially untalented at sports, Maura frequently dressed up in <b>her</b> mother's <b>nightgown</b> and jewelry and danced alone in the family bunker. Rose and Yetta were somewhat tolerant, provided Maura confined her activities to the bunker. Things took {{a turn for the}} worse when Haim screamed at her in front of the whole family, revealing how Gittel had been killed in the Holocaust because of her gender identity. Brina shortly thereafter publicly denounced Maura at school, beginning their lifelong feud.|$|R
5000|$|A 250 {{in all but}} name, the 1963 330 America {{shared the}} {{outgoing}} model's chassis but not its engine. Powered by the new 4.0 L engine of the later 330 cars, fifty 330 Americas were built. 185VR15 Pirelli Cinturato tyres (CA67) were original equipment, changed to 205VR15s (CN72) after 1964. A famous 330 America was that of California socialite Sandra Ilene West, who was buried {{at the wheel of}} the car following a 1977 drug overdose. Her instructions specified that she be clad in <b>her</b> lace <b>nightgown</b> with the driver’s seat [...] "slanted at a comfortable angle". Car and driver are interred at the Alamo Masonic Cemetery, San Antonio, Texas.|$|R
60|$|They {{turned the}} clothes back. Paul saw his mother {{like a girl}} curled up in her flannel nightdress. Quickly they made {{one half of the}} bed, moved her, made the other, {{straightened}} <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> over her small feet, and covered her up.|$|E
60|$|Mariposilla was now awake. Her {{hair had}} fallen over her {{shoulders}} and the little necklace still encircled her throat. About her eyes lingered the rosy flush of her unbroken sleep. She sat up as we entered, pushing quickly beneath <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> sleeve a tiny rim of gold.|$|E
6000|$|MABEL and RONALD DANCY enter. She is {{a pretty}} young woman with [...] bobbed hair, fortunately, for she has {{just got out of}} bed, and is in [...] <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> and a wrapper. DANCY is in his smoking jacket. He [...] has a pale, {{determined}} face with high cheekbones, small, deep-set [...] dark eyes, reddish crisp hair, and looks like a horseman.|$|E
50|$|Emilie, now in {{the later}} stages of her pregnancy, refuses to restore the {{children}} to the home. Edvard insists she do so. Emilie allows Edvard to drink a large dosage of her bromide sedative. She explains to him, as he shows signs that the medication is working, that she intends to flee the home as he sleeps. He claims that he will follow her family {{from city to city}} and ruin their lives, then blacks out. After Emilie gets away, Edvard's dying aunt knocks over a gas lamp, setting <b>her</b> bedclothes, <b>nightgown</b> and hair on fire. She runs through the house in flames to seek Edvard's help, igniting him. Despite the sedative, he is able to get her off him, but dies shortly thereafter.|$|R
50|$|Posing as a prostitute, Vanessa steals a {{car from}} a {{prospective}} john and drives to her grandmother's house. Vanessa finds Bob in bed wearing <b>her</b> grandmother's <b>nightgown</b> and nightcap with the covers {{pulled up to}} his nose. Bob reveals himself and Vanessa sees her grandmother's body on the floor. A struggle ensues, culminating in Vanessa strangling Bob. Detectives Breer and Wallace arrive and approach the trailer with their guns drawn when they hear the commotion inside. Vanessa eventually exits the trailer exhausted after her struggle and the detectives enter to find Bob and Vanessa's grandmother both dead. Outside, Vanessa sits in a chair, near her breaking point, when she looks up and asks the detectives {{if they have a}} cigarette. They smile and Vanessa responds in kind.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{believed}} {{that all of}} the victims except for Lena Stillinger had been asleep when murdered. They thought that she was awake and tried to fight back, as she was found lying crosswise on the bed, and with a defensive wound on <b>her</b> arm. Lena's <b>nightgown</b> was pushed up to her waist and she was wearing no undergarments, leading to law enforcement speculation that the killer(s) sexually molested her or attempted to do so.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't make a purse {{out of a}} sow's ear. Fan will sag {{right down}} after marriage. Mark my words. She's a slattern in her blood, and before the honeymoon is over she'll be slouching around in old {{slippers}} and <b>her</b> <b>nightgown.</b> That is plain talk, Mr. Lester, but I can't let you go into this trap with your eyes shut." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Golden's words labored like a steamer {{in heavy}} seas; the {{throbbing}} {{of her heart}} shook them like the throb of the engines. She put {{her hand to her}} right side, shakily, with effort. It lay there, yellow against the white muslin of <b>her</b> <b>nightgown,</b> then fell heavily to the bed, like a dead thing. Una trembled with fear as her mother continued, [...] "My pulse--it's so fast--so hard breathing--side pain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I woon't, mother," [...] the boy promised, {{and then}} he said, [...] "But you ought to see Philadelphy, mother. It's twenty times as big as Wheeling, Benny says, and all red brick houses and white marble steps." [...] He was sitting up, and talking now; his mother flew about in the lank linsey-woolsey dress she had thrown over <b>her</b> <b>nightgown</b> in some unrealized {{interval}} of her labors and had got the skillet of bacon hissing over the coals.|$|E
6000|$|... "How old is he?" [...] Dolly asked, innocently enough, {{standing}} {{up by the}} bedside in <b>her</b> dainty white <b>nightgown.</b> But Winnie caught at her meaning with the preternatural sharpness of the girl brought up in immediate contact with the landed interest. [...] "Oh, he's of age," [...] she answered quickly, with a knowing nod. [...] "He's come into the property; he has nobody on earth but himself to consult about his domestic arrangements." ...|$|R
25|$|One summer, Mr. O'Brien {{takes a long}} {{business}} trip. While he is away, {{the boys}} enjoy unfettered access to their mother, and Jack experiences the first twinges of rebelliousness. Goaded by other boys his age, Jack commits acts of vandalism and animal abuse. He later trespasses into a neighbor's house and steals <b>her</b> sheer <b>nightgown.</b> Jack is confused and angered by his feelings of sexuality and guilty trespass. He throws the stolen lingerie into a river to rid himself of it. Mr. O'Brien returns home from his business trip. Shortly thereafter, the plant that he works at closes and he is given the option of relocating {{to work in an}} inferior position within the firm or losing his job. He and his family pack up to move to the new job location. He laments the course his life has taken, questioning whether he has been a good enough person. He asks Jack for forgiveness for his harsh treatment of him.|$|R
6000|$|Though utterly {{unlike in}} character, the twins got on remarkably well together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day. Of course, Demi tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her brother {{as the one}} perfect being in the world. A rosy, chubby, sunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart, and nestled there. One of the {{captivating}} children, who seem made to be kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small virtues were so sweet {{that she would have}} been quite angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human. It was all fair weather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the window in <b>her</b> little <b>nightgown</b> to look out, and say, no matter whether it rained or shone, [...] "Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!" [...] Everyone was a friend, and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful worshipers.|$|R
