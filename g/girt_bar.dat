5000|$|Slides and slide/rafts can be {{detached}} from the <b>girt</b> <b>bar,</b> usually by a two or three step procedures. This may, for example, involve lifting up the flap on the <b>girt</b> <b>bar,</b> and pulling the detach handle. These procedures are usually placarded red on the slide, [...] "For Ditching Use Only". Once the slide is separated, the slide remains attached to the aircraft by a mooring line. This line will break if the airframe submerges, or can be disconnected with a pre-supplied knife or disconnect handle.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{departure}} (usually before engine startup), all {{the aircraft}} doors are placed into the armed (or automatic) mode by the cabin crew. Methods of arming vary from aircraft to aircraft, but ultimately the <b>girt</b> <b>bar</b> (a metal bar {{attached to the}} door end of the slide) is physically attached to brackets either in or adjacent to the door sill. On older aircraft, such as the Boeing 737, this is done physically by the cabin crew and on most other aircraft it involves pushing a lever on the door itself which arms the door internally.|$|E
50|$|For {{the slide}} to deploy correctly, it is packed {{in a manner}} that has the aspirators {{directly}} under the outer cover.The entire, self-contained slide pack is approximately 3 ft wide, 2.5 ft long and about 1 ft high, depending on aircraft type. In the center, forward part of the pack, a multi-layered piece of heavy urethane or neoprene/nylon fabric, called the girt, is left hanging out to a length of about 2 ft. When installed in the aircraft, a <b>girt</b> <b>bar</b> is put through the center, outside end of the girt and attached to the interior floor, just inside and in front of the exit door. On the face of the girt are instructions in large red lettering, and a handle with the word 'PULL' on it.|$|E
5000|$|If a rapid {{evacuation}} {{is required}} {{and the doors}} are opened while [...] "armed", {{the opening of the}} door pulls the slide pack out of the bustle (because the <b>girt</b> <b>bar</b> is physically attached to the aircraft floor). Due to the weight of both the door and the slide, great effort is involved in pushing the door open sufficiently to free the slide from the bustle, thus on larger aircraft a [...] "power assist" [...] function kicks in to aid the opening, either electrically or from compressed gas. Once the slide is completely free it will fall under gravity and after travelling a certain distance a pin will be pulled from a squib containing compressed gas and the slide will inflate. Should this system fail, the slide can be manually inflated by the cabin crew by pulling a manual inflation handle {{at the top of the}} slide. Should this also fail, standard operating procedures require the cabin crew to send passengers away from the door and to one that has a functioning escape slide.|$|E
