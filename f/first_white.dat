5|$|Human {{history of}} the Grand Teton region dates back at least 11,000years, when the first nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} Paleo-Indians began migrating into the region during warmer months pursuing food and supplies. In the early 19thcentury, the <b>first</b> <b>White</b> explorers encountered the eastern Shoshone natives. Between 1810 and 1840, the region attracted fur trading companies that vied {{for control of the}} lucrative beaver pelt trade. U.S. Government expeditions to the region commenced in the mid-19thcentury as an offshoot of exploration in Yellowstone, with the first permanent white settlers in Jackson Hole arriving in the 1880s.|$|E
5|$|In April, the 2nd Ranger Infantry Company was {{reattached}} to the 7th Infantry Division, {{this time}} to the 31st Regimental Combat Team. The company spent the month training replacements, with up to 400 enlisted men filtering into the company. By May, the process of transferring these men to other units began as U.S. Army units throughout Korea, driven by necessity, began slowly desegregating. The Rangers eventually settled at a force of 123 men, among them the <b>first</b> <b>white</b> member of the unit, medic Joe Russo.|$|E
5|$|Nada (May 1894 – May 19, 1896), Burnham's daughter, was the <b>first</b> <b>white</b> {{child born}} in Bulawayo; {{she died of}} fever and {{starvation}} during the town's siege.

Chief Halfda allowed Wright to build his cabin {{at the south end of}} the Potawatomi village at the site of the intersection of present-day Milwaukee Avenue and Aptakisic Road. The Potawatomi tribesmen were ousted a year later in the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which was implemented two years after its ratification, and faced relocation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>White</b> House Christmas {{card was}} sent during the {{administration}} of Dwight David Eisenhower in 1953.

Over the course of two terms, the Eisenhower White House issued 38 different cards and prints with many of them bearing the President's own artwork. The tradition was continued during the Kennedy years with Jacqueline Kennedy's artwork featured on a 1963 card issued to raise funds for a national performing arts center.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>white</b> {{settlers}} in Lackawanna County settled near Keyser Creek. Timothy Keys, Solomon Hocksey, and Andrew Hickman constructed homes at this location in 1769.

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Keyser Creek was historically {{affected by}} coal mining {{and has been}} channelized. It has no flow in dry conditions, although it does have some during and after storms. As of 1991, the watershed is mostly forested. The <b>first</b> <b>white</b> settlers in Lackawanna County settled near the creek in 1769. Keyser Creek is a major second-order tributary of the Lackawanna River. Since 2013, a trailhead of the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail has been situated near the creek. A number of bridges have also been built across the creek.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their <b>first</b> <b>white</b> coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 {{he started}} his third All-Star Game, but was charged with the loss despite {{allowing}} only one run in three innings. Buoyed {{by the arrival of}} rookie shortstop Luis Aparicio, who sparked the team in leading the league in stolen bases, the White Sox enjoyed a two-month offensive surge from June 4 to August 3 in which they averaged eight runs in Pierce's 13 starts; he won 11 of the games, losing only those immediately before and after the All-Star break, the latter being a 2–1 loss to Ford and the Yankees. He became the <b>first</b> <b>White</b> Sox pitcher since 1941 to win 20 games, was second in the AL with a career-high 192 strikeouts (a team record for left-handers until Gary Peters had 205 in 1964), and was named AL Pitcher of the Year by The Sporting News, outpolling Ford (who had edged him in a close 1955 vote) by a margin of 117 to 52; he also finished fifth in voting for the AL Most Valuable Player Award. In 1957 Pierce became the <b>first</b> <b>White</b> Sox pitcher since Red Faber (1920–1922) to earn 20 victories in consecutive seasons; he tied Jim Bunning for the league lead, and bested him in voting for AL Pitcher of the Year. He had six consecutive complete game victories from May 16 to June 8 in which his total ERA was 0.64, with two 1–0 victories in ten innings including his sixth career two-hitter on June 4 against the Red Sox; the White Sox scored just nine total runs over the last five games in that stretch. Despite the presence of such popular players as Miñoso, Aparicio and second baseman Nellie Fox, Pierce was chosen as the player most popular with White Sox fans in a 1957 spring training poll of sportswriters. A separate poll of managers, coaches, writers and broadcasters named him Chicago's best fielding pitcher, best pitcher at holding runners to first base, and best pitcher for crucial games, as well as the team's most nervous player on the field.|$|E

The 2014 book The New Moon: Water, Exploration, and Future Habitation by Arlin Crotts discussed the appreciation of the importance of science education by the Obama Administration, citing the White House Astronomy Night and the inclusion of NASA's Lunar Electric Rover in the First inauguration of Barack Obama as key examples. Sally Ride: America's First Woman in Space, a 2015 biography of the astronaut by Lynn Sherr, discussed Ride's attendance at the 2009 White House Astronomy Night and commented that she enjoyed speaking with youngsters about the possibility of humans visiting Mars in the future.|$|E
5|$|The St. Joseph Valley {{was long}} {{occupied}} by Native Americans. One {{of the earliest}} known groups to occupy what would later become northern Indiana was the Miami tribe. Later, the Potawatomi moved into the region, utilizing the rich food and natural resources found along the river. The Potawatomi occupied this region of Indiana until {{most of them were}} forcibly removed in the 1840s. The South Bend area was so popular because its portage was the shortest overland route from the St. Joseph River to the Kankakee River. This route was used for centuries, first by the Native Americans, then by French explorers, missionaries and traders. The French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, the <b>first</b> <b>white</b> European to set foot in what is now South Bend, used this portage between the St. Joseph River and the Kankakee River in December 1679.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>White</b> House Astronomy Night {{was held}} on the South Lawn on October 7, 2009. This first event coincided with the International Year of Astronomy. Science Advisor to the President John Holdren stood next to President Obama as the {{president}} made a speech wherein he emphasized the values of science education and how crucial it was to society to increase the interest of youth towards studying science. This was an attempt by the White House to increase motivation for children to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Only optical telescopes were used to peer at the heavens during the events. Over twenty such telescopes were placed on the South Lawn of the White House in addition to displays of Moon rocks, meteorites, and presentations of the Solar System.|$|E
