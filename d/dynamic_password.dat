We propose <b>dynamic</b> <b>password</b> mechanisms in which a user has a mobile, in that mobile the <b>dynamic</b> <b>password</b> scheme is implemented using Android Operating System, so <b>dynamic</b> <b>password</b> requires {{a small amount of}} human computing to secure users passwords. Among the schemes, we have a default method (i. e., traditional password scheme), system recommended functions, user-specified functions, user-specified programs. A function/program is used to implement the <b>dynamic</b> <b>password</b> concept. For user-specified functions, we adopt secret little functions and a constant value, in which security is enhanced by hiding both. The computation of human can be reduce by using mobile applications with builtin <b>dynamic</b> <b>password.</b> Here the user only needs to input the system random digits which the system provides and then the <b>dynamic</b> <b>password</b> is automatically calculated for the user. Thus we can overcome the main attacks like phishing, key-logger, shoulder-surfing, mobile malwar attacks simultaneously...|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: In {{this paper}} we propose a new verifier-based {{password}} authentication protocol using <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Passwords.</b> The protocol features mutual authentication, integrated session key exchange and is resistant to both dictionary attacks and replay attacks. It also reveals any successful spoofing. The protocol achieves these features by using one-way hash functions, symmetric encryption and two-part <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Passwords.</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Passwords</b> break user passwords into two parts: a dynamic part and a static part. The dynamic part is similar to a one-time password, which can reveal to a legitimate user if any spoofing has occurred and makes the protocol more resistant to social engineering. The static part adds entropy to the password and makes the password more resistant to dictionary attacks. Due to the fact that verifiers are not plain-text equivalent to passwords and from which no meaningful information about passwords can be extracted, verifiers in contrast to passwords are stored in authentication servers. The protocol is most suitable for mobile users because no persistent data is stored on the user side...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The web {{applications}} {{are now being}} used in many security oriented areas, including online shopping, e-commerce, which require the users to transmit sensitive information on the Internet. Therefore, to successfully authenticate each party of web applications is very important. A popular deployed technique for web authentication is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol. However the protocol does not protect the careless users who connect to fraudulent websites from being trapped into tricks. For example, in a phishing attack, a web user who connects to an attacker may provide password to the attacker, who can use it afterwards to log in the target website and get the victim’s credentials. To prevent phishing attacks, the Two-Way Password Protocol (TPP) and <b>Dynamic</b> Two-Way <b>Password</b> Protocol (DTPP) are developed. However there still exist potential security threats in those protocols. For example, an attacker who makes a fake website may obtain the hash of users’ passwords, and use that information to arrange offline password guessing attacks. Based on TPP, we incorporated challenge responses with arbitrary images to prevent the off-line password guessing attacks in our new protocol, TPP with Challenge response using Arbitrary image (TPPCA). Besides TPPCA, we developed another scheme called Rain to solve the same problem by dividing shared secrets into several rounds of negotiations.

Building on this observation, we have developed an end to end system ActivPass and experimented with 70 users. With activity logs from Facebook, browsing his-tory, call logs, and SMSs, the system achieves 95 % success (authenticates legitimate users) and is compromised in 5. 5 % cases (authenticates impostors). While this level of security is obviously inadequate for serious authentication systems, cer-tain practices such as password sharing can immediately be thwarted from the <b>dynamic</b> nature of <b>passwords.</b> With secu-rity improvements in the future, activity-based authentication could fill in for the inadequacies in today’s password-based systems...|$|R
40|$|To keep {{password}} users from creating {{simple and}} common passwords, major websites and applications provide a password-strength measure, namely a password checker that displays instant password strength ratings in levels e. g., “strong”, “mod- erate”, and “weak”.

To address this weakness, we propose and devise the <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Password</b> Policy Generator, namely DPPG, to be an effective and usable alternative to the existing password strength checker. DPPG aims to enforce an evenly-distributed password space and generate dynamic policies for users to cre- ate passwords that are diverse and contribute to the overall security of the password database. Since DPPG is modular and can function with different underlying metrics for policy generation, we further introduce a diversity-based password security metric that evaluates the security of a password database in terms of password space and distribution.

40|$|Abstract—The {{need for}} secure {{communication}} in the Internet {{has led to the}} widespread deployment of secure applicationlevel protocols. The current state-of-the-art is to use TLS, in conjunction with a password protocol. The password protocol, which we call a one-way password protocol (OPP), authenticates a user to a server, using a particular secret called the password. TLS has two functions: (1) It ensures secure communication between a client and a server (2) It allows a user to authenticate a server. The first function effectively provides a secure channel for end-to-end communication between a client and a server. However, the second function is frequently compromised by a variety of Phishing attacks. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a password protocol which we name the Two-way Password Protocol (TPP). TPP, when used in conjunction with TLS, ensures that users correctly authenticate servers, and are protected from Phishing attacks. The first contribution {{of this paper is to}} develop a protocol, called the Universal Password Protocol (UPP), which ensures that a user’s password is kept safe even in the case of a successful Phishing attack. However, it may be noted that a user, after logging in, frequently shares other secrets (such as credit card number) over the secure connection, and UPP cannot protect these. Our second contribution is to build on UPP and develop, first, the Two-Way Password Protocol (TPP), and finally an improved version named the <b>Dynamic</b> Two-Way <b>Password</b> Protocol (DTPP), which ensures that both a server and a client are properly authenticated to each other. This ensures the security of all secrets which should be known only to the client and the server, including, of course, the password. I...|$|R

Government organizations are setting standards, passing laws and forcing organizations and agencies to comply with these standards with non-compliance being met with wide-ranging consequences. There are several issues when it comes to security concerns in these numerous and varying industries with one common weak link being passwords. Most systems today rely on static passwords to verify the user’s identity. However, such passwords come with major management security concerns. Users tend to use easy-to-guess passwords, use the same password in multiple accounts, write the passwords or store them on their machines. Further more, hackers have the option of using many techniques to steal passwords such as shoulder surfing, snooping, sniffing, guessing. Several ‘proper’ strategies for using passwords have been proposed. Some of which are very difficult to use and others might not meet the company’s security concerns. Two factor authentication using devices such as tokens and ATM cards has been proposed to solve the password problem and have shown to be difficult to hack. Two-factor authentication (T-FA) or (2 FA) is a system wherein two different factors are used in conjunction to authenticate. The proposed method guarantees that authenticating to services, such as online Shopping, is done in a very secure manner. The system involves using a OTP (One Time Password) Algorithm generation of <b>Dynamic</b> <b>password</b> for second way of authentication. One time password uses information sent as an SMS to the user as part of the login process...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{collaboration of}} applications {{and services that}} run on a distributed environment using virtualized resources and accessed by common internet protocols and networking standards. Due to its feature and availability of its service at low cost it is achieving increased popularity in IT industry. But there are several issues in cloud computing such as security issues, network issues, performance issues, availability etc. which is ruining its growth. As, people store their confidential and private data on cloud, {{issues related to the}} security of their data is at the top. The user authentication is the key factors of security in cloud. Many of the organizations for authentication still relies on static password authentication technique, but this method is getting old and is becoming less secure. So, there is a requirement for a strong authentication technique. For implementing a strong authentication technique, this paper has proposed a dynamic one-time password technique with two factor authentication scheme in which mobile phones are used as an authentication device. This technique is very robust, secure, multi-factor, <b>dynamic</b> <b>password</b> based authentication scheme. In this technique, mobile phone will run a MIDlet which is responsible to produce one time password which is valid for short period of time. The produced one time password is then used by client to authenticate itself to the cloud. For securely transmitting all the information between client and server, secure socket layer (SSL) has been used. All the information is encrypted by AES- 256 and sends over the network, along with that client can also use virtual private network for carrying the sensitive information into the cloud. So, this paper focus on the authentication and network issues of the cloud...|$|E
