25|$|During 2009 {{the railway}} marked the 150th {{anniversary of the}} first train on the Corris {{with a series of}} events, {{including}} demonstration horse-worked freight trains and gravity runs <b>of</b> rakes <b>of</b> <b>waggons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|CargoBeamer: This newly {{developed}} type <b>of</b> <b>waggon</b> (TSI conformity since 8/2010) enable {{the transport of}} semi-trailers, loading of which is automated by a tub (Wanne) and pulled parallel onto the railway wagon.|$|R
60|$|One {{could see}} the dark moving lines <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> with an {{occasional}} flash of steel from the escort. There could, apart from my promise, be no indiscretion in admitting that which was already obvious.|$|R
60|$|A {{few months}} later three teams <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> {{drove up to the}} farm. It was late in the evening, and their owner, who had met Mr Humphreys several times at Newcastle, knocked at the door.|$|R
50|$|A well-preserved {{section of}} track {{from the south}} side of the McKenzie Inn on Station Road in Bamber Bridge was taken up and relaid in Worden Park in Leyland. Plates and stone {{sleepers}} are in South Ribble Museum in Leyland and the Harris Museum in Preston. The Harris Museum also has a model <b>of</b> a <b>waggon</b> and a wheel and axle <b>of</b> a <b>waggon</b> recovered from the bed of the River Ribble (Clegg et al., 2001). They had lain there since an accident involving the failure of the endless chain on the Avenham Incline, which caused a train <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> to run away and plunge into the river at the bottom.|$|R

60|$|So they journeyed {{on in the}} wain at {{the head}} of a quarter of a mile <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> and pack-horses, slowly indeed, but so {{steadily}} that they were sure of a good start before the princess's departure was known to the Court.|$|R
60|$|To {{convey the}} baggage and stores of so {{numerous}} a force an immense number <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> was required, {{and a very}} urgent appeal was made to the loyalty of the colonists to furnish transport for the troops engaged in fighting their battles.|$|R
5000|$|Dott {{adds that}} [...] "the writer further remarks {{that the use}} of three small instead <b>of</b> one large <b>waggon</b> is not only easier on the horse, but also on the rails—a matter of prime {{importance}} when materials were so faulty. The first expense of making this type <b>of</b> <b>waggon</b> way is undoubtedly great, being at least 10s per running yard," [...] but he comments that it had served six years without any repair worth mentioning.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{it seemed}} to her that she was wide awake, and staring into a part of the pool beneath her where the bottom was of granite and the water clear. In this water she saw a picture. She saw a great laager <b>of</b> <b>waggons,</b> and outside <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> them a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> bearded, jovial-looking men smoking and talking. Presently another man of sturdy build and {{resolute}} carriage, who was followed by a weary Kaffir, walked up to them. His back was towards her so that she could not see his face, but now she was able to hear all that was said, although the voices seemed thin and far away.|$|R
60|$|The convoy marched twenty miles, {{and then}} halted for the night. Two hours after {{they did so}} a great train <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> {{containing}} wounded came up, and halted at the same place. The wounded were lifted out and laid on the ground, where the surgeons attended to the more serious cases.|$|R
50|$|From {{the bottom}} of the plane to Bugsworth Basin, a team of four horses could draw up to twenty wagons. The ganger and nipper (apprentice), {{controlling}} a gang <b>of</b> <b>waggons,</b> rode on the axles and kept the speed at 4 to 6 mph by spragging the wheels to make them skid.|$|R
60|$|After walking two {{or three}} miles Malcolm and Ronald came upon the rear of a train <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> which had set out from Paris an hour earlier. Entering into {{conversation}} {{with one of the}} drivers they found that the convoy was bound for the frontier with ammunition and supplies for the army.|$|R
60|$|He had {{not gone}} far, however, before he met a party of his fellow labourers running home. Their trouble had been saved them. The Roundhead {{soldiers}} had taken possession <b>of</b> <b>waggons,</b> horses, corn and all, as the property of a malignant, and were carrying them off to their camp before the town.|$|R
5000|$|The Conductors of the Passenger Carriages {{have still}} no notice by lights or {{otherwise}} {{of the approach}} or position <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> coming down the [...] "Incline", or proceeding to the Kipps, neither have they notice to avoid the waggons which are sometimes temporarily stationary on the line {{on their way to}} Kipps.|$|R
60|$|On the 20th {{the column}} was marching along a road {{commanded}} {{on both sides}} by rising ground. The troops as usual were marching at ease; one company was ahead of the line <b>of</b> <b>waggons,</b> two companies marched in straggling order {{by the side of}} the long teams, and the fourth company formed the rearguard.|$|R
60|$|Presently the Indians {{were seen}} {{approaching}} at a gallop. As {{soon as they}} {{caught sight of the}} log-house and the inclosure <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> they reined in their horses. The men had been ordered to show themselves, and the sight of some forty white men all armed with rifles brought the Indians to a dead stand-still.|$|R
60|$|Douglas had, {{like the}} Earl of Dunbar, {{perceived}} at what disadvantage the party {{who took the}} offensive would have to fight; and had determined {{to stand on the}} defensive, especially as, if he moved forward, the English could detach bodies of horsemen to work round the hill, and fall upon his immense train <b>of</b> <b>waggons.</b>|$|R

60|$|Followed by long trains of captives, long trains <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> {{bearing the}} spoils of all the world, Alaric went on South, 'with the native {{instinct}} of the barbarian,' as Dr. Sheppard well says. Always toward the sun. Away from Muspelheim and the dark cold north, toward the sun, and Valhalla, where Odin and the Asas dwell in everlasting light.|$|R
60|$|From this {{it will be}} {{seen that}} the {{signalman}} has entire control of the line, and if we consider that shunting <b>of</b> <b>waggons,</b> carriages, and trains is a pretty constant and lively operation at some stations, we can easily conceive that the office of signalman can only be filled by a very able and trustworthy man.|$|R
6000|$|... "A great train <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> {{filled with}} wine and {{provisions}} {{was to start}} at midnight, and will be here to-morrow morning at daybreak. Herds will be driven in, and dispatched at once. By to-morrow night, therefore, the famine will be at an end, and every man, woman, and child in Ghent {{will be able to}} eat their fill." ...|$|R

6000|$|... [With {{the going}} {{down of the}} sun the English army finds itself in [...] {{complete}} possession of the mass <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> and carriages distantly [...] beheld from the rear--laden with pictures, treasure, flour, [...] vegetables, furniture, finery, parrots, monkeys, and women--most [...] of the male sojourners in the town having taken to their heels [...] and disappeared across the fields.|$|R
60|$|In the end I {{felt that}} I could not. Yes, I turned coward {{and saying that}} I must fetch {{something}} out <b>of</b> the <b>waggon,</b> bolted into it, bidding Hans go forward and repeat his tale. He obeyed unwillingly enough and looking out between the curtains <b>of</b> the <b>waggon</b> tent I saw all that happened, though I could not hear the words that passed.|$|R
60|$|As {{they walked}} along towards {{the head of}} the long line <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> Malcolm closely {{scrutinized}} the troopers who formed the escort, but most of them were young soldiers, and he therefore went on without accosting them until he reached {{the head of the}} column. Here two officers were riding together, a captain and a young lieutenant. Malcolm saluted the former.|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall {{sleep in}} no town, {{for there is}} no place on the road between this and Eu that could receive so large a party; but soon after we rode out {{yesterday}} a train <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> with tents and all else needful started from Rouen, and half-way to Eu we shall find the camp erected and everything in readiness for our reception." ...|$|R
5000|$|Robertson's earlier view is {{not entirely}} the same: [...] "The line was built to give a steady {{downhill}} gradient to the sea, even though this required {{the construction of a}} substantial embankment, so that loaded trains <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> could be sent down by gravity under the control of a brakesman, and horses would only be required for returning the empties." ...|$|R

6000|$|On this {{occasion}} no man's service is compelled, {{but you are}} invited [...] voluntarily to come forward in defence of everything that is dear to [...] you, by entering your Names on the Lists which are sent to the Tything- [...] man of every Parish, and engaging to act either as Associated [...] Volunteers bearing Arms, as Pioneers and Labourers, or as Drivers [...] <b>of</b> <b>Waggons.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "My name is King, sir. I {{have just}} {{returned}} from an expedition to Komati, I and three friends with me, and we have succeeded in blowing up a large number <b>of</b> <b>waggons</b> containing a battery of field artillery, two very heavy long guns, which, by the marks on the case, came from Creusot, some eight or ten thousand rifles, and six truck-loads of ammunition." ...|$|R
50|$|On Monday last 17th August, the Rail-road {{from the}} Forest of Dean to Monmouth was opened. A great number <b>of</b> <b>waggons,</b> laden with coal, lime, paving-stone, and other {{productions}} of the forest, followed {{a procession of}} thousands of people, accompanied by flags and a band of music. A numerous company afterwards met at the Beaufort Arms Inn, where a most excellent dinner was provided on the occasion.|$|R
2500|$|The general {{election}} promised {{from the start}} to be a closely contested event. Wilson was clearly the [...] "business" [...] candidate, and Leach was the choice of [...] "moderates," [...] including blacks and organized labor. Blacks then comprised 31 percent of Fourth District voters and {{were expected to be}} decisive in the outcome of the congressional race, the first competitive one since the initial election <b>of</b> <b>Waggonner.</b> Ironically, Leach's later congressional voting record was clearly on the [...] "conservative" [...] side, like that <b>of</b> his predecessor <b>Waggonner,</b> not on the [...] "moderate" [...] side as most observers had anticipated.|$|R
