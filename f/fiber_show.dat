We propose subpath protection, {{which is a}} generalization of shared-path protection. The main ideas of subpath protection are: 1) to partition a large optical network into smaller domains and 2) to apply shared-path protection to the optical network such that an intradomain lightpath does not use resources of other domains and the primary/backup paths of an interdomain lightpath exit a domain (and enter another domain) through a common domain-border node. We mathematically formulate the routing and wavelength-assignment (RWA) problem under subpath protection for a given set of lightpath requests, prove {{that the problem is}} NP-complete, and develop a heuristic to find efficient solutions. Comparisons between subpath protection and shared-path protection on a nationwide network with dozens of wavelengths per <b>fiber</b> <b>show</b> that, for a modest sacrifice in resource utilization, subpath protection achieves improved survivability, much higher scalability, and significantly reduced fault-recovery time...|$|E

A fundamental understanding of such regulation requires insight into the folding properties of the chromatin fiber in molecular detail.

Single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments {{have the potential to}} provide such insight, but interpretation of the data has been hampered by the large variations in experimental force-extension traces. Here we explore the possibility that chromatin fibers are composed of both single-turn and fully wrapped histone octamers. By characterizing the force-dependent behavior of in vitro reconstituted chromatin fibers and reanalyzing existing data, we show the unwrapping of the outer turn of nucleosomal DNA at 3 pN. We present a model composed of two freely-jointed chains, which reveals that nucleosomes within the chromatin <b>fiber</b> <b>show</b> identical force-extension behavior to mononucleosomes, indicating that nucleosome-nucleosome interactions are orders-of-magnitude smaller than previously reported and therefore can be overcome by thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that lowering the salt concentration externally increases the wrapping energy significantly, indicative of the electrostatic interaction between the wrapped DNA and the histone octamer surface. We propose that the weak interaction between nucleosomes could allow easy access to nucleosomal DNA, while DNA unwrapping from the histone core could provide a stable yet dynamic structure during DNA maintenance...|$|E

40|$|The unusual {{dynamics}} of water under confinement {{is important to}} a number of conventional and emerging industrial processes and to life in general; nevertheless, our understanding of this critical area is still in an early stage. Nanoporous carbons have provided a key material through which to investigate this dynamics; however, existing simulations have been based on the use of idealized slit pore carbons or carbon nanotubes with smooth energy landscapes and fail to capture the influence of structural disorder inherent to real carbons. We show here that the irregular structure of such carbons critically influences the dynamics and the mode of diffusion (single file, subdiffusion or Fickian). Our molecular dynamics simulations, using a realistic hydrophobic carbon model based on hybrid reverse Monte Carlo simulation of the structure of an activated carbon <b>fiber,</b> <b>show</b> the existence of a single-file diffusion mode between the ballistic and Fickian modes in the narrowest pore regions of this material, not seen in simulations using model 2 -D slit pores. A rich variety of behavior is found in this subdiffusion regime, with the fits of time-dependent mean square displacement to the power law of time (alpha t(a)), revealing that the exponent a varies significantly with temperature, especially at low temperatures (273 - 350 K). It reaches a minimum value of 0. 5 at 298 K corresponding to the single-file diffusion regime and approaches unity at 610 K, corresponding to the Fickian mode.

This research has been approached with cupper and iron (Cu 2 + and Fe 2 +), being both materials commonly used in water supply systems. Spanish regulation allows maximum levels of 2 mg/L for Cu 2 + and 0. 2 mg/L for Fe 2 +. Two types of vegetable fibers were used: banana fiber from Canary Islands and abaca fiber from Ecuador. Also different length fibers have been used, studying that way the effect of the superficial area on the adsorptive of ions on natural material. The amount of fiber used has also been varied, from 5 to 20 g per 100 mL of water sample.

Organic contents of muscle cells were replaced by phosphatized minerals. Fungal and bacterial cells, including extracellular polymer (EPS), were preserved as casts and moulds. Ultrastructural and biogeochemical analysis of the sedimentary rock matrix yielded significant data on the genesis of the limestone-marl laminar rhythmites of the Múzquiz fossil bearing strata, probably induced by diagenetic alteration, mainly as consequence of aragonite dissolution in the laminar interfaces. Biogeochemical analysis of fossil material showed a high concentration of Si, P, Ca, Fe and enrichment of Na, Mg, K, Cr, Mn, Zn, As, Sr and Ba, suggesting that such elements may be involved in the process of soft tissue preservation and could be used as fossil fingerprints.

We demonstrate quantum-limited noise {{performance of a}} hybridly modelocked semiconductor laser with an rms timing jitter of only 47 fs (10 Hz to 10 MHz) and 86 fs (10 Hz to 4. 5 GHz). The daunting task of measuring ultralow-noise levels is solved by a combined use of microwave and optical measurement techniques that yield complete characterization of the laser noise from DC to half the laser repetition rate. Optical cross-correlation techniques are {{shown to be a}} useful tool for quantifying fast noise processes, isolating the timing jitter noise component, measuring timing jitter asymmetries, and measuring correlations of pulses in harmonically modelocked lasers. A noise model for harmonically modelocked lasers is presented that illustrates how to correctly interpret the amplitude noise and timing jitter from microwave measurements. Using information about the supermodes, the amplitude and timing noise can be quantified independently, thereby making it possible to measure the noise of harmonically modelocked lasers with multi-gigahertz repetition rates. Methods to further reduce the noise of a modelocked laser are explored. We demonstrate that photon seeding is effective at reducing the noise of a modelocked semiconductor laser without increasing the pulse width.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop an understanding of the high strain rate response of High Performance Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC). The research is divided into four parts. In the first, HPFRCC with high tensile strength (> 10 MPa) and ductility (> 0. 5 %) is developed by using slip hardening fibers within a high strength mortar. Two types of fibers, twisted and hooked, are used in volume fractions ranging from 1 to 2 %. The large slip capacity of twisted fibers during pullout generates large pullout energy (large equivalent bond strength), and thus leads to high strain capacity composites with multiple micro-cracks. In the second part, experiments are performed to investigate the effect of strain rate on fiber pullout and composite response. The rate sensitivity of HPFRCC in tension depends on fiber type, volume fraction and matrix strength (or composition). As the strain rate increases, HPFRCC with twisted fibers exhibits a pronounced, beneficial strain rate effect, i. e. a higher tensile strength is achieved with no reduction in strain capacity. In contrast, HPFRCC with hooked <b>fiber</b> <b>show</b> no clear strain rate effect. In the third part of this work, a new impact test system that employs suddenly released elastic strain energy is developed to enable impact testing for cementitious composites with large-sized specimen. A prototype system that was simulated and built is only 1. 5 m in height and can generate a high rate impact pulse. Compared to current impact test system, the new setup is inexpensive, small, portable, safe and easy to operate. Finally, the source of strength enhancement for cement-based materials under high rate compressive loadings was investigated through computational simulation models. The observed strain rate effect or mortar under compression is primarily, but not totally, due to lateral inertial effects under high rate loading and the pressure dependent nature of cementitious materials. The test and simulation results show {{that it is possible to}} develop a high performance cementitious composite with 1 % to 2 % volume fraction of fibers that has high energy absorption capacity and that can therefore be used to mitigate the effect of extreme loading such as earthquakes, impact, and blast...|$|E
