Ambedkar, the Minister of Law in the Interim Government, and a leader who drafted of the Indian constitution alone according to constitutional debate available on the government website, made provisions <b>for</b> <b>reservations</b> for Scheduled Castes (previously termed 'untouchables') in government run institutions in the 1950s. Consequently, IITs have been offering reservation for Scheduled Castes and Tribes of society since 1973. However, while a policy of quota system exists throughout the country for their reservation, a slightly different scheme is implemented in IITs, as these are Institutes of National Importance.|$|E

25|$|The Raja of Panagal {{government}} had introduced the Communal Government Order (G. O. No. 613) in 1921 which introduced reservations in the Presidency. However, {{the provisions of}} this act were not implemented till 1927. The Subbarayan government, therefore, introduced the Communal G. O. Ms No. 1021 to implement the 1921 order. The act was introduced by S. Muthiah Mudaliar, the Education Minister in Subbarayan's cabinet on 11 April 1927. This act, it is believed, introduced provisions <b>for</b> <b>reservations</b> for Dalits and increased representation for Indian Christians and Muslims. At the same time, it reduced the reservations for Brahmins from 22% to 16% and non-Brahmins from 48% to 42%. This act was in effect till India's independence on 15 August 1947.|$|E
