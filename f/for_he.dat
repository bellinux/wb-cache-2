5|$|After much contemplation, {{she chose}} not to abdicate. Joseph himself often {{threatened}} to resign as co-regent and emperor, but he, too, was induced not to do so. Her threats of abdication were rarely taken seriously; Maria Theresa believed that her recovery from smallpox in 1767 {{was a sign that}} God wished her to reign until death. It was in Joseph's interest that she remained sovereign, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> often blamed her for his failures and thus avoided taking on the responsibilities of a monarch.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{commitment}} to discipline the army and serve the Republic which attracted the admiration of people, his temper caused some to abhor him.

Besides his military studies, Luna also studied pharmacy, literature and chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Essentially a stylist, Kippax was {{in every}} sense a great batsman, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> could suit his game {{to the needs of}} the occasion.

5|$|Ramírez had {{difficulty}} with his vision; {{he could not}} see which pitch the catcher was calling <b>for.</b> <b>He</b> was fitted for prescription goggles, which he continued to wear throughout his career. Angels' MLB players of the time did not remember working with Ramírez; catcher José Molina suggested that Ramírez must not have been in the Angels' long-term plans, as they had a number of right-handed power pitching relief pitchers in the organization.|$|E

5|$|The exact date of Gubazes's {{accession}} is unknown, but it {{must not}} have been much earlier than 541, when he is first attested as king of the Lazi. It is very likely that before his accession he had lived for several years at the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> is recorded {{to have been a}} silentiarius, an influential position at the imperial palace; alternatively, but less probably, he may have been given the title as an honorary appointment after his accession.|$|E

He commanded Carrier Division Eleven around Tarawa for several more days, returning to Pearl Harbor on 4 December.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that those net-men wearing tunics, known as retiarii tunicati, formed a special sub-class, one even more demeaned than their loincloth-wearing colleagues. The Roman satirist Juvenal wrote that: So even the lanista's establishment is better ordered than yours, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> separates the vile from the decent, and sequesters even from their fellow-retiarii the wearers of the ill-famed tunic; in the training-school, and even in gaol, such creatures herd apart….|$|E
