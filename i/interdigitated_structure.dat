40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} for the ethanol-induced aggregation/fusion of uniform-sized small liposomes comprised of dipalmitoyl (DPPC) or egg yolk (eggPC) phosphatidylcholines was studied by measuring the average size using a photon correlation spectroscopy, by observing directly {{the states in the}} liposomal solutions using freeze-fracture electron microscopy and by attempting resonance energy transfer using fluorophore-labeled phospholipids. Abrupt increases in the apparent size of DPPC liposomes were observed in the presence of above 44 mg/ml ethanol, where microscopically plateau membranes form <b>interdigitated</b> <b>structure,</b> in which the acyl chains fully interpenetrate the hydrocarbon chains of the apposing monolayer. On the contrary, in the eggPC liposome, where the membranes cannot form interdigitated structures even in the presence of high concentration of ethanol, such intense aggregation and fusion were not observed, suggesting their intimate relation to the <b>interdigitated</b> <b>structure</b> formation. The formation of interdigitated structures in the adhering region leads to an increase in the interfacial area and an exposure of hydrophobic acyl chain terminal on the surface area, and enhances hydrophobic interactions between two interdigitated bilayers. Thus, the resultant <b>interdigitated</b> <b>structure</b> makes the aggregated state stable and partially initiates the bilayer mixing between the two apposed membranes, leading to fusion...|$|E

Introduction In the last decade, some {{attempts have been made to}} develop automation for analog circuit layout design [1, 2, 3, 4]. Since the constraints for analog and digital design are different, the techniques for digital circuits cannot be easily ported to analog design.

40|$|AbstractAdsorption {{of alcohol}} {{molecules}} or other small amphiphilic molecules {{in the cell}} membrane can induce {{significant changes in the}} structure of the membrane. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these structural changes, we developed a mesoscopic membrane model. Molecular simulations on this model nicely reproduce the experimental phase diagrams. We find that alcohol can induce an <b>interdigitated</b> <b>structure</b> in which the normal bilayer structure changes into a monolayer in which the alcohol molecules screen the hydrophobic tails from the water phase. We compute the effect of the chain length of the alcohol on the phase behaviour of the membrane. At low concentrations of alcohol, the membrane has domains of the interdigitated phase that are in coexistence with the normal membrane phase. We use our model to clarify some of the experimental questions related to the structure of the interdigitated phase and put forward a simple model that explains the alcohol chain length dependence of the stability of this interdigitated phase...|$|E

Even after the HDTMS formed initial bilayer-by-bilayer structures, mixing of these aggregates with foreign additives at room temperature can change the original structure to a more compact configuration (i. e., interdigitated). Our MD simulations further revealed that the most favorable organization for this interdigitated stacking {{appears to be a}} formation of relatively small domains of HDTMS and TMOS molecules, supporting our proposal of a heterogeneous mixing before reorganization. Although the coassembly of binary or multiple building blocks has previously been used to modify a supramolecule or to produce a supramolecular composite, the modification of already formed supramolecules via molecular intercalation, examined here, provides a flexible path for decorating more advanced supramolecules without disturbing their complex assembly conditions.

Small angle X-ray diffraction experiments strongly indicated that these bilayers are interdigitated at 98 % relative humidity in the gel phase. The slight differences in the structures of the ether lipids affect their thermal behavior and packing properties. Of the three, (R) -Lyso-PAF shows the highest phase transition temperature, broadest phase transition peak and smallest enthalpy change.

To provide experimental evidence of this lipid bilayer organization, phospholipids spin-labeled at different positions of the hydrocarbon chain were incorporated into the membrane and their Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectra were recorded at different temperatures. For comparison, similar experiments were performed with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, a zwitterionic lipid (DMPC) which adopts a bilayer organization over a broad temperature range. Lipid mixing between diC 14 -amidine and asolectin liposomes was more efficient below (10 - 15 °C) than above the transition temperature (above 25 °C). This temperature-dependent "fusogenic" activity of diC 14 -amidine liposomes is opposite {{to what has been}} observed so far for peptides or virus-induced fusion.
