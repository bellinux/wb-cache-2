40|$|According to Gibson (1962) {{fixation}} on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters {{has a major}} role in the development of emergent literacy. But it was still unknown which role <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters had on children who can’t read or write conventional. The following hypotheses where tested in this research: ‘Do 4 -year old children fixate more on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters than 3 -year old children?’, ‘Do 4 -year old children fixate longer on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters than 3 -year old children?’, ‘Mediates letter knowledge the relation number of fixations on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters and emergent writing?’ and ‘Mediates letter knowledge the relation fixation time on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters and emergent writing?’ In this research 75 4 -year old and 104 3 -year old children participated. The Tobii eye tracker x 2 - 60 recorded the fixation count and duration on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters. Besides using the eye tracker device, a letter knowledge task has been taken. At the same time a test was taken to determine the stage of emergent writing. The first task of the letter perception test was not significant (P >. 05). But there was a significant difference between the 3 - and 4 -year old and the second task fixation count on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters, t (171) = - 2. 05, p =. 042. A significant difference between the 3 - and 4 -year old was shown on the second task fixation duration on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters, t (171) = - 2. 83, p =. 005. Additionally can be concluded that letter knowledge (p <. 01) mediates significant between the first and second task fixation duration and the first and second task fixation count on <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters and emergent writing. Concluding, from the early childhood letter {{fixation on}} <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of letters has influence on the further development of emergent literacy...|$|R
40|$|The kidneys {{are very}} vital organs. Failing kidneys lose {{their ability to}} filter out waste products, {{resulting}} in kidney disease. To extend or {{save the lives of}} patients with impaired kidney function, kidney replacement is typically utilized, such as hemodialysis. This work uses an entropy function to identify <b>key</b> <b>features</b> related to hemodialysis. By identifying these <b>key</b> <b>features,</b> one can determine whether a patient requires hemodialysis. This work uses these <b>key</b> <b>features</b> as dimensions in cluster analysis. The <b>key</b> <b>features</b> can effectively determine whether a patient requires hemodialysis. The proposed data mining scheme finds association rules of each cluster. Hidden rules for causing any kidney disease can therefore be identified. The contributions and key points of this paper are as follows. (1) This paper finds some <b>key</b> <b>features</b> {{that can be used to}} predict the patient who may has high probability to perform hemodialysis. (2) The proposed scheme applies k-means clustering algorithm with the <b>key</b> <b>features</b> to category the patients.

5|$|Though Eastbourne is a {{relatively}} new town, there is evidence of human occupation in the area from the Stone Age. The town grew as a fashionable tourist resort largely thanks to prominent landowner, William Cavendish, later to become the Duke of Devonshire. Cavendish appointed architect Henry Currey to design a street plan for the town, but not before sending him to Europe to draw inspiration. The resulting mix of architecture is typically Victorian and remains a <b>key</b> <b>feature</b> of Eastbourne.|$|E

5|$|Combined Emergency Service – {{these are}} full service {{emergency}} service agencies, {{which may be}} found in places such as airports or large colleges and universities. Their <b>key</b> <b>feature</b> is that all personnel are trained not only in ambulance (EMT) care, but as a firefighter and a peace officer (police function). They {{may be found in}} smaller towns and cities, where size or budget does not warrant separate services.

5|$|Dentition is the <b>key</b> <b>feature</b> {{by which}} fossil rodents are {{recognized}} and the earliest record of such mammals {{comes from the}} Paleocene, shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. These fossils are found in Laurasia, the supercontinent composed of modern-day North America, Europe, and Asia. The divergence of Glires, a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas), from other placental mammals occurred within a few million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; rodents and lagomorphs then radiated during the Cenozoic. Some molecular clock data suggest modern rodents (members of the order Rodentia) had appeared by the late Cretaceous, although other molecular divergence estimations are {{in agreement with the}} fossil record.|$|E

5|$|Ikaruga is a shoot 'em up {{video game}} {{developed}} by Treasure. It is the spiritual sequel to Radiant Silvergun (1998) and was originally released in Japanese arcades in December 2001. The game's story follows a rebel pilot named Shinra as he battles an enemy nation using {{a specially designed}} fighter called the Ikaruga which can flip between two polarities, black and white. This polarity mechanic is the game's <b>key</b> <b>feature</b> and the foundation for its stage and enemy design. All enemies and bullets in the game are either black or white. Bullets which are {{the same color as}} the player are absorbed while the others will kill the player. The game features both single-player and cooperative modes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a <b>key</b> <b>feature</b> of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} immune system known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E
5|$|The Bolton Wanderers club badge {{consists}} of the initials of the club {{in the shape of}} a ball, with a red scroll and Lancashire rose underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by a badge which retained the recognisable initials but controversially exchanged the scroll and rose for blue and red ribbons. The re-design has been welcomed by fans who saw the ribbons as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a <b>key</b> <b>feature</b> of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera Moras. This feature has been reincorporated into more recent club shirts.|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} is to refine the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care by developing a taxonomy that specifies the underlying <b>key</b> <b>features</b> of the six dimensions. Methods:  First, a literature review was conducted to identify features for achieving integrated service delivery. Second, a thematic analysis method was used to develop a taxonomy of <b>key</b> <b>features</b> organised into the dimensions of the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care. Finally, the appropriateness of the <b>key</b> <b>features</b> was tested in a Delphi study among Dutch experts. Results:  The taxonomy consists of 59 <b>key</b> <b>features</b> distributed across the six integration dimensions of the Rainbow Model of Integrated Care. <b>Key</b> <b>features</b> associated with the clinical, professional, organisational and normative dimensions were considered appropriate by the experts. <b>Key</b> <b>features</b> linked to the functional and system dimensions were considered less appropriate.

On SAR variants, the cabin was enlarged by a stretch of the fuselage behind the door; another <b>key</b> <b>feature,</b> used for additional flotation in the unusual event of a water landing, inflatable buoyancy bags were housed inside the aircraft's sponsons. Upgrades and changes made to SAR Sea Kings include the addition of radar warning receivers, a cargo hook for the underslung carriage of goods, and the redesigning of the cockpit for compatibility with night vision goggles.|$|E
5|$|A <b>key</b> <b>feature</b> of the Cadet Nurse Corps {{program was}} its {{accelerated}} training curricula. Participating schools of nursing {{were required to}} compress the traditional nursing program of 36 months to 30 months. They were also bound to provide the students with the four clinical experiences of medical, surgical, obstetrics, and pediatrics. The students became senior cadets {{in the last six}} months before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital. They rendered full-time service equivalent to that of a graduate nurse. During their first nine months of service, the cadets were protected by regulation from working on the wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes. Senior cadets were free of classes. All State Boards of Nursing modified their regulations to agree with the accelerated program.|$|E
5|$|A <b>key</b> <b>feature</b> of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle {{over the side}} of the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a tilted seat at 13–15°. The tilted seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E

5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a <b>key</b> <b>feature</b> of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the specimen was either a runt of either the yellow-breasted fruit dove or a Treron pigeon, or a hybrid instead of a unique species; however, these views are generally considered invalid {{due in part to the}} distinctiveness of the specimen, particularly in the bare skin around the eye, and no proper evidence has suggested that the Negros fruit dove is an invalid species. It is uncertain where the dove should be placed within the genus Ptilinopus as the male's plumage, a <b>key</b> <b>feature</b> used in organizing the Ptilinopus doves, is unknown. It has been suggested that the Negros fruit dove is either most closely related to the black-naped fruit dove or represents an early colonization of the Philippines by the genus that has left no surviving close relatives. It has no known subspecies and is also known as Ripley's fruit dove.|$|E
5|$|Studies to {{quantify}} this theory {{have shown that}} there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, and endotoxin. In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as ornipressin, terlipressin, and octreotide) leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a <b>key</b> <b>feature</b> of its pathogenesis.|$|E
