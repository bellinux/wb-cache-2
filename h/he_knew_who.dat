5|$|Hans Bethe {{once said}} that Klaus Fuchs was the only {{physicist}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> truly changed history. Because {{the head of the}} Soviet project, Lavrenti Beria, used foreign intelligence as a third-party check, rather than giving it directly to the scientists, as he did not trust the information by default, it is unknown whether Fuchs's fission information had a substantial effect. Considering that the pace of the Soviet program was set primarily by the amount of uranium they could procure, it is hard for scholars to accurately judge how much time this saved.|$|E

He was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

5|$|Despite {{the threat}} of imprisonment, Mysterion unmasks himself, showing the {{television}} viewers only the portion of his face that looks similar to almost all of Mr. Garrison's 4th grade class. The crowd, however, is shocked to learn Mysterion's identity and, much to the regret of all except Coon, who says that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> Mysterion was, even calling him out on it at one point (though this helps the audience little as Cartman claimed that practically everyone in his class was Mysterion at times), Mysterion is hauled to prison. With Professor Chaos, General Disarray and Mysterion defeated, Cartman now perceives {{that he is the}} superhero in South Park and that every town should have a Coon like him.|$|E

Toth, who was driving, was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.139 and {{was arrested and charged with}} driving under the influence and failing to maintain a lane. Witherspoon was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for disobeying the arresting officer's instructions to remain in the vehicle and arguing with him, asking if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> she was. Witherspoon pleaded no contest and was fined $313, including court costs.|$|E
5|$|M is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Ian Fleming's James Bond book and film series; {{the character is}} the Head of the Secret Intelligence Service—also known as MI6—and is Bond's superior.

M has appeared in the novels by Fleming and seven continuation authors, as well as appearing in twenty-four films. In the Eon Productions series of films, M has been portrayed by four actors: Bernard Lee, Robert Brown, Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes, the incumbent; in the two independent productions, M was played by John Huston, David Niven and Edward Fox.|$|E

25|$|Zemfira asks Aleko if {{he misses}} {{the splendor of}} his homeland, but he {{responds}} that his only desire is to spend his life with her in voluntary exile. (ll.174–176). The Old Man warns that although Aleko loves the Gypsy life, this feeling may not last forever, and tells {{a story of a}} man that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> spent his entire life with the Gypsies but who eventually pined for his homeland and asked to be buried there. (ll.181–216). This is thought to be a reference to the Roman poet Ovid, who was banished to Tomis in 8AD.|$|E
25|$|Marsh had a {{controversial}} start to his Test career, selected {{on account of}} his batting abilities. Sections of the media lampooned Marsh’s glovework, dubbing him “Iron Gloves” after sloppy catching in his debut Test. His keeping improved over time {{and by the end of}} his career he was regarded as one of the finest in the history of the sport. He was widely regarded for his sense of team discipline, in particular after Bill Lawry controversially declared the Australian first innings closed in the Fifth Test of the 1970–71 series at the MCG with Marsh just eight runs short of a century. Greg Chappell said he was one of only two players <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> would kill to get into the Australian Test team, the other being Ian Redpath.|$|E

25|$|Magda and Ruggero {{have been}} living {{together}} on the French Riviera for some months. They talk about their first meeting and happiness together, living quietly by the sea. Ruggero tells Magda that he has written to his mother to ask for money to pay their growing debts and for her consent to his marriage to Magda. Ruggero imagines their happy married life and the child they may have (Aria: Dimmi che vuoi seguirmi). Magda is deeply touched, but also uneasy: she knows that her past life as a courtesan would make her unacceptable to Ruggero's family, and possibly to Ruggero if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> she really was. As Ruggero leaves to post his letter she meditates on her dilemma, torn between her desire to tell Ruggero everything, her wish not to hurt him and her fear of losing his love. Prunier and Lisette arrive. Lisette has had a brief and disastrous career as a music-hall singer: her performance in Nice the previous evening was a catastrophe. She and Prunier bicker with each other while waiting for Magda. When Magda appears, Lisette begs for her job back, and Magda consents. Prunier expresses surprise that Magda can be happy away from Paris, and delivers a message to Magda from Rambaldo: he is happy to take her back on any terms. Magda refuses to listen. Prunier takes his leave of Lisette (first arranging a rendezvous with her for that evening) and Lisette resumes her duties as Magda's maid. Ruggero returns with a letter from his mother, in which she says that if Ruggero's fiancée has all the virtues he has described to her, {{he will have a}} blissful marriage. She looks forward to welcoming the couple to her home and sends Magda a kiss. Magda is unable to keep her secret any longer. She tells Ruggero about her past and declares that she can never be his wife – she would cause his parents too much grief. Ruggero implores Magda not to abandon him (Ma come puoi lasciarmi), but Magda is adamant that they cannot remain together, and that Ruggero must return home. Like a swallow, she flies back to Rambaldo and her old life, leaving Ruggero behind, devastated.|$|E

At Livermore, Teller continued work on the hydride bomb, and the result was a dud. Ulam once wrote to a colleague about an idea he had shared with Teller: [...] "Edward is full of enthusiasm about these possibilities; this is perhaps an indication they will not work." [...] Fermi once said that Teller was the only monomaniac <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> had several manias.|$|E

500|$|In 1976, at age 16 and as {{a member}} of the Melbourne punk rock band Young Charlatans, Howard wrote [...] "Shivers". Discussing the song's origins, Howard said that [...] "Shivers" [...] was [...] "intended as an ironic comment on the way that I felt that people I knew were making hysterical things out of what were {{essentially}} high school crushes". He further explained that the emotional responses of people <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> were in relationships seemed [...] "incredibly insincere and blown out of proportion" [...] and inspired the cynical lyrics of the song.|$|E
500|$|A disgruntled {{worker was}} widely suspected. When Adolph Fischer {{was asked if}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> threw the bomb, he answered, [...] "I suppose it was some excited workingman." [...] Oscar Neebe {{said it was a}} [...] "crank." [...] Governor Altgeld speculated the bomb thrower might have been a disgruntled worker who was not {{associated}} with the defendants or the anarchist movement but had a personal grudge against the police. In his pardoning statement, Altgeld said the record of police brutality towards the workers had invited revenge adding, [...] "Capt.

Alexander is not Gladiator." [...] In response, Sean Penn rebutted Rock's remarks praising Law {{as one of his}} generation's [...] "finest actors". Over a year later, Law {{expressed}} his anger toward Rock in The New York Times telling columnist Craig Modderno, [...] "At first I laughed because I didn't think <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> I was.

500|$|Kricfalusi's team wrote story {{outlines}} for thirteen {{episodes in}} a week and pitched them to Price. By the next week, Kricfalusi had hired animators <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> had been working at other studios. [...] went into production the month it was greenlighted; it was scheduled to premiere on September 19, 1987. This haste required the crew to be split into four teams, led by supervising director Kricfalusi, Fitzgerald, Steve Gordon and Bruce Woodside. Each team was given a handful of episodes, and operated almost entirely independently of the others. Although the scripts required approval by CBS executives, Kricfalusi insisted that the artists add visual gags as they drew. Bruce Timm, Andrew Stanton, Dave Marshall and Jeff Pidgeon were among the artists {{who worked on the}} series. Despite the time constraints, CBS was pleased with the way Bakshi Productions addressed the network's notes.|$|E
500|$|Klowden {{recalled}} {{later that}} [...] "he was very {{down in the}} dumps about his wife. [...] He told me how he had met Northrup.

I remember he said to me I was the only person <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> would set up a white silk tent for him. I was rather surprised when we were driving back to LA on Sunday evening, he stopped at a florist to buy some flowers for his wife." [...] In November 1950, Northrup attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills. Hubbard blamed Klowden for the suicide bid and told her to forget about him and the Foundation, but resumed the affair with her again within a month.|$|E
500|$|Bryan Singer met Kevin Spacey {{at a party}} after a {{screening}} of the young filmmaker's first film, Public Access, at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival. Spacey had been encouraged {{by a number of}} people <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> had seen it, and was so impressed that he told Singer and McQuarrie {{that he wanted to be}} in whatever film they did next. Singer read a column in Spy magazine called [...] "The Usual Suspects" [...] after Claude Rains' line in Casablanca. Singer thought that it would be a good title for a film. When asked by a reporter at Sundance what their next film was about, McQuarrie replied, [...] "I guess it's about a bunch of criminals who meet in a police line-up," [...] which incidentally was the first visual idea that he and Singer had for the poster: [...] "five guys who meet in a line-up," [...] Singer remembers. The director also envisioned a tagline for the poster, [...] "All of you can go to Hell." [...] Singer then asked the question, [...] "What would possibly bring these five felons together in one line-up?" [...] McQuarrie revamped an idea from one of his own unpublished screenplays — the story of a man who murders his own family and disappears. The writer mixed this with the idea of a team of criminals.|$|E
