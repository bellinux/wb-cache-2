50|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, Volkswagen {{introduced}} the Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG), a type of dual clutch transmission. It is an automated semi-automatic transmission, drivable like a conventional automatic transmission. Based on the gearbox found in the Group B S1, the system includes <b>dual</b> electrohydraulically <b>controlled</b> <b>clutches</b> instead of a torque converter. This is implemented in some VW Golfs, Audi A3, Audi A4 and TT models where DSG is called S-tronic.|$|R

40|$|Autonomous agents {{engaged in}} a {{continuous}} interaction with an incompletely known environment face the problem of <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> [Fel'dbaum 1965]. Simply stated, actions are necessary not only for studying the environment, but also for making progress on the task. In other words, actions must bear a "dual" character: They must be investigators to some degree, but also directors to some degree. Because the number of variables involved in {{the solution of the}} <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> problem increases with the number of decision stages, the exact solution of the <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> problem is computationally intractable except for a few special cases. This paper provides an overview of <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> theory and proposes a heuristic approach towards obtaining a near-optimal <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> method that can be implemented. The proposed algorithm selects control actions taking into account the information contained in past observations as well as the possible information that future observations may reveal. In short, t [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A {{vibration}} retest of {{a spacecraft}} flight instrument, the Mars Observer Camera (MOC), was conducted using extremal <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> to automatically limit the shaker force and notch the shaker acceleration at resonances. This {{was the first}} application of extremal <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> with flight hardware at JPL. The retest was successful in that the environment was representative of flight plus some margin, the instrument survived without any structural or performance degradation, and the force limiting worked very well. The test set-up, force limiting procedure, and test results are described herein. It is concluded that <b>dual</b> <b>control</b> should be utilized {{when there is a}} concern about overtesting in hard-base-drive tests and the instrumentation for force measurement and control is available.
