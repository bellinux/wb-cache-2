5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{purchased}} the film rights to Gary K. Wolf's novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? shortly after its publication in 1981. Ron W. Miller, {{then president of}} Disney, {{saw it as a}} perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were hired to write the script, penning two drafts. Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in 1982, but Disney declined as his two previous films (I Wanna <b>Hold</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hand</b> and Used Cars) had been box office bombs. Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van Citters as animation director, Paul Reubens voicing Roger Rabbit, Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant, and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit. The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner, the then-new CEO of Disney. Amblin Entertainment, which consisted of Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, were approached to produce Who Framed Roger Rabbit alongside Disney. The original budget was projected at $50 million, which Disney felt was too expensive.|$|E
25|$|Kaufman was parodied in {{the film}} The Rutles – All You Need Is Cash as a radio host named Bill Murray the K, played by actor Bill Murray. Kaufman {{appeared}} as a guest star on the 1960s television series Coronet Blue and also appeared as himself {{in the film}} I Wanna <b>Hold</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hand.</b> He also appeared in the 1975 film That's the Way of the World.|$|E
500|$|Critics universally acknowledged, {{but gave}} mixed {{opinions}} on, the game's {{high level of}} difficulty. This sentiment was epitomized by Sliva's comment that [...] "Don't Starve will never, ever <b>hold</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> and I both love it and hate it for that." [...] For example, he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game's camera system obscuring needed objects. Meunier stated that [...] "survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge," [...] but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game's cons. Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that [...] "learning is half the fun and even the smallest victory {{makes you feel like}} you’re winning with a capital FU." [...] Reviewers also felt that players' levels of satisfaction would depend heavily on their levels of commitment to survival.|$|E

500|$|Xbox World Australia {{gave the}} game 90/100, saying [...] "Devil May Cry 4 is {{everything}} a hack-and-slash {{should be and}} then some. Sadly it falters with repeated level design and a moderately troublesome camera; but {{in the grand scheme}} of things, these are only minor flaws." [...] PSM3 gave the game an 80 out of 100. The magazine discussed the difficulty of the game, saying, [...] "Most games these days tend to <b>hold</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand</b> all the way through...Devil May Cry is not like that. It'll throw a million demons at you because it wants to, put in half a dozen arbitrary fights in a 30-foot stretch of map, force you to survive for ages on a tiny sliver of health... and then give you a D at the end of the level because you weren't doing enough combos." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{two were}} tempted to ally {{themselves}} with Steven Spielberg, who produced Used Cars and I Wanna <b>Hold</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hand,</b> which were both box office bombs. Zemeckis and Gale initially had shown the screenplay to Spielberg, who had [...] "loved" [...] it. Spielberg, however, was {{absent from the}} project during development because Zemeckis felt if he produced another flop under him, {{he would never be}} able to make another film. Gale said [...] "we were afraid that we would get the reputation that we were two guys who could only get a job because we were pals with Steven Spielberg." [...] Zemeckis chose to direct Romancing the Stone instead, which was a box office success. Now a high-profile director, Zemeckis reapproached Spielberg with the concept. Agreeing to produce Back to the Future, Spielberg set the project up at his production company, Amblin Entertainment, with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall joining Spielberg as executive producers on the film.|$|E
500|$|Zemeckis and Gale {{said that}} they had set the story in 1955 because a 17-year-old {{traveling}} to meet his parents at the same age arithmetically required the script to travel to that decade. The era also marked the rise of teenagers as an important cultural element, the birth of rock n' roll, and suburb expansion, which would flavor the story. In an early script, the time machine was designed as a refrigerator, and its user needed to use the power of an atomic explosion at the Nevada Test Site to return home. Zemeckis was [...] "concerned that kids would accidentally lock themselves in refrigerators", and found that it would be more convenient if the time machine were mobile. The DeLorean DMC-12 was chosen because its design made the gag about the family of farmers mistaking it for a flying saucer believable. Zemeckis and Gale found it difficult to create a believable friendship between Marty and Brown before they created the giant guitar amplifier, and only resolved his Oedipal relationship with his mother when they wrote the line [...] "It's like I'm kissing my brother." [...] Biff Tannen was named after studio executive Ned Tanen, who behaved aggressively toward Zemeckis and Gale during a script meeting for I Wanna <b>Hold</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hand.</b>|$|E

500|$|... "I'm Her Slave" [...] is {{a heroin}} anecdote with lyrics narrated by a subjugate lover. Music critic Greg Kot cites [...] "Turn On the Water" [...] {{as an example}} of when [...] "the twisted narrator is the victim" [...] and [...] "cast adrift" [...] in Dulli's lyrics. Inspired by a {{paranoid}} breakup, [...] "Conjure Me" [...] is told from the perspective of an aggressive predator and obscure object of desire. On [...] "Kiss the Floor", the narrator recounts stealing a girl's virginity and avoiding her brothers. [...] "This Is My Confession" [...] has a theme of absolution. The lyrics depicts it as an empty sexual experience: [...] "Shove my head against the door, crawl inside and kiss the floor / Waiting for the sun again, drink it, smoke it, stick it in." [...] "The Temple" [...] is a cover of the song of the same name from the 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. Dulli became a fan of the rock opera as a child when his babysitter played it. [...] "Let Me Lie to You" [...] has lyrics expressing passive cruelty and subtle manipulation. [...] "Tonight" [...] depicts a peaceful night as the backdrop for the narrator's corrupt one-track mind: [...] "Follow me down to the bushes, dear / No one will know, we'll disappear / I'll <b>hold</b> <b>your</b> <b>hand,</b> we'll never tell / Our private little trip to hell". The album's hidden track [...] "Miles Iz Ded" [...] is about seduction and alcohol, with a last call sensibility and despairing tone.|$|E
2500|$|I Wanna <b>Hold</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hand</b> (1978), {{starring}} Nancy Allen, and [...] Used Cars (1980), starring Kurt Russell, were well-received critically {{but were}} commercial failures. I Wanna <b>Hold</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hand</b> {{was the first}} of several Zemeckis films to incorporate historical figures and celebrities into his movies. In the film, he used archival footage and doubles to simulate the presence of The Beatles. After the failure of his first two films, and the Spielberg-directed bomb 1941 in 1979 (for which Zemeckis and Gale had written the screenplay), the pair gained a reputation for writing [...] "scripts that everyone thought were great [...] somehow didn't translate into movies people wanted to see." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album—which {{included}} the macabre [...] "I <b>Hold</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hand</b> in Mine", the mildly risqué [...] "Be Prepared", and [...] "Lobachevsky" [...] (regarding plagiarizing mathematicians)—became a cult success via word of mouth, despite being self-published and without promotion. Lehrer {{embarked on a}} series of concert tours and in 1959 recorded a second album, which was released in two versions: the songs were the same, but More of Tom Lehrer was studio-recorded while An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer was recorded live in concert. [...] In 2013, Lehrer recalled the studio session for [...] "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park," [...] which referred to the practice of controlling pigeons in Boston with strychnine-treated corn: ...|$|E

2500|$|Newman {{was married}} twice. [...] His first {{marriage}} was to Jackie Witte from 1949 to 1958. They had a son, Scott (19501978), and two daughters, Stephanie Kendall (born 1951) and Susan (born 1953). Scott, {{who appeared in}} films including Breakheart Pass, The Towering Inferno, and the 1977 film Fraternity Row, died in November 1978 from a drug overdose. Newman started the Scott Newman Center for drug abuse prevention in memory of his son. Susan is a documentary filmmaker and philanthropist, and has Broadway and screen credits, including a starring role as one of four Beatles fans in I Wanna <b>Hold</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hand</b> (1978), and also a small role opposite her father in Slap Shot. She also received an Emmy nomination as co-producer of his telefilm, The Shadow Box.|$|E
2500|$|Little Pattie's debut single was {{the double}} A-sided, [...] "He's My Blonde Headed, Stompie Wompie, Real Gone Surfer Boy" [...] / [...] "Stompin' at Maroubra", both co-written by Jay Justin and record {{producer}} Joe Halford, which utilised the surf music style and 'The Stomp' dance craze. It {{was released by}} EMI on HMV in November 1963 when she was aged 14, and reached #2 on the Sydney music charts (#1 was The Beatles' I Want to <b>Hold</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hand),</b> #6 in Brisbane, and peaked at #19 on the national Kent Music Report. Little Pattie left school in early 1964, and released her debut album, The Many Moods of Little Pattie on EMI / HMV. She had further hits on the Sydney charts with [...] "We're Gonna Have a Party Tonight" [...] (#18 in March), [...] "Pushin' a Good Thing Too Far" [...] (#28 in March 1965) and [...] "Dance Puppet Dance" [...] (#9 in October). Her popularity saw her voted as Australian Female Singer of the Year in 1965. She appeared frequently on television variety programs, including Bandstand, Saturday Date, An Evening With, and Sing, Sing, Sing. Little Pattie regularly toured supporting Col Joye & the Joy Boys, with Judy Stone, Cathy Wayne and international star Sandie Shaw. The Joy Boys included, Joye's brothers, Kevin Jacobsen on piano and Keith Jacobsen on bass guitar.|$|E
