5000|$|Director Jonathan Paz {{grew up on}} Kibbutz Mizra in {{northern}} Israel, {{where he was a}} member until 1971. In a 2009 interview, Paz stated: “The idea for the film came to me some seven years ago, in the final year of my dear mother's life. On one of my visits to the kibbutz (which, incidentally, treated her and her contemporaries in a wonderful way, as do, {{to the best of my}} knowledge, all of the other kibbutzim), we spoke of Globalization, insensitive Capitalism and the poor state of the kibbutzim. Many of the kibbutzim had begun the process of Privatization (no more Communal Living or ‘Each contributes according to his abilities and receives according to his needs’… no more equality and cooperation, only ‘Differential Wages’ etc.). I spoke to my mother about loneliness and the fact that life passes so quickly (even though my mother lived to the ripe old-age of 97, alert and lucid to the end). I asked her, ‘Mother, which period of your life <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>miss</b> the most?’ She answered without any hesitation, 'I would like to go back to the time when we founded the kibbutz.’ I knew right then that I had a story! There was a film to be made!” ...|$|E

[...] On {{the other side of the}} coin, Bert Gangl of Jesus Freak Hideout found that [...] "while there's absolutely nothing wrong with the pop idiom, in and of itself, or even trading in one's punk roots for a kinder, gentler sound, much of what appears on the new record, pleasant though it is, fails to make much of a lasting impression." [...] New Release Tuesday's Jonathan Francesco asked a question about the album [...] "is it any good?", which he wrote that [...] "the short answer is: definitely." [...] At Worship Leader, Mike Pueschell told that the album has a [...] "subtly updated sound" [...] that should be [...] "likely palatable and welcome change for Hawk Nelson’s maturing fan base".|$|E
