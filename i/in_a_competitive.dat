50|$|Supply {{and demand}} is an {{economic}} model of price determination <b>in</b> <b>a</b> perfectly <b>competitive</b> market. It concludes that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> perfectly <b>competitive</b> market with no externalities, per unit taxes, or price controls, the unit price for a particular good is the price at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. This price results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stable economic equilibrium.|$|R

The return match saw Leigh Griffiths score two late free-kicks to give Scotland a 21 lead, but Harry Kane scored in added time to force a 22 draw. A draw in Slovenia in the final game of the group ended Scottish hopes of a play-off position, and Strachan subsequently left his position by mutual consent.|$|E

During a match against Catania on 1 December, Balotelli accused opponent Nicolás Spolli of racially abusing him, but there was insufficient evidence for any action to be taken.

5|$|As {{an iconic}} skill, bicycle kicks are an {{important}} part of association football culture. Executing a bicycle kick <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>competitive</b> football match, particularly in scoring a goal, usually garners wide attention in the sports media. The bicycle kick has been featured in works of art, such as sculptures, films, advertisements, and literature. The manoeuvre is also used in other similar ball sports, particularly in the variants of association football like futsal and beach soccer. The controversy over the move's invention and name in Brazil, Chile, and Peru (and its status as an element of the notable Chile–Peru football rivalry) has added to the kick's acclaim in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Burnley's first match {{outside the}} league in the 1920–21 season was a {{friendly}} on 22September 1920 against a Blackburn Rovers XI to mark the opening of Accrington Stanley's new stadium at Peel Park. Burnley won the game 10–1 with seven goals from Joe Anderson in addition to strikes from James Lindsay, Walter Weaver and Thomas Jackson. Burnley's opening game in the FA Cup was an away tie at Leicester City on 8 January 1921. Bob Kelly scored for the fourth game in succession and Joe Anderson scored four goals as Burnley won the match 7–3, {{the first time the}} team had scored seven goals <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>competitive</b> match away from home. After the match, the Athletic News described Burnley as {{the best team in the}} country.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's biggest winning {{scoreline}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>competitive</b> {{match is}} 13–0, achieved against Jeunesse Hautcharage in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971. The club's biggest top-flight win was an 8–0 victory against Wigan Athletic in 2010, which was matched in 2012 against Aston Villa. Chelsea's biggest loss was an 8–1 reverse against Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1953. Officially, Chelsea's highest home attendance is 82,905 for a First Division match against Arsenal on 12 October 1935. However, an estimated crowd of over 100,000 attended a friendly match against Soviet team Dynamo Moscow on 13 November 1945. The modernisation of Stamford Bridge during the 1990s {{and the introduction}} of all-seater stands mean that neither record will be broken for the foreseeable future. The current legal capacity of Stamford Bridge is 41,663. Every starting player in Chelsea's 57 games of the 2013–14 season was a full international – a new club record.|$|E

On 9 June 2017, Andorra beat Hungary 1–0 in a World Cup home qualifier, their first victory <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>competitive</b> match since 2004. Thanks to these two wins and a draw against the Faroe Islands on 6 July 2017, Andorra progressed 57 positions in the FIFA rankings to 129th, its second best position ever.|$|E
5|$|Meredith Grey, M.D. is {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{from the medical}} drama television series Grey's Anatomy, which airs on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series' producer Shonda Rhimes, and is portrayed by actress Ellen Pompeo. Meredith is the series' protagonist, and was introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital (later Seattle Grace-Mercy West, and afterwards Grey Sloan Memorial), eventually obtaining {{the position of a}} resident, and later the position of an attending, and in 2015, attaining the Chief of General Surgery position. As the daughter of world-renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, Meredith struggles with the everyday life of being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>competitive</b> profession, maintaining the relationship with her one-night stand and eventual husband Derek Shepherd (deceased), her motherhood, and her friendships with her colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Weak {{attacks from}} uke {{allow for a}} {{conditioned}} response from tori, and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners. To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, {{in keeping with the}} core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>competitive</b> format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that {{there is no need to}} adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.|$|E
40|$|Both {{politicians}} and {{parties in the}} labour market have in recent years {{stressed the importance of}} work-related training. Globalization, an increased international competition, is often said to be one important factor determining the need for more work-related training. The relationship between increased international competition and more training has almost become a stylized fact. However, we argue that this relationship is not empirically well enough founded. Therefore, in this note we test this relationship by answering the following question: Is it true that firms operating <b>in</b> <b>an</b> international <b>competitive</b> arena invest more in training for their workers compared to firms not operating <b>in</b> <b>an</b> international <b>competitive</b> arena? Evidence from representative firm-level data suggests that the answer is yes. Manufacturing firms operating <b>in</b> <b>an</b> international <b>competitive</b> arena do invest more in training for their workers compared to firms not operating <b>in</b> <b>an</b> international <b>competitive</b> arena. <b>A</b> natural interpretation of this result is that these firms respond to demands from fierce international competition by skilling their workforce through training at work. ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} studies, {{we discussed the}} spatial equilibrium model applied <b>in</b> <b>a</b> perfectly <b>competitive</b> market. However, in some cases, the market may be explained <b>in</b> <b>an</b> imperfect competition model. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> perfectly <b>competitive</b> market, the price difference between any two demand market is {{less than or equal}} to the transportation cost among those markets. But such a situation may not occur <b>in</b> <b>an</b> imperfectly <b>competitive</b> market, that is, the price difference between any two demand markets may be larger than the transportation cost. Then, <b>in</b> such <b>a</b> case, the transfer of the product would take place among those two markets. In this study, we would like to discuss the problem of introducing transfer into the spatial equilibrium model and apply it to the Japanese milk industry...|$|R
