25|$|The {{final result}} (49.8% Union vs 49.7% <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms)</b> was about 3% {{different}} from almost all polls (including all the exit polls) reducing the expected 5% {{gap between the}} coalition to a difference of about 0.1%. On Italian TV some tried to explain this discrepancy claiming that some <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms</b> voters were ashamed {{to admit that they}} planned to vote for them. Others claimed that the last week of electoral campaign, dominated by Berlusconi's proposal of cutting ICI and by the media's insistence on the alleged new taxes advocated by The Union, persuaded a large number of Italians, usually uninterested to politics, to cast a vote for the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms.</b>|$|E
25|$|Preliminary {{results showed}} The Union leading the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms</b> in the Chamber of Deputies, with 340 seats to 277, thanks to obtaining a {{majority}} bonus (actual votes were distributed 49.81% to 49.74%). One more seat is allied with The Union (Aosta Valley) and 7 more {{seats in the}} foreign constituency. The <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms</b> had secured a slight majority of Senate seats elected within Italy (155 seats to 154), but The Union won 4 of the 6 seats allocated to voters outside Italy, giving them control of both chambers.|$|E
25|$|Operating {{under a new}} {{electoral law}} written {{unilaterally}} by the governing parties with strong criticism from the parliamentary opposition, the April 2006 general election was held. The results of this election handed Romano Prodi's centre-left coalition, known as The Union, (Berlusconi's opposition) a very thin majority: 49.8% against 49.7% for the centre-right coalition <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms</b> in the Lower House, and a two-senator lead in the Senate (158 senators for The Union and 156 for the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms).</b> The Court of Cassation subsequently validated the voting procedures and determined that the election process was constitutional.|$|E

50|$|However, {{when the}} Union {{proposed}} Giorgio Napolitano, a senator for life {{that in recent}} years had not had a prominent role in politics, the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedom</b> objected that the Union should have presented a list of names. In the end, the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedom</b> chose to cast a blank vote. Some right-wing newspapers protested the communist background of the new president.|$|R
50|$|In 2001 Frattini was a {{candidate}} for the Chamber of Deputies in the constituency of Bolzano, supported by <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedom.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{party was}} part of all three <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms</b> {{coalition}} governments led by Silvio Berlusconi. Gianfranco Fini was notably nominated Deputy Prime Minister after the 2001 general election and was Foreign Minister from November 2004 to May 2006.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, the new {{electoral law}} allowed Mr Prodi {{to count on}} a large {{majority}} in the Chamber and to obtain majority also in the Senate, where The <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms</b> actually had more votes (49.88% vs. 49.18% for The Union).|$|E
25|$|The 2006 Italian general {{election}} {{for the two}} Chambers of the Italian Parliament was held on 9 and 10 April 2006. Romano Prodi, leader of the centre-left coalition The Union, narrowly defeated the incumbent Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the centre-right coalition <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{criticism}} focused on how the president was to be elected. Surprisingly, given the enormous heat and animosity shown in the preceding general elections, the two coalition leaders organized a meeting {{to try to come}} up with a candidate that was acceptable to both. The attempts failed quickly, with the Union arguing that the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedom</b> was not interested in any candidate, and the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedom</b> arguing that the Union was not proposing any that were acceptable.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Tajani was a {{candidate}} for mayor of Rome for the coalition <b>of</b> the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedom,</b> but was defeated by Walter Veltroni after polling 47.8% of votes.|$|R

25|$|However, when The Union {{proposed}} Giorgio Napolitano, the House of Freedom objected {{that the}} Union should have presented {{a list of}} names. Even though Napolitano appeared at first a candidate that the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms</b> could converge on, the proposal was rejected much like that of D'Alema.|$|E
25|$|The party {{took part}} to the 2006 general {{election}} with a new logo, characterised by {{the inclusion of the}} name of Casini, who also headed party electoral lists in most constituencies. Despite the defeat of the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms,</b> the UDC improved its electoral performance by gaining 6.8% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|The centre-left {{majority}} coalition, on 7 May 2006, officially endorsed Napolitano as its {{candidate in}} the presidential election that began on 8 May. The Vatican endorsed him as President through its official newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, just after The Union named him as its candidate, as did Marco Follini, former secretary of the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, a member party of the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms.</b>|$|E

In the end, Cuffaro won the election, despite a heavy loss of support compared with five years before, {{when he was elected}} with 59.1% of votes.|$|E
25|$|After a long discussion, the centre-left {{coalition}} {{released its}} official platform on 10 February 2006, and {{presented it to}} the public the next day. However, the Rose in the Fist refused to sign it in, because it did not explicitly include some issues, such as civil unions and LGBT rights. The platform has been criticised by the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms</b> because of its 281-page length.|$|E
25|$|The May 2001 election, {{where both}} coalitions used decoy lists to {{undermine}} the proportional-compensation part of the electoral system, ushered a refashioned center-right coalition, <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms</b> dominated by Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia (29.2%) and including Alleanza Nazionale (12.5%), the Lega Nord, the Christian Democratic Center and the United Christian Democrats. The Olive Tree coalition (The Daisy (14.5%) and the Democrats of the Left (16.7%)) sat in the opposition.|$|E

Before leaving the UDC in February 2008 in order to join the PdL, Giovanardi and Barbieri organised their faction as Liberal Populars.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the opinion}} polls released, mainly {{commissioned}} for national newspapers, magazines and TV stations, The Union was clearly leading {{the race to}} the general election. The three surveys which show a majority of votes for the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms</b> were all commissioned by Berlusconi's party Forza Italia. Notably, the surveys of Penn, Schoen & Berland, a U.S. research firm, were commissioned by Berlusconi because he claimed the national surveys to be politically biased.|$|E
25|$|In {{occasion}} of the 2006 general election, AN ran within the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms,</b> with new allies. The centre-right lost by 24,000 votes in favour of the centre-left coalition The Union. Individually AN received nearly 5 million votes, amounting to 12.3%. In July 2007 a group of splinters led by Francesco Storace formed The Right, which was officially founded on 10 November. Seven MPs of AN, including Teodoro Buontempo and Daniela Santanchè, joined the new party.|$|E
50|$|From 2001 to 2003 Della Vedova was {{president}} of the Italian Radicals.

In 2005 he launched the Liberal Reformers (with Marco Taradash and Peppino Calderisi), after the Radicals had decided to support Romano Prodi and his centre-left coalition The Union.|$|R

On 15 October 2005 Follini suddenly resigned from his position as party secretary and was replaced on 27 October by Lorenzo Cesa, an ally of Casini.|$|E
25|$|The general {{election}} in April 2006 saw a {{victory of the}} centre-left candidate Romano Prodi against the incumbent conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. After the election, the Presidents of both houses of parliament were chosen by the winning centre-left coalition, and so the centre-right <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms</b> demanded an impartial candidate {{for the role of}} President of the Republic. The Union stressed the fact that the Italian Constitution demands that the President be a defender of the constitution, hinting that such a quality was scarce among the opposition members.|$|E
25|$|The <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Freedoms</b> {{did not do}} {{as well in the}} 2003 local {{elections}} {{as it did in the}} 2001 national elections. In common with many other European governing groups, in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament, gaining 43.37% support. Forza Italia's support was also reduced from 29.5% to 21.0% (in the 1999 European elections Forza Italia had 25.2%). As an outcome of these results the other coalition parties, whose electoral results were more satisfactory, asked Berlusconi and Forza Italia for greater influence in the government's political line.|$|E
5000|$|A staunch Catholic, and in {{the past}} a rather {{conservative}} and anti-communist politician, Scalfaro nevertheless distrusted many members of the DC who changed support to Forza Italia, and was consistently on bad terms with Silvio Berlusconi.

Despite his age, he also actively campaigned, for the [...] "No" [...] side, in the June 2006 referendum on a constitutional reform.
