50|$|Common {{antistatic}} {{agents are}} based on long-chain aliphatic amines (optionally <b>ethoxylated)</b> and amides, quaternary ammonium salts (e.g., behentrimonium chloride or cocamidopropyl betaine), esters of phosphoric acid, polyethylene glycol esters, or polyols. Traditional migrating antistatic agents include long-chain alkyl phenols, <b>ethoxylated</b> amines, and glycerol esters, such as glycerol monostearate. Migrating antistatic agents offer cost-effective protection for short-term applications, but other applications need longer-term protection or the lower resistivity required to prevent sparks and protect electronics from electrostatic dissipation. These applications utilize permanent antistatic agents or conductive additives such as carbon black, conductive fibers, and nanomaterials. An antistatic agent for the treatment for coatings may also involve an ionic liquid or a solution of a salt in an ionic liquid. Indium tin oxide {{can be used as}} transparent antistatic coating of windows. It is also possible to use conductive polymers, like PEDOT:PSS and conducting polymer nanofibers, particularly polyaniline nanofibers. In general these systems are not very durable for coating, especially antimony tin oxide is used for durable systems, often in its nano form, it is then formulated to a final coating.|$|E

These are then converted to fatty amines via the nitrile process before being <b>ethoxylated</b> with ethylene oxide; this makes them water soluble and amphiphilic. The length of the fatty tail and degree of exothylation will determine the overall properties of the surfactant. Due to it being synthesized from an impure material POEA is itself a mixture compounds.|$|E
50|$|Ethoxylation is {{sometimes}} combined with propoxylation, the analogous reaction using propylene oxide as the monomer. Both reactions are normally {{performed in the}} same reactor and may be run simultaneously to give a random polymer, or in alternation to obtain block copolymers. Propylene oxide is more hydrophobic than ethylene oxide and its inclusion at low levels can significantly affect {{the properties of the}} surfactant.

Cationic softeners are incompatible with anionic surfactants in detergents because they combine with them to form a solid precipitate. This requires that they be added in the rinse cycle. Anionic softeners can combine with anionic surfactants directly. Other anionic softeners can be based on smectite clays. Some compounds, such as <b>ethoxylated</b> phosphate esters, have softening, anti-static, and surfactant properties.|$|E

Other cationic compounds can be derived from imidazolium, guanidinium, substituted amine salts, or quaternary alkoxy ammonium salts.|$|E

Minor components are the polyethyelene glycol esters of ricinoleic acid, polyethyelene glycols and polyethyelene glycol ethers of glycerol.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of many herbicides {{can be increased}} by adding adjuvants to the spray solution. Surfactants are able to increase foliar uptake of active ingredients for example, by enhancing retention of spray droplets on cuticles and penetration and absorption into leaf tissue. In this study, dose-response studies with <b>ethoxylated</b> seed oils (soybean, linseed, safflower and high oleic sunflower oil), {{in combination with the}} herbicides sulfosulfuron, carfentrazone-ethyl and foramsulfuron & iodosulfuron were conducted. Commercial adjuvants (polyethylated fatty alcohol, polyether siloxane and rapeseed oil methyl-ester) served as standards. The experiments were carried out under greenhouse conditions, using Abutilon theophrasti Medik. as test species. Dry weight of A. theophrasti was measured three weeks after treatment and dose-response curves were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. Results showed that two of three herbicides did not control A. theophrasti sufficiently when they were applied without any adjuvant. The <b>ethoxylated</b> linseed oil decreased the ED 90 of sulfosulfuron and foramsulfuron & iodosulfuron by 245 - and 44 -fold, respectively, whereas the ED 90 of carfentrazone-ethyl was reduced 2 -fold by the <b>ethoxylated</b> safflower oil. Furthermore, none of the herbicides developed its best efficiency in combination with the respective recommended commercial adjuvant.
