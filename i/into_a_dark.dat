Ammon is initially unwilling to help the player character, but after inadvertently slaying his descendant Shandra, he repents and joins the party.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers fondly {{recalled}} serendipitous in-game encounters as {{they learned}} the game environment's unwritten rules. Not knowing how foreign figures would react, Rock, Paper, Shotgun reviewer treated new encounters as puzzles. This experimentation led to moments of fearful scrambling across {{a room to}} avoid a new, encroaching enemy type, and discovering that other enemies that are harmless if left alone. Rain World was abundant with opportunities for a player to demonstrate ingenuity and improvisation, according to GameSpot reviewer, whose highlights included making a mouse <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> room's lantern, using weapons as climbable objects, and luring enemies into battle to distract from the Slugcat's presence. Those critics considered these mysterious, perceptive interactions {{to be among the}} game's best features, though far outweighed by Rain World punishing game mechanics.|$|E

Elgo explains to the party that he wished to use the crystals to achieve immortality, and predicted that the crystals, sensing his purpose, would split the world hoping to halt his plans.
