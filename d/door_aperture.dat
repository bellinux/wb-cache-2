50|$|The {{architecture}} of the house, a severe neoclassical style, which in many ways resembles the architecture made popular in the early 19th century by Sir John Soane, under whom Arlington's architect Thomas Lee trained. Often mistakenly likened to the slightly more flamboyant Greek Revival architecture, the style confines most ornament to {{the interior of the}} house, leaving the symmetrical exterior almost unadorned and chaste, relying only on window and <b>door</b> <b>apertures</b> and shallow recesses and apses and the occasional pilaster to relieve the austerity of the facade; at Arlington, this is seen in the shallow twin pilasters terminating the two principal façades, the lack of either aprons or pediments to the windows and, in place of the near conventional classical entrance portico of the era, is a single-story, semi-circular pillared porch. The simplicity of the design is further accentuated by a low, unpierced parapet concealing the roof-line from view; thus giving the building a low, box-like appearance.|$|R

5000|$|Closely {{associated}} with the Weather Pylon are small flying golden bipyramidal objects the Marshalls dubbed Skylons. When the matrix table in the Pylon has been tampered with in a destructive way, Skylons will arrive and hover over the Pylon, while flashing a sequence of colours corresponding to the sequence of light crystals required to restore the table (usually the reverse {{order in which they}} were originally touched). Skylons also appear to respond to signaling with reflected sunlight. The Skylons are apparently only able to cope with problems resulting directly from mis-set crystal matrix tables. The Skylons are unable to handle problems resulting from outside forces such as the Zarn's gravity drive, though they do indicate Zarn as the source of the problem. This may suggest that they are relatively simple automatons and not particularly intelligent. Rick suggests that they are [...] "living machines" [...] and possibly sentient.

40|$|Expressions are {{provided}} for calculating the torsional stiffness {{of a car}} body passenger compartment. The two main reaction systems which contribute towards the torsional stiffness, i. e. the couple due to shear forces in the roof and floor and the rectangular frame formed by the sill torque boxes and the end bulkheads of the passenger compartment, are considered separately. This enables the behaviour to be studied qualitatively as well as quantitatively. It is shown theoretically and diagrammatically that the first system {{is dependent on the}} bend stiffness of the members forming the <b>door</b> <b>apertures.</b> Simplifying assumptions permit the expressions developed to be sufficiently straightforward for them to be acceptable for repeated use in the design office to optimize the distribution of material. Alternative approaches are suggested for cases where greater accuracy is necessary. The basic expressions relate to a simplified structure but a technique is supplied for assessing the contribution of extra members. The effect of the horizontal offset of the wheel centres from the ends of the passenger compartment is dis-cussed and the influence of suspension and structure geometries on the effective offset is mentioned. Ways in which the deflections of the passenger compartment affect the front and rear end structures are discussed qualitatively...|$|R

60|$|Window {{apertures}} {{are mainly}} of two kinds; those for outlook, and those for inlet of light, many being for both purposes, and either purpose, or both, combined in military architecture {{with those of}} offence and defence. But all window apertures, as compared with <b>door</b> <b>apertures,</b> have almost infinite licence of form and size: they may be of any shape, from the slit or cross slit to the circle;[56] of any size, from the loophole of the castle to the pillars of light of the cathedral apse. Yet, according to their place and purpose, one or two laws of fitness hold respecting them, which let us examine in the two classes of windows successively, but without reference to military architecture, which here, as before, we may dismiss as a subject of separate science, only noticing that windows, like all other features, are always delightful, if not beautiful, when their position and shape have indeed been thus necessarily determined, and that many of their most picturesque forms have resulted from the requirements of war. We should also find in military architecture the typical forms of the two classes of outlet and inlet windows in their utmost development; the greatest sweep of sight and range of shot on the one hand, and the fullest entry of light and air on the other, being constantly required at the smallest possible apertures. Our business, however, is to reason out the laws for ourselves, {{not to take the}} examples as we find them.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} {{experiment}} was to study regulation of human locomotion under externally paced temporal constraints. On a screen {{placed in front of}} a treadmill a virtual hallway was projected (Silicon Graphics systems) in which a pair of doors were presented that continuously opened and closed at a rate of 1 Hz. Subjects were attached to a locometer and instructed to regulate walking pace such that the doors were passed correctly. Performance outcome, movement kinematics (stride duration, stride length and synchronization of stride and door cycles) and flow patterns (change in visual angle of <b>door</b> <b>aperture)</b> were used to examine the data. The analysis of the synchronization patterns indicates that stride cycles were not linked to the period of door oscillation. Moreover, results for stride duration reveal that subjects walked at their preferred speed up to the final phase of the approach. This observation is supported by the inspection of the flow patterns, revealing a final increase in variability as a result of regulation. In sum, regulation of locomotion under externally paced temporal constraints seems to generate a specific functional behavior. It appears that regulations are postponed until the final stage of the approach during which adaptations are made according to the requirements of the current situation.

40|$|Background: Individuals acquire {{information}} about self-motion {{from the environment}} which specifies actions necessary to be successful (Fajen 2 ̆ 6 Matthis, 2011). However, concussed individuals demonstrate residual disturbance in execution of postural movement at 30 days post injury, depicting an impaired ability to perceive self-motion in a visually conflicting environment (Slobounov et al. 2006). The objective of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} extent to which one’s behaviours on a central field of view task are influenced by the amount and type of peripheral visual movement during a collision avoidance task, as well as to determine the additive effects of changes to balance control through the examination of the behaviours of a previously concussed population. The study utilized the closing doors of a virtual subway train to create an aperture for passage. For the purposes of this study, peripheral visual stimuli was a technique in which objects located within an individual’s peripheral field of view were manipulated to be absent, stationary/relatively stationary (veridical optic flow), or move independent of the participant’s movements (non-veridical optic flow). It was hypothesized that individuals would perform best when the environment provided visual information regarding one’s own self motion. It was expected that a critical point (i. e., when the limits of action are reached and a transition phase into a different action occurs (Warren 2 ̆ 6 Whang, 1987)) would emerge, which would be impacted by the different levels of peripheral visual environment, eliciting a change in critical point. Furthermore, it was anticipated that previously concussed asymptomatic individuals would elicit more variable behaviours (i. e., inconsistent path selection when aperture width remains constant) compared to non-concussed counterparts (Baker 2 ̆ 6 Cinelli, 2014), as a product of the peripheral visual environment. Methods: Previously concussed (3 - 12 months prior) asymptomatic young adults (N= 12) were recruited, along with age and gender matched non-concussed controls (N= 12). Participants walked along a 7 m virtual path (via HTC Vive) towards a set of subway doors and were instructed to safely board the train without colliding with the doors. When the participants were 2 m from the doors, they began to close at a constant rate such that the final <b>door</b> <b>aperture</b> width at the time of crossing ranged from 35 - 85 cm (in 10 cm increments). Participants performed aperture crossing trials during one of four peripheral environments: 1) ground plane only; 2) ground plane plus stationary poles in the peripheral environment; 3) ground plane with stationary humanoids in the peripheral environment; or 4) randomly moving humanoids. Participants were exposed to three trials of each aperture width within each environment for a total of 72 walking trials (6 widths x 4 conditions x 3 trials). Kinematic data was collected using a 3 D motion capture system (Optotrak, NDI). Results: The results revealed that participants executed significant shoulder rotations regardless of aperture width at time of crossing. It was found that non-concussed control subjects executed slightly larger shoulder rotations for smaller apertures (i. e., 35, 45, and 55 cm) compared to the largest aperture (p. 05), coefficient of variation of velocity (p 3 ̆e. 05), or medial-lateral stability during the approach phase (p 3 ̆e. 05). Conclusion: The findings {{of this study suggest that}} although a significant difference was found between aperture sizes for non-concussed controls, all individuals were found to employ a more conservative approach (i. e., “one solution fits all” strategy) to ensure success within each of the peripheral visual environments. As such, further research is required to assess the contributions of peripheral body information during an aperture crossing task and further the understanding of the behaviours demonstrated by each group. In addition, a more comprehensive sample of previously concussed asymptomatic individuals from various time points since concussion recovery will provide further insight into potential visuomotor deficits within this population...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} role of {{architecture}} in influencing the social position of slaves in the Pompeian household. While slaves were omnipresent in the elite household, research regarding their lives has been lagging behind. Besides architectural evidence from Pompeii, the thesis looks into textual, legal, and iconographic sources. Slaves in the Roman Empire did not possess any legal rights. However, they are often mentioned in legal documents concerned with ownership disputes. Lacking any legal protection, {{the life of a}} slave was dependent on his master, often making slaves a target for emotional and physical abuse. The slave could only endure such outbursts and continue working hard, for the only way to gain freedom was if the master granted him manumission. This is illustrated by the story of Lucius in Apuleius’ metamorphoses, a satirical comment on the lives of slaves. The well-off Lucius was transformed into a donkey. As a mule he is beaten and abused, worked half to death, humiliated and sold multiple times. Apuleius created a story which strikes a close resemblance to the life of a slave. Apart from literary sources, Pompeian art also shows how deeply the low status of slaves was embedded in Roman society, where slaves were represented as small and insignificant. Regarding {{the role of}} architecture, five different-sized Pompeian houses are examined, comparing floor-plans to identify characteristics common to these houses, and searching for places where slaves might have enjoyed privacy. The focus of this research points to the servile quarters such as the kitchen and the triclinium, allowing us to examine the role of architecture on the movement trajectories of slaves. All five houses have different sized doorways within the house, directing guests to big open doors, while slave staff had to use small and narrow doorways. The difference in the size of <b>door</b> <b>apertures</b> emphasises the social distinction within the house. The architecture of Roman houses aims to create sightlines to optimize visual effects. The triclinium (dining room) was {{an important part of the}} house and usually had the best view into the garden. To maintain this visual effect slaves had to avoid crossing this line of sight. The architecture thus contributed in controlling the movement of slaves...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{satellite}} and receiver technology make former denied areas like indoors accessible for satellite based radio services. As a consequence, suitable penetration loss models are of significant importance for service availability planning. Standard penetration loss models ignore the building layout {{in relation to}} the transmitter-receiver geometry. Within this paper, we introduce the term entry loss as a measure for the additional loss of a wideband impulse received at the geometrical line-of- sight path delay caused by the building materials. Knowing the received power caused by indoor multipath propagation, the penetration loss and the entry loss are deterministically related. As a contribution, we propose an entry loss model which is able to include the geometrical relation of walls, receiver and transmitter positions. Within the model, we treat walls, windows and <b>doors</b> as <b>apertures</b> and, therefore, as sources for signal penetration and diffraction. A verification of the model using wideband channel sounder measurement data is performed. By simulations, we show the comparability between existing models and the proposed one.

40|$|Airborne {{infrared}} astronomy {{has a long}} successful history, albeit {{relatively unknown}} outside of the astronomy community. A major problem with ground based infrared astronomy is the absorption and scatter of infrared energy by water in the atmosphere. Observing the universe from above 40, 000 ft puts the observation platform above 99 % of the water vapor in the atmosphere, thereby addressing this problem {{at a fraction of}} the cost of space based systems. The Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) aircraft is the most ambitious foray into the field of airborne infrared astronomy in history. Using a 747 SP (The Boeing Company, Chicago, Illinois) aircraft modified with a 2. 5 m telescope located in the aft section of the fuselage, the SOFIA endeavors to provide views of the universe never before possible and {{at a fraction of the}} cost of space based systems. The modification to the airplane includes moveable <b>doors</b> and <b>aperture</b> that expose the telescope assembly. The telescope assembly is aimed and stabilized using a multitude of on board systems. This modification has the potential to cause aerodynamic anomalies that could induce undesired forces either at the cavity itself or indirectly due to interference with the empennage, both of which could cause handling qualities issues. As a result, an extensive analysis and flight test program was conducted from December 2009 through March 2011. Several methods, including a Lower Order Equivalent Systems analysis and pilot assessment, were used to ascertain the effects of the modification. The SOFIA modification was found to cause no adverse handling qualities effects and the aircraft was cleared for operational use.

This important result is consistent with predictions from models that include flows. However, the absence of a clear center-to-limb variation in the profiles may be more indicative of an isotropic field than a mainly radial flow. Conclusions. It appears that the ubiquitous hydrogen behaves in a similar way to a filter that dampens all signatures of the line formation by processes in both the chromosphere and transition region...|$|R
60|$|Men {{of middle}} age, rather early middle age, {{remember}} the two following species of bullying {{to which they}} were subjected, and which, perhaps, are obsolescent. Tall stools were piled up in a pyramid, and the victim was seated on the top, near the roof of the room. The other savages brought him down from this bad eminence by hurling other stools at those which supported him. Or the victim was made to place his hands against the door, with the fingers outstretched, while the young tormentors played at the Chinese knife-trick. They threw knives, that is to say, at the <b>door</b> between the <b>apertures</b> of the fingers, and, as a rule, they hit the fingers and not the door. These diversions I know to be correctly reported, but the following pretty story is, perhaps, a myth. At {{one of the most famous}} public schools, a praepostor, or monitor, or sixth-form boy having authority, heard a pistol-shot in the room above his own. He went up and found a big boy and a little boy. They denied having any pistol. The monitor returned to his studies, again was sure he heard a shot, went up, and found the little boy dead. The big boy had been playing the William Tell trick with him, and had hit his head instead of the apple. That is the legend. Whether it be true or false, all boys will agree that the little victim could not have escaped by complaining to the monitor. No. Death before dishonour. But the side not so seamy of this picture of school life is the extraordinary power of honour among boys. Of course the laws of the secret society might well terrify a puerile informer. But the sentiment of honour is even more strong than fear, and will probably outlast the very disagreeable circumstances in which it was developed.|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Çadır geleneğinin Türk tarihi içindeki sürekliliği ve önemi bilinen bir olgudur. Günümüzde çadırlar artık sadece kimi göçebe topluluklar tarafından kullanılıyorsa da görsel ve yazılı kaynaklardan da bilindiği üzere Türk tarihi içinde çadırlar saray erkanı için de 20. yüzyıla kadar varlık göstermiştir. Çadırlar kimi zamanlarda savaş alanlarında İstanbul sarayının bir benzerini oluşturmak için kullanılmış, kimi zamanlarda çeşitli gösteri, kutlama ve törenlere bir arka plan oluşturmak ve padişah ve çevresine bir sahne yaratmak için kullanılmıştır. Çadırlar Türk boylarıyla birlikte Orta Asya&# 8223;dan Anadolu&# 8223;ya, oradan da Osmanlı fetihleriyle Viyana yakınlarına kadar geniş bir coğrafyada varlık göstermiştir. Bu yapılar birer sanat veya zanaat ürünü olmalarının yanında aynı zamanda birer mimari eser olarak da nitelendirilebilir. Bu noktada genel anlamda çadırların dekoratif ve mekansal bağlamlarda sabit mimariyle olan ortaklıkları olduğu düşünülmüş ve bu konu tez kapsamında irdelenmiştir. Kimi durumlar ortaklık olarak nitelendirilebilirken kimi durumlar ise sadece benzerlikleri ifade etmektedır. Ayrıca çadır ve yapı üretimlerindeki kimi eş alışkanlıklar, farklı iki ürün grubunun ortaklığı olmaktan çok birbirine eş bütünsel bir algının farklı malzeme ve tekniklerle üretilmiş son ürünleri olarak değerlendirilebilir. Ortaklıkların dekoratif ve yapısal olmak üzere iki başlık altında gruplanarak çözümlenebileceği düşünülmüştür. Çözümlemeler, bu iki başlık içinde revak, baldaken ve örtü gibi elemanlar ile dekorasyonla ilgili çeşitli alt durumlar temelinde ele alınmıştır. Ancak bunun için ilk olarak bugüne ulaşan ve Türkiye ve Avrupa&# 8223;daki çeşitli müze ve kurumlarda korunmakta olan çadırlardan bir seçkiye karar verilmiş ve seçki içindeki çadırlar mekansal ve dekoratif özellikleriyle detaylıca betimlenmiştir. Böylelikle çadırlar bütünsel olarak algılanmış ve karşılaştırmalara olanak verecek şekilde çözümlenmiştir. Yapılan tahliller neticesinde benzerlik ve ortaklıkların hangi alt durumlar hususunda izlenebileceğine karar verilmiştir. Alt başlıklar yansıttıkları durumlara göre sınıflandırılarak daha önce de belirtildiği üzere yapısal ve dekoratif olmak üzere iki ana başlık altında ifade bulmuştur. Karşılaştırmalar üzerinden yapılan değerlendirmelerde temel olarak çadırlar ve günümüze ulaşan yapılar ele alındıysa da Osmanlı görsel kaynakları da göz önüne alınmıştır. Özellikle de mekan, kullanıcı ve yapılar arasındaki ilişkiyi sahneleyen kitap resimleri bugüne ulaşmayan çadırlar hakkında bilgi vermenin yanında sabit mimari yapılarla çadırlar arasındaki ortak kullanımları inceleme noktasında yararlı olmuştur. Çadırlardaki durumların karşılıkları özellikle Topkapı Sarayı olmak üzere İstanbul&# 8223;daki imparatorluk yapılarında aranmıştır. Daha bütünsel bir bakış için diğer sanat ve zanaat dallarından bir kısmı da gözden geçirilmiştir. El işlemeleri, çiniler, duvar resimleri ve kalem işleri bu noktada not edilebilir. Tüm bu inceleme, karşılaştırma ve değerlendirmeler sonucunda hem genel kurguda hem de ayrıntılar ölçeğinde ortaklıklar saptanmış, tüm bu durumlar görsel bütünlüğe dayalı bir yaklaşımla ifade edilmiştir. The {{importance}} and {{the continuity of}} tent making and usage in Turkish culture are very well-known phenomena. Turks transferred the tradition of “tent culture” with them from Central Asia to Asia Minor {{and as far as}} to Vienna by the Ottoman counquests. Even if the tents are only used by some nomadic tribes in Anatolia nowadays, as one can easyly find out from visual and written sources, the tents were used by the palace until {{the first decades of the}} 20 th century. The tents were used to create the palace settlement for the sultan and his retunie during the war campaigns especially until the 18 th century when there were less campaigns and the sultan did not lead the army anymore. After then, the main purpose of the imperial tents were creating a background for some ceremonies and celebrations. But through all these centuries, tents were used to create a scene for the sultan to represent his sovereignty. Because of these facts that can be followed from the sources, it is not possible to define the tents only as artifacts or artisanship products, one can identify them as architectural designs as well. In that point, some similarities are predicted in decorative and spatial aspects between the „immobile&# 8223; architecture and tent architecture. These predictions have been pursued in this study as the major topic and some common aspects of architecture and tent production have been identified. It was possible to consider the outcomes of these two different production spheres as products of a common approach of space and decoration even if they have been produced with different materials and alternative methods. The method of this study focuses on comparisons. And generally comparisons have been made between tents and existing buildings, as well as the Ottoman visual sources. Especially Topkapi Palace and some other imperial buildings are chosen for the comparisons, as tents are thougnht to be the mobile form of them. And it is shownn that these buildings releaves certain common features with the tent architecture. The Ottoman miniatures are examined not only to compare the nonextant buildings with tents but also to examine the similar functions, as miniatures shows how both tents and buildings were used at their time. The similarities have been examined under two titles as „structural&# 8223; and „decorative&# 8223;. Selected samples of the tents -which are preserved in the Turkish and European museums and the other collections- have been described considering spatial and decorative characteristics. These descriptions led to categorize the similarities as subtopics which are placed under the main titles, structural and decorative. For the structural similarities, comparisons are made under theree subtopics: arcades, canopies and <b>door</b> and window <b>apertures.</b> Arcades which are generally seen on the interior surfaces of the tents are examined as the visual representations of the built ones. Imperial mausolea are investigated firstly for this case as they present common spatial attitudes with tents directly. It has been shown that the tents can be perceived as reduced dimensioned versions. Also the imperial mosques and Turkish baths are xviii also compared with tents to show the similarities in different scales as well. But also some other Ottoman artifacts such as tiles, praying rugs etc. are examined to perceive and place the arcade usage in tent decoration. Also as the details of the arches have more lavish expressions compared to the usual arches in Ottoman architecture, some similar arch types with tents are pointed as well. And at the end of this part, some pre-Ottoman examples are noted to show the historical perspective. As a second subtopic, canopies are examined under two other subtopics. Adjacent canopies and canopies that are not attached to an other building have been grouped under different titles. Different groups are evaluated regarding their spatial and decorative aspects as well as their functions including historical backgrounds. The palace buildings or some pieces such as gondolas, thrones from the imperial collections are mutually studied in order to comprehend the canopies and tents as their mobile forms. Especially some scenes that are represented in miniatures and some buildings in the Topkapi Palace complex are detailedy examined in order to have some persuasive conclusions about the relation between the mobile and immobile architectures. Window and <b>door</b> <b>apertures</b> were the last subtopic under the main topic, sturctural. As these apertures are some of the most basic and essential building elements, searching for the resemblancres brought out some conclusive results. Studying on these building elements has especially shown how the tents and their decorations represent built architecture and their details. The apertures from the buildings and the tents have been investigated regarding to each other as their decorations present the same notion. From the most basic apertures to their representations on the tents and the built architecture itself and the details over the tiles, window grills etc. are expressed mutually to have an opinion about the big picture. Second topic is based on decorative similarities. As tents and built architectural pieces have different building / preparation techniques, the structural similarities are generally up to the visual expression. Even if it is shown that they are the products of the same notion; from the structural point of view, the tents seem to „copy&# 8223; the built architecture. Not because of the different structural systems -actually even if the systems seem to be different they have a similar approach- but because of ornamentation of tents which represents the structural elements. But decorative similarities lead to some different directions. Even if it is hard to mention about a canonic concept in Ottoman architecture, there are some details that can be relatively easyly followed. As it will be shown by the subtopics the tents and the built architecture seem to be closer from the point of decoration. General concept of decoration is discussed as the first subtopic. By the descriptions of the tents which have been made in the first part, some general approaches about the ornamentation elements are examined. By the examples especially from the Harem of Topkapi Palace, similarities are shown from different periods about the resembling concepts between tents and these buildings. Not only the motives but also the general emplacement of the ornamemtation elements are studied. Secondly, interior surface of the (roof) covering is examined as an other subtopic. As one of the most important architectural element of Ottoman architecture is dome, the importance of the domes must be remembered not only in a spatial sense but also because of the meaning of dome in architecure. Meaning of the dome and its relation with the tents is briefly explained in the part for the canopies but as this is not the topic of the study, it is just mentioned as a reminder. It is possible to categorize the xix ornamentation programmes of the tent roof coverings into two. In the first one there is the arcade image applied on the roof -in which the arcade units are adjusted to the roof geometer. And in the second type there is a circular motive in the center and semicircles or quadrants around it with some other motives. As one who has observed the Ottoman architecture can easyly perceive, the resemblance is obvious. So in this part these are explained detailedly. And as the last subtopic, pastoral depictions are studied. It is explained in different chapters as well that tent architecture has not evolved as much as built architecture. There are several reasons for this. But the main reasons are purpose of the tents and their spatial simplicity. Also because of its preparation method and simple technology, there is no possiblity to play with the space that much. Because of these whole study puts aside the evaluation of the built architeture in a way. Even if some situations about the different tent types about their function and form trough the centuries are stated and comparisons between the tents and built architecture focus on the same period between each other, generally the study does not stick to the precise dates. Also for the pastoral depictions, depictions with European style are examined. Even if there are miniatures and some European style depictions around the palace enviroment, depictions are seen after the classical era in Ottoman architecture. In this part firstly, the history of depictions in Ottoman art has been explained briefly and then comparisons between the wall paintings and the embroideries creating a pastoral image in the tent decoration are done. The tent decoration is similar with the wall paintings and architectural decoration but after all the tents are embroideries. So to place these tent depictions in Ottoman art a motive -tent- has been chosen as a case study. So tent as a motive has been followed in different Ottoman arts such as tiles and hand embroideries to have an holistic perception. Finally, in this study some general information about Turkish / Ottoman tent culture with its historical background has been given. From the earliest Ottoman imperial tents from the 17 th century -which could be preserved until today- until the latest examples which are from the early 20 th century are examined to have a consistent approach. Even if the general structure of the study is based on the similarities and mutual characteristics of the tents and Ottoman architectural pieces, some diverse features are also noted. As tents and built architecture have different evolution processes, it is possible to consider these two different „architecture&# 8223;s in their own contexts. To gain some more stringent conclusions, roots and evolution processes of both architectures must be examined mutually. After all as structural and decorative similarities support to consider immobile architecture and tent architecture as outcomes of a common notion of space creating, stands out as an appropriate approach. Consequently, both on general scale and on detail level, many common attitudes have been identified between „mobile&# 8223; and „built&# 8223; architecture. By some deeper studies some other conclusions would fine some blurry points of this study. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
