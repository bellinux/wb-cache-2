5|$|A few {{scholars}} have {{put forward a}} genealogical reconstruction making the Godwins descend from Alfred the Great's elder brother, King ÆthelredI of Wessex. The theory was <b>first</b> <b>proposed</b> by the historian Alfred Anscombe in 1913, and advocated by the genealogist Lundie W. Barlow in 1957 and the Mayanist scholar and genealogist David H. Kelley in 1989.|$|E

5|$|A tram {{network has}} long been planned in Skopje and the idea was <b>first</b> <b>proposed</b> in the 1980s. The project became real in 2006 when the mayor Trifun Kostovski asked for {{feasibility}} studies. His successor Koce Trajanovski launched a call for tenders in 2010 and the first line is scheduled for 2019.|$|E
5|$|As <b>first</b> <b>proposed</b> in 1944, {{the western}} {{terminus}} of I-70 was Denver, {{along the corridor}} of US40. The portion across the Rocky Mountains {{was added to the}} plans, after lobbying by Colorado officials, following the US6 corridor. The origins of both the US40 and US6 pre-date the U.S. System of numbered highways, using established transcontinental trails.|$|E
5|$|Believers in Planet X/Nibiru {{have given}} it many names since it was <b>first</b> <b>proposed.</b> All are, in fact, names for other real, {{hypothetical}} or imaginary Solar System objects that bear little resemblance either to the planet described by Lieder or to Nibiru as described by Sitchin.|$|E

30|$|In this section, we <b>first</b> <b>propose</b> {{a hybrid}} {{splitting}} method {{for the problem}} (1.6), and then we give some remarks on the described method.|$|R
5|$|Domains are a {{relatively}} new grouping. <b>First</b> <b>proposed</b> in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system was not generally accepted until later. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, Archaea, but do not accept the domain method.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{physician}} Pieter Pel <b>first</b> <b>proposed</b> {{a tissue}} {{stage of the}} malaria parasite in 1886, presaging its discovery by over 50 years. This suggestion was reiterated in 1893 when Golgi suggested that the parasites might have an undiscovered tissue phase (this time in endothelial cells). Pel in 1896 supported Golgi's latent phase theory.|$|E
5|$|<b>First</b> <b>proposed</b> as a LRT {{line when}} {{originally}} announced in 2001, the 20-kilometre Jurong Region Line {{has since been}} upgraded to be a medium capacity line after the project was revived in 2013. The new configuration will serve West Coast, Tengah and Choa Chu Kang and Jurong. Details will be announced once Tengah New Town development is up, and the completion will be by 2025.|$|E

5|$|<b>First</b> <b>proposed</b> in 2008 by the New York City Department of Transportation, Citi Bike's {{scheduled}} 2011 opening {{was delayed}} by Hurricane Sandy and technological problems. It officially opened in May 2013 with 332 stations and 6,000 bikes. Annual expansions {{have brought the}} totals to 706 stations and 12,000 bikes , making the service the largest bike sharing program in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, two {{prominent}} geologists, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick (who <b>first</b> <b>proposed</b> {{the name of}} the Cambrian period), independently used their studies of the geology of Wales to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian, were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area based on Murchison's and Sedgwick's work.|$|E
5|$|Much of the play's Protestant tones {{derive from}} its setting in Denmark—both {{then and now}} a {{predominantly}} Protestant country, though {{it is unclear whether}} the fictional Denmark of the play is intended to portray this implicit fact. Dialog refers explicitly to Wittenberg, where Hamlet, Horatio, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern attend university, implying where Martin Luther in 1517 <b>first</b> <b>proposed</b> his 95 theses and thereby initiated the Protestant Reformation.|$|E

5|$|St James's Church was <b>first</b> <b>proposed</b> in 1664, when {{residents}} {{wanted to}} become a separate parish from St Martin in the Fields. After several Bill readings, construction began in 1676. The building was designed by Christopher Wren and cost around £5,000. It was consecrated in 1684, when the surrounding area became St James Parish.|$|E
5|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} was <b>first</b> <b>proposed</b> by Juan Maldacena in late 1997. Important {{aspects of}} the correspondence were elaborated in articles by Steven Gubser, Igor Klebanov, and Alexander Markovich Polyakov, and by Edward Witten. By 2015, Maldacena's article had over 10,000 citations, becoming the most highly cited article {{in the field of}} high energy physics.|$|E
5|$|The President of the Commission is <b>first</b> <b>proposed</b> by the European Council {{taking into}} account the latest Parliamentary elections; that {{candidate}} can then be elected by the European Parliament or not.

30|$|We {{intend to}} derive {{analytical}} expressions for modeling throughput and delay {{characteristics of a}} MAC protocol that mimics the IEEE 802.11 e in every essential respect. We do so by <b>first</b> <b>proposing</b> a simplified model of the IEEE 802.11 e MAC.|$|R

5|$|The Super Bowl {{began as}} an inter-league {{championship}} game between the AFL and NFL, an idea <b>first</b> <b>proposed</b> by Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt. This compromise {{was the result of}} pressures the upstart AFL was placing on the older NFL. The success of the rival league would eventually lead to a full merger of the two leagues.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a fortified city on the Sciberras Peninsula was <b>first</b> <b>proposed</b> in 1524, when the Order of St. John sent a commission to inspect the Maltese Islands. Back then, the only fortification on the peninsula was a militia watchtower built by the Aragonese in 1488. The tower was strengthened in 1533, but the proposed city was not built since the Order focused on building the fortifications of Birgu, which had become their base.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} Ciomadul {{could be a}} still active volcano was <b>first</b> <b>proposed</b> in 1780 {{on the basis of}} its young {{appearance}} and the release of gas. While a publication in 1964 postulated that the tuffs of Ciomadul were reworked Pliocene volcanites, the late Pleistocene age was established soon afterwards.|$|E
40|$|We <b>first</b> <b>propose</b> the fractal {{models for}} the one-phase {{problems}} of discontinuous transient heat transfer.

30|$|We <b>first</b> <b>propose</b> {{to utilize}} a {{temporal}} autocorrelation model {{to optimize the}} slot scheduling and detail its implementation in the IEEE 802.15. 6.
