50|$|Interiors Contained {{beneath the}} main U-shaped roof are six rooms opening off a central hallway, which is {{accessed}} via the front door. This hall is divided in two by an arched opening. The semi-circular arch rests on plasterwork relief capitals. Two rooms open {{off the first}} segment of the hallway. These are currently used as bedrooms. The room to the right is extended by the bay that looks onto the north-facing verandah. This bay has two double-hung sash windows in its front face, and one on each of its angled sides. The sill height matches the low waist of the double doors. On the wall it shares with the adjoining room, this room also has an ornately carved timber mantelpiece and <b>fireplace</b> <b>lined</b> with ceramic tiles. A metal fire grate sits on the hearth, which is also lined with ceramic tiles. These walls only feature a plaster picture-rail fixed at approximately 3.5m. The room opening to the left off the central hallway has a mantelpiece and fireplace without ceramic tiles, also in its west-facing wall. The mantelpiece is decorated with simple, applied timber shapes and the hearth is edged with a low timber rail. A door opens from this bedroom {{into the next room}} along the hall.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{doors at}} either end of the bar access the rear section of the building. On the {{southern}} side of the building the door from the front bar accesses a small hallway with an entrance door to Victoria Street. The hall leads on to two parlour rooms with pressed metal ceilings and brick fireplaces to the west, and the main central staircase to the east. A newer spacious lounge area is located in a central position in the rear section of the building which has the afore mentioned lantern style roof. The upper floor is accessed by the central staircase with original timber balustrading. The ceiling over the staircase retains its decorative pressed metal. The stairs land onto a long north-south hallway which is clad with sheeting material and accesses a large doorway to the southern verandah. Three large bedrooms with original <b>fireplaces</b> <b>line</b> this hallway, all have doors to the verandahs. There are two narrow hallways running east-west on either end of the building each lined with bedrooms on either side. The southerly hallway still displays original Vertical Joint timber work and a decorative arch at its entrance. These hallways are connected by an intersecting hall along the former enclosed verandah at the rear of the building.|$|R

60|$|It was low {{and solid}} in appearance; the wooden {{framework}} was unusually massive, and there was much quaint carving on the beams. The furniture was heavy and solid, and polished with beeswax until it shone. The <b>fireplaces</b> were <b>lined</b> with Dutch tiles; the flooring was of oak, polished as brightly as the furniture. The appointments from roof to floor were Dutch; and no wonder that this was so, for every inch of wood in its framework and beams, floor and furniture, and had been brought across from Friesland by William Martin in his ship, the Good Venture. It had been the dowry he received with his pretty young wife, Sophie Plomaert.|$|R
5000|$|The Nathaniel Daggett House, one of {{the oldest}} extant {{dwellings}} in East Providence, is a rare surviving example of early colonial domestic architecture. It is particularly noteworthy because the method utilized to enlarge the original end-chimney house—the addition of a rear lean-to with end <b>fireplace</b> in <b>line</b> with the original chimney—is more similar to northern Rhode Island building practice than to the mode customarily employed in Massachusetts, where houses were expanded by adding to {{the opposite side of the}} chimney, converting the structure into a center-chimney dwelling [...] This exhibits the close tie between Providence and western Rehoboth, a tie that developed and flourished even though the two communities were located in different colonies and, later, states.|$|R

5000|$|The {{painting}} is in {{oil on canvas}} (67 cm × 55 cm). It is also {{sometimes referred to as}} A Woman Peeling Apples, with a Small Child. This painting by Hooch was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1908, who wrote; [...] "33. WOMAN PEELING APPLES. de G. 55. In the right-hand corner of a room sits a woman, facing the spectator. She wears a black velvet jacket trimmed with fur, a red skirt, and a white apron. In her lap she holds a basket of apples which she is peeling. She holds out a long rind in her right hand to a little girl standing to the left and seen in profile. A tub is on the floor at the woman's feet. To the left is a fireplace with a kettle on the fire. The <b>fireplace</b> is <b>lined</b> with Delft tiles, and is enclosed with pilasters worked in low relief. Behind the woman hangs a mirror in a black frame. The sunlight enters through a window above to the right and illumines the wall and a corner of the mirror. The floor is composed of brown and white tiles. The picture is in a very dirty condition. Its general effect is fine. It is somewhat similar in style to the Weissbach picture (4), but not so charming in subject it is Canvas, 26 inches by 21 inches. Mentioned by Waagen, Supplement, p. 87, {{in the collection of the}} Marquis of Hertford, who bought it from C. Perrier in 1848 (for ₤283 : 10s.). Described by Bürger, Gazette des Beaux Arts, 1866, vol. xxi. p. 561, as a Vermeer, No. 16. Exhibited at the Royal Academy Winter Exhibition, London, 1893, No. 55. Now in the Wallace collection, London, No. 23 in the 1901 catalogue." ...|$|R
