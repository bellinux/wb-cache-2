40|$|Within the Aspergillus genus, Aspergillus fumigatus {{species is}} one of the most {{ubiquitous}} saprophytic fungi and is considered the section of species with higher clinical relevance. This section is the most common cause of invasive aspergillosis and a major source of infection-related mortality in immunocompromised patients. One of the most abundant metabolites produced by this fungus is the metabolite gliotoxin, which exhibits a diverse array of biologic effects on the immune system. The aim of the present work was to determine the prevalence of Aspergillus section Fumigati by cultural and molecular methods in poultry; swine/bovine; and large animal (bovine and horses) slaughterhouses. Air samples were collected through an impaction method, while surface samples were collected by the swabbing method and subject to further macro and microscopic observations. In addition, we collected air samples using the impinger method in order to perform real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplification of genes from A. fumigatus complex. Aspergillus section Fumigati was present only in Stacker, Bleeding and Evisceration air collected from the Poultry Slaughterhouse (10 – 30 CFU. m 3), and in air from the <b>Gut</b> <b>Room</b> collected in the Bovine Slaughterhouse (10 CFU. m 3). Molecular tools amplified successfully DNA from the A. fumigatus complex in six sampling sites where the presence of this fungal species was not identified by conventional methods. Besides suggesting A. fumigatus complex as an indicator of harmful fungal contamination in this occupational setting, this study also indicates that conventional and molecular tools should be used as a combined strategy to ensure a proper characterization of fungal occupational exposure. Moreover, in the considered slaughterhouses, fungal contamination results pinpoint to co-exposure to other mycotoxins. In fact, occupational exposure to aflatoxin B 1 has already been detected in Poultry Slaughterhouse. Therefore, there is a need for considering possible interactions between mycotoxins and fungi and this should be taken into account in the risk assessment process. N/...|$|E

5000|$|While Campania awaited demolition, the Admiralty {{stepped in}} {{at the last minute}} and bought her with a view of {{converting}} her to an armed merchant cruiser that could carry seaplanes. The original idea was to use float-planes which would be lowered into and retrieved from the water by a crane. The conversion was carried out at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. Her interior was completely <b>gutted,</b> and <b>room</b> made inside to store up to 14 aircraft. She was also equipped with eight 4.7" [...] (120-mm) guns.|$|R
5000|$|Director Mikael Håfström {{said that}} the ending for 1408 was reshot because test audiences felt that the {{original}} ending {{was too much of}} a [...] "downer". This first alternate ending was used in the theatrical release. The original discarded ending had Mike dying in the fire, but happy to see the room destroyed. During Mike's funeral, Olin approaches Lily and Sam. He unsuccessfully attempts to give her a box of Mike's possessions, including the tape recorder. Olin claims that the room was successfully destroyed and that it will no longer hurt anyone else. He later listens to the recording in his car, and becomes visibly upset when he hears Katie's voice on the tape. He looks in the car mirror and sees a vision of Enslin's burnt corpse in the back seat, then he sees a father and daughter hold hands as they walk away. Olin places the tape recorder back in the box and drives off. The final scene is of the <b>gutted</b> <b>room,</b> where an apparition of Mike looks out the window while smoking a cigarette. He hears his daughter calling his name, and he disappears as he walks toward her. A door is heard closing and the scene fades to black.|$|R

50|$|A great furor {{accompanied}} {{the arrival of}} a Chapters bookstore at the Runnymede Theatre in the late 1990s. Aside from discontent about the effect of a large bookstore undermining older local businesses, many residents were upset that the local historic movie theatre was going to be <b>gutted</b> to make <b>room</b> for the new store. However, the arrival of Chapters allowed restoration of the historical Runnymede Theatre. At the time, Chapters was the only company willing to make the $5 million investment necessary to restore the building. The movie theatre closed in February 1999.|$|R
50|$|On 22 October 2006, a fire <b>gutted</b> {{the waiting}} <b>room,</b> {{footbridge}} and ticket office. The fire has subsequently {{been attributed to}} arson and caused around £1m of damage to the station, necessitating the demolition of the footbridge. This has not been rebuilt, necessitating a lengthy {{walk out of the}} station and along the adjacent main road to change platforms. A new single-storey ticket office has though been provided as part of a £1.7million revamp of the station, along with improved lighting, an extended car park with 140 spaces, CCTV cameras and cycle storage lockers. The new facilities were commissioned in December 2014, with an official opening attended by the Minister of State for Transport Baroness Kramer.|$|R
6000|$|By {{the second}} day after the {{conclusion}} of the Sale, the removers' vans and carts should have <b>gutted</b> the <b>rooms</b> and be gone. It had, therefore, been arranged that Pollie should as usual share my bedroom the last night, and that next day we should set off on our journey. After luncheon--the flavour of its sliced nectarine (or is it of one that came later?) is on my tongue at this moment--all {{the rest of the house}} being now hollow and vacant, Pollie put on her hat, thrust the large door key into her pocket, and went off to visit her mother in the village and to fetch a clean nightdress. She promised to return before dark. Her shoes clattered down the stone stairs, the outer door boomed like a gun. I spread out my hands in the air, and as if my four-poster could bear witness, cried softly, [...] "I am alone." [...] Marvel of marvels, even as I sit here to-day gazing at my inkpot, there in its original corner stands that same old four-poster. Pollie is living down in the village with her husband and her two babies; and once more: I am alone. Is there anything in life so fascinating, so astonishing, as these queer, common little repetitions? Perhaps on the Last Day--but I anticipate.|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War, {{the team}} won its first trophy, a Scottish Cup victory, and with {{increased}} success came more additions to Pittodrie. The record attendance occurred on 13 March 1954, when 45,061 spectators turned {{up for a}} Scottish Cup match between Aberdeen and Heart of Midlothian. Floodlights were introduced at Pittodrie on 21 October 1959, when English league side Luton Town were beaten 3-2 in a friendly. By the 1 August 1968, the Main Stand had become all-seated {{as part of a}} £100,000 improvement of the ground. This coincided with a change of name from Pittodrie Park to Pittodrie Stadium. On 6 February 1971, a fire destroyed part of the Main Stand, and <b>gutted</b> the dressing <b>rooms</b> and club offices. The Scottish Cup - held by Aberdeen at the time - had to be rescued by firemen.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, UUTV's great grandparent, Light Works Community Darkrooms, re-entered UUTV's {{life in a}} most {{unexpected}} manner. SU announced that they had accepted a very substantial grant, which would further develop the photography program of Light Works Community Darkrooms. Unfortunately, Light Works was physically located directly next to the UUTV studios in the Watston Theater complex. Light Works was hungry to acquire the UUTV real estate for their upcoming expansion, and their newfound grant money provided the political and monetary support that they needed. SU administration was eager to accept the Light Works grant, and only nominally aware of UUTV's activities. Consequently, the original Watson Theater television studio was completely <b>gutted</b> to make <b>room</b> for the Light Works expansion. The UUTV studios and offices were moved {{down the hall and}} squeezed into a space that formerly housed the original UUTV offices and the independent student radio station, WJPZ. The Watson Theater complex was renamed the Robert B. Menschel Media Center, in recognition of the Light Works donor.|$|R
50|$|At this time, Stage 19, {{as well as}} {{the second}} floor control room in the center {{building}} between it and 18, is home to Fox Sports Florida and Sun Sports. It is also being used as a storage area for Universal Orlando parade floats, and to train sporting events for My Family's Got Guts, which was a short-lived revival of the classic Nickelodeon game show <b>Guts.</b> The green <b>room</b> had been used as a one for the show, and has remained exactly the same as it did when earlier Nickelodeon productions used it, albeit with new furniture. Much of the Nickelodeon signage is still visible in the second floor hallways including multiple murals of the Ren and Stimpy episode: Space Madness. Currently, the tube that runs above Soundstage 19 {{that was part of the}} tour, is now used for storage of several old props and A/V equipment, along with storage for the Blue Man Group. Additionally, the Gak Kitchen is used as the break room for the front of their house staff and the space that formerly housed the Game Lab is now a special event room for them and the park itself.|$|R
50|$|Fighting his {{way through}} the Mandragorans and Balzac's forces to reach the castle, Guts and Rita see the mysterious girl and take her with them. When they finally reach Balzac's throne <b>room,</b> <b>Guts</b> demands to know where Casca is, but Balzac only answers that they are too late to save her. Rita asks Balzac how all of these events came to pass; he recounts that he was once a kind and just ruler, but the {{pressure}} of juggling his responsibilities as both a ruler and as a husband eventually got to him, and he now finds comfort only in bloodshed. Balzac also reveals the woman to be his wife, Annette. He had preserved her life with a drug extract made from the Mandragora's Heart, making her ageless, but at a steep price - the drug also ravaged her mind, rendering her unable to remember her own husband. Despite this, in his madness, Balzac drinks an even more potent extract of the Mandragora's Heart, transforming himself into a monstrous figure. Guts quickly dispatches him, however, and saves Casca from the fully grown Mandragora. In a cruel twist of fate, Casca's exposure to the Mandragora briefly restores her sanity - with Guts forced to watch her revert to her catatonic state once more. He is given little time to mourn this turn of events, however, as in the confusion of battle, Rita had dropped Erica's pendant - revealed to be a Behelit - and the dying Balzac had claimed it, offering Annette's life as his sacrifice in order to be reborn as an Apostle. Guts finds himself forced into battle once more, but manages to defeat the Apostle Balzac despite his new-found powers. With the town reverting to some normalcy, Guts and his group continue their journey; Rita promising to not forget them. Some time after Guts's group leave, the Skull Knight appears in Balzac's castle and swallows Balzac's Behelit.|$|R
