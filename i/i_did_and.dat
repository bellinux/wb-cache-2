25|$|I {{am proud}} of what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> would do it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E

She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars. And I think he would have loved to do what I did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete.

She told MTV News: [...] "I heard it and I always knew I wanted to write this futuristic, alienistic song, and they pulled it up and I was like, 'Wait, I can wrap my head around this.

Chuck Yarborough of the Cleveland Plain Dealer said, [...] "Listening to the first excerpt of his [...] "Blue Cowboy" [...] made me balk—you'll pardon the expression—at listening to the second. But <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>And</b> the third. And so on. And now? Well, if I'm Nashville, I run West outta the game. The Hook. The Heave-Ho. The Thumb." [...] In a September 2012 review, music blog Long After Dark said, [...] "Blue Cowboy easily ranks with Ron Artest and Carl Lewis {{as one of the}} worst albums that a sports figure has cut ... ever. I can say that I managed {{to make it through the}} record, although it was not easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Bakshi {{is quoted}} as saying that he had [...] "mixed feeling" [...] about Jackson's adaptations, {{although}} he had not seen the films.

[...] has anyone sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> a lot better budget." ...|$|E

[...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not.

500|$|In May 2010, Cooper {{felt that}} she had been sidelined by former {{producer}} Lucy Allan and that Jacqui had lost her identity. New executive producer Paul Marquess also felt that Cooper had been under used. He decided to split Jacqui away {{from the rest of the}} McQueens, his reason for which being that there was so much [...] "talent" [...] in terms of acting within the family, he felt Cooper or Jacqui didn't need that [...] "support system". He increased her role in storylines. This made Cooper delighted, of the changes she stated: [...] "he seemed to like what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> he's worked on it and developed it. Paul has really taken me under his wing, he's worked me so hard and he's given me opportunities that I could only have dreamt of." [...] Speaking of her approach to playing Jacqui, Cooper has said: [...] "I try to tame Claire back because I'm a really emotional, sensitive person and very different from Jacqui, so I do work hard and I feel very privileged." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was disappointed, {{arguing that}} [...] "All the story's power {{is allowed to}} leak away by the deliberative {{heaviness}} with which Rivette pads through his 150-minute narrative, with its exasperating lack of dramatic emphasis." [...] Philip French noted similarities to Hitchcock's Vertigo and Jean Cocteau's Orphée, but called it [...] "surprisingly flat and unmagical". The New York Times also found it [...] "dry and overdetermined," [...] and Time Out complained that it [...] "never supplies the frissons expected of a ghost story or the emotional draw of a good love story." [...] Film 4 compared it to The Sixth Sense and The Others, but said that [...] "its glacially slow pace will frustrate {{all but the most}} patient". (Rivette said when promoting the film that [...] "I like The Sixth Sense because the final twist doesn't challenge everything that went before it. You can see it again, which <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> it's a second film that's just as logical as the first one. But the end of The Others made the rest of it meaningless.") [...] "An intellectual exercise in metaphysical romance - Ghost for art-house audiences" [...] was Empire wry take. The Digital Fix argued that Rivette's direction resulted in a product that [...] "if never exactly dull and certainly the work of a master, is ultimately an empty film that has nothing to offer but its own cleverness". Keith Uhlich of Slant Magazine found it was [...] "a lesser Rivette offering — a watchable, ultimately unfulfilling ghost story".|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Birkett {{acted as}} {{counsel for the}} second of the two Brighton trunk murders, a case which was {{described}} as [...] "his greatest triumph in a capital case". In June 1934, a woman's torso was found in a suitcase in Brighton railway station. The legs were discovered at King's Cross station the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman's body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye's case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye's boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman could not possibly be Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was ten years older. Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading [...] "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi." [...] in block capitals. The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, but experts testified that the handwriting on the telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, [...] "What is the good of knocking a woman about with your fists? You only hurt yourself. You should hit her with a hammer same as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> [...] her up." [...] A hammerhead was later found in the rubbish at his old house.|$|E

500|$|While {{calling into}} WVEE during their {{interview}} with Ciara and Polow da Don, Hilson said, [...] "I {{just want to}} tell Ciara it’s not about you. People are just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t want to see me succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E
