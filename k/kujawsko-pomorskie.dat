40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} and greenhouse gas (methane and nitrous oxide) emissions were investigated in 2003 on 20 organic {{farms in the}} central part of Poland (<b>Kujawsko-pomorskie</b> voivodeship) using a questionnaire developed in the Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation in Pulawy (Poland). Statistical data from the Central Statistical Office concerning the agriculture in the <b>Kujawsko-pomorskie</b> voivodeship was also used. A simple index (Ee) defined as a ratio of the total energy value of agricultural production (Pe) to the material and energy inputs (Ne) (in MJ) was used to evaluate the energy efficiency. The average value of this index was 2. 05; however, it ranged from 0. 04 to 16. 59. In the organic farms, direct energy carriers (liquid and solid fuels and electric energy) contributed most (about 45 %) to total energy inputs. Plant products had the biggest share in total energy value of the yields (81. 7 %), of which cereals were the most important component (56. 4 %). Animal products had only an 18. 3 % share, dominated by meat. Average methane emission per ha of agricultural land (AL) was 36 kg per year, 8 kg more than the average value for the whole voivodeship. This was mainly due to the higher cattle density on organic farms. Emission of N 2 O from the organic farms was about half the average of others in the voivodeship. In the group of 20 organic farms, total methane and nitrous oxide emission expressed in units of Global Warming Potentials (GWP) was 985 and was 45 units less than the average for the <b>Kujawsko-pomorskie</b> voivodeship...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to collect the data on undetected hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the frequently hospitalized residents of the <b>Kujawsko-Pomorskie</b> Voivodeship. Material and Methods: The analysis focused on empirical data. The research was conducted in 2013 among 6332 citizens of the <b>Kujawsko-Pomorskie</b> Voivodeship who had been hospitalized at least twice. The blood was tested for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies. The diagnostic survey with an anonymous questionnaire was developed and used for the purpose of the study. For the statistical analysis Statistica 10. 0 was used. The hypothesis was verified using the Mann- -Whitney U test and Chi 2 test of independence. A level of statistical significance was assumed at α = 0. 05. The results were considered to be statistically significant if the probability fulfilled the inequality of p < 0. 05. Results: Positive anti-HCV antigens were detected in 91 (1. 44 %) examined individuals. The relationship was found between blood transfusions provided before 1992, the use of intravenous narcotics and doping, and minor surgical procedures and the infection. Conclusions: Asymptomatic infection was detected in 91 citizens of the <b>Kujawsko-Pomorskie</b> Voivodeship. The highest risk of HCV infection occurs during small surgery and usage of intravenous narcotics and doping. The percentage of positive results is slightly higher in the group of people with cosmetic and beauty treatments. Planning screening programs special attention should be paid to this group of risk. Blood and blood products transfusions before 1992 were associated with a higher risk of HCV infection. People with above-mentioned interventions should become a particular group of screening program participants. Occupational medicine service plays an important role in prevention.

40|$|The use of {{renewable}} energy sources for energy production is increasingly gaining importance in the transition of energy systems based on fossil fuels. In Poland, wind energy is expected to play a mayor role in fulfilling the recent targets set out by the national policy. As the utilisation of wind energy {{is perceived to be}} associated with various negative impacts, this kind of energy source should be systematically addressed by related spatial policy instruments to ensure its harmonisation with infrastructural, ecological and socio-economic systems. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop an approach to support the decision making process connected with the site selection for wind energy projects using a geographical information system. Available locations for wind farm sites were investigated according to defined criteria reflecting the spatial and ecological policy and regulations. The technical and economic potential was estimated to quantify the conditions of the case study region regarding the utilisation of the wind source.
