5|$|Although Howe {{was in a}} {{favourable}} position, Villaret had {{not been}} idle during the night. He had attempted, with near success, to distance his ships from the British fleet; when dawn broke at 05:00 he was {{within a few hours}} of gaining enough wind to escape over the horizon. Allowing his men to breakfast, Howe took full advantage of <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> weather gage to close with Villaret, and by 08:12 the British fleet was just four miles (6km) from the enemy. By this time, Howe's formation was strung out in an organised line parallel to the French, with frigates acting as repeaters for the admiral's commands. The French were likewise in line ahead and the two lines began exchanging long-range gunfire at 09:24, whereupon Howe unleashed his innovative battleplan.|$|E

Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275BC after the ultimate failure of both campaigns, which contributed {{to the rise of}} Rome because Greek cities in southern Italy such as Tarentum now became Roman allies. Pyrrhus invaded Macedonia in 274BC, defeating the largely mercenary army of AntigonusII at the 274BC Battle of Aous and driving him out of Macedonia, forcing him to seek refuge with his naval fleet in the Aegean.|$|E

5|$|Pre-game media {{coverage}} of the game focused on Auburn being left out of the national championship game, a point of controversy for Auburn fans in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game.

5|$|As Morgan and {{his allies}} on the Assembly of Jamaica {{continued}} to deal with privateers and pirates, criticism of their action in London was fomented by two former governors of Jamaica, Carbery and Lynch. After Lynch paid £50,000 to Charles II, Morgan's commissions as lieutenant-governor and lieutenant-general were revoked and Lynch was appointed as the island's governor; Morgan still retained <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Assembly of Jamaica. Morgan had been a heavy drinker for several years; he received {{the news of the}} revocation of his positions badly and increased his intake of alcohol to the point where his health began to suffer. Lynch removed Morgan's supporters from the Assembly of Jamaica by 1683, and in October that year he removed Morgan and his brother-in-law, leaving the assembly packed with men loyal to him. In 1684 Lynch died, and was temporarily replaced as governor by his friend, the lieutenant-general, Hender Molesworth.|$|E

5|$|Hassett came in {{with the}} score at 2/117 and {{together}} with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77 and Hassett 10. The next day, the pair took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett lbw for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply {{on the first day}} and were already well in the lead, they {{had plenty of time to}} complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to string together substantial partnerships and Australia ended at 389. When England batted again, Allan Watkins pulled Doug Ring to the leg side and straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boundary, leaving England at 6/167. The home team were eventually out for 188 and Australia thus sealed the series 40 with an innings victory.|$|E

During peace talks at Altenburg, Metternich put forward pro-French proposals to save the Austrian monarchy. Napoleon, however, disliked <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> future of Poland, and Metternich was gradually displaced from the proceedings by Prince Liechtenstein. He soon regained influence, however, on 8 October, as Foreign Minister (and additionally that of Minister of the Imperial Household).
