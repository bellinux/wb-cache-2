5|$|The battle {{lasted about}} two hours, and {{involved}} innovative tactics and technology. By {{the end of}} the day, the IAF <b>had</b> <b>destroyed</b> 29 of 30 SAM batteries deployed in the Beqaa Valley and shot down between 82–86 enemy aircraft with minimal losses.

5|$|A second {{column of}} 25 T-34 tanks {{approached}} the Task Force within an hour. This second T-34 formation advanced singly or by twos, and threes, close together {{with no apparent}} formal organization. The howitzer battery hit another tank from this column in its tracks, disabling it, and damaged three more. The North Korean tanks <b>had</b> <b>destroyed</b> the forward howitzer (number six) and wounded one of its crew members, had killed or wounded an estimated twenty infantrymen, and <b>had</b> <b>destroyed</b> all the parked vehicles behind the infantry line. At the main battery position {{one of the five}} remaining 105mm guns had been slightly damaged by a near-hit. Several {{of the men in the}} artillery battery began deserting their positions but Perry managed to convince most of them to return. Although Smith later stated that he believed that the rounds had deteriorated with age, the ineffectiveness of the 2.36-inch bazooka had been demonstrated repeatedly during World War II against German armor. Because of peacetime defense cutbacks the 24th Infantry Division had never received improved U.S. M20 3.5-inch bazookas with M28A2 HEAT antitank ammunition, capable of defeating Soviet tanks. After the last tanks passed their lines, no North Korean forces were spotted for around an hour.|$|E

5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination.

He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E
5|$|Braham <b>had</b> <b>destroyed</b> 12 enemy {{aircraft}} {{with one}} probable and four damaged {{and was one}} of the most successful RAF night fighter pilots. In recognition of his experience he was then given command of No. 141 Squadron RAF at RAF Ford on 23 December 1942 as a 22-year-old wing commander. With him went his AI operator Gregory, now a flying officer with the DFC and Distinguished Flying Medal. Three weeks later, on 20 January 1943, Braham claimed a Do 217.|$|E

On 19 and 20 September the XXI Corps suffered total of 3,378 casualties of whom 446 were killed. They had captured 12,000 prisoners, 149 guns and vast quantities of ammunition and transport. With the exception of the Asia Corps, the whole Eighth Army had been destroyed.|$|E

The Allied air and naval attacks <b>had</b> <b>destroyed</b> {{almost all of the}} buildings on Labuan, rendering large numbers of civilians homeless. Within days of the invasion, about 3,000 civilians were housed in a compound within the beachhead. The BBCAU party were unable to assist so many civilians, and the 24th Brigade needed to assign soldiers to support them and transport supplies.|$|E
5|$|Leigh-Mallory {{claimed the}} Big Wings <b>had</b> <b>destroyed</b> entire {{formations}} of enemy aircraft upon seeing them. He even claimed the RAF outnumbered their opponents in several engagements. In the afternoon battle, {{he claimed that}} the Wing could not get into position {{to break up the}} bombers in time and was intercepted by German fighters. Still, while that was true he also claimed his units had shot down 105 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed a further 40. He claimed another 18 damaged for the loss of 14 and six pilots.|$|E

Around 700 men were lost in engineering units, 70th Tank Battalion, and seaborne vessels sunk by the enemy. German losses are unknown.

5|$|The British {{had been}} alerted to Arnold's {{approach}} and <b>had</b> <b>destroyed</b> {{all of the}} boats on the river's southern banks. Although two warships, the frigate Lizard (26 guns) and the sloop-of-war Hunter (16 guns), kept up a constant patrol to prevent a river crossing, Arnold was able to procure sufficient watercraft for his men, and crossed to the Quebec City side on November 11. He then realized his force was {{not strong enough to}} capture the city, so he retreated several miles and waited for Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans quickly {{advanced}} {{after the}} Battle of Taejon, with {{four of their}} divisions attacking south from the city along four different roads. The NK 3rd Division departed the city on July 22, advancing down the main highway toward Taegu and Yongdong, to where the 1st Cavalry Division was emplaced. The next morning, July 23, the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, in front of Yongdong, reported it <b>had</b> <b>destroyed</b> three North Korean T-34 tanks with 3.5-inch rocket launchers in its first use of that weapon.|$|E

5|$|The attacks caught UN {{planners}} and troops by surprise.

ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale thanks to their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict. UN troops were looking ahead to Operation Chromite, their amphibious assault far behind North Korean lines {{at the port of}} Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate the North Koreans would mount a serious offensive before then.|$|E
5|$|The bombing <b>had</b> <b>destroyed</b> {{the north}} {{wing of the}} school. During the search, rescuers found an {{additional}} 500pounds (230kg) of dynamite which had failed to detonate in the south wing. The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to disarm the devices, and they found an alarm clock timed to go off at 8:45a.m. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion may have caused a short circuit in {{the second set of}} bombs, preventing them from detonating. They searched the building and then returned to the recovery work.|$|E

Major streets were mined, with demolition charges throughout the main piazza, and booby traps littered the town. German forces had also buried tanks in the rubble, leaving only the turrets exposed.|$|E
