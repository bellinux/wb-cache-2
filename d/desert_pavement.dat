5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature <b>desert</b> <b>pavement.</b> Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
500|$|A {{large part}} of the surface area of the world's deserts {{consists}} of flat, stone-covered plains dominated by wind erosion. In [...] "eolian deflation", the wind continually removes fine-grained material, which becomes wind-blown sand. This exposes coarser-grained material, mainly pebbles with some larger stones or cobbles, leaving a <b>desert</b> <b>pavement,</b> an area of land overlaid by closely packed smooth stones forming a tessellated mosaic. Different theories exist as to how exactly the pavement is formed. It may be that after the sand and dust is blown away by the wind the stones jiggle themselves into place; alternatively, stones previously below ground may in some way work themselves to the surface. Very little further erosion takes place after the formation of a pavement, and the ground becomes stable. Evaporation brings moisture to the surface by capillary action and calcium salts may be precipitated, binding particles together to form a desert conglomerate. In time, bacteria that live {{on the surface of the}} stones accumulate a film of minerals and clay particles, forming a shiny brown coating known as desert varnish.|$|E

The central part of the range is striated by a network of dry valleys with the north- and east- facing slopes silted by the prevailing winds. After the typically violent rains, these slopes form ephemeral streams and flora. The southwest slopes in the south and west of the mountain range have a gentle rise, while the northern slope of the range is a cliff overlooking the vast Libyan <b>desert</b> <b>pavement</b> known as the Sarir Tibesti.|$|E

40|$|Normal faults {{exposed in}} the Volcanic Tableland {{in the southeastern}} part of the Bishop Tuff provide a unique {{opportunity}} to investigate whether tectonic faulting and associated fracturing control the rate of erosion in the vicinity of actively growing faults. If fracturing increases with fault displacement, erosion close to the faults should be more rapid for faults with higher displacement. Here we use in situ produced cosmogenic 21 Ne to quantify the erosion rate in the flat footwall blocks of three normal faults that have maximum vertical displacements between &# 8764; 12 and &# 8764; 160 m. 21 Ne concentrations in surface samples from volcanic bedrock and <b>desert</b> <b>pavements</b> along the three faults are nearly uniform and demonstrate that erosion is spatially invariant, both along individual faults and between faults with different tectonic offsets. Hence, faulting and fracturing of rocks adjacent to the active normal faults in the Bishop Tuff do not {{have a significant impact on}} the rate of erosion in the sub-horizontal footwall blocks next to the faults. This is further supported by samples from sites which are unaffected by faulting but record a similar erosion rate as samples located near faults. Using the density of the Bishop Tuff and a published 40 Ar/ 39 Ar eruption age for the tuff (760 ± 2 ka), the absolute amount of erosion since eruption has been quantified. At most sample sites the time-integrated amount of erosion ranges between &# 8764; 0. 9 and &# 8764; 1. 9 m, which is equivalent to average erosion rates between &# 8764; 1. 2 and &# 8764; 2. 5 m/Ma. Samples of bedrock-derived clasts from <b>desert</b> <b>pavements</b> have slightly higher 21 Ne concentrations than adjacent bedrock outcrops and thus yield higher apparent exposure ages (calculated assuming no erosion). Thus, <b>desert</b> <b>pavements</b> are more suitable for determining the minimum eruption ages of yet-undated welded tuffs than bedrock exposures. <b>Desert</b> <b>pavements</b> from the Bishop Tuff yield exposure ages that are &# 8764; 60 % of the tuff's 40 Ar/ 39 Ar eruption age...|$|R

40|$|Terrestrial {{ecosystems}} {{can be more}} holistically {{understood by}} investigating the morphology of landscape mosaics, the assemblage of their ecological communities, and the linkages and feedbacks between the mosaics and communities. The overarching objectives {{of this study were}} to: (1) study the abiotic and biotic configurations of landform units as mosaics within a Mojave Desert chronosequence; and (2) elucidate their potential feedbacks, interactions, and dynamics during landform evolution. Seven landform units distributed over three geomorphic ages were identified, including: young bars and swales; intermediate-aged flattened bars, flattened swales, and bioturbation units; and old <b>desert</b> <b>pavements</b> and shrub zones. These landform units were characterized according to abiotic and biotic land surface properties. Landform units were statistically distinct and predictable based on a specific suite of abiotic and biotic properties. Vascular plant functional group and biological soil crust community diversity varied with geomorphology, with greatest diversity associated with bars and shrub zones and lowest diversity associated with <b>desert</b> <b>pavements.</b> Biological soil crust communities were controlled by geomorphic age, surface rock size, and protruding rocks with young bar units having the highest abundance and diversity. Perennial forbs were observed in old shrub zones with small rocks and few protruding rocks. A high clast density and a finer-sized clast distribution were found particularly in <b>desert</b> <b>pavements</b> and flattened swales, and generally inhibited biological soil crust and plant cover. Evolutionary trajectories for landforms of a lower piedmont landscape can be dominated by either abiotic and biotic landform processes. These two trajectories are distinctly different and are associated with their own unique linkages, feedbacks, and dynamics of abiotic and biotic land surface properties, producing a highly diverse desert landscape. © 2013 Elsevier B.

50|$|A second theory supposes that <b>desert</b> <b>pavements</b> {{form from}} the shrink/swell {{properties}} of the clay underneath the pavement; when precipitation is absorbed by clay it causes it to expand, and when it dries it cracks along planes of weakness.

5000|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} {{for the formation of}} <b>desert</b> <b>pavements.</b> [...] A common theory suggests they form through the gradual removal of sand, dust and other fine-grained material by the wind and intermittent rain, leaving the larger fragments behind.

The removal of small particles by wind does not continue indefinitely, because once the pavement forms, it acts as a barrier to resist further erosion. The small particles collect underneath the pavement surface, forming a vesicular A soil horizon (designated [...] "Av").|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>desert</b> <b>pavements</b> (gravel mulch) on near surface soil micro-hydrology has been inadequately studied. Micro-hydrology in arid {{ecosystems}} occurs {{due to a}} daily non rainfall atmospheric water cycle, consisting of an input phase (dew, fog, vapour adsorption) and an evaporation phase. A winter comparative study between a bare soil (control) and gravel mulch using the automated microlysimeter approach was conducted in Stellenbosch, South Africa in 2008. Results showed that dew deposition and direct water vapour adsorption were significantly higher into bare soil compared to gravel mulch. In contrast, however, soil moisture from rain persists for a longer time under gravel mulch compared to bare soil. This result suggests that the greatest impact of gravel mulch on soil micro-hydrology is towards conserving moisture and could explain why the treatment is used in dry-land agriculture in Mediterranean regions. © 2011 Springer Basel AG...|$|R

40|$|Biological soil crusts (BSCs) {{are complex}} {{matrices}} of soil particles, mosses, lichens, and cyanobacteria that prevent erosion and influence {{water and energy}} balances, soil fertility, and vascular plant germination. The processes that form BSCs, the factors that control their distribution, and the ecosystem feedbacks that they sustain are poorly understood. This dissertation employed a novel interdisciplinary approach to address those research unknowns through investigations of the micromorphological structure, soil-geomorphic relationships, and biogeochemical feedbacks of BSCs in the Mojave Desert. A micromorphological study of BSCs resulted in a succession model that illustrates how crust formative processes and structures change through time. Tall moss-lichen pinnacled crusts actively capture dust, precipitate authigenic minerals, experience alternating expansion-contraction from wet-dry cycles, and form a surface seal that together with dust capture produces Av horizons. The resulting unique bio-sedimentary structures control ecological function and further promote BSC growth. This is the first study to demonstrate a biological process leading {{to the formation of}} Av horizons and suggests that BSCs are previously under-recognized critical agents of arid pedogenesis and landscape development. From a soil-geomorphic study of BSCs a model was developed wherein the ratio of fine sand to rocks controls the relative distribution of three surface cover types - cyanobacteria crusts, moss-lichen crusts, and <b>desert</b> <b>pavements</b> with low to moderate moss-lichen cover. The biological and geological feedbacks that sustain these cover types vary predictably across intermontane basins, yielding new insights for land management. Moreover, the physical processes that control BSCs are common to most deserts, making these results applicable worldwide. An ecological study of BSCs resulted in a conceptual model wherein the sand-to rock-ratio, which constrains interspace cover by BSCs and <b>desert</b> <b>pavements,</b> ultimately determines the magnitude of the fertile island effect. Inferred biological-geological feedbacks produce three unique biogeochemical patterns that vary predictably across the landscape. These surface cover patterns are consistent within many deserts, potentially reflecting overarching controls of resource allocation that operate despite differences in total site productivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{terminal}} lake systems of central Australia are key {{sites for the}} reconstruction of late Quaternary paleoenvironments. Paleoshoreline deposits around these lakes reflect repeated lake filling episodes and such landforms have enabled {{the establishment of a}} luminescence-based chronology for filling events in previous studies. Here we present a detailed documentation of the morphology and chemistry of soils developed in four well-preserved beach ridges of late Pleistocene and mid-to-late Holocene age at Lake Callabonna to assess changes in dominant pedogenic processes. All soil profiles contain evidence for the incorporation of eolian-derived material, likely via the formation of <b>desert</b> <b>pavements</b> and vesicular horizons, and limited illuviation due to generally shallow wetting fronts. Even though soil properties in the four studied profiles also provide examples of parent material influence or site-specific processes related to the geomorphic setting, there is an overall trend of increasing enrichment of eolian-derived material since at least ~ 33 ka. Compared to the Holocene profiles, the derived average accumulation rates for the late Pleistocene profiles are significantly lower and may suggest that soils record important regional changes in paleoenvironments and dust dynamics related to shifts in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies...|$|R
