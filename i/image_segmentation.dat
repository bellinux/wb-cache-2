25|$|By the 1990s, {{some of the}} {{previous}} research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective 3-D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized {{that a lot of}} the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse 3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve <b>image</b> <b>segmentation.</b> This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see Eigenface). Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included image-based rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early light-field rendering.|$|E

30|$|Activity {{concentration}} The tumour {{activity concentration}} was estimated from the SPECT images using the VOIs {{obtained from the}} three segmentation methods. Three combinations of VOIs and SPECT images were investigated: one with the VOIs obtained from the ASR <b>image</b> <b>segmentations</b> and applied to the ASR images (ASR/ASR), one with the VOIs obtained from the AS <b>image</b> <b>segmentations</b> and applied to the ASR images (AS/ASR), and one with the VOIs obtained from the AS images and applied to the AS images (AS/AS). The reason for including the mixed methodology (AS/ASR) was {{as an attempt to}} combine the better recovery properties of ASR images with the, as it turned out, potential advantage of improved volume estimation when using AS <b>images</b> for <b>segmentation.</b>|$|R
30|$|To model {{both the}} object and the scene in an image, Russell et al. [32] {{proposed}} to use regions resulting from multiple unsupervised <b>image</b> <b>segmentations</b> to represent an image as an aggregate of sub-images. These sub-images are represented with bag-of-visterms and modeled with an latent aspect model. Starting from multiple <b>image</b> <b>segmentations</b> to maximize the chance that some segmented regions will correspond to actual objects is an interesting approach. There is however no guarantee {{that this will be}} true in general, and we therefore model images at the scale of patches in our work to ensure that no initial segmentation step will harm the image representation.|$|R

40|$|Conditional Random Rields (CRF) {{have been}} widely applied in <b>image</b> <b>segmentations.</b> While most studies rely on hand-crafted features, we here propose to exploit a pre-trained large {{convolutional}} neural network (CNN) to generate deep features for CRF learning. The deep CNN is trained on the ImageNet dataset and transferred to <b>image</b> <b>segmentations</b> here for constructing potentials of superpixels. Then the CRF parameters are learnt using a structured support vector machine (SSVM). To fully exploit context information in inference, we construct spatially related co-occurrence pairwise potentials and incorporate them into the energy function. This prefers labelling of object pairs that frequently co-occur in a certain spatial layout {{and at the same}} time avoids implausible labellings during the inference. Extensive experiments on binary and multi-class segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the promise of the proposed method. We thus provide new baselines for the segmentation performance on the Weizmann horse, Graz- 02, MSRC- 21, Stanford Background and PASCAL VOC 2011 datasets...|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to study the problem of color medical <b>images</b> <b>segmentation.</b> The <b>images</b> {{represent}} pathologies of the digestive tract such as ulcer, polyps, esophagites, colitis, or ulcerous tumors, gathered with the help of an endoscope. This article presents the results of an objective and quantitative study of three segmentation algorithms. Two of them are well known: the color set back-projection algorithm and the local variation algorithm. The third method chosen is our original visual feature-based algorithm. It uses a graph constructed on a hexagonal structure containing half of the image pixels in order to determine a forest of maximum spanning trees for connected component representing visual objects. This third method is a superior one taking into consideration the obtained results and temporal complexity. These three methods were successfully used in generic color <b>images</b> <b>segmentation.</b> In order to evaluate these segmentation algorithms, we used error measuring methods that quantify the consistency between them. These measures allow a principled comparison between segmentation results on different images, with differing numbers of regions generated by different algorithms with different parameters.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} for {{averaging}} multidimensional images is presented, {{which is based}} on signed Euclidean distance maps computed for each of the pixel values. We refer to the algorithm as “shape-based averaging ” (SBA) because of its similarity to Raya and Udupa’s shape-based interpolation method. The new method does not introduce pixel intensities that were not present in the input data, which makes it suitable for averaging nonnumerical data such as label maps (segmentations). Using segmented human brain magnetic resonance images, SBA is compared to label voting for the purpose of averaging <b>image</b> <b>segmentations</b> in a multiclassifier fashion. SBA, on average, performed as well as label voting in terms of recognition rates of the averaged segmentations. SBA produced more regular and contiguous structures with less fragmentation than did label voting. SBA also was more robust for small numbers of atlases and for low atlas resolutions, in particular, when combined with shape-based interpolation. We conclude that SBA improves the contiguity and accuracy of averaged <b>image</b> <b>segmentations.</b> Index Terms—Combination of segmentations, shape-based averaging (SBA), shape-based interpolation (SBI), signed Euclidean distance transform.
