5|$|Around 1991, Gossard {{was selling}} the Wonderbra lines under {{licenses}} {{that were to}} expire in January 1994. At the time, the plunge style was a good seller in the UK market. Gossard planned to renew their license and had an option to do so under the <b>existing</b> <b>agreement.</b> Instead of simply renewing the agreement, Gossard executives decided to negotiate better terms with Sara Lee.|$|E
25|$|Coromantee {{slaves were}} also behind a {{conspiracy}} in 1765 to revolt. The {{leaders of the}} rebellion sealed their pact with an oath. Coromantee leaders Blackwell and Quamin (Kwame) ambushed and killed soldiers at a fort near Port Maria {{as well as other}} whites in the area. They intended on allying with the Maroons to split up the island. The Coromantins were to give the Maroons the forests of Jamaica, while the Coromantins would control the cultivated land. The Maroons did not agree because of their treaty and <b>existing</b> <b>agreement</b> with British.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Ungdomshuset {{was put up}} {{for sale}} by the city council. This sparked an outcry of protest from the users. The users saw it as {{breaking}} the <b>existing</b> <b>agreement</b> and the sale {{was taken to the}} courts. This would {{be the beginning of a}} legal conflict that would go on for the eight years. In 2001, the company Human A/S bought Ungdomshuset for the price of two million Danish crowns. The company was owned by the right-wing Christian sect called Faderhuset ("The Father House") who clearly stated that they wanted the users of Ungdomshuset out of the building.|$|E

The Check21 Act permits any financial institution (such as a commercial bank or credit union) that participates in the check collection process to remove or truncate the original paper check from the forward collection or return process and reconvert the paper check to a substitute check without first requiring an <b>existing</b> <b>agreement</b> between the bank of first deposit (...) and the [...] "paying bank." ...|$|E
2500|$|YRT route Viva Orange {{uses the}} entire York University Busway. [...] It was rerouted {{to use the}} busway on May 1, 2011, {{more than a year}} after the {{original}} target date of March 1, 2010. [...] Since a portion of the Hydro Corridor busway is on Imperial Oil property, York Region Transit needed Imperial Oil's permission to amend the <b>existing</b> <b>agreement</b> with the City of Toronto to allow Viva vehicles to travel on the busway. [...] Delays in this process prevented Viva Orange from using the busway earlier. [...] The late start to use the busway was also due to the need to relocate VivaNow machines from Keele-Finch to Murray Ross, and from Sheppard West station to Dufferin-Finch.|$|E
2500|$|Bowes {{made only}} eight {{championship}} appearances for Yorkshire in 1929 {{but he took}} 40 wickets, five per match, and achieved the very low average of 17.77 which only Rhodes bettered among Yorkshire bowlers. Bowes' best bowling return in 1929 was an outstanding eight for 77 in late July against Leicestershire at the Dewsbury and Savile Ground. Yorkshire's view of his contribution is unclear and Kilburn wrote that they [...] "were not, apparently, convinced". When MCC offered him a nine-year extension to his Lord's ground staff contract, Yorkshire did not dissuade him from signing even though it gave MCC continued first call on his services, per the <b>existing</b> <b>agreement</b> with Lord Hawke, and consequently he played for MCC against Yorkshire on several occasions.|$|E

2500|$|Labor {{relations}} were still strained. There {{had been a}} two-day strike in 1985 (over the division of television revenue money), and a 32-day spring training lockout in 1990 (again over salary structure and benefits). By far the worst action would come in 1994. The seeds were sown earlier: in 1992 the owners sought to renegotiate salary and free-agency terms, but little progress was made. The standoff continued {{until the beginning of}} 1994 when the <b>existing</b> <b>agreement</b> expired, with no agreement on what was to replace it. Adding to the problems was the perception that [...] "small market" [...] teams, such as the struggling Seattle Mariners could not compete with high spending teams such as those in New York or Los Angeles. Their plan was to institute TV revenue sharing to increase equity amongst the teams and impose a salary cap to keep expenditures down. Players felt that such a cap would reduce their potential earnings.|$|E

50|$|Prior {{to their}} merger, Sprint and Nextel were {{dependent}} on a network of affiliated companies.

In order for Sprint Nextel to allay some of this opposition, they initiated discussions of either acquiring some of these affiliates or renegotiating <b>existing</b> <b>agreements.</b> In several cases, the newly formed company was forced to acquire affiliated companies in exchange for their dropping their opposition to the merger.

40|$|Nearly 60 million refugees, asylum-seekers and {{internally}} {{displaced persons}} (IDPs) fled {{their homes in}} 2014, predominately from war-torn Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia. The global response to assisting this vulnerable group has been wholly incommensurate with the need given the profound health hazards faced by forced migrants at each stage of their journey. The majority of forced migrants are housed in lower-income countries {{that do not have}} the infrastructure to assist the significant numbers of individuals who are crossing their borders and the humanitarian organizations who seek to assist in the response are grossly underfunded and under-resourced. Countries have varying responsibilities to protect different classes of forced migrants based in international law, however there are significant gaps in <b>existing</b> <b>agreements,</b> leaving many individuals without protection or hope of assistance. There is a need to strengthen <b>existing</b> international <b>agreements</b> to ensure that all classes of forced migrants are entitled to protection and to ensure the enforceability of <b>existing</b> <b>agreements</b> where governments refuse to honor their existing obligations...|$|R
