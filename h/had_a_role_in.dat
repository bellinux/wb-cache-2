5|$|Although {{ultimate}} power officially rested {{with the}} country's {{government in the}} form of Sovnarkom and the Executive Committee (VTSIK) elected by the All-Russian Congress of Soviets (ARCS), the Communist Party was de facto in control in Russia, as acknowledged by its members at the time. By 1918, Sovnarkom began acting unilaterally, claiming a need for expediency, with the ARCS and VTSIK becoming increasingly marginalised, so the soviets no longer <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> governing Russia. During 1918 and 1919, the government expelled Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from the soviets. Russia had become a one-party state.|$|E

5|$|Many {{meanings}} {{have been}} suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air rock art may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art {{may have had a}} ritual role in rites of initiation, vision quests or totemic ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as notation systems and anthropomorphic figures may have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.|$|E

5|$|The Crusades {{consolidated}} {{the papal}} {{leadership of the}} Latin Church, reinforcing the link between Western Christendom, feudalism, and militarism and increased the tolerance of the clergy to violence. The growth {{of the system of}} indulgences became a catalyst for the Protestant Reformation in the early 16thcentury. The Crusades also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the creation and institutionalisation of the military and the Dominican orders as well as the Medieval Inquisition.|$|E
5|$|This system allowed {{crops to}} grow in {{straight}} lines from sowing to harvest, conserved moisture in the soil, and provided a stable annual yield for harvested crops. Zhao Guo first experimented with this system right outside the capital Chang'an, and once it proved successful, he sent out instructions for it to every commandery administrator, who were then responsible for disseminating these to the heads of every county, district, and hamlet in their commanderies. Sadao Nishijima speculates that the Imperial Counselor Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BCE) perhaps <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> promoting this new system.|$|E
5|$|Although castle {{construction}} faded {{towards the}} end of the 16thcentury, castles did not necessarily all fall out of use. Some retained a role in local administration and became law courts, while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats. A particularly famous example of this is Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11thcentury and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom. In other cases they still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> defence. Tower houses, which are closely related to castles and include pele towers, were defended towers that were permanent residences built in the 14th to 17th centuries. Especially common in Ireland and Scotland, they could be up to five storeys high and succeeded common enclosure castles and were built by a greater social range of people. While unlikely to provide as much protection as a more complex castle, they offered security against raiders and other small threats.|$|E
40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> immune regulation. In general, they are anti-inflammatory and promote Th 2 type responses, and they {{are associated with the}} alternative activation of macrophages. Interestingly, helminth infections, such as the schistosome blood flukes that cause schistosomiasis, are characterised by a Th 2 response and the accumulation of alternative activated macrophages. This would suggest that at some level, PPARs could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the modulation of the immune response in schistosomiasis. This paper discusses possible areas where PPARs could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> this disease...|$|R

5|$|As {{well as his}} {{chancery}} duties, Neville occasionally {{sat with}} the barons of the exchequer or with royal justices, and he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the appointment of royal justices. In 1230 he was regent of England while Henry was absent in France, during which time he met with Llywelyn the Great in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate an agreement that would resolve the disputes between the English and the Welsh. In 1232, during the events surrounding the de Burgh's downfall Neville, along with Ranulf, the Earl of Chester, urged that de Burgh should not be dragged from sanctuary to face the royal accusations against him. Neville's pleas prevailed for a time, but eventually de Burgh was removed from sanctuary.|$|E

5|$|Flooding also {{occurred}} in Cuba. Hundreds were evacuated {{their homes in}} four different provinces in Cuba, including 400peasant families in Oriente Province.

5|$|Rickey was a {{conservative}} teetotaler, while O'Malley freely enjoyed vices such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco. As O'Malley became {{more involved in}} affairs, he became critical of Rickey, the highest-paid individual in baseball, counting salary, attendance bonuses, and player contract sales commissions. O'Malley and Rickey had very different backgrounds and philosophies. It was O'Malley who put pressure on Rickey to fire manager Leo Durocher, who O'Malley felt was a drain on attendance. In board of directors meetings, O'Malley also opposed Rickey's extravagances. When he was with his political friends, he made fun of Rickey at every chance. Daily News columnist Jimmy Powers would deride Rickey for selling off players and for general miserliness. When Rickey asked O'Malley, the team lawyer, if he should sue, O'Malley said no. Powers' campaign became so public that after the 1946 season Rickey gave each player a new Studebaker, which gave O'Malley, a Dodgers shareholder, reason to speak ill of Rickey in the press. It {{got to the point}} where everything Rickey did was something O'Malley derided: O'Malley thought Rickey's construction of the state of the art Vero Beach spring training facility, known as Dodgertown, was extravagant; he thought Rickey's investment in the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference was questionable; he fought Rickey on the team's beer sponsor; and he demanded that players return their 1947 World Series rings before receiving the new ones Rickey ordered. As team lawyer, O'Malley <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> breaking the racial barrier as well. In particular, he had a significant role in Rickey's top-secret search for suitable ballplayers to break the color barrier and then later he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> assessing the ongoing legal risks to the franchise.Other accounts, however, suggest that he played a lesser role in Robinson's signing.|$|E
