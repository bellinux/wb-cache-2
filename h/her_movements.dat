5|$|During World War II, Seisho Maru {{served as}} an army transport, but sources {{reporting}} <b>her</b> <b>movements</b> are incomplete. It is known that {{she was one of}} some 20 ships that departed Takau as part of three combined convoys—TASA-17, TE-03, and No. 82—in mid-April 1944.|$|E
5|$|Instead of detaining {{a person}} for the {{purposes}} mentioned above, the executive may impose other restrictions upon the person's liberty such as curfews, requiring the reporting of his or <b>her</b> <b>movements,</b> prohibiting the person from speaking at public meetings or taking part in political activities, and travelling beyond Singapore or {{any part of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|French {{hopes of}} regaining {{supremacy}} in the Adriatic now {{rested on the}} Rivoli, a ship of the line under construction at Venice. Although her completion had been delayed by almost two years, British intelligence was aware of her condition and had periodically supplied ships of the line to observe <b>her</b> <b>movements</b> and engage her if the opportunity should arise. In February 1812, Rivoli departed Venice for the first time, destined for Pola on her maiden voyage. Waiting for Rivoli was the British HMS Victorious, commanded by John Talbot, who chased Rivoli and captured her in a four-hour battle in which both sides suffered heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} few years, <b>her</b> <b>movements</b> in New Zealand were {{arranged}} around the most important national races. She won the Coast to Coast a record five times (1991–1994, 1996), the national mountain bike series every year until aged 40, and the Karapoti Classic all eight times that she started. In 1994, after being pushed by Susan DeMattei through the whole race, Lynch set a new race record at the Karapoti Classic that stood for 13 years. At the 1995 Karapoti Classic, she defeated the world number 2 – Caroline Alexander.|$|E
5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} begins with Carey, revisiting her youth, wandering {{a high school}} corridor and standing inside a classroom of schoolchildren playing various musical instruments with inter-cutting clips of men playing on drums. Clips of a schoolgirl playing Carey are also shown, with Carey shadowing <b>her</b> <b>movements,</b> and her efforts to catch a schoolboy's attention who in turn persistently ignores her, choosing to mess about {{in the classroom and}} corridors with his friends instead. Towards the end of the video, groups of schoolchildren are shown dancing in the corridor as the boy she liked, now an adult, is following Carey around the school and trying to flirt with her, but Carey brushes him off. The official music video has achieved 3.3 million views on YouTube as of June 2017.|$|E
5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict <b>her</b> <b>movements</b> to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E

5|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by contemporary critics, who noted {{the success of}} the Dragonette-production, in addition to reviewers who called it a good follow-up single to her debut due to the successful pop themes and potential of the track. Commercially the track debuted at number 40 in both the UK Singles Chart and the Scottish Singles Chart. A music video directed by Stephen Agnes was released; the video was filmed in the East Village of New York City and presented Roberts walking down various streets in the city with special effects added to <b>her</b> <b>movements.</b> During the shoot, weather conditions made it uncomfortable for filming, although this was not reflected in critical opinion. The video's simplicity, as well as the dress she wore in the video, gained mixed responses from critics.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Terra and Ventus, Aqua is {{the only}} protagonist {{who did not have}} a point of {{reference}} for Tetsuya Nomura to design from, and thus was designed from scratch. Later in the design process, Nomura became concerned that Aqua would not be popular, and this drove his decision to make her very distinct in her personal bravery and combat abilities. While her outfit design was based on Terra's, <b>her</b> <b>movements</b> were chosen to distinguish her from other characters by having her specialize in magical combat. Aqua is voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi in Japanese and Willa Holland in English.|$|E
5|$|Visual effects at Kroma were {{supervised}} by Bert Yukich and produced by Amy Yukich. A {{key part of}} the video is a 24-second visual effects sequence in which Rihanna is surrounded by silvery strands of liquid that crisscross the frame in graceful arcs in response to <b>her</b> <b>movements.</b> Water elements were recorded on a special effects stage using a high-speed 35mm camera. Bert Yukich then composited them into the scene with the singer. He then added lighting effects to the practical water elements to give them the mirror-like texture of mercury.|$|E

5|$|Haunting Ground is a {{survival}} horror game with similar gameplay elements to Clock Tower 3 (2002). The player controls Fiona Belli directly and gives commands to her canine companion, Hewie. Fiona can run and perform a backstep maneuver, {{both of which}} reduce stamina. She can also crouch down to hide from enemy pursuers. Fiona can kick and tackle enemies as well, but tackling also reduces stamina. Losing too much stamina will result in Fiona becoming exhausted, causing <b>her</b> <b>movements</b> to slow down or possibly stop altogether. Exhaustion can be revived with certain items or with time. Fiona can interact with the environment by checking items, opening doors, and climbing ladders. The player can utilize hiding spots to evade pursuers. Other areas act as retaliation points that allow Fiona to use her environment to counterattack against her enemy, although some of these locations can only be used once.|$|E
5|$|Under {{this new}} ownership, Mary Celeste sailed {{mainly in the}} West Indian and Indian Ocean routes, {{regularly}} losing money. Details of <b>her</b> <b>movements</b> occasionally appeared in the shipping news; in February 1879, she was reported at the island of St. Helena, where she had called to seek medical assistance for her captain, Edgar Tuthill, who had fallen ill. Tuthill died on the island, encouraging {{the idea that the}} ship was cursed—he was her third captain to die prematurely. In February 1880, the owners sold the Mary Celeste to a partnership of Bostonians headed by Wesley Gove. A new captain, Thomas L. Fleming, remained in the post until August 1884, when he was replaced by Gilman C. Parker. During these years, the ship's port of registration changed several times, before reverting to Boston. There are no records of her voyages during this time, although Brian Hicks, in his study of the affair, asserts that Gove tried hard to make a success of her.|$|E
5|$|Information on West Cheswalds {{early career}} is lacking, but records {{of some of}} <b>her</b> <b>movements</b> and cargo are available. On 30 September 1920, West Cheswald took on a load of white sugar at Java {{and headed for the}} United States via the Suez Canal. While she was near Bermuda, West Cheswald was {{diverted}} from her original destination of New York to Philadelphia, to deliver her cargo in fulfillment of an order. Because the cargo had not been originally headed to Philadelphia, the purchasers refused to pay for it, believing that the voyage took too long. After litigation and various appeals, the case ended up before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1928 as Lamborn v. National Bank of Commerce, 276 U.S. 469 (1928). The court found that under the contract signed, the purchasers were obligated for the sugar {{regardless of whether or not}} the ship had originally been destined for Philadelphia. West Cheswald was also reported in Hawaiian service during 1920. The report of the Governor of Hawaii in the annual report of the United States Department of the Interior for the 1920–21 fiscal year, listed West Cheswald among the four -owned ships sailed to Hawaii by the Pacific Steamship Company.|$|E

6000|$|This {{question}} recalled Tessa to {{the consciousness}} of Romola's presence. Without answering, she turned towards her, blushing and timid again, and Monna Lisa's eyes followed <b>her</b> <b>movement.</b> The old woman made a low reverence, and said-- ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Her</b> <b>movements</b> until October 1942 are not recorded. In mid October she {{was sent}} {{to work in the}} Mediterranean Sea.

25|$|West Gotomska was {{subsequently}} chartered to Cia Sud Americana of Chile and renamed SS Andalien. <b>Her</b> <b>movements</b> after this point are unknown, but she remained under charter to the Chilean firm until 1947, and was scrapped by Northern Metals of Philadelphia in 1948.|$|E
60|$|She {{rose and}} made {{as if to}} take Mr. Polly's arm. But Mr. Polly felt that their {{condition}} must be nakedly exposed to the ridicule of the world by such a linking, and evaded <b>her</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Zollar's choreographic {{style is}} {{influenced}} by the dance traditions of black Americans—modern dance, African dance, and social dance. <b>Her</b> <b>movement</b> synthesizes influences from modern dance (a combination of Dunham, Graham, Cunningham, and Limón techniques), Afro-Cuban, Haitian, and Congolese dance. She emphasizes the use of weight and fluidity as opposed to creating clean shapes. From her Afro-Cuban dance training she employs a strong sense of dynamic timing, rhythmic patterns, and continuous flow of movement. She derives many of <b>her</b> <b>movement</b> ideas from African-American culture—allowing the [...] "church testifying, emotional energy shape the form, and the rawness of that form, like you have in jazz," [...] she says.|$|R

25|$|During her German tour, {{she began}} to suffer agonizing pain in her right knee, {{probably}} connected with a fall she had suffered on stage during her tour in South America. She was forced to reduce <b>her</b> <b>movements</b> in L'Aiglon. A German doctor recommended that she halt the tour immediately and have surgery, followed by six months of complete immobilization of her leg. Bernhardt promised {{to see a doctor}} when she returned to Paris, but continued the tour.|$|E
25|$|Cyclops spent Christmas 1939 in Liverpool {{and left}} port on 30 December.
