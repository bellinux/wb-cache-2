According to the reports, freed slaves in the area led Union forces to a new grave that had a head board and a <b>foot</b> <b>board</b> but no name. When they dug it up 2000lbs of bacon was discovered. The freed slaves indicated that a force of 400 Confederates had fled the area following a skirmish {{at one of the}} barricades the day before (July 2).
