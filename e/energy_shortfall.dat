50|$|With the {{discovery}} of large surface deposits of anthracite coal, the Lehigh Coal Mine Company (LCMC) was formed in 1792 to secure the mineral rights to vast areas of wilderness west of the Lehigh River ranging beyond to the outcrops atop Sharpe Peak of Pisgah Ridge near present-day Summit Hill, Pennsylvania. The LCMC lacked a principle investor as a hands-on-manager and periodically hired teams to trek to the wilderness to build Arks along the Lehigh near the turnpike operated from Lausanne (1800s Township) above Mauch Chunk to the Susquehanna River valley (passed by Beaver Meadows and the eventual Beaver Meadows mines) and then attempted to transport the coal down the Lehigh River to the Delaware River {{and on to the}} docks in Philadelphia. The lack of steady effort and an intimately involved company officer in the operations returned sketchy results, most often the expeditions would loose arks on the rapids of the Lehigh and so the LCMC made little profits, and only sporadic efforts over two decades. Inspired by the <b>energy</b> <b>shortfall</b> during the blockade of the War of 1812, the LCMC sent a large expedition out in 1813, which started down the river in spring of 1814 with five arks laden with coal. Only two of them made it to Philadelphia, and both were purchased by Josiah White and partner Erskine Hazard. The LCMC board in its disgust confirmed the unreliability of the fuel source when they let it be known they planned no further risky expeditions as too costly, giving White and Hazard the idea of purchasing the rights to operate the mining company. In the fall of 1814 they mounted an expedition to survey the Lehighs problems and those of the coal mine and transportation needs for getting its output to the River reliably and regularly.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEnergetic {{demands of}} social {{communication}} signals can constrain signal duration, repetition, and magnitude. The metabolic costs of communication signals are further magnified {{when they are}} coupled to active sensory systems that require constant signal generation. Under such circumstances, metabolic stress incurs additional risk because <b>energy</b> <b>shortfalls</b> could degrade sensory system performance {{as well as the}} social functions of the communication signal. The weakly electric fish Eigenmannia virescens generates electric organ discharges (EODs) that serve as both active sensory and communication signals. These EODs are maintained at steady frequencies of 200 – 600 Hz throughout the lifespan, and thus represent a substantial metabolic investment. We investigated the effects of metabolic stress (food deprivation) on EOD amplitude (EODa) and EOD frequency (EODf) in E. virescens and found that only EODa decreases during food deprivation and recovers after restoration of feeding. Cortisol did not alter EODa under any conditions, and plasma cortisol levels were not changed by food deprivation. Both melanocortin hormones and social challenges caused transient EODa increases in both food-deprived and well-fed fish. Intramuscular injections of leptin increased EODa in food-deprived fish but not well-fed fish, identifying leptin as a novel regulator of EODa and suggesting that leptin mediates EODa responses to metabolic stress. The sensitivity of EODa to dietary energy availability likely arises because of the extreme energetic costs of EOD production in E. virescens and also could reflect reproductive strategies of iteroparous species that reduce social signaling and reproduction during periods of stress to later resume reproductive efforts when conditions improve...|$|R

40|$|Humans have a {{tendency}} to discount the future; that is we value small, short-term rewards over larger, long-term rewards. The degree of future discounting, however, changes in response to socio-ecological factors. Here, we study Mbendjele BaYaka hunter-gatherers of northern Congo and their farmer neighbours to investigate adaptations in inter-temporal preferences in humans. We argue that in immediate-return systems, where food storage is absent and egalitarianism is enforced through levelling mechanisms, future discounting is an adaptive strategy to prevent wealth accumulation and the emergence of hierarchies. This ensures food sharing and allows for survival in unpredictable environments where there is risk of an <b>energy</b> <b>shortfall.</b> On the other hand, when food storage is made possible by the emergence of agriculture or as seen in some delayed-return hunter-gatherer populations, wealth accumulation, hierarchies and lower discount rates become the adaptive strategy. Therefore, individuals in immediate-return, egalitarian societies will discount the future more than those in non-egalitarian, delayed-return societies. Consistent with the predictions we found that market integration and socio-economic transitions decrease the future discounting in Mbendjele hunter-gatherers. Our measures of socio-economic differences marked this transition in hunter-gatherers living in a logging town. The degree of future-discounting was the same between more market-integrated hunter-gatherers and their farmer neighbours...|$|E

We studied the antipredator behaviour of pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) subjected to different periods of food deprivation, against the parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). As the energetic internal stress of aphids increased, the predominant antipredator response changed from walking away and dropping to kicking behaviour, and parasitization avoidance decreased. Parasitoids did not show preference between food-deprived and nonfood-deprived aphids. Dropping and walking away reduced parasitization from 50 to 33 %. These results support the hypothesis that the antipredator behaviour of an aphid changes as a function of internal stress. By performing less costly behaviour such as kicking under energetically constrained conditions, aphids seem to minimize their probability of <b>energy</b> <b>shortfall.</b> Given that aphid antipredator behaviour is a function of nutritional state, its occurrence under natural conditions may match host quality spatial distribution.

Since they would have lost some of their opportunities to hunt ringed seals from a sea ice platform, they may be deWcient in energy. Subadult polar bears appear to come ashore before more mature individuals and the earliest subadults are beginning to overlap the nesting period of the large colony of snow geese also occupying the Cape Churchill Peninsula. The eggs these bears are known to eat could make up some of their <b>energy</b> <b>shortfall.</b> The earlier these eggs are consumed during the snow goose nesting period, the greater would be the energy that is available. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the annual survival rate for subadult bears declined in contrast to that of prime aged individuals. If this reduction in survival is related to an increasing energy deWcit, as suggested by some, the con-sumption of goose eggs may reverse the trend and help sta-bilize the population, at least for some period of time. The total number of polar bears that could beneWt from this resource will depend on the increasing temporal overlap with the nesting period and on the foraging behaviors of individuals eating the eggs. It is likely that other food sources will also have to play a role if the polar bears are to persist...|$|E
40|$|Institutions are {{source of}} {{comparative}} advantage or disadvantage in international trade. Socio-economic and political constraints also matter for creating comparative advantage and affect the trade pattern of a country. These diverse ‘beyond the border’ and ‘behind the border’ constraints {{are often not}} fully captured {{in the literature on}} international trade and institutions. The existence of such institutional, socio-economic, and political constraints to Pakistani exports is empirically investigated in this paper through a cross-sec-tional analysis employing a trade Stochastic Frontier Gravity Model. Aggregate data for 2006 - 08 and 2009 - 11 show lower exports in the latter period. This is attributed to demand-suppressing effects emanating from the 2008 global financial crisis and supply-suppressing effects emanating from <b>energy</b> <b>shortfalls</b> and input constraints, due to floods, in Pakistan. The model estimation then demonstrates that behind the border con-straints in Pakistan are statistically significant in explaining total exports during 2009 - 11. The estimation is also presented for four single-digit SIC categories of products for this period. Behind the border constraints are evident for SIC 0 (agriculture, forestry and fish products) and SIC 2 (manufactured products) that com-bined account for approximately 80 percent of Pakistan’s exports. The estimation results by country further demonstrate that behind the border constraints affect the pattern of trade through the non-realization of bilateral trade potential. In the post-financial crisis era, Pakistan needs to further develop its institutional capacity to promote competitive exports given the explicit and implicit beyond the border trade barriers it faces and work to remove political obstacles to regional trade.

Although statistically-significant shortfalls were indicated for nearly all such values for home-prepared soymilk (1 : 4 ratio) against industrial ‘SoyCow’ soymilk and values reported in the South African database for standardised nutrient composition of food (p ≤ 0. 05), a much-needed contribution {{will be made to}} protein (and energy) intake through consumption of the product. More efficient extraction (possibly double mincing of rehydrated soybeans and more efficient pressing of cooked soy mash) should be explored, followed by an intervention study to evaluate the impact of daily consumption of home-prepared soymilk on the nutritional status of children in low-income communities. The development of recipes to promote the inclusion of undissolved fibre from the soymilk extraction process (okara) in dishes prepared at household level, such as bread, is recommended...|$|R
