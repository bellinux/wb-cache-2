5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers {{that there should be}} a planet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km in diameter. Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673km in diameter, 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E
5|$|A roadway {{was present}} along parts of today's H-58 {{by the late}} 1920s; initially, this county road was gravel or earth between Munising and Kingston Corners and {{connected}} with other roads to Grand Marais. In the 1930s, another segment was built to connect to Deer Park and to fill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between Kingston Corners and Grand Marais. The southwestern segment between Munising and Van Meer formed part of M-94 from 1929 until it was transferred back to county control in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between the two Roman lines.|$|E
40|$|Castellation is {{foreseen}} for {{the first}} wall and divertor area <b>in</b> ITER. <b>The</b> concern of the fuel accumulation and impurity deposition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> of castellated structures calls for dedicated studies. Recently, a tungsten castellated limiter with rectangular and roof-like shaped cells was exposed to <b>the</b> SOL plasmas <b>in</b> TEXTOR. After exposure, roughly two times less fuel was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> between <b>the</b> shaped cells whereas <b>the</b> difference <b>in</b> carbon deposition was less pronounced. Up to 70 at. % of tungsten was found intermixed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deposited layers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps.</b> <b>The</b> metal fraction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deposit decreases rapidly with a depth of <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> Modeling of carbon deposition in poloidal gaps has provided a qualitative agreement with an experiment.

5|$|Development {{continued}} through late 2002, with targeted release dates of December in Japan and early 2003 in North America. During the final stages, two planned dungeons that fell behind schedule were cut {{and replaced with}} a quest to recover Triforce pieces around the Great Sea. Elements of these dungeons were recycled for later Zelda games. On October 15, 2002, Nintendo revealed the game's official Japanese subtitle, Kaze no Takuto (Wind Baton), to emphasize the role of wind in the game. The company announced the official English version, The Wind Waker, on December 2, 2002. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between the Japanese and North American releases, the designers reworked some troublesome segments, notably shortening the lengthy Triforce quest.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{with the}} Welsh continued, and in 1158 Ifor Bach raided the castle and took William hostage for a period. A further attack {{followed}} in 1183. By 1184 town walls {{had been built}} around Cardiff, and the West Gate to the town was constructed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between the castle and the river. William died in 1183, leaving three daughters. One of these, Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, was declared the sole heir to the estate by Henry II. This was contrary to legal custom in England, and was done in order that Henry could then marry her to his youngest son Prince John and thus provide him with extensive lands. John later divorced Isabel, but he retained control of the castle until she married Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1214.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in ten natural canopy <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Santa Genebra County Reserve (22 ° 4945 S, 47 ° 0633 W) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> county of Campinas, São Paulo State, Brazil. The size and canopy {{openness}} of <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> were studied using hemispherical photographs. The vegetation survey included all shrubs and trees with height 0. 50 m <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> interiors and all the individuals with PBH (perimeter at breast height) 15 cm in a 3 m surrounding border of <b>the</b> <b>gaps.</b> <b>The</b> similarity among <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> and among their surrounding areas was assessed by the Jaccard similarity index and by cluster analyzes. <b>The</b> <b>gap</b> size varied from 20. 09 to 468 m 2, with a pre-dominance of small <b>gaps.</b> <b>The</b> families with the greatest species richness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> were Rutaceae, Rubiaceae and Euphorbiaceae. The species with the greatest number of individuals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> were Coffea arabica L., Hybanthus atropurpureus (St. Hil.) Taub. and Actinostemon klotschii (Muell. Arg.) Pax, all widely distributed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> understorey. Shade-tolerant species (late secondary species) predominated <b>in</b> function of <b>the</b> predominance of small <b>gaps.</b> <b>The</b> high number of species found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> reflects <b>the</b> importance of these disturbances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maintenance of species diversity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studied forest...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the thermo-mechanical durability of ITER it is proposed to castellate the interior surface of the first wall and divertor by splitting them into small-size cells [W. Daener et a]., Fusion Eng. Des. 61 & 62 (2002) 61]. A concern is the accumulation of fuel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps</b> of <b>the</b> castellation. <b>In</b> TEXTOR, molybdenum limiters were exposed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scrape-off layer (SOL) plasma to assess fuel accumulation. The first limiter was exposed under deposition-dominated conditions. Carbon deposits were formed both on top surfaces and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps.</b> About 0. 12 % of the impinging D-fluence was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gaps.</b> Another castellated limiter was exposed under erosion-dominated conditions. Deposited layers were found only on the plasma shadowed areas of <b>the</b> <b>gaps.</b> A significant amount of molybdenum from the limiter was found intermixed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deposit. <b>The</b> <b>gaps</b> contained similar to 0. 03 % of the impinging D-fluence.

5|$|By 14 August, Godwin-Austen {{realized}} the peril of his situation, with XV Brigade nearly {{able to cut}} him off from behind, his troops exhausted, and his artillery completely deficient and running low on ammunition, and informed General Henry Maitland Wilson, who was in command at Cairo while Wavell was absent in England, that retreat from Tug Argan and evacuation from British Somaliland was now a necessity. If his forces could be evacuated, perhaps 70 percent of them might be removed. Otherwise, he {{would be forced to}} fight to the death, with his entire command destroyed. Wilson agreed to Godwin-Austen's request the next day, and preparations were made to flee after dark on 15 August. During that day, Observation Hill was attacked for the final time by De Simone's forces. De Simone had decided to doggedly press his attack <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> in lieu of completing the flanking maneuver, and finally this proved successful. By 7:00pm XIII Brigade had seized Observation Hill, and the British retreated from it in disarray. After sundown, the defenders of the remaining hills were withdrawn, along with the Punjab troops, who departed just as II Brigade was able to make inroads through their abandoned positions. British resistance had collapsed, and as Godwin-Austen and his forces fled towards Berbera, the Italians were in control of Tug Argan.|$|E
5|$|In a motte-and-bailey design, {{a castle}} {{would include a}} mound called a motte, usually artificially {{constructed}} by piling up turf and soil, and a bailey, a lower walled enclosure. A keep and a protective wall would usually be built {{on top of the}} motte. Some protective walls around a keep would be large enough to have a wall-walk around them, and the outer walls of the motte and the wall-walk could be strengthened by filling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between the wooden walls with earth and stones, allowing it to carry more weight – this was called a garillum. Smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers, whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander keep. Many wooden keeps were designed with a bretasche, a square structure that overhung from the upper floors of the building, enabling better defences and a more sturdy structural design. These wooden keeps could be protected by skins and hides to prevent them being easily set alight during a siege.|$|E

5|$|Julian drew up his {{infantry}} in two lines, widely spaced apart, each several ranks deep. This was {{a standard}} Roman line-up: the rear line troops were reserves {{who would be}} able to intervene if the enemy threatened to break through at any point, and to exploit opportunities as they arose. During the battle, the foot archers (sagittarii) would have formed the rear rank of the front line, to shoot over the heads of their own infantry. But at the start, archers were sometimes stationed in front of the main line, so that they could disrupt the enemy ranks with their missiles. This was especially likely if the Romans' archer forces were much stronger than Chnodomar's, giving them a competitive advantage in a long-range missile exchange. But Ammianus does not state if this happened on this occasion. On the right wing was posted the entire cavalry. Most likely, the light cavalry would have been stationed in front, to harass the enemy before the heavy cavalry launched their shock charge. Set back from the left flank of the front line, Julian posted a separate division under Severus to face the woods beyond the highway, apparently with orders to advance into them, presumably to launch a surprise attack on the German right wing. Julian himself, with his escort of 200 scholares, probably took up position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between the Roman lines, giving him a close, but relatively protected, view of the action.|$|E
5|$|The {{orders for}} Operation Roland were issued {{in the closing}} hours of 13 July 1943. But after meeting with Manstein, Hitler {{countermanded}} the XXIV Panzer Corps' deployment to the Kursk salient, sending them on 14 July to support the 1st Panzer Army to the south. The assault began at 04:00 on 14 July. Following a brief artillery barrage, the 4th SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment Der Führer of Das Reich struck out for the high ground south-west of Pravorot, evicting {{the remnants of the}} 2nd Guards Tank Corps from the village of Belenikhino following house-to-house and hand-to-hand fighting. Das Reichs 2nd SS-Panzer Regiment fought off a series of counterattacks and forced the Red Army units to withdraw eastward to a new line. Zhukov ordered the 10th Guards Mechanized Brigade of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps to reinforce the line. The 7th Panzer Division of the III Panzer Corps made contact with Das Reich, but Trufanov, commanding the Soviet forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap,</b> was aware of the threat and conducted a fighting withdrawal. The link-up failed to trap the Soviet forces, though they abandoned a substantial number of their anti-tank guns. Operation Roland failed to produce a decisive result for the German side, and Totenkopf began withdrawing from its positions north of the Psel, following orders issued late on 15 July, as the II SS-Panzer Corps assumed a defensive stance along its entire front.|$|E
