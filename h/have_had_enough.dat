Although they {{continued}} to be plagued by financial difficulties, Normand Latourelle took the gamble and went to Los Angeles, despite only having enough money to make a one-way trip. Had the show been a failure, the company would not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> money to get their performers and equipment back to Montreal.|$|E
5|$|When Sélestat {{started to}} appear in written {{documents}} in the 8th century, {{it may have been}} a market town or simply a village populated by fishermen and farmers. The area was part of the estate of Eberhard, a member of the Alsatian ducal family, who donated it to Murbach Abbey at the end of his life. In 775, Charlemagne spent Christmas in Sélestat, which indicates that the town must <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> appropriate buildings and population to accommodate his court and troops.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{elements of the}} cathedral are so specifically detailed and the elements of Gothic and contemporary architecture so well delineated, that art and architecture historians have concluded that van Eyck must <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> architectural knowledge to make nuanced distinctions. More so, given the finesse of the descriptions, many scholars have tried to link the painting with a particular building. Yet, and as with all buildings in van Eyck's work, the structure is imagined and probably an idealised formation of what he viewed as a perfect architectural space. This is evident {{from a number of}} features that would be unlikely in a contemporary church, such as the placing of a round arched triforium above a pointed colonnade.|$|E

5|$|The {{chief of}} police reveals himself as Ushi-oni and starts eating the humans trapped in the shelter. Sagisaka sacrifices himself to push his {{daughter}} away from Ushi-oni's attack. Otoha confronts and, in a climatic sequence, his conviction resurrects his Yurine, which restores Otoha as a karas and he slays Ushi-oni. While karas from other cities observe the showdown between Otoha and Eko, Homura steps in to help Otoha. Otoha carries out Nue's request to kill him and his brother, depriving Eko of his new power source and stopping his entire scheme. Confronting the depowered Eko on equal terms, Otoha finally defeats him. Eko claims Otoha will understand his reasons after 400 years as a karas. Despite defending his human body and Yurine from soldiers ordered by the Deputy Governor to shoot them, Otoha proclaims himself as Tokyo's appointed agent, who will protect all its inhabitants. While Hinaru stays behind in Shinjuku as it is being rebuilt, Kure and Yoshiko <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> and leave for the countryside.|$|E

Already with the 2006 {{municipal}} elections, the VLD {{showed signs of}} fatigue with the Flemish voter, who seem to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of eight years of Verhofstadt, and the purple coalition governments. In an evening speech on election day, Verhofstadt conceded defeat {{and asked for a}} new generation to lead the VLD; he was to step down as prime minister after formation of a new government. However, the formation of a new government was complicated, and in the end, CD politician Yves Leterme failed to bring about a new government.|$|E
25|$|Beeching's {{secondment}} from ICI ended {{early in}} June 1965 after Harold Wilson's {{attempt to get}} him to produce a transport plan failed. It is a matter of debate whether Beeching left by mutual arrangement with the government or if he was sacked. Frank Cousins, the Labour Minister of Technology, told the House of Commons in November 1965 that Beeching had been dismissed by Tom Fraser. Beeching denied this, pointing out that he had returned early to ICI as he would not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> time to undertake an in-depth transport study before the formal end of his secondment.|$|E
25|$|Wealth {{inequality}} in Latin America and the Caribbean remains {{a serious issue}} despite strong economic growth and improved social indicators observed over the past decade. A report release in 2013 by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs entitled Inequality Matters. Report of the World Social Situation, observed that: ‘Declines in the wage share {{have been attributed to}} the impact of labour-saving technological change and to a general weakening of labour market regulations and institutions. Such declines are likely to affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the income distribution disproportionately, since they rely mostly on labour income.’ In addition, the report noted that ‘highly-unequal land distribution has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency, as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase productivity, while big owners may not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> incentive to do so.|$|E

25|$|From 1 to 4 November, the Australians were in Durban to play Natal and {{won this}} one convincingly by 310 runs. They batted first and were bowled out for 158, Collins making 76, but then {{dismissed}} Natal for only 83 with Gregory taking nine for 32, the best analysis of his entire career. The one wicket he didn't get was a run out. The Australians did {{much better in}} their second innings and amassed 341 with Taylor's 81 the highest score. Once again, Natal were no match for Gregory who took five for 54 and bowled them out for 106. Natal should <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> after that but they played the AIF again on 7 and 8 November in Pietermaritzburg, a three-day match completed in two with the AIF winning by an innings and 42 runs. In the first innings, Natal were routed in only 19 overs for 45, Gregory taking seven for 21. The Australians replied with 282 and were all out just before close of play, Taylor scoring 78 and Pellew 62. Natal were dismissed for 195 {{on the second day}} to end the match, this time Collins being the main bowler with six for 55.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Bell {{announced}} that he had quit as producer of Last of the Summer Wine. Citing differences with the BBC and his dislike of their indifference towards the series, Bell said, [...] "I have now decided I will not do it again. I <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of the BBC's attitude." [...] The announcement came following rumours initiated by Bell that the network would not commission another series of episodes following the 30th series and their indecision regarding a possible one-off special. However, on 26 June 2009, the BBC {{announced that}} it had recommissioned the show for a 31st series with Bell continuing as producer and director.|$|E
500|$|In practice, only wealthy {{families}} {{would have been}} able to implement this ideology. Women's responsibilities would have forced them to leave the house frequently – to fetch water from the well or wash clothing, for example. [...] Although wealthy families may have had slaves to enable free women to remain in the house, but most would not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> slaves to prevent free women from leaving at all. According to Gould, even Athenian women forced to work outside the home for economic reasons would have had a conceptual (if not physical) boundary preventing them from interacting with unrelated men. In contrast, Kostas Vlassopoulos has posited that some areas of Athens (such as the agora) were [...] "free spaces" [...] where women and men could interact.|$|E

500|$|The final debate {{took place}} October 28 at the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium, to an {{overflow}} crowd {{in excess of}} a thousand. Voorhis went on the attack, charging Nixon with misrepresenting the [...] "46votes" [...] to avoid real debate and any discussion of where Nixon himself stood on issues. The Republican candidate stated that he was fighting for [...] "the person on a pension {{trying to keep up}} with the rising cost of living... the white-collar worker who has not had a raise... Americans <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough,</b> and they have come to the conclusion that they are going to do something." [...] Nixon sat down to thunderous applause, and the San Gabriel Sun described Voorhis: [...] "He pauses, breathes heavily, scans the audience with tired eyes, adjusts his glasses nervously with both hands, and then strikes the podium with an open hand." ...|$|E
500|$|Nurmi stated to a Swedish {{newspaper}} that [...] "this is absolutely my last {{season on the}} track. I am beginning to get old. I have raced for fifteen years and <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of it." [...] However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin. Nurmi's one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945. In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn. He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile. Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925, and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him. In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20km. In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles. He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes. Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he [...] "won't enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event." ...|$|E

He and his family spent Christmas with the Camerons at Chequers where, according to Craig Oliver, Cameron {{got the impression that}} Gove would support remaining in the EU. He argued Britain would be [...] "freer, fairer and better off" [...] for leaving. When in an interview it was claimed that there was no expert opinion to support this, Gove remarked that [...] "the people of this country <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of experts from organizations with acronyms saying they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong." [...] However, interviewer Faisal Islam interrupted Gove after the word [...] "experts", causing some sources to report that he had made a general statement that [...] "the people... <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> of experts".|$|E
