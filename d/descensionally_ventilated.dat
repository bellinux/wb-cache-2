40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{backdraft}} in {{an underground}} mine tunnel fire is investigated {{by means of}} experimental simulation. According to the results, such a backdraft phenomenon is different from a general one in a compartment fire. A backdraft of tunnel fire takes place in an open system with flowing gases and no newly formed vents are needed to result in it under such an occasion. The backdraft occurs with the reversal of <b>descensionally</b> <b>ventilated</b> airflow. The results obtained extend the range where a backdraft can occur and promote {{a better understanding of}} the backdraft phenomenon. KEY WORDS: fire, backdraft, descensional ventilation, airflow reversal. Backdraft is a special phenomenon in a compartment fire. According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) definition, a backdraft is ‘‘The explosive or rapid burning of heated gases that occurs when oxygen is introduced into a building that has not been properly ventilated and has a depleted supply of oxygen due to fire. ’’[1]. The occurrence of a backdraft will cause the temperature and pressure to increase sharply in the compartment. This causes considerable damage to the building and threatens fire fighters. Concerned research work therefore receives extensive attention. Fleischmann and Pagn...|$|E
