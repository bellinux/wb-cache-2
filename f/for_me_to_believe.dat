[...] "The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things."

2500|$|Israeli Defense Force spokesmen {{initially}} {{reported that}} the building had collapsed several hours after Israeli bombing. According to the IAF Chief of Staff, Brigadier-General Amir Eshel, the building was attacked a little after midnight. He also alleged {{that he did not}} know when the building collapsed, but [...] "according to foreign press reports, and this is one of the reports we are relying on, the house collapsed at 8 A.M. We do not have testimony regarding the time of the collapse. If the house collapsed at 12 A.M., it is difficult <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that they waited eight hours to evacuate it." [...] In addition, it was reported that senior IAF officers had said that the collapse could have been caused by an unexploded missile or by a Hezbollah-planted explosive device. The IDF's excuses were immediately denounced by Qana's residents and witnesses of the strike, who said the Israeli shelling was responsible for the collapse. An elderly man who survived the strike said a Hezbollah device could not be the cause of the explosion, since Israeli destruction of local infrastructure made it impossible that weaponries be moved towards the building.|$|E

In May 2016, Ulrich said in an interview with Metal Forces that the album would be released in the summer of 2016, and that details for the new album would be finalized in the next month. [...] "If the record doesn't come out this year then it won't be because it’s not done... it will be because there's some sort of cosmic reason that it would be smarter to hold onto it until next year. But the record will be done this summer". Recording of the album was completed in June 2016 once the recording for the song [...] "Hardwired" [...] was finished.|$|E

2500|$|Webb {{was found}} dead in his Carmichael home on December 10, 2004, with two gunshot wounds to the head. His death was ruled a suicide by the Sacramento County coroner's office. After a local paper {{reported}} that he had died from multiple gunshots, the coroner's office received so many calls asking about Webb's death that Sacramento County Coroner Robert Lyons issued a statement confirming Webb had committed suicide. When asked by local reporters about the possibility of two gunshots being a suicide, Lyons replied: [...] "It's unusual in a suicide case to have two shots, but it has been done in the past, and it is in fact a distinct possibility." [...] News coverage noted that there were widespread rumors on the Internet at the time that Webb had been killed as retribution for his 'Dark Alliance' series, published eight years before, but Webb's ex-wife Susan Bell told reporters that she believed Webb had committed suicide. [...] "The way he was acting it would be hard <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it was anything but suicide," [...] she said. According to Bell, Webb had been unhappy for some time over his inability to get a job at another major newspaper. He had sold his house the week before his death because he was unable to afford the mortgage.|$|E

60|$|Now then, when he saith he saw 'No temple therein,' he cannot {{exclude the}} Lord God Almighty and the Lamb, {{for they are}} here said to be 'the temple of it.' Neither can he shut out the church, which is the body of Christ, for that is the city itself; yea, and the church shall be God's temple, and God and Christ {{the temple of the}} church for ever and ever He must {{therefore}} by this word 'no temple,' exclude only the outward way of gospel-worship, in which the saints in the times of the New Testament both meet and edify each other, and also meet their God, and are blessed and refreshed by him. Again, that this outward gospel-worship should be laid aside while the church is in this world, before her Lord doth come to be enjoyed by her, as touching his personal presence; it looks too like ranting opinions, and contradiction to Scripture, <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> (1 Cor 11:26).

If carried away by my feelings, I were to appeal to the jury for their sympathy because of my belief, I should betray your cause.

60|$|There {{are those}} who will not believe without seeing; who say, I must have proof. What I hear in church is too much <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> without many more reasons than are given for it all. Many people, for instance, stumble at the stumbling-block of the cross, and cannot bring {{themselves}} to believe that God would condescend to suffer and to die for men. Others cannot {{make up their minds}} about the resurrection. It seems to them a strange and impossible thing that Jesus' body should have risen from the grave and ascended to heaven, and that our bodies should rise also. That was the great puzzle to the Greeks, who thought themselves very learned and cunning, and were great arguers and disputers about all deep matters in heaven and earth. When St. Paul preached to them on Mars' Hill, they heard him patiently enough, till he spoke of Jesus rising from the dead; and then they mocked; laughed at the notion as absurd. And we find that the Corinthians, even after they were converted and baptised Christians, were puzzled about this same matter. They could not understand how the dead were raised, and with what body they would come.|$|E
