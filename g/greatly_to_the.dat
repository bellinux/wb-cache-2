5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature.

Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented any chance the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E

5|$|Bishop John Innes (1407–14) contributed <b>greatly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{rebuilding}} of the cathedral, {{as evidenced by}} the inscription on his tomb praising his efforts. When he died, the chapter met secretly—"in quadam camera secreta in campanili ecclesie Moraviensis"—and agreed that should one of their number be elected to the see, the bishop would grant one-third of the income of the bishopric annually until the rebuilding was finished. The major alterations to the west front were completed before 1435 and contain the arms of Bishop Columba de Dunbar (1422–35), and it is presumed that both the north and south aisles of the choir were finished before 1460, as the south aisle contains the tomb of John de Winchester (1435–60). Probably the last important rebuilding feature was the major restructuring of the chapterhouse between 1482 and 1501, which contains the arms of Bishop Andrew Stewart.|$|E
5|$|Decades {{of civil}} war during the 1st century BC had contributed <b>greatly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> demise of the old {{aristocracy}} of Rome, which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in prominence during {{the early part of}} the 1st century. One such family, the Flavians, or gens Flavia, rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Domitian's great-grandfather, Titus Flavius Petro, had served as a centurion under Pompey during Caesar's civil war. His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC.|$|E
5|$|During the Victorian {{expansion}} of Manchester, Didsbury {{developed as a}} prosperous settlement; a few mansions from the period still exist on Wilmslow Road between Didsbury village and Parrs Wood {{to the east and}} Withington to the north, but they have now been converted to nursing homes and offices. The opening of the Midland Railway line in 1880 contributed <b>greatly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rapid growth in the population of Didsbury, with stations at Didsbury and Withington and West Didsbury offering easy rail connections to Manchester Central. The line closed in 1967, although Didsbury station building remained standing until its demolition in the 1980s. The station clock and water fountain have survived, dedicated to local doctor and campaigner for the poor, Dr. J. Milson Rhodes.|$|E

Despite a growing state population and recent economic development, many rural areas have been struggling over the past 50 years with locally declining populations and the emigration of educated young adults to larger South Dakota cities, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states.

It accelerated east-northeastward away from the continental United States without redeveloping, and after passing over cooler waters, the remnants of Andrea merged with an approaching cold front on May 14.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{ability to}} adapt to {{different}} environments contributed <b>greatly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> breed's current success outside France. In most cases, Limousin bulls or their semen are now imported to improve locally bred Limousins. Today, the breed is present in about 70 countries around the world, and in all latitudes ranging from Finland in the north to South Africa in the south. Limousin breeders' associations exist {{in many of these}} countries, of which 29 are members of the International Limousin Council (ILC). The ILC was founded at Limoges in 1973 by Louis de Neuville, the Limousin breed ambassador. In 1989, EUROLIM was formed to bring together all of the herd books of European Limousins.|$|E

Although he lost control of Kiev, Bolesław succeeded in keeping the Cherven Towns captured by Vladimir the Great in 981; he was crowned King of Poland in 1025.

5|$|Two {{terms are}} used in {{referring}} to a quark's mass: current quark mass refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while constituent quark mass refers to the current quark mass plus {{the mass of the}} gluon particle field surrounding the quark. These masses typically have very different values. Most of a hadron's mass comes from the gluons that bind the constituent quarks together, rather than from the quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, they possess energy – more specifically, quantum chromodynamics binding energy (QCBE) – and it is this that contributes so <b>greatly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overall mass of the hadron (see mass in special relativity). For example, a proton has a mass of approximately 938MeV/c2, of which the rest mass of its three valence quarks only contributes about 9MeV/c2; much of the remainder {{can be attributed to the}} field energy of the gluons. See Chiral symmetry breaking.|$|E

Vespasian's grandfather, Titus Flavius Petro, had served as a centurion under Pompey during Caesar's civil war. His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC. Nevertheless, Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely wealthy Tertulla, whose fortune guaranteed the upwards mobility of Petro's son Titus Flavius Sabinus I. Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible equestrian status through his services as tax collector in Asia and banker in Helvetia (modern Switzerland)). By marrying Vespasia Polla he allied himself to the more prestigious patrician gens Vespasia, ensuring the elevation of his sons Titus Flavius Sabinus II and Vespasian to the senatorial rank.|$|E

5|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} outcome of the naval battle, Philip IV, who {{expected}} that the French fleet would have been destroyed, and the honour of his navy restored, dismissed and imprisoned Count of Linhares and Admiral Pimienta, among other officers, accusing them of mismanagement and abandonment of their forces. Linhares was replaced by Luis Fernández de Córdoba, Pimienta by Jerónimo Gómez de Sandoval, and Bazán del Viso by Giannettino Doria. Philip IV also appointed his 17 years old illegitimate son John of Austria as Príncipe de la mar, commander of all the Hispanic maritime forces, giving them widespread orders and powers in order to end with the misrule of the Spanish Navy. The French failure at Orbetello, nevertheless, contributed <b>greatly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reduction the French pressure in Italy. 6,000 soldiers from Naples could be consequently carried to Valencia to fight against the French armies in Catalonia. On September, a French expedition led by Charles de la Porte de la Meilleraye, with Portuguese help, succeeded in capturing both the presidi of Piombino and Porto Longone, which encouraged the Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena, to change his allegiance from the Spanish monarchy to France.|$|E
5|$|Tegström {{became an}} instant success at Sandefjord and contributed <b>greatly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club's first-ever {{promotion}} to the Tippeligaen, {{with a total}} of 14 goals when the club finished second in the 2005 Norwegian First Division. Tegström scored a hat-trick in the decisive match, beating promotion-challengers Moss 4–2; Tegström's teammate Andreas Augustsson scored one goal. Tegström also impressed at the top-flight in Norway, and after scoring five goals in the five first matches of the season he was the leading goalscorer in Tippeligaen, while his team was in fourth place despite being predicted to be in last place by every media outlet in Norway. When Sandefjord played Viking on 24 September 2006, both teams were fighting against relegation and Tegström scored the match-winning goal on a counter-attack after dribbling past half the Viking defencecomparable to Diego Maradona's goal in the 1986 World Cup. Tegström scored ten goals and made five assists in the Tippeligaen, helping Sandefjord avoid relegation in their first year in the top-flight. He also scored the first goal in the semi-final of the 2006 Norwegian Football Cup, which Sandefjord won 5–2 against Rosenborg at Lerkendal Stadion and played in the 2006 Norwegian Football Cup Final, in which the team lost 3–0 to Fredrikstad.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} decades of Hammurabi's reign were quite peaceful. Hammurabi used {{his power to}} {{undertake}} a series of public works, including heightening the city walls for defensive purposes, and expanding the temples. In c. 1801 BC, the powerful kingdom of Elam, which straddled important trade routes across the Zagros Mountains, invaded the Mesopotamian plain. With allies among the plain states, Elam attacked and destroyed the kingdom of Eshnunna, destroying a number of cities and imposing its rule on portions of the plain for the first time. In order to consolidate its position, Elam tried to start a war between Hammurabi's Babylonian kingdom and the kingdom of Larsa. Hammurabi and the king of Larsa made an alliance when they discovered this duplicity {{and were able to}} crush the Elamites, although Larsa did not contribute <b>greatly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military effort. Angered by Larsa's failure to come to his aid, Hammurabi turned on that southern power, thus gaining control of the entirety of the lower Mesopotamian plain by c. 1763 BC.|$|E
