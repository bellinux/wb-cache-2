40|$|At its 1976 {{annual meeting}} held in August, the American Bar Association (ABA) House of Delegates {{recommended}} a new court procedure {{for the application}} of due process to the issuance of gag orders. The proposal seeks to render standing gag rules unenforceable and would provide for special gag orders only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing are given to interested parties. The ABA proposal will help to reduce the current glut of <b>judicial</b> <b>restraints</b> by providing more specific procedural guidance than was offered by the Supreme Court in Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart. This article first explores the structure of the ABA proposal and how it could improve the current system of <b>judicial</b> <b>restraints</b> by reducing unneeded gag orders, preserving first amendment freedoms of speech and press without the expense and delay of traditional court procedures, and eliminating the hidden jeopardy of standing gag rules. It then examines the two pressing issues left unsolved: When does the Constitution allow a judge to gag a journalist, lawyer, or other individual interested in a trial? Should one who violates an improper or erroneous order be punished? It is concluded that the ABA proposal approved by the House of Delegates may be a long overdue improvement in the area of <b>judicial</b> <b>restraints.</b> However, the House of Delegates could have strengthened the proposal by expressing an opinion on the constitutional standards which should apply to the issuance of gag orders, and by recommending that those who violate erroneous court orders not be punished...|$|R

All potential benefits and drawbacks of each installation were compared and contrasted between the three areas of focus, on levels ranging from maintenance costs to long run ecological factors.

40|$|These lectures {{speak in}} large part from the second decade of the present [20 th] century; and they show the faith in the {{efficacy}} of effort and belief that the administration of justice may be improved by conscious intelligent action which characterized that time. The recrudescence of juristic pessimism {{in the past three}} years has not led me to abandon that point of view. At the end of the nineteenth century lawyers thought attempt at conscious improvement was futile. Now many of them think it is dangerous. In the same way the complacent nothing-needs-to-be-done attitude of Blackstone, who in the spirit of the end of a period of growth thought the law little short of a state of perfection, was followed by the timorous juristic pessimism of Lord Eldon who feared that law reform would subvert the constitution. Not a little in the legislative reform movement which followed might have proceeded on more conservative lines if he had been willing to further needed changes instead of obstructing all change. The real danger to administration of justice according to law is in timid resistance to rational improvement and obstinate persistence in legal paths which have become impossible in the heterogeneous, urban, industrial America of today. Such things have been driving us fast to an administrative justice through boards and commissions, with loosely defined powers, unlimited discretion and inadequate <b>judicial</b> <b>restraints,</b> which is at variance with the genius of our legal and political institutions.

40|$|Traditionally, the ECJ {{has treated}} the {{international}} legal {{framework of the}} external trade law of the Community with <b>judicial</b> self <b>restraint.</b> Especially the GATT was perceived as a forum for interstate negotiations driven by the spirit of intergovernmental reciprocity. Thus, the ECJ has concluded that the GATT should be protected from intrusion by national authorities and cannot be invoked directly before the court. However, {{in the context of}} new developments, GATT and WTO-law are increasingly seen differently: International trade rules can serve as a quasi-constitutional constraint on excessive national trade policy. Basic principles such as the Most Favored Nation clause, the principle of non-discrimination and the prohibition of quantitative restrictions are reinterpreted as protection of economic rights of individuals rather than as protection of interstate reciprocity. Application of GATT-rules by national authorities is thus essential for the effective implementation of the spirit of GATT to fight a potential bias in favor of protectionism.

40|$|This thesis {{performs}} a Foucauldian genealogy of youth justice, situating the generic community based sentence of the Youth Rehabilitation Order (YRO) - introduced in 2008 - at {{the frontier of}} an emasculating developmental trajectory which has informed youth justice policy and practice since {{the foundation of the}} juvenile court. It is argued that the YRO’s ‘governmentalisation’ (Foucault, 2007) of youth justice – its movement of sentencing determination and oversight from the judiciary to the executive - enabling the ‘young offender’ to be governed within a complex of managerial and administrative apparatuses with reference to bio-political ‘norms’ – has engendered the formation of a paradigm of governance which obfuscates the distinction between executive and judicial powers. It is expounded that this may serve to create administrative ‘petty sovereigns’ (Oksala, 2007) largely unhindered by <b>judicial</b> <b>restraints,</b> potentially exposing the ‘young offender’ to exceptional sovereign violence i. e., violence which is direct, arbitrary and subject to severely weakened judicial regulation (Oksala, 2010 : 42). The genealogy, analysed through the developmental prism of the nine community based sentences which the YRO replaces, traces the ‘governmentalisation’ of youth justice, illustrating how this obfuscatory paradigm of governance is programmed within its hybrid ‘penal-welfare’ evolution. The thesis illustrates that at the apotheosis of the ‘welfare-era’ in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s a youth justice strategy of ‘familial enclosure’ – aiming to immobilise the working class child - delimited the exercise of exceptional sovereign violence to within the walls of the nuclear family. It is shown that the disintegration of the ‘underclass’ familial enclosure in an advanced-liberal Britain has rendered this governmental strategy of ‘sedentarisation’ untenable. The belief is promulgated that the YRO, which provides a nomadic form of electronic surveillance and control, is a technology of replacement for this disintegrating enclosure, introduced by a managerial Youth Justice Board in response to the return of the nomadic children of the ‘dangerous classes’ (Lea, 1997). The genealogy suggests that the YRO may facilitate the diffusion of exceptional sovereign violence throughout the ‘social’, exercised at-a-distance upon a nomadic population of ‘underclass children’. It is also asserted that the YRO’s amalgamation of the ‘child in need’ and the ‘young offender’ is indicative of a wider process of ‘net-widening’ and ‘mesh thinning’ (Cohen, 1985) in which the ‘child in need’ is being captured within the penal net. A ‘de-governmentalisation’ of youth justice through a return to the ‘justice-model’ of youth justice policy and practice is proposed as a remedy to these issues. This, it will be espoused, will de-obfuscate executive and judicial powers and reign in administrative ‘petty sovereigns’ by subjecting them to effective judicial controls, preventing the ‘underclass child’s’ exposure to exceptional sovereign violence. The potential for the offence-centric ‘justice-model’ to restrict the orbit of the youth justice system will also be explored...|$|R
40|$|The Indian Constitution embraces {{economic}} and social rights as directive principles of state policy, ostensibly insulated from judicial review.

40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court {{has decided}} an {{extraordinary}} {{number of cases}} under the Federal Arbitration Act {{in the last half}} century, a pattern that continues today at the pace of a case or two a year. During this time, Republican presidential candidates have made much political hay out of the Supreme Court, running against the Warren Court’s “liberal activism” by promising to appoint judges who would decide cases more conservatively. In this article, I analyze whether this promise has been fulfilled {{in the context of the}} Supreme Court’s FAA jurisprudence by identifying the core principles of <b>judicial</b> conservatism – <b>restraint,</b> fidelity to text, and federalism [...] and then applying them to five of the Court’s most significant FAA arbitration cases: Prima Paint v.

The analysis finds the conservative promise woefully disappointed in the FAA area. Instead, the article contends, the Court has been highly activist as it has used the FAA as pretext to impose its own brand of civil justice reform. Finally, the article concludes by suggesting that FAA arbitration would look very different today had the bellwether cases actually been decided by conservative jurisprudential principles [...] much less visible in the dispute resolution landscape but also much more legitimate as a dispute resolution process...|$|R
40|$|Challenging the {{conventional}} wisdom that constitutional courts are the best device that democratic systems have for the protection of individual rights, Wojciech Sadursdki examines carefully the most recent wave of activist constitutional courts: those that have emerged after the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe. In contrast to most other analysts and scholars he does not take for granted that they are a "force for the good", but rather subjects them to critical scrutiny against a background of a wide-ranging comparative and theoretical analysis of constitutional judicial review in the modern world. He shows that, in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, their record in protecting constitutional rights has been mixed, and their impact upon the vibrancy of democratic participation and public discourse about controversial issues often negative. Sadurski urges us to reconsider the frequently unthinking enthusiasm for the imposition of judicial limits upon constitutional democracy. In the end, his reflections go to {{the very heart of the}} fundamental dilemma of constitutionalism and political theory: how best to find the balance between constitutionalism and democracy? The lively, if imperfect, democracies in Central and Eastern Europe provide a fascinating terrain for raising this question, and testing traditional answers. This innovative, wide-ranging and thought-provoking book will become essential reading for scholars and students alike in the fields of comparative constitutionalism and political theory, particularly for those with an interest in legal and political developments in the postcommunist world.

40|$|We recall Supreme Court Justice and Nuremberg {{prosecutor}} Robert Houghwout Jackson (1892 - 1954) {{for many}} reasons, but certainly a leading {{one is the}} striking contrast between his humble origins and his exalted destinations. Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s life began literally in the deep woods, on a family farm in the gorgeous rural isolation of Spring Creek Township in northwestern Pennsylvania 2 ̆ 7 s Warren County. He spent his boyhood and obtained his basic public school education in Frewsburg, {{a small town in}} southwestern New York State. While still a teenager, Jackson spent one additional year as a high school student in nearby Jamestown, New York, but he never received a day of college education. He prepared to become a lawyer principally by working as an apprentice for two years in a Jamestown law office. From that background, Robert Jackson rose to make big marks on the biggest stages of his time, and in history. As a young lawyer, he became a great success in twenty years of private practice while also developing an identity, and some important connections, in Democratic Party politics in New York State. Jackson moved to Washington in 1934, joining the New Deal and becoming a true Roosevelt administration insider and a personal confidant and favorite of the President. 2 ̆ 7 In ensuing years, Jackson became a leading government lawyer of national renown, a great and very successful Supreme Court advocate during his years as Assistant Attorney General and Solicitor General and, for eighteen months beginning in January 1940, Attorney General of the United States. In July 1941, Robert Jackson was appointed an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, where he served for thirteen years and created a permanent legacy of independent thinking, <b>judicial</b> principle and <b>restraint,</b> and simply gorgeous writing that was authentically his own product. By presidential appointment that took him away from the Supreme Court for the full 1945 - 1946 year, Justice Jackson also served, and he succeeded, in a legal position of unprecedented complexity and permanent historical importance: he was chief United States prosecutor of the major Nazi war criminals, and truly the principal architect of the legal proceedings that gave birth to modern international law, at Nuremberg, Germany. That summary of Robert H. Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s amazing life journey covers a lot of ground, but it skips Albany. In Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s biography, 2 ̆ 2 Albany 2 ̆ 2 means the Albany Law School, where he was a student during the academic year 1911 - 1912. Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Albany 2 ̆ 2 also encompasses, more broadly, his personal and professional ties to New York State 2 ̆ 7 s capital city during most {{of the first half of}} the twentieth century, when Albany was a leading site of American political and economic power and legal development. In the study and appreciation of Robert H. Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s life and his enormous accomplishments, to skip Albany is to make a big mistake. As this article describes, Albany connected with who Jackson already was when he arrived in the capital city as an eighteen- or nineteen-year-old law apprentice, and Albany over the ensuing years contributed directly to the experiences and values that played major roles in all that he ultimately did and became. As young Robert Jackson observed closely and absorbed deeply, Albany 2 ̆ 7 s constituents, including its private law school, its governmental institutions and its people, especially its courts, judges and lawyers, employed rational capacities in practical efforts to address and improve individual and collective circumstances. They embodied the human reasoning process that Jackson came to see as the content of law itself, and that process became for him the hallmark of the justice-seeking, self-interest restraining work to which he dedicated his life in the legal profession. Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s personal foundation, in other words, rested on the law as he came to understand it and began to work with it on Albany 2 ̆ 7 s soil, at its law school and in the legal environment of its state...|$|R

500|$|To {{the wider}} public, who knew little of his legal work, Hand was by then a folk hero. Social {{scientist}} Marvin Schick {{has pointed out}} that this mythic status is a paradox. Because Hand never served on the Supreme Court, the majority of his cases were routine and his judgments rooted in precedent. On Hand's retirement in 1951, Felix Frankfurter predicted that his [...] "actual decisions will be all deader than the Dodo before long, as at least many of them are already". Working for a lower court, however, saved Hand from the taint of political influence that often hung over the Supreme Court. Hand's eloquence as a writer played a larger part in the spread of his influence than the substance of his decisions; and Schick believes that the Hand myth brushes over contradictions in his legal philosophy. Hand's reputation as a libertarian obscures {{the fact that he was}} cautious as a judge. Though a liberal, he argued for <b>judicial</b> <b>restraint</b> in interpreting the Constitution, and regarded the advancement of civil liberties as a task for the legislature, not the courts. In his 1958 Holmes Lectures, for example, he voiced doubts about the constitutionality of the Warren Court's civil rights rulings. This philosophy of <b>judicial</b> <b>restraint</b> failed to influence the decisions of the Supreme Court during Hand's lifetime and afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Hand is also {{remembered as}} a pioneer of modern {{approaches}} to statutory interpretation. His decisions in specialist fields, such as patents, torts, admiralty law, and antitrust law, set lasting standards for craftsmanship and clarity. On constitutional matters, he was both a political progressive and an advocate of <b>judicial</b> <b>restraint.</b> He believed in the protection of free speech and in bold legislation to address social and economic problems. He argued, however, that the United States Constitution does not empower courts to overrule the legislation of elected bodies, except in extreme circumstances. Instead, he advocated the [...] "combination of toleration and imagination {{that to me is}} the epitome of all good government".|$|E
500|$|Because of Minton's {{previous}} Congressional partisanship, many liberals {{believed he}} would support their positions when on the Court. Throughout his tenure, Minton regularly disappointed them, leading many to rail against him. A lawyer writing for the New Jersey Law Journal labeled Minton a [...] "spokesman against freedom", calling him [...] "a man of conspicuous judicial shortcomings, whose votes against civil liberties exceeded those of any other man on the Court, and who wrote comparatively few opinions of other kinds." [...] Linda Gugin pointed out that Minton was a disappointment to liberals because he consistently chose order over freedom. Gugin also concludes that Minton had the strongest commitment to <b>judicial</b> <b>restraint</b> and ideological neutrality of any justice, past or present.|$|E
500|$|After Minton {{failed in}} his 1940 Senate {{re-election}} bid, Roosevelt appointed {{him as a}} judge to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. After Roosevelt's death, President Harry Truman, who had developed a close friendship with Minton during their time together in the Senate, nominated him to the Supreme Court. [...] He was confirmed by the Senate on October 4, 1949, {{by a vote of}} 48 to 16, 15 Republicans and one Democrat (Harry Flood Byrd of Virginia) voting against him. He served on the Supreme Court for seven years. An advocate of <b>judicial</b> <b>restraint,</b> Minton was a regular supporter of the majority opinions during his early years on the Court; he became a regular dissenter after President Dwight Eisenhower's appointees altered the Bench's composition. In 1956, poor health forced Minton's retirement, after which he traveled and lectured until his death in 1965.|$|E
500|$|In June 1987, Philip Elman, a {{civil rights}} {{attorney}} who served as an associate in the Solicitor General's office during Harry Truman's term, claimed he and Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter were mostly responsible for the Supreme Court's decision, and stated that the NAACP's arguments did not present strong evidence. Elman {{has been criticized for}} offering a self-aggrandizing history of the case, omitting important facts, and denigrating the work of civil rights attorneys who had laid the groundwork for the decision over many decades. However, Frankfurter was also known for being one of court's most outspoken advocates of the <b>judicial</b> <b>restraint</b> philosophy of basing court rulings on existing law rather than personal or political considerations. Public officials in the United States today are nearly unanimous in lauding the ruling. In May 2004, the fiftieth anniversary of the ruling, President George W. Bush spoke {{at the opening of the}} Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site, calling Brown [...] "a decision that changed America for the better, and forever." [...] Most Senators and Representatives issued press releases hailing the ruling.|$|E
500|$|Hand {{has been}} {{called one of the}} United States' most {{significant}} judicial philosophers. A leading advocate of <b>judicial</b> <b>restraint,</b> he took seriously Alexander Hamilton's formulation that [...] "the judiciary ...may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgement." [...] Any judicial ruling that had the effect of legislating from the bench troubled Hand. In 1908, in his article [...] "Due Process of Law and the Eight-Hour Day", he attacked the 1905 Supreme Court ruling in Lochner v. New York, which had struck down a law prohibiting bakery staff from working more than ten hours a day. The Supreme Court went on to strike down a series of similar worker-protective laws {{on the grounds that they}} restricted freedom of contract. Hand regarded this principle as undemocratic. [...] "For the state to intervene", he argued, [...] "to make more just and equal the relative strategic advantages of the two parties to the contract, of whom one is under the pressure of absolute want, while the other is not, is as proper a legislative function as that it should neutralize the relative advantages arising from fraudulent cunning or from superior force." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the case}} of United States v. Dennis in 1950, Hand made a ruling that {{appeared}} to contradict his Masses decision. By then, a series of precedents had intervened, often based on Oliver Wendell Holmes's [...] "clear and present danger" [...] test, leaving him less room for maneuver. Hand felt he had [...] "no choice" [...] but to agree that threats against the government {{by a group of}} Communists were illegal under the repressive Smith Act of 1940. In order to do so, he interpreted the [...] "clear and present danger" [...] in a new way. [...] "In each case," [...] he wrote, [...] " [...] must ask whether the gravity of the 'evil', discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger." [...] This formula allowed more scope for curbing free speech in cases where, as the government believed with Communism, the danger was grave, whether it was immediate or not. Critics and disappointed liberals accused Hand of placing his concern for <b>judicial</b> <b>restraint</b> ahead of freedom of speech. Hand confided to a friend that, if it had been up to him, he would [...] "never have prosecuted those birds".|$|E
500|$|Black {{intensely}} {{believed in}} <b>judicial</b> <b>restraint</b> and reserved {{the power of}} making laws to the legislatures, often scolding his more liberal colleagues for {{what he saw as}} judicially created legislation. Conservative justice John M. Harlan II would say of Black: [...] "No Justice has worn his judicial robes with a keener sense of the limitations that go with them." [...] Conservative Judge Robert Bork wrote, [...] "Justice Black came to have significantly more respect for the limits of the Constitution than Justice Douglas and the other leading members of the Warren majorities ever showed." [...] One scholar wrote, [...] "No Justice of the Court conscientiously and persistently endeavored, as much as Justice Black did, to establish consistent standards of objectivity for adjudicating constitutional questions." [...] Black advocated a narrow role of interpretation for justices, opposing a view of justices as social engineers or rewriters of the Constitution. Black opposed enlarging constitutional liberties beyond their literal or historic [...] "plain" [...] meaning, as he saw his more liberal colleagues do.
