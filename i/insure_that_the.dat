5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to <b>insure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E
5|$|To {{minimize}} Soviet opposition, Norway {{attempted to}} move the debate from the political to the specialist scene, {{while at the same}} time establishing a protocol for Norwegian control and operation of the facility. To achieve this, Norwegian authorities worked towards establishing an inspection procedure to <b>insure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> facilities remained solely used for 'peaceful activities'. This would particularly focus on the regular inspection of auxiliary equipment. To depoliticize the issue further, the government appointed the semi-independent NTNF as the operator of the facility. The first oral consultations between the Soviet embassy and the Norwegian government took place in November 1964.|$|E

25|$|The {{first line}} {{protected}} by the guard was the Lod–Haifa line, which suffered the most, although other lines were integrated later, including the valley line. The policemen erected watchtowers and conducted frequent patrols {{in search of the}} guerillas. Two designated armored train cars were built for the guard by the Ford Motor Company, which could move faster than conventional trains, and in both directions. The Railway Guard sometimes took with them prominent Arab leaders on the patrols, in order to <b>insure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> policemen were not harmed by the Arab gangs.|$|E
25|$|Fort Duquesne, {{located at}} the {{confluence}} of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers at the site of present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, guarded the most important strategic location in the west {{at the time of the}} Seven Years' War. It was built to <b>insure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ohio River valley remained under French control. A small colonial force from Virginia began a fort here but a French force under Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur drove them off in April 1754. New France claimed this as part of their colony and the French were anxious to keep the British from encroaching on it. The French built Fort Duquesne here to serve as a military stronghold and as a base for developing trade and strengthening military alliances with the Aboriginal peoples of the area.|$|E
500|$|Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1819) is {{a famous}} {{use of the}} {{certificate}} of division procedure in a civil case. [...] In order to <b>insure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> certificate of division procedure would be available in Dartmouth College, [...] "Story was closely involved from the outset with the litigation."

[...] The Contract Clause question for which Dartmouth College is famous could have been appealed to the Supreme Court even if the case had been brought in the courts of New Hampshire (and it was); but, the [...] "vested rights" [...] argument, which Story and Webster regarded as potentially stronger, was not a matter of federal law and thus could not be appealed by writ of error. In fact, after the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled against the College, in addition to filing an appeal, a new case was filed in the federal circuit court. As Webster {{wrote in a letter to}} another lawyer for the College: ...|$|E

[...] When completed, the Cunard’s ships grew to 1150 GRT but were still 15% smaller than Great Western. [...] The other steamships under construction for Atlantic {{service at the}} time were also bigger than Cunard’s initial units.

Shipowners throughout the South, and perhaps some from the North as well, responded with enthusiasm to the call. [...] The largest privateer, Phenix, was from Wilmington, Delaware. [...] The initial burst of ardor was great enough that the Confederate government could lay down some rather stringent conditions, such as requiring the deposit of large bonds, to <b>insure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> practice did not degenerate into outright piracy. The holders of letters of marque were also required to be the actual owners of the ships; this was to discourage speculation in the letters.|$|E
2500|$|Pure culture yeasts {{that are}} grown {{in a lab}} are often freeze dried and {{packaged}} for commercial use.

Ideally winemakers want to add enough inoculum to have a viable cell population density of 5 million cells per milliliter. The exact amount of freeze-dried culture varies by manufacturer and strain of yeast but it is often around 1gram per gallon (or 25grams per 100 liters). Wines that could have potentially problematic fermentation (such as high sugar level late harvest or botryized wines) may have more yeast added.|$|E
2500|$|Although nonprofit {{hospital}} {{workers were}} covered by the original Wagner Act of 1935, they were excluded in 1947 with the Taft-Hartley amendments. However, during the 1960s, hospital workers at nonprofit hospitals wanted to form unions in order to demand better pay and working conditions. Major American cities were also experiencing hospital strikes which raised awareness of both labor leaders and the government regarding how to continue life-sustaining patient care delivery during work stoppages. Hospital workers and labor leaders petitioned the government to amend the NLRA. In 1974, under President Richard Nixon, the NRLA was amended to extend coverage and protection to employees of non-profit hospitals. “When the new legislation was considered by the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, it was recognized that labor relations {{in the health care}} industry required special considerations. The Senate Labor Committee sought to fashion a mechanism which would <b>insure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> needs of the patient would be met during contingencies arising out of labor disputes. The new law represented a sound and equitable reconciliation of these competing interests.” ...|$|E
