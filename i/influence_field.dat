After receiving his menkyo kaiden, he travelled around many parts of Japan in a form of musha shugyo, learning in the schools of Yoshin-ryū, Takenouchi-ryū, Sekiguchi-ryū, Kito-ryū and Shibukawa-ryū, as well as the armed styles of Yagyū Shinkage-ryū, Hōzōin-ryū, Otsubo-ryū and Yamada-ryū. By adopting the strong points of each style, he created his Fusen-ryū curriculum. After being appointed priest of the Saihoji temple in Kyoto in 1830, he built a dojo in the nearby grounds and started teaching his style. Many martial artists heard his reputation and came to challenge him, but nobody could beat him. It was said Motsugai's students reached the number of 3000. Motsugai died in 1867, after which his school moved its <b>influence</b> <b>field</b> to Okayama.|$|E
5000|$|Though a proud Frenchman, Gobineau {{was fairly}} cosmopolitan, and {{regarded}} {{himself as a}} part of a cultured European elite that transcended national loyalties, a good Frenchman but even more so a [...] "good European"; the aristocratic Gobineau felt more affinity for fellow aristocrats of other nationalities than he did for French commoners. The Czech historian Ivo Budil called Gobineau [...] "...a cosmopolitan thinker who did not feel wholly French" [...] and who was obsessed with ancient Greece and Persia. In 1876, he accompanied his close friend Emperor Pedro II of Brazil on his trip to Russia, Greece and the Ottoman Empire, and introduced Pedro to both Emperor Alexander II of Russia and the Sultan Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire. Gobineau took his friend on a guided tour of Athens, a city that Gobineau called [...] "heaven on earth" [...] due to its ruins. Inspired by his last visit to Greece, Gobineau started writing what became his 1878 book Le Royaume des Hellènes arguing that the achievements of ancient Greece were all due to the Aryans, and that there existed no connection between the ancient Greeks and modern Greeks, as the Aryan blood was all gone. After leaving Pedro in Constantinople, Gobineau traveled to Rome for a private audience with Pope Pius IX. During his visit to Rome, Gobineau met and befriended the German composer Richard Wagner and his wife Cosima Wagner. Wagner was greatly impressed with the Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines and he used his newspaper, the Bayreuther Blätter to popularize Gobineau's racial theories in Germany. Gobineau in his turn was greatly impressed with Wagner's music and, unusually for a Frenchman, Gobineau became a member of the Bayreuth Circle. [...] Wagner was fascinated by Gobineau's racial theories, and much of his writings from 1876 onwards showed Gobineau's <b>influence.</b> <b>Field</b> wrote that [...] "Gobineau's chief work, Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines contained a far more detailed and closely argued explanation for cultural decadence than anything Wagner had written. Indeed, this synthesis of anthropology, theology, linguistics and history was unquestionably the most impressive and ideologically coherent racial analysis produced in the pre-Darwinian era.".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} distributed multi-hypothesis classification {{in the context of}} wireless sensor networks. The goal is to reliably classify an underlying hypothesis at a fusion center using simple localized decisions at individual sensors. The fusion-center classification must be performed despite the presence of faults in both local sensor decisions and transmission channels between the sensors and fusion center. Local sensor nodes make binary classifications based on their noisy observations and send their decisions to the fusion center through parallel additive white Gaussian noise channels. The fusion center then uses these noisy versions of local decisions to perform a global classification. In contrast with other similar approaches for multi-hypothesis classification based on combined binary decisions, our approach exploits the relationship between the influence fields of different hypotheses and the accumulated noisy versions of local binary decisions as received by the fusion center, where the <b>influence</b> <b>field</b> of a hypothesis is defined to be the spatial region in its surrounding in which it can be sensed using some specific modality. The main contribution of this paper is the formulation of local and fusion decision rules that maximize the probability of correct global classification at the fusion center, along with an algorithm for channel-aware global optimization of the local and fusion center decision thresholds. The performance of the proposed classification system is investigated through practical scenarios. Performance analysis results show that the proposed approach could simplify decision making at local sensors while achieving acceptable performance in terms of the global probability of correct classification at the fusion center.

De acordo com os resultados, ambos os setores analisados foram considerados setores-chave com base apenas no índice de Rasmussen-Hirschman e no campo de influência, ou seja, apresentaram maior relevância quando considerados os seus impactos na demanda final e os seus poderes de encadeamento na economia.

This paper has proposed a node importance evaluation approach based on energy field model. The {{idea is that the}} influence transfers and generates feedback constantly in the process of data transmission which creates a field and interaction with related nodes forms a topological <b>influence</b> <b>field</b> over the network. By defining and computing the influence of the nodes with the distance r[*]=[*] 1 and r[*]>[*] 1 with target nodes. After a full consideration of the changes in data transmission and network topology caused by the variation of node amount, our approach can reflect and analyze the variation of node influence in different data reception periods. According to the influence results and contrast analysis in simulation experiments, compared with other methods, it can be easily applied to node classification, and the approach is able to make real-time dynamic evaluation on the node importance. The model presented in this paper is of flexibility which could be applied to some other research fields such as energy management and network survivability in the wireless sensor network in the future works.|$|E
