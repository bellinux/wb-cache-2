5|$|Rhys treats Susan {{when she}} has an MS relapse and he tries {{to make sure she}} is {{prepared}} in case her condition becomes worse. He later looks after Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) when she is brought in with severe morning sickness. Vanessa learns Rhys <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> her with his friends and she tells him to stay out of her business. Rhys later helps Vanessa carry some boxes and he spends the day baking a cake with her. He buys her a new mixer and Vanessa invites him to dinner. Rhys gives the cake to Elaine and when he tells her about Vanessa, she warns him to think about what he is doing before letting it go any further. Rhys thinks about cancelling on Vanessa, but he later arrives with dessert. Rhys asks Vanessa to bid on him at a charity bachelor auction, so he can raise more money than Karl. Vanessa wins and she chooses a couples massage for them to enjoy together. Rhys learns Susan has befriended Elaine and he angrily tells her to stay away from his mother. Vanessa witnesses the scene and becomes cold towards him. Rhys apologises to Susan and opens up to Vanessa about why he did it.|$|E
25|$|Eugenia {{is talking}} and flirting with Robert Acton; {{she says she}} will divorce her husband. She visits Mrs Acton and says a white lie – that her son <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> her a lot – which {{comes across as a}} terrible faux-pas. Later, Mr Wentworth tells Felix that Clifford got {{suspended}} from Harvard owing to his drinking problem, and that he is improperly in love with Lizzie Acton – Felix suggests fixing him up with Eugenia instead. Later still, Gertrude tells him her father wants her to marry Mr Brand, though she doesn't love him. Mr Brand then criticises Felix. Gertrude emotionally blackmails Charlotte into keeping him from talking to her, lest she tell him Charlotte likes him. Clifford then visits Eugenia. Robert Acton goes to the Wentworths' but Eugenia is not in their house; he goes into hers and asks her about the divorce note and going to see the Niagara Falls with him. Clifford comes out of his hiding place; the two men get back together.|$|E
500|$|Carr's {{essay was}} widely {{discussed}} in the media both critically and in passing. While English technology writer Bill Thompson observed that Carr's argument had [...] "succeeded in provoking a wide-ranging debate", Damon Darlin of The New York Times quipped that even though [...] " [...] <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> [...] article in The Atlantic magazine", only [...] "ome subset of that group has actually read the 4,175-word article, by Nicholas Carr." [...] The controversial online responses to Carr's essay were, according to Chicago Tribune critic Steve Johnson, partly {{the outcome of the}} essay's title [...] "Is Google Making Us Stupid?", a question that the article proper doesn't actually pose and that he believed was [...] "perfect fodder for a 'don't-be-ridiculous' blog post"; Johnson challenged his readers to carefully consider their online responses in the interest of raising the quality of debate.|$|E

This was the first time that Singapore had won the event. In the game she played, Wang beat world number one Liu Shiwen. The Southern Daily published in Guangdong criticized Chinese sports authorities for permitting China-born players like Wang, Feng and Li to leave and play for other countries: [...] "For the sake of developing the sport, China <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> 'breeding wolves'. Well, now the wolf has grown up and it has returned home to bite." ...|$|E

6000|$|That night Julius Savine called Geoffrey {{into his}} study, and, {{spreading}} {{a roll of}} plans before him, offered terms, which were gladly accepted, {{for the construction of}} portions of several works. Savine said: [...] "I won't worry much about references. Your work speaks for itself, and the Roads and Trails surveyor <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> you. I'll take you, as you'll have to take me, on trust. I keep my eye on rising young men, and I have been watching you. Besides, the man who could master an obstinate bicycle the first time he wrestled with one must have some sense of his own, and it isn't everybody who would have swallowed that physic." ...|$|E

6000|$|One {{peculiarity}} of {{the genuine}} kind of {{enemy of the}} people is that his slightest phrase is clamorous with all his sins. Pride, vain-glory, and hypocrisy seem present in his very grammar; in his very verbs or adverbs or prepositions, {{as well as in}} what he says, which is generally bad enough. Thus I see that a Nonconformist pastor in Bromley <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the pathetic little presents of tobacco sent to the common soldiers. This is how he talks about it. He is reported as having said, [...] "By the help of God, they wanted this cigarette business stopped." [...] How one could write a volume on that sentence, a great thick volume called [...] "The Decline of the English Middle Class." [...] In taste, in style, in philosophy, in feeling, in political project, the horrors of it are as unfathomable as hell.|$|E
6000|$|... "Frankly {{that is my}} opinion, doctor. I {{own that}} I have no ground {{whatever}} for my disbelief, except that I have naturally studied the man closely. I have watched his lips as he spoke. When he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> these adventures with savages he spoke without effort, and I have no doubt whatever that he did take part in such adventures; {{but when he was}} speaking of India, and especially when at some of the bachelor dinners uncle gave there were officers who had known him out there, {{it was clear to me}} that he did not speak with the same freedom. He weighed his words, as if afraid of making a mistake. I believe that the man was playing a part. His tone was genial and sometimes a little boisterous, as it might well be on the part of a man who had been years away from civilization; but I always thought from his manner that all this was false. I am convinced that he is a double-faced man. When he spoke I observed that he watched in a furtive sort of way the person to whom he was speaking, to see the effect of his words; but, above all, I formed my opinion upon the fact that I am absolutely convinced that this man could never have performed the splendid action of facing a wounded tiger unarmed for the sake of one who was, in fact, but a casual acquaintance." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{there were}} others besides Crocker and Mrs. Vincent, and his mother and Sir Boreas, who were much {{interested}} by George Roden's condition. Mrs. Roden returned home on the 2nd of March, and, as may be remembered, the tidings respecting her son had reached England before she came. By {{the end of the}} month many persons were much exercised as to the young man's future name, and some people of high rank had not only discussed the subject at great length, but had written numerous letters concerning it. It was manifest to Lady Persiflage that no further attempt should now be made to throw obstacles in the way of Lady Frances and her lover. Lady Persiflage had never believed in the obstacles from the first. [...] "Of course they'll marry," [...] she had said to her one daughter, who was now almost as good as married herself, and equally trustworthy. [...] "When a girl is determined like that, of course nothing will stop her. My sister shouldn't have let her meet the young man at first." [...] But this had been said before the young man had turned out to be an Italian Duke. Since the news had come Lady Persiflage had been very eager in recommending her sister to discontinue the opposition. [...] "Make the most of him," [...] she had said in one of her letters. [...] "It is all that can be done now. It is a fine name, and though Italian titles do not count like ours, yet, when they are as good as this, they go for a good deal. There are real records of the Di Crinola family, and there is no manner of doubt but that he is the head of them. Take him by the hand, and have him down at Trafford if Kingsbury is well enough. They tell me he is quite presentable, with a good figure and all that;--by no means a young man who will stand shivering in a room because he doesn't know how to utter a word. Had he been like that Fanny would never have set her heart upon him. Persiflage <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> him, and he says that something will be sure to turn up if he is brought forward properly, and is not ashamed of his family name. Persiflage will do whatever he can, but that can only be if you will open your arms to him." [...] Lady Kingsbury did feel that she was called upon to undergo a terrible revulsion of sentiment. Opening her arms to the Duca di Crinola might be possible to her. But how was she to open her arms to Lady Frances Trafford? The man whom she had seen but once might appear before her with his new title as a young nobleman of whose antecedents she was not bound to remember anything. She might seem to regard him as a new arrival, a noble suitor for her stepdaughter's hand, of whom she had not before heard. But how was she to receive Fanny Trafford, the girl whom she had locked up at Königsgraaf, whose letters she had stopped as they came from the Post Office? Nevertheless she consented,--as far at least as her sister was concerned. [...] "I shall never like Fanny," [...] she had said, [...] "because she is so sly." [...] Girls are always called sly by their friends who want to abuse them. [...] "But of course I will have them both here, as you think it will be best. What they are to live upon Heaven only knows. But of course that will be no concern of mine." ...|$|E
