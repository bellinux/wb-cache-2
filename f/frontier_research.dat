Instead, he became a science student, majoring in mathematics, and received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1937. He later considered this a fortunate turn of events.

40|$|Given the {{challenging}} environmental {{issues in the}} energy sector, the importance of strategic research and development (R&D) planning has been emphasized to manage a turbulent business situation. This study aims to propose a methodology for exploring promising <b>research</b> <b>frontiers</b> in the energy sector. To this end, first, core documents are collected from scientific documents such as patents and academic papers. Second, the <b>research</b> <b>frontiers</b> are extracted by clustering the core documents based on the bibliographic relations. Third, a knowledge map is generated by mapping the relations between <b>research</b> <b>frontiers.</b> Finally, the promising <b>research</b> <b>frontiers</b> (RFs) are identified by conducting dynamic analyses and the contents of promising RFs are suggested. As an illustration of the method, the field of solar cell technology is chosen and analyzed As a result, the promising <b>research</b> <b>frontiers</b> from the patent knowledge map are related to development (D) themes and promising <b>research</b> <b>frontiers</b> from scientific paper knowledge map {{are related to the}} research (R) themes.
