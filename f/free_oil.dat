This was {{condemned}} by various Conservatives claiming that Chávez's democratic socialist government had undermined pluralistic democracy. Livingstone proceeded to accept {{the presidency of the}} pro-Chávez Venezuelan Information Centre. In November 2006, Livingstone travelled to Latin America to visit Chávez, during which he and his entourage stayed in Cuba at a cost of £29,000; many British sources condemned the visit as a waste of tax-payer's money. In August 2007, it was announced that Livingstone had come to an agreement with oil-rich Venezuela; Chávez's government would supply £16 million a year worth of <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> to TfL, who would use it to subsidise half priced bus fares for 250,000 Londoners on benefits. In return, London would provide expertise in running transport, as well as other services such as CCTV and waste management.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{compressed}} air <b>free</b> of entrained <b>oil</b> {{to be used in}} industry. In many cases it can be supplied by oil flooded screw compressors with multi stage filtration systems, or by <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> screw compressors. However, if water injected screw compressors can be made to operate reliably, they could be more efficient and therefore cheaper to operate. Unfortunately, to date, such machines have proved to be insufficiently reliable and not cost effective. This paper describes an investigation carried out to determine the current limitations of water injected screw compressor systems and how these could be overcome in the 15 - 315 kW power range and delivery pressures of 6 - 10 bar. Modern rotor profiles and approach to sealing and cooling allow reasonably inexpensive air end design. The prototype of the water injected screw compressor air system was built and tested for performance and reliability. The water injected compressor system was compared with the oil injected and <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> compressor systems of the equivalent size including the economic analysis based on the lifecycle costs. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that water injected screw compressor systems could be designed to deliver clean air <b>free</b> of <b>oil</b> contamination with a better user value proposition than the oil injected or <b>oil</b> <b>free</b> screw compressor systems over the considered range of operations...|$|R

The Super Globetrotters use their boats {{in order to get}} into Moby Whale. Whaleman plans to use the stolen oil in order to control the world's oil. The Super Globetrotters managed to evade Whaleman and get out of Moby Whale. They follow Moby Whale to an island where Whaleman makes his headquarters and is storing the stolen supertankers. They find Whaleman who has tricked the islanders into giving them <b>free</b> <b>oil</b> and try to convince the islanders that Whaleman is not what he claims to be. The Super Globetrotters end up challenging Whaleman and his crew to a game of jungle basketball (the one score version) for the fate of the stolen oil and to prove that they are the actual Globetrotters. During the basketball game, Whaleman's fifth player is revealed to be Moby Whale. After defeating Whaleman, the islanders know the Globetrotters are the real ones anyway and Whaleman and his crew are arrested by the Navy.|$|E
