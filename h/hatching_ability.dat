40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to gain insight into the influence of spraying and cooling, during artificial incubation, on the embryo metabolic rate and <b>hatching</b> <b>ability</b> of Muscovy duck eggs. Three times a week 93 incubated eggs were sprayed and cooled for 0. 5 h at room temperature. Daily embryo metabolic rate was measured in 30 eggs with a water vapor conductance ranging from 1. 15 to 2. 07 mg/day. kPa. Egg weight ranged from 63. 73 to 84. 52 g; length and breadth ranged from 59. 6 to 66. 4 mm and 43. 2 to 48. 2 mm, respectively. According to observed <b>hatching</b> <b>ability,</b> eggs were classified by three categories: eggs that hatched normally; eggs that were assisted during hatching, and nonhatched eggs. Five ducklings were assisted during hatching. Four ducklings died on Day 31, two on Day 32, and two on Day 34. Two functions were derived by discriminant analysis and accounted for 100 % of the variation among the three categories of <b>hatching</b> <b>ability.</b> Collectively, these functions were able to classify 93. 3 % of the eggs in the correct hatching category. Egg length and metabolic rate at Days 21 and 28 of incubation were the most important predictor variables of the two functions.

40|$|ParasitologySwimmer’s itch {{is caused}} by nonhuman schistosomes, {{including}} Trichobilharzia stagnicolae, which have complex indirect life cycles. Miracidia are a free living life cycle stage of these schistosomes that are transmitted from either an avian or mammalian host to a specific snail intermediate, depending on the species. The goals {{of this study are}} to determine the life span of the miracidia of T. stagnicolae in various solutions and to examine the effect of desiccation on the <b>hatching</b> <b>ability</b> of miracidia. Miracidia were hatched and placed in dishes of five different solutions (filtered lake water, well water, distilled water, distilled water with sucrose and avian ringers) to determine their life span. Samples of host fecal material were dried and miracidia were hatched from these samples to test the effects of desiccation. Longevity of miracidia was greatest in filtered lake water and distilled water. <b>Hatching</b> <b>ability</b> decreased with the amount of water evaporated from the fecal samples (p = 4. 03 x 10 - 10).

40|$|Potato cyst {{nematodes}} (PCN), Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida, are economically important pests {{of potato}} (Solanum tuberosum) crops in potato growing regions worldwide. Integrated management is under threat, with effective nematicides increasingly being withdrawn on environmental and health grounds. Alternative strategies are urgently needed and trap cropping {{could be one}} of them. The non-tuber-bearing Solanum sisymbriifolium is regarded as an effective trap crop for PCN with strong <b>hatching</b> <b>ability</b> and immunity to PCN infection and has been used in the UK and The Netherlands. However, its mode of action is unknown. In order to shed light on the mode of action so that a novel control strategy could be identified, the interactions between G. pallida and S. sisymbriifolium were investigated using in vitro bioassays. In choice assays, G. pallida J 2 s were equally attracted to the roots of S. sisymbriifolium and to those of S. tuberosum. However, potato root diffusate (PRD), which is routinely used to induce PCN hatch, failed to attract G. pallida J 2 s in chemotaxis bioassays, indicating hatching factors (HFs) and soluble compounds present in PRD are not involved in attraction of G. pallida J 2 s to potato roots. The J 2 s invaded the roots of S. sisymbriifolium in large numbers but failed to develop further. To facilitate continuous observation of nematode development, a novel in vitro method was devised with the use of Pluronic F- 127, which requires no sterilisation, and the life cycle of G. pallida was successfully observed in S. tuberosum roots. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses of defence related genes of S. tuberosum and S. sisymbriifolium infected with G. pallida revealed up-regulation of the chitinase gene (ChtC 2. 1) at 3 days post inoculation in S. sisymbriifolium but not in S. tuberosum. Electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry analyses of root exudate extracts of the two Solanum species and subsequent bioassay-guided fractionation showed that the HF of S. sisymbriifolium differs from that of S. tuberosum. Previously, attention had been solely paid to the <b>hatching</b> <b>ability</b> of the root exudate of S. sisymbriifolium, but this study revealed {{for the first time that}} the aerial part extract possesses a significant <b>hatching</b> <b>ability.</b> The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), Branston Lt...|$|E

40|$|The potato cyst {{nematode}} Globodera rostochiensis is an important pest of potato (Solanum tuberosum). Pseudomonas fluorescens F 113, which produces 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), was investigated as a potential biocontrol agent against G. rostochiensis. Exposure of nematode cysts to the pseudomonad, under in vitro conditions or in soil microcosms, almost doubled {{the ability of the}} eggs to hatch. The percentage of mobile juveniles was reduced threefold following their incubation {{in the presence of the}} pseudomonad, both in vitro and in soil.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{bacterial}} strains {{on the growth}} rate of rotifers, Brachionus plicatilis, was determined under monoxenic conditions. The first objective was to obtain sterile rotifer cultures starting from rotifer resting eggs using merthiolate or glutaraldehyde as disinfectant. Sterile rotifer cultures were obtained, without affecting the <b>hatching</b> <b>ability</b> of the resting eggs, when 0. 05 µl/l glutaraldehyde was used. This disinfection procedure was used to examine the effect of 20 bacterial strains, isolated from well-performing live-feed production systems, on the population growth rate of rotifers cultured under monoxenic conditions. Five out of the 20 bacterial strains tested were able to improve significantly the asexual reproduction of rotifers. The population growth rate (µ pop) of rotifer cultures treated with GR 12 and GR 11 (respectively 0. 664 ± 0. 043 and 0. 622 ± 0. 062) was significantly higher than the µ pop of the control treatment (0. 512 ± 0. 101). Overall, the egg ratio after 48 h was significantly higher in the cultures inoculated with the bacterial strains than in the axenic control treatment.

Materials and Methods: Bovine presumptive zygotes were cultured in Ménézo's B 2 (B 2) plusvero-cells or sequential synthetic oviductal fluid (SOF) for eight days. Subsequently, half of theexpanded blastocysts developed in both groups were vitrified, warmed within 30 minutes and postwarmingembryos along with their corresponding non-vitrified embryos were cultured for twoadditional days in the same medium used before vitrification. Embryo development, cryosurvivaland apoptosis were compared between the groups. Results: For non-vitrified embryos, culture in SOF significantly promoted the potency of embryosto develop into blastocysts compared with the co-culture system. The difference in post vitrificationsurvival rate of SOF blastocysts (83. 3 %) was insignificant compared with co-culture (84. 3 %). However, while total cell number of warmed blastocysts in the co-culture system was significantlyhigher in the co-culture versus the sequential system (215. 4 vs. 170. 4), the quality of survived embryosin terms of <b>hatching</b> <b>ability</b> and apoptosis was adversely affected by co-culture compared with SOF(65. 0 % vs. 74. 3 %, and 13. 5 % vs. 10. 0 %, respectively; p< 0. 05).

40|$|In avian species, {{spermatozoa}} {{reside in}} the oviduct for prolonged periods in specialized structures known as sperm storage tubules, but {{little is known about}} the relative distribution of spermatozoa in these tubules after successive inseminations by different males. The staining efficacies of various fluorescent dyes for fowl and turkey spermatozoa were evaluated to investigate one proposed mechanism of sperm competition. Hens were then inseminated at different intervals with stained and unstained spermatozoa to observe the spatial distribution of spermatozoa within the storage tubules. Several novel fluorescent lipophilic tracers that successfully stain mammalian spermatozoa either did not stain fowl or turkey spermatozoa, or greatly impaired sperm motility. In contrast, Hoechst 33342 readily stained sperm nuclei (fowl: 25 nmol l– 1; turkey: 77 nmol l– 1) within 4 h without inhibiting sperm motility, or affecting fertility or the <b>hatching</b> <b>ability</b> of the eggs. Hens were tandemly inseminated with equal numbers of stained or unstained spermatozoa at 24 h intervals and were killed 24 h after the final insemination to study sperm entry and storage within the tubules. Oviductal mucosa containing sperm storage tubules was removed, and individual tubules were classified as containing stained spermatozoa, unstained spermatozoa, a mixture of stained and unstained spermatozoa, or as not containing spermatozoa. Results from the present study indicate that spermatozoa from two different inseminations generally segregate into different storage tubules in both fowl and turkey hens. Storage tubules containing mixed populations of spermatozoa were found in only 4 % of fowl and 12 % of turkey storage tubules examined.

We investigated the anti-schistosome efficacy of polypyridylruthenium(II) complexes and showed they were active against all intra-mammalian stages of S. mansoni. Two compounds, Rubb 12 -tri and Rubb 7 -tnl, which were among the most potent in their ability to kill schistosomula and adult worms and inhibit egg hatching in vitro, were assessed for their efficacy in a mouse model of schistosomiasis using 5 consecutive daily i. v. doses of 2 mg/kg (Rubb 12 -tri) and 10 mg/kg (Rubb 7 -tnl). Mice treated with Rubb 12 -tri showed an average 42 % reduction (P = 0. 009), over two independent trials, in adult worm burden. Liver egg burdens were not significantly decreased in either drug-treated group but ova from both of these groups showed significant decreases in <b>hatching</b> <b>ability</b> (Rubb 12 -tri- 68 %, Rubb 7 -tnl- 56 %) and were significantly morphologically altered (Rubb 12 -tri- 62 % abnormal, Rubb 7 -tnl- 35 % abnormal). We hypothesize that the drugs exerted their activity, at least partially, through inhibition of both neuronal and tegumental acetylcholinesterases (AChEs), as worms treated in vitro showed significant decreases in activity of these enzymes. Further, treated parasites exhibited a significantly decreased ability to uptake glucose, significantly depleted glycogen stores and withered tubercules (a site of glycogen storage), implying drug-mediated interference in this nutrient acquisition pathway. Our data provide compelling evidence that ruthenium complexes are effective against all intra-mammalian stages of schistosomes, including schistosomula (refractory to PZQ) and eggs (agents of disease transmissibility). Further, {{the results of this study}} suggest that schistosome AChE is a target of ruthenium drugs, a finding that can inform modification of current compounds to identify analogues which are even more effective and selective against schistosomes...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{arecoline}} hydrobromide {{was used for}} the first time to study whether its exposure was associated with toxic effects using D. melanogaster as a model. It has been reported that about 75 % of human disease-causing genes have functional homology in D. melanogaster, and therefore, it is being used as a model for toxicological studies (Rand, 2010). Further, we also investigated the effect of arecoline hydrobromide on pupation and emergence of flies. A significant dose-dependent increase in the duration of pupation was observed at 20, 40 and 80  μM of arecoline and lower doses fail to express any dose-dependent increase in the duration of pupation. This delay in the pupation of larvae at higher doses may be due to the activation of some drug metabolising enzymes (Pai, 1983; Podder & Roy, 2015). Similarly, the emergence of the flies was also significantly delayed in a dose-dependent manner compared to the control flies. Similar results have been obtained by the treatments of cryolite and fluorinated insecticide (Podder & Roy, 2015. Gupta, Siddique, Saxena, & Chowdhuri, 2005). The delay in the emergence of flies is possible due to the activation of enzymes involved in the detoxification of the drug during the pupation. Besides these effects, arecoline has also been shown to induce various kinds of genetic damages, such as chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchange, DNA breaks and DNA protein cross-links on different target cells (Jeng, Chang, & Hahn, 2001). Arecoline also exhibits cytotoxicity and inhibits the growth of oral fibroblasts and keratinocytes (Chang et al., 1998; Tseng et al., 2012). The eyes of emerged flies were also analysed for the phenotypic abnormalities. Clear dose-dependent deformities were observed in the flies emerged from the exposure of larvae to 20, 40 and 80  μM of arecoline. The flies showed the loss of hexagonal texture in a dose-dependent manner, bristles were also lost and the ommatidia were of round shape. The studies on insecticides and pesticides have revealed well-defined effects on the life cycle, <b>hatching</b> <b>ability</b> and the emergence of D. melanogaster (Gupta et al., 2005; Podder & Roy, 2015). The exposure of arecoline not only increased the duration of pupation but also delayed the emergence of flies. It also decreased the life span of flies exposed to 20, 40 and 80  μM of arecoline in a dose-dependent manner.|$|E

40|$|Musca domestica Linnaeus, 1758, a {{relevant}} synanthropous pest, {{is the most}} frequent dipteran species in animal farms and waste landfills. Fly infestations cause heavy economic losses and often lawsuits against cattle or poultry farms near residential areas. For control of pest arthropods, including M. domestica, since 1940 neurotoxic adulticides with very low selectivity and high environmental impact were employed regardless of their toxicity to vertebrates, bioaccumulation and development of resistance. A more recent insecticide class, the Insect Growth Regulators (IGR), has species-specific toxicity and low health and environmental impact. The IGR activity is mostly exerted on larval stages {{but some of them}} also induce sterility in adults. The aim of this doctoral thesis is to investigate on a sensitive strain of M. domestica the effects of diofenolan, an IGR analogue of juvenile hormone, unregistered for control of this species in Italy. The toxicity of diofenolan on immature stages was evaluated by topical treatments on 3 rd instar larvae at different concentrations, verifying the main toxicological parameters and monitoring morphological effects of the active ingredient by optical and scanning electron (SEM) microscopy. The effects of diofenolan were also investigated on female reproductive ability (egg laying and hatching) by suitable tests along the gonotrophic cycles, monitoring ovarian and ovariole alterations by optical and transmission electron (TEM) microscopy. The interactions between diofenolan and ecdysteroids, produced by ovariole follicle cells in adult females and involved in the ovarian cycle, were also investigated by enzymatic immunoassay (EIA). The interactions between diofenolan and the activity of corpora allata, endocrine gland producing juvenile hormone required for ovarian development, were also tested by morphological and ultrastructural investigations. The results showed a dose-dependent toxicity of diofenolan against M. domestica, mainly affecting pupae by inducing larviform puparia and apparently normal ones with altered respiratory plates, together with puparium-trapped adults. Tests on reproductive ability according to the gonotrophic cycle showed that treated females were able to lay eggs only in the first cycle and that <b>hatching</b> <b>ability</b> reduced to 24 % along the gonotrophic cycles. In the second gonotrophic cycle the reproductive ability was 1 / 6 of the initial one and in the third cycle lowered to 1 / 16 of the initial one. The results show that diofenolan is very efficient in affecting the reproductive ability (egg laying and hatching) in M. domestica. The morphological investigations on ovarioles at different time intervals since emerging from puparium showed nine morphotypes which could be arranged into three “transformation paths”: a “precocious degenerative” path involving the primary follicle and associated to secondary follicle hypertrophy, an “intermediate degenerative” path involving the secondary follicle, and a “degenerative/hypertrophic” path in which the secondary follicle may degenerate or increase its size by hypertrophy. The most frequent path is the “intermediate degenerative” one and these data agree with the previous ones obtained on M. domestica reproductive ability. The ecdysteroid content measured by EIA in M. domestica females treated at different time intervals shows a modified profile in comparison to controls, closely related to the degenerative events detected in ovariole follicles. In adult insects corpora allata are known to exhibit periodical activation/inactivation phases related to the ovarian cycle. The effects of diofenolan on corpora allata, investigated and confirmed {{for the first time at}} the ultrastructural level in M. domestica adults, together with original data on cell number and volume of the gland, show in treated females widespread alterations of nucleus, cytoplasm and mitochondria which strongly suggest that the gland undergoes a rapid transition from an inactive stage to a degenerative one. This study also shows the presence within the gland of light and dark cells, never previously identified in morphological and ultrastructural investigations of corpora allata in M. domestica. In conclusion, the main effects of the juvenile hormone analogue diofenolan in this species include inhibition of emerging from puparium and abatement of the reproductive ability in terms of egg laying and hatching, probably related to anomalous ecdysteroid profiles and marked alterations in corpora allata. Further investigations may involve the effects of diofenolan on other stages of the biological cycle and on male reproductive ability. The biocide and sterilizing effects of diofenolan in M. domestica are very interesting for integrated pest management programs since the multiple activity of this active ingredient may significantly reduce the need for adulticides with higher environmental and health impact. It is therefore recommended to extend studies on this IGR in M. domestica by appropriate field trials...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. (Zoology) Pans are endorheic wetlands, and are {{abundant}} in South Africa {{in a band}} from the western Free State into Mpumalanga. The pan environment experiences daily and seasonal fluctuations in physico-chemical conditions. The physico-chemical variables {{are influenced by the}} local climatological and hydrological conditions, and are all inter-related. An imbalance of one variable can have countless effects on the others. The physico-chemical composition of the water ultimately determines the existence of the biota in such wetlands. Branchiopod crustaceans are a unique group of fauna which have various morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations which enable them to survive in these variable environments. One such adaptation is the production of dormant egg banks. These eggs reside within the sediment through the dry phase and hatch during a following wet phase when conditions are favourable. Due to the endorheic nature of pans they are more vulnerable to anthropogenic stress. Anthropogenic activities are having profound effects on the integrity of these ecosystems. Agricultural and mining activities have some of the largest influences. The impacts that the following activities have include: the over utilisation of water, decreased periods of inundation, erosion and sedimentation, effluent discharge and direct habitat destruction. Many wetlands as a result are experiencing a rapid loss in biodiversity. Mining activities are on the increase especially in the Highveld region of southern Africa. Many of these wetlands are already (and will be in the future) affected by mining activities, making the effect of acid mine drainage (AMD) on the biota a priority concern. In conjunction with the uniqueness and vulnerability of pan ecosystems it is necessary to find new ways of monitoring such environmental impacts in the shortest time possible with minimal efforts, for the benefit of both the environment and researchers involved. This study therefore aimed to assess the diversity of branchiopod crustaceans hatching from egg banks of selected pans and obtain a reference community structure. It also aimed to assess the impacts AMD could have on the hatching success of branchiopods from these egg banks with the objective to determine whether these egg banks are still viable after exposure. To achieve the stated aims and objectives, sediment samples were collected from selected pans in mining regions of the country. Regions selected included Chrissiesmeer in the Mpumalanga province, Wesselsbron in the Free State province and Delareyville in the North West province. The sediment was used for hatching experiments in the laboratory. Pan sediment was exposed to three different treatments which included two salt solutions (1000 mg/l and 1500 mg/l respectively) and AMD. The salt solutions served as controls while the AMD served as an exposure. The number of nauplii hatching was counted in the controls and compared to the number of nauplii hatching in the AMD. The diversity of nauplii was also assessed and compared between controls and the AMD. The recovery potential of eggs exposed to AMD was also assessed by exposing the sediment treated with AMD to distilled water after its removal to get a better understanding on the effects of AMD at the community level. Results from the control treatments indicated that most pans have a range of taxa hatching that follow patterns of pan succession. Between the 1000 mg/l and 1500 mg/l controls there was no treatment that proved superior to the other. Representatives of all four orders of branchiopoda hatched from the experiments. The North West and Free State pans were the most diverse and had had the greatest abundances of individuals hatching. Spatially all three provinces differed in the diversity of individuals hatching from pans, as there were distinct differences in the taxonomic compositions. Although taxonomic composition of pans grouped together per province, pans from just a single province were largely dissimilar. Results from the AMD treatments indicated that AMD has a negative effect on the <b>hatching</b> <b>ability</b> of branchiopod crustacean eggs. Eggs that were initially exposed to AMD were unable to hatch in its presence. The recovery experiments indicated that recovery after exposure is limited as recovery only occurred in a few pans. The taxonomic composition of nauplii in the pans where recovery took place was altered and less diverse than the taxonomic composition found in the respective control treatments. Overall it was found that hatching experiments {{can be used as a}} monitoring tool in lieu of field sampling. Hatching experiments showed that AMD is detrimental to the branchiopod egg banks, inhibiting the ability of eggs to hatch in its presence. Recovery can take place but the recovery potential is low. Since the recovery potential of the egg banks is low, pans which are affected by AMD could experience extinction of the entire branchiopod community in years to come. As branchiopod communities are unique among pans, and serve as an important food source for many aquatic bird species, their extinction will bring about further losses in biodiversity...|$|E

50|$|The larvae live in {{the streams}} {{mentioned}} before and are mainly dependent on the water plants. The larvae need the stems and leaves, especially in areas with stronger currents to hold on. Hence it is extremely rare to find them in barren locations, flat expiring banks, or areas with a smooth stone floor. They also live in small natural lakes or ponds characteristic for limestones bedrock. They live in quieter areas between alluvial leaves or on exposed roots of the vegetation. They {{can be found on}} submerged plants such as waterweed (Elodea sp.), floods for water crowfoot (Ranunculus fluitans) or other plants, submerged from a few centimetres to several decimetres.Compared with the larvae of the banded demoiselle the larvae of the blue-wing demoiselle prefer quieter areas of the water, since slower flow causes a more effective absorption of oxygen under water. Only in very rare cases the larvae are present in stagnant water. The substrate of the river has only a very minor importance, because the larvae reside mainly in the vegetation.An important factor for the occurrence of blue-wing demoiselles is the oxygen in the water. The larvae is much more sensitive to oxygen deficiency than the larvae of the banded demoiselle, hence it needs a sufficient oxygen saturation of the water. Waters with high levels of sediment and sludge, which is consumed by bacterial decomposition of oxygen are, accordingly not as a habitat for the larvae. This sensitivity qualifies it in water chemistry as a bioindicator for the assessment of water quality. Thus they will be an indication of value in the saprobic assigned of 1.9, which represents a low to moderately polluted waters type (β-mesosaprob) and a water quality class from I to II does.Another key factor for the occurrence of the larvae of the blue-wing demoiselle is the temperature of the water. This species prefers unlike the banded demoiselle, mainly the cooler and shadier areas of the water. The optimal temperature is a summer average 13 to 18 °C. At temperatures above 22 °C were often injuries of larvae observed and also a reduced <b>hatch</b> <b>ability</b> of eggs. The main reason is the oxygen content under higher temperatures. Individual populations may get used to permanently higher temperatures.|$|R

50|$|Juveniles often {{reside in}} coastal feeding grounds {{as is the}} case with green sea turtles and loggerheads. Adult sea turtles can be divided into 3 {{categories}} according to their movements. Leatherbacks and olive ridley turtles roam widely and unpredictably before returning to specific breeding sites. Satellite tracking of leatherbacks showed however that they tended to stay within relatively food-rich areas of the ocean during their migration. Kemp's ridley sea turtles, loggerheads and flatback sea turtles migrate between breeding areas and a series of coastal foraging areas. Green sea turtles and hawksbill sea turtles shuttle between fixed foraging and nesting sites. Both species of ridley sea turtle nest in large aggregations, a phenomenon called an arribada. It is thought to be an adaptation against predators — there are simply too many eggs for the predators to consume. One unifying aspect of sea turtle migrations is their ability to return to specific nesting sites over vast areas of ocean year after year. They may return to the beach where they <b>hatched,</b> an <b>ability</b> called natal philopatry and this has been demonstrated in green turtles using mitochondrial DNA analysis.|$|R

Both species can be distinguished using features of the morphology of their resting eggs and of the male antennae. A kev to the species is also provided. Egg morphology and male antennal morphology appear to be consistent taxonomic criteria for the proposed subgenus. The presence of taxon-related differences in egg morphology raises the question whether or not differently shaped eggs confer any selective advantage. We suggest that selective pressure {{on the amount of}} energy allocated to reproduction has resulted in the fact that eggs share a combination of characteristics (<b>hatching</b> response, dispersal <b>ability,</b> drought, and mechanical resistance), which allows them to endure a specific set of environmental conditions. status: publishe...|$|R

Avian {{model in}} developmental physiology- Page 3 The avian embryo {{has a long}} history of use as a model system for the study of morphological and physiological development. Properties of avian eggs that make them good developmental models include the large range of functional maturity at <b>hatching</b> and the <b>ability</b> to easily manipulate the environment in which the egg is incubating. The chicken embryo develops over a 20 day incubation period. During the first 19 days of incubation, the embryo relies on the chorioallantoic membrane for gas exchange. The embryo begins the hatching process on day 19 which involves internal pipping, external pipping, and finally hatching. Our lab uses the chicken embryo to study the development of the cardiovascular system, specifically the ductus arteriosi. The ductus arteriosi are a pair of blood vessels in the avian embryo which allow blood to bypass the non-ventilated lungs. Upon initiation of lung ventilation these blood vessels must close. Closure appears to be stimulated by increased oxygen in the blood due to increased lung ventilation during external pipping. The properties of the avian model syste...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSkeletal {{muscles in}} {{developing}} chick embryos were tested for responsiveness to adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP), a substance known to depolarize chick skeletal muscle in culture. The sensitivity to extracellular ATP was tested {{at various stages}} of development in five different muscles; pectoralis superficia, anterior latissimus dorsi, posterior latissimus dorsi, sartorious, and gastrocnemius. At the earliest time that muscles were tested (Embryonic Day 6, stage 30 of Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951) application of ATP (50 – 100 μM) elicited vigorous contractions in all five muscles, but {{within a few days}} (Embryonic Day 17, stage 43) none of the muscles contracted in response to ATP. Sensitivity declined at approximately the same time in all five of these muscles. Intracellular recordings made from muscle fibers near the time of hatching (Embryonic Days 18 – 21 or Postnatal Days 1 – 2) indicated that the loss of the ability to contract in response to ATP was due to the total loss of responsiveness to ATP. Surgical denervation of the anterior latissimus dorsi and posterior latissimus dorsi was performed in a series of chicks 1 – 2 days after <b>hatching,</b> and the <b>ability</b> of these muscles to contract in response to ATP was tested 3 – 10 days after the surgery. Contractions in response to ATP were present in many of the muscles. Thus denervation of muscles in newly hatched chicks led to the reappearance of sensitivity to ATP. The disappearance of ATP responsiveness shortly after muscles become innervated and the reappearance of ATP responsiveness following denervation suggest that the expression of ATP responsiveness is regulated by motor neurons...|$|R

Egg shell temperatures during incubation were consistently recorded. Parsimonious models were developed across eight studies using stepwise multiple linear regression of egg shell temperatures over 3 -day periods and both bone ash at hatch and Latency-To-Lie. A model for bone ash at hatch explained 70 % {{of the variation in}} this factor and revealed an association with lower egg shell temperatures during days 4 - 6 and 13 - 15 and higher egg shell temperatures during days 16 - 18 of incubation. Bone ash at hatch and subsequent Latency-To-Lie were positively correlated (r =  0. 57, P< 0. 05). A model described 66 % of the variation Latency-To-Lie showing significant association of the interaction of femoral ash at hatch and lower average egg shell temperatures over the first 15 days of incubation. Lower egg shell temperature in the early to mid incubation process (days 1 - 15) and higher egg shell temperatures at a later stage (days 16 - 18) will both tend to delay the hatch time of incubating eggs. Incubation profiles that resulted in later hatching chicks produced birds which could remain standing for a longer time at 6 weeks of age. This supports a contention that the effects of incubation observed in many studies may in fact relate more to earlier hatching and longer sojourn of the hatched chick in the final stage incubator. The implication of these outcomes are that the optimum egg shell temperature during incubation for broiler leg strength development may be lower than that regarded as ideal (37. 8 °C) for maximum hatchability and chick growth...|$|R

Larvae of the clownfish Amphiprion ocellaris and the evasive copepod prey Parvocalanus crassirostris {{were used}} as a model system {{for the study of}} larval reef fish predatory {{behavior}} during the planktonic larval phase. Little is known about the feeding behavior of coral reef fish larvae during this critical phase. The use of a model larval reef fish predator and natural prey allowed for the investigation of feeding behaviors such as prey selectivity and capture success from hatching to settling. Filming techniques were used to examine larval fish predatory behavior when presented with multiple copepod lifestages in mixed and single prey-type assemblages. A. ocellaris growth characteristics were measured and compared to prey size. A. ocellaris predatory ability improved with age. Larvae <b>hatched</b> with the <b>ability</b> to capture P. crassirostris nauplii, but not copepodites. Capture of copepodites occurred on day 3 post-hatch with an initial success rate of 22 %. Capture of adult copepods was first observed on day 8 post-hatch, with an initial success of 4 %. Early in development, A. ocellaris exhibited preference for nauplii (Manly-Chesson index value of 0. 68 at day 1 post-hatch) and avoidance of adults (Manly-Chesson index value of 0. 05 at day 1 post-hatch). Selectivity between nauplii and adults decreased as fish larvae aged and A. ocellaris aged 10 - 14 days post-hatch demonstrated no selectivity for any prey type. The common assumption that larval fish mouth gape size relative to prey size is a good predictor for prey preference was not supported. A. ocellaris mouth gape measurements relative to prey size measurements would have predicted consumption of all P. crassirostris life-stages by day 2 post-hatch.
