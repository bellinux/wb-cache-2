40|$|Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG’s) now control {{two-thirds of}} the NHS budget for England, {{influencing}} healthcare provider priorities and playing {{a key role in}} implementing the NHS plan. However significant failures in healthcare has highlighted a dissonance between expressed values of leaders and everyday routine practices. This research aims to explore the leadership behaviour of Commissioners and the role it plays in determining Quality & Safety (Q&S) in healthcare. The research took a pragmatic mixed method approach using two phases: phase 1 used focused video ethnography to observe Commissioners (n= 9) verbal and non-verbal communication in an open forum setting. The research method further develops the process to observe real time group dynamics and may aid decision making processes for leaders in healthcare. Phase 2 employed a quantitative questionnaire (n= 48) to determine the leadership behaviours that subordinates would expect their Commissioners to adopt. The findings of this research identified that the leadership style most prevalent within the Commissioners was transactional in nature. The Commissioners <b>felt</b> <b>joint</b> ownership of the risks to patients from providers of healthcare services, with empathy and understanding of the pressure their colleagues were under. The most prevalent behaviour within the group determined outcomes of risk analysis. The questionnaire to subordinates of Commissioners identified that transformational leadership had the best outcome on staff performance if this was linked to positive leadership style. In addition Commissioners appeared to lack consistency when analysing risks effectively and therefore holding providers to account, citing issues such as “professional drift” and concerns over further scrutiny, as validation for this approach. This confusion of leadership behaviours, allied with poor analysis of risk leaves Commissioners prone to repeating previous healthcare failures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Effects {{of carbon}} fiber on {{strength}} were {{studied in the}} carbon fiber reinforced Cu- 33 at%Al alloy-joint device of aluminum to copper. Although chemical reactions induced the strong bonding of interface, they decayed the strength of fine fibers, resulting in occurrence of the welding brittleness. To enhance the fracture resistance, the carbon fiber reinforced metal (CFRM) joint device was successfully developed by using a duplex-coated carbon fiber <b>felt.</b> The high <b>joint</b> strength was obtained. The carbon fiber acted as a deformation resistance by fiber-reinforced mechanics. Static and dynamic frictions at the joint interface probably prevented the pullout of fibers from matrix. Introduction. Airplanes and racing cars are dream worthy mover machines. In order to save their energy and to enhance their mobility, strengthening and their reliability of fiber-reinforced metals (FRM) have been useful tools.

40|$|Objectives: Research {{suggests}} that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{can have a}} negative psychosocial impact on partners, as well as patients. However, until now there has been very little in-depth qualitative research in this area. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the experiences of partners of people with RA. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a heterogeneous sample of eight partners of people with RA (six men, two women, age range 48 – 73 years). Transcripts were analysed thematically. Results: Five overarching themes emerged: psychological burden in partners was substantial, as they experienced frustration and distress at watching their partner suffer and tried to protect their spouse from emotional and physical distress. ‘It’s a restricted life’: partners reported having to cut back on previously enjoyable shared activities and had diffi culty making future plans. Adjusting lives: partners had to make considerable adjustments to many aspects of their lives, and had adopted practical and psychological ways to cope. ‘It’s a joint approach’: many partners discussed adopting a joint approach to managing the RA. Met and unmet support needs varied considerably, and many partners <b>felt</b> that a <b>joint</b> approach to treatment taken by health professionals is needed, which involves and recognizes their role. Conclusions: Partners of people with RA are vital to the patients’ disease management, but the data show that many carry a substantial psychosocial burden. Healthcare professionals should be aware of this, so that couples coping with RA can be better supported...|$|R
40|$|The {{sense of}} agency {{refers to the}} feeling of {{generating}} and controlling actions and their effects. Philosophers have proposed that when people coordinate their actions with others they may experience a sense of joint agency, or shared control over actions and their effects. However, little empirical work has investigated the sense of joint agency. Therefore, {{the primary goal of}} the present research was to directly examine people’s experiences of joint agency. In a series of experiments, we manipulated factors hypothesized to influence joint agency, and employed rating scales that asked participants specifically about their experience of joint agency. In Experiment 1, pairs of people coordinated their actions to produce tone sequences and then rated their sense of joint agency on a scale ranging from shared to independent control. People felt more shared than independent control overall, confirming that people experience joint agency during joint action. Furthermore, people <b>felt</b> stronger <b>joint</b> agency when they: a) produced sequences that required mutual coordination compared to sequences in which only one partner had to coordinate with the other, and b) held the role of follower compared to leader. Because joint agency is thought to include not only a sense of shared control over a continuous action, but also a sense of shared responsibility for action outcomes, in Experiment 2 we examined whether the same factors would influence people’s sense of shared responsibility for joint action outcomes. Participants rated their responsibility on a scale with endpoints indicating they were responsible (self-responsibility) or their partner was responsible (other-responsibility), and a midpoint indicating they both were responsible (shared responsibility). People felt more shared responsibility for correct outcomes and more self-responsibility for incorrect outcomes, regardless of the type of coordination or role they held within the joint action. Finally, in Experiment 3 we examined whether the predictability of a partner’s actions influenced the sense of shared control. Each participant coordinated with two confederate partners, the timing of whose actions was manipulated so that one partner’s actions were highly predictable in time and the other’s less predictable. People felt more shared control when they coordinated with the more predictable partner, even after controlling for joint performance accuracy and variability of the participant’s action timing. The results from these three experiments indicate that the sense of joint control is driven by people’s predictions about their partner’s actions, whereas joint responsibility is more strongly influenced by outcome valence. These finding have implications for theories of joint agency as well as our understanding of self-agency and everyday joint action...|$|R
40|$|The {{off-highway}} {{sector is}} under increasing pressure to reduce operating costs (including fuel costs) {{and to reduce}} emissions. Recognizing this, the Society of Automotive Engineers and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) convened a workshop in April 2001 (ANL 2001) to (1) determine {{the interest of the}} off-highway sector (consisting of agriculture, construction, surface mining, inland marine) in crafting a shared vision of off-highway, heavy machines of the future and (2) identify critical research and development (R&D) needs for minimizing off-highway vehicle emissions while cost-effectively maintaining or enhancing system performance. The workshop also enabled government and industry participants to exchange information. During the workshop, {{it became clear that the}} challenges facing the heavy, surface-based off-highway sector can be addressed in three major machine categories: (1) engine/aftertreatment and fuels/lubes, (2) machine systems, and (3) thermal management. Working groups convened to address these topical areas. The status of off-highway technologies was determined, critical technical barriers to achieving future emission standards were identified, and strategies and technologies for reducing fuel consumption were discussed. Priority areas for R&D were identified. Given the apparent success of the discussions at the workshop, several participants from industry agreed to help in the formation of a joint industry/government ''roadmap'' team. The U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies has an extensive role in researching ways to make heavy-duty trucks and trains more efficient, with respect to both fuel usage and air emissions.

With industry expertise, in-kind contributions, and federal government funding (coupled with the resources at the DOE's national laboratories), an effective program can be planned and executed. This document outlines potential technology R&D pathways to greatly reduce emissions from the off-highway sector and yet greatly reduce fuel costs cost-effectively and safely. The status of technology, technical targets, barriers, and technical approaches toward R&D are presented. Program schedule and milestones are included...|$|R

Task 3 (Design and Fabricate Ratcheting Stainless-Steel Repair Sleeves) has progressed to installing prototype sleeves in test cast-iron pipe segments. Efforts in the current quarter continued {{to be focused on}} Tasks 4 - 8. Highly valuable lessons were learned from field tests of the 4 -inch gas pipe repair robot in cast-iron pipe at Public Service Electric & Gas. (These field tests were conducted and reported previously.) Several design issues were identified which need to be implemented in both the small- and large-diameter repair robots for cast-iron pipe to assure their commercial success. For Task 4 (Design, Fabricate and Test Patch Setting Robotic Train), previous problems with bladder design and elastomeric material expansion in the large mains were addressed. A new bladder based on a commercially available design was obtained and tested with success. Minor improvements were highlighted during patch-setting tests and are now being pursued. For Task 5 (Design and Fabricate Pipe-Wall Cleaning Robot Train with Pan/Zoom/Tilt Camera), the previous field tests showed clearly that, in mains with low gas velocities, {{it will be necessary to}} improve the system's capacity to remove debris from the immediate vicinity of the bell and spigot joints. Otherwise, material removed by the cleaning flails (the flails were found to be very effective in cleaning bell and spigot joints) falls directly to the low side of the pipe and accumulates in a pile. This accumulation can prevent the sleeve from achieving a leak-free repair. Similarly, it is also deemed necessary to design an assembly to capture existing servicetap coupons and allow their removal from the inside of the pipe. Task 6 (Design and Build Surface Control and Monitoring System) was previously completed with the control and computer display functions being operated through LabVIEW. However, this must now be revisited to add control routines for the coupon catcher that will be added. This will most likely include a lift-off/place-on magnet translation function.

Task 1 (Program Management) and Task 2 (Establishment of Detailed Design Specifications) were completed in prior quarters while Task 3 (Design and Fabricate Ratcheting Stainless-Steel Repair Sleeves) has progressed to installing prototype sleeves in cast iron test pipe segments. Efforts in this quarter continued to focus on Tasks 4 - 8, with significant progress made in each as well as field testing of the 4 -inch gas pipe repair robot in cast iron pipe at Public Service Electric & Gas. The field tests were conducted August 23 - 26, 2004 in Oradell, New Jersey. The field tests identified several design issues which need to be implemented in both the small- and large-diameter cast iron repair robots to assure their commercial success. Task 4 (Design, Fabricate and Test Patch Setting Robotic Train) progressed {{to the design of}} the control electronics and pneumatic system to inflate the bladder robotic patch setting module in the last quarter 5. In this quarter, work has been concentrated on increasing the nitrogen bladder reservoir volume to allow at least two complete patch inflation/patch setting cycles in the event the sleeve does not set all ratchets in the same row on the first attempt. This problem was observed on a few of the repair sleeves that were recently installed during field tests with the small-diameter robotic system. For Task 5 (Design & Fabricate Pipe-Wall Cleaning Robot Train with Pan/Zoom/Tilt Camera) it was observed that {{it will be necessary to}} add a stiff brush to push debris away from the immediate vicinity of the bell and spigot joints in mains having low gas velocities. Otherwise, material removed by the cleaning flails (which were found to be very effective in cleaning bell and spigot joints) simply falls to the low side of the pipe and accumulates in a pile. This accumulation can prevent the sleeve from achieving a leak free repair. Similarly, it is also necessary to design a small magnet to capture existing service tap coupons and allow their removal from the inside of the pipe. These coupons were found to cause difficulty in launching and retrieving the small pipe repair robot; one coupon lodged beneath the end of the guide shoe. These new features require redesign of the pipe wall cleaning train and modification to the patch setting train. Task 6 (Design & Build Surface Control and Monitoring System) was previously completed with the control and computer display functions being operated through LabView. However, this must now be re-visited to add control routines for the coupon catcher to be added. This will most likely include a lift-off/place-on magnet translation function. Task 7 (Design & Fabricate Large Diameter Live Access System) progressed to completing the detailed design of the entry fitting for 12 -inch diameter cast iron pipe in the previous quarter. Field tests with the 4 -inch size fitting were completely successful and did not reveal any significant design issues. The primary suggestion from the PSE&G field crew was to produce a version which completely bolts together and does not require a long seam weld. This could be used in low-pressure cast iron mains to reduce installation time. A bolt-on version is now being designed based on this recommendation. Task 8 (System Integration and Laboratory Validation) continued with the development of the robot module inter-connects and of a master LabView-based system display and control software...|$|R
40|$|Utilities in the U. S. operate over 75, 000 km (47, 000 miles) of old {{cast-iron}} pipes for gas distribution. The bell-and-spigot joints {{that connect}} pipe sections together tend to leak as these pipes age. Current repair practices are costly and highly disruptive. The {{objective of this}} program is to design, test and commercialize a robotic system capable of sealing multiple cast-iron bell and spigot joints from a single pipe entry point. The proposed system will perform repairs while the pipe remains in service by traveling through the pipe, cleaning each joint surface, and installing a stainless-steel sleeve lined with an epoxy-impregnated <b>felt</b> across the <b>joint.</b> This approach will save considerable time and labor, avoid traffic disruption, and eliminate any requirement to interrupt service to customers (which would result in enormous expense to utilities). Technical challenges include: (1) repair sleeves must compensate for diametric variation and eccentricity of cast-iron pipes; (2) the assembly must travel long distances through pipes containing debris; (3) the pipe wall must be effectively cleaned in the immediate area of the joint to assure good bonding of the sleeve; and (4) an innovative bolt-on entry fitting is required to conduct repair operations on live mains.

Highly valuable lessons were learned from field tests of the 4 -inch gas pipe repair robot in cast-iron pipe at Public Service Electric & Gas.

These tests identified several design issues which need to be implemented in both the small- and large-diameter repair robots for cast-iron pipe to assure their commercial success.

These coupons were found to cause difficulty in launching and retrieving the small pipe repair robot; for example, one coupon lodged beneath the end of the guide shoe. Designs for new features to accomplish these goals for the large robotic system were pursued and are presented in this report.
