5|$|He {{made his}} maiden Test century against Bangladesh {{and then was}} India's leading scorer in the Test tour of England, helping India to win their first series in England in 21 years. However, Karthik {{suffered}} a form slump in late-2007 and was dropped from the Test team, and since then has only made sporadic international appearances, although he continues to score heavily in domestic cricket. These <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> occasional appearances as a specialist batsman when other players were rested or injured, or as a wicket-keeper when Dhoni was sidelined.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand and France {{have played}} seven Rugby World Cup games, {{more than any}} other pair of teams, {{including}} six play-off matches. Five have been won by New Zealand and two by France. France's wins knocked New Zealand out of the 1999 and 2007 tournaments at the semi-final and quarter-final stage respectively. New Zealand's first two successful campaigns (1987 and 2011) ended with wins over France, both at Eden Park. New Zealand's other victories <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> a quarter-final (2015), a pool match (2011, again at Eden Park) and the 2003 third-place playoff.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, the Ojibwe {{attracted}} attention, gaining {{publicity and}} {{money for their}} cause. In Washington, however, they were turned away by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and told they should never <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> the first place. Luckily, they drew {{the attention of the}} Whig Congressman Briggs from New York, who was scheduled a meeting with President Millard Fillmore the next day. He invited the Ojibwa to come with him to see the president. At the meeting, Buffalo rose first. He performed the pipe ceremony with a pipe made especially for the occasion. He had the younger chief Oshaga speak {{for more than an hour}} about the broken treaty promises and the disastrous attempt at removal. Fillmore agreed to consider the issues. The next day, he announced that the removal order would be canceled, the payment of annuities would be returned to La Pointe, and another treaty would set up permanent reservations for the Ojibwe in Wisconsin.|$|E

Bai Juyi lived through the reigns of eight or nine emperors, being born in the Dali regnal era (766-779) of Emperor Daizong of Tang. He had a long and successful career both as a government official and a poet, although these two facets of his career seemed to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> conflict with each other at certain points.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the Manifestations of God, there are also minor prophets.

Moses, for example, is taught as having been a Manifestation of God and his brother Aaron a minor prophet. Moses spoke on behalf of God, and Aaron spoke on behalf of Moses (Exodus 4:14-17). Other Jewish prophets are considered minor prophets, as they are considered to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> {{the shadow of the}} dispensation of Moses to develop and consolidate the process he set in motion.|$|E
