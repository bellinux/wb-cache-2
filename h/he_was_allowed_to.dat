Thunder was also allowed to run in the end zone after a touchdown, but because MetLife Stadium was {{considered}} a neutral zone for both teams, he was not allowed to run the length of the field.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, backup {{receiver}} and redshirt freshman Jamere Holland was dismissed from the team, although not for any violation of team rules. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> stay on scholarship for the year.

He would later transfer to the University of Oregon.|$|E

5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because of rules that under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of the war had forced the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E

The novel was one of three that Andrić wrote over the next several years. All three were published in short succession in 1945, following Belgrade's liberation from the Nazis. The Bridge on the Drina was published in March of that year to widespread acclaim.|$|E

5|$|In 580 or 581, Mundhir {{participated in}} an {{unsuccessful}} campaign against the Persian capital, Ctesiphon, alongside the Byzantine general (and future emperor) Maurice. The failure of the campaign led to a quarrel between the two and Maurice accused Mundhir of treason. Byzantine agents captured Mundhir, who was brought to Constantinople but never faced trial. His arrest provoked an uprising among the Ghassanids under Mundhir's son al-Nu'man VI. When Maurice ascended the throne in 582, Mundhir was exiled to Sicily although, according to one source, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> return to his homeland after Maurice's overthrow in 602.|$|E
5|$|In November 1276, war was declared. Initial {{operations}} were launched under the captaincy of Mortimer, Lancaster (Edward's brother Edmund) and William de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Support for Llywelyn was weak among his own countrymen. In July 1277 Edward invaded {{with a force}} of 15,500, of whom 9,000 were Welshmen. The campaign never came to a major battle, and Llywelyn soon realised {{he had no choice}} but to surrender. By the Treaty of Aberconwy in November 1277, he was left only with the land of Gwynedd, though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> retain the title of Prince of Wales.|$|E
