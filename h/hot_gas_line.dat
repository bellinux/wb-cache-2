40|$|The far-ultraviolet (FUV; 912 [...] 1700 Å) {{radiation}} field from accreting central stars in Classical T Tauri systems influences the disk chemistry {{during the period}} of giant planet formation. Previous efforts to measure the true stellar+accretion-generated FUV luminosity (both <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> emission <b>lines</b> and continua) have been complicated by a combination of low-sensitivity and/or low-spectral resolution and did not include the contribution from the bright Lyα emission line. In this work, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic study of the FUV {{radiation field}}s of 16 T Tauri stars whose dust disks display a range of evolutionary states. We include reconstructed Lyα line profiles and remove atomic and molecular disk emission (from H_ 2 and CO fluorescence) to provide robust measurements of both the FUV continuum and <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> <b>lines</b> (e. g., Lyα, N 5, C 4, He 2) for an appreciable sample of T Tauri stars for the first time. We find that the flux of the typical Classical T Tauri Star FUV radiation field at 1 AU from the central star is ∼ 10 ^ 7 times the average interstellar radiation field.

40|$|We analyze {{high-resolution}} UV {{spectra of}} {{a small sample of}} Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAEBES) in order to explore the origin of the T∼ 10 ^ 5 K gas in these stars. The C IV 1548, 1550 Å line luminosities are compared to non [...] simultaneous accretion rate estimates for the objects showing C IV emission. We show that the correlation between L_CIV and Ṁ previously established for classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) seems to extend into the HAEBE mass regime, although the large spread in literature Ṁ and A_V values makes the actual relationship highly uncertain. With the exception of DX Cha, we find no evidence for hot, optically thick winds in our HAEBE sample. All other objects showing clear doublet emission in C IV can be well described by a two component (i. e., a single component for each doublet member) or four component (i. e., two components for each doublet member) Gaussian emission line fit. The morphologies and peak-flux velocities of these lines suggest they are formed in weak, optically thin stellar winds and not in an accretion flow, as is the case for the hot lines observed in CTTSs. The lack of strong outflow signatures and lack of evidence for line formation in accretion flows is consistent with the conclusion presented in our recent optical and He I 10830 Å studies that the immediate circumstellar environments of HAEBES, in general, are not scaled-up analogs of the immediate environments around CTTSs. The conclusions presented here for <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> <b>lines</b> around HAEBES should be verified with a larger sample of objects. Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures, accepted to ApJ 5 / 12 / 1...|$|R
40|$|Starburst {{galaxies are}} primary {{feedback}} sources of mechanical energy and metals, which are generally measured from associated X-ray emission lines assuming {{that they are}} from the thermal emission of the outflowing <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> Such <b>line</b> emission, however, can also arise from the charge exchange X-ray emission (CXE) between highly ionized ions and neutral species. To understand the feedback of energy and metals, {{it is crucial to}} determine the origin of the X-ray emission lines and to distinguish the contributions from the CXE and the thermal emission. The origin of the lines can be diagnosed by the Kα triplets of He-like ions, because the CXE favors the inter-combination and forbidden lines, while the thermal emission favors the resonance line.

40|$|We present new {{measurements}} of the spatial distribution of cool and <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> in the local interstellar medium {{as a result of}} a search for O VI absorption in the FUV spectra of 100 white dwarfs at distances between 50 and 300 pc. We have carried out a detailed velocity analysis on the detected O VI lines to ascertain the degree of contamination from the background star. The position of the stars relative to the local cavity is calculated through cold gas phase column density measurements. Through curve of growth analysis we note that the local cavity is depleted in metals relative to hydrogen by a factor of 5 - 10 compared to the space beyond. Whereas the O VI producing <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> was originally thought to be observed in the interface regions between <b>hot</b> and cold <b>gas,</b> i. e. the cavity wall, our investigation nds no unambiguously <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> in <b>lines</b> of sight that span such regions. We do, however, nd <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> at high galactic latitudes where there are no such walls. We discuss the wider context of this result by comparing the position of these detections to the soft X-ray background. This work ultimately changes our picture of the local interstellar environment and its processes by removing the ubiquitous million degree gas that was once thought to surround the solar system. One possible explanation worthy of further investigation is that the local cavity has recently begun to be inundated by <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> spilling out of the loop 1 supernova remnant.

40|$|Properties of <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> {{outflows}} from {{galaxies are}} generally measured from associated X-ray line emission assuming {{that it represents}} atomic transitions in thermally excited <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> X-ray <b>line</b> emission, however, can also arise from the charge exchange between highly ionised ions and neutral species. The Kα triplet of He-like ions {{can be used as}} a powerful diagnostic, because the charge exchange X-ray emission (CXE) favours the inter-combination and forbidden lines, while the thermal emission favours the resonance line. We analyse the OVII triplet of a sample of nine nearby star-forming galaxies observed by the XMM-Newton reflection grating spectrometers. For most galaxies, the forbidden lines are comparable to or stronger than the resonance lines, which is in contrast to the thermal prediction. For NGC 253, M 51, M 83, M 61, NGC 4631, and the Antennae galaxy, the observed line ratios are consistent with the ratio of the CXE; for M 94 and NGC 2903, the observed ratios indicate multiple origins; for M 82, different regions show different line ratios, also indicating multiple origins. We discuss other possible mechanisms that can produce a relatively strong forbidden line, such as a collisional non-equilibrium-ionization recombining/ionizing plasma, which are not favoured. These results suggest that the CXE may be a common process and contribute a significant fraction of the soft X-ray line emission for galaxies with massive star formation.

40|$|We present new far-ultraviolet {{observations}} of the young M 8 brown dwarf 2 MASS J 12073346 - 3932539, which is surrounded by an accretion disk. The data were obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. Moderate resolution spectra (R 17, 000 - 18, 000) obtained in the 1150 - 1750 A and 2770 - 2830 A bandpasses reveal H 2 emission excited by HI Lyα photons, several ionization states of carbon (CI - CIV), and <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> emission <b>lines</b> of HeII and NV (T 10 ^ 4 - 5 K). Emission from some species that would {{be found in a}} typical thermal plasma at this temperature (SiII, SiIII, SiIV, and MgII) are not detected. The non-detections indicate that these refractory elements are depleted into grains, and that accretion shocks dominate the production of the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> observed on 2 MASS J 12073346 - 3932539. We use the observed CIV luminosity to constrain the mass accretion rate in this system. We use the kinematically broadened H 2 profile to confirm {{that the majority of the}} molecular emission arises in the disk, measure the radius of the inner hole of the disk (R_hole 3 R_*), and constrain the physical conditions of the warm molecular phase of the disk (T(H 2) 2500 - 4000 K). A second, most likely unresolved H 2 component is identified. This feature is either near the stellar surface in the region of the accretion shock or in a molecular outflow, although the possibility that this Jovian-like emission arises on the day-side disk of a 6 M_J companion (2 M 1207 b) cannot be conclusively ruled out. In general, we find that this young brown dwarf disk system is a low-mass analog to classical T Tauri stars that are observed to produce H 2 emission from a warm layer in their disks, such as the well studied TW Hya and DF Tau systems.

40|$|We use Chandra and XMM-Newton {{to study}} the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> content {{in a sample of}} field early-type galaxies. We find that the L_X-L_K {{relationship}} is steeper for field galaxies than for comparable galaxies in groups and clusters. The low <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> content of field galaxies with L_K < L_star suggests that internal processes such as supernovae driven winds or AGN feedback expel <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> from low mass galaxies. Such mechanisms may be less effective in groups and clusters where the presence of an intragroup or intracluster medium can confine outflowing material. In addition, galaxies in groups and clusters may be able to accrete gas from the ambient medium. While there is a population of L_K < L_star galaxies in groups and clusters that retain <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> halos, some galaxies in these rich environments, including brighter galaxies, are largely devoid of <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> In these cases, the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> halos have likely been removed via ram pressure stripping.

Firstly, a description of both an experimental prototype ASHP unit where the novel reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method may be realized, and its operating modes are presented. This is followed by reporting an experimental set up for testing the defrosting performance of the prototype ASHP unit using the novel thermal energy storage (TES) based reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method.

The experimental results suggested {{that the use of}} the novel reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method for the experimental ASHP unit was able to help shorten the defrosting time by ∼ 3 min or 38 %, and minimize the risk of shutting down the ASHP unit due to low suction pressure through increasing the compressor's suction pressure by about 200 kPa, when compared {{to the use of the}} traditional standard reverse-cycle <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> defrosting method.

With Chandra and XMM-Newton, we studied 32 early-type galaxies (kT ≲ 1 keV) covering a span of two orders of L_X, gas/L_K to investigate these missing factors. Contrary to previous studies that X-ray faint galaxies show extremely low Fe abundance (∼ 0. 1 Z_), nearly all galaxies in our sample show an Fe abundance at least 0. 3 Z_, although the measured Fe abundance difference between X-ray faint and X-ray bright galaxies remains remarkable.

With a subset of 24 galaxies in this sample, we find that there is virtually no correlation between <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> Fe abundances and their atomic gas content, which disproves the scenario that the low metal abundance of X-ray faint galaxies might be a result of the dilution of the remaining <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> by pristine atomic gas.

However, the {{expected}} super-solar iron abundance of the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> is not observed. Instead, X-ray observations often show decreasing iron abundance toward galactic central regions, where the Ia SN enrichment {{is expected to be the}} highest. We examine the cause of this missing iron problem by studying the enrichment process and its effect on X-ray abundance measurements of the <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> The evolution of Ia SN iron ejecta is simulated in the context of galaxy-wide <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> outflows, in both supersonic and subsonic cases, as may be expected for <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> in galactic bulges or elliptical galaxies of intermediate masses. SN reverse-shock heated iron ejecta is typically found to have a very high temperature and low density, hence producing little X-ray emission. Such hot ejecta, driven by its large buoyancy, can quickly reach a substantially higher outward velocity than the ambient medium, which is dominated by mass loss from evolved stars. The ejecta is gradually and dynamically mixed with the medium at large galactic radii. The ejecta is also slowly diluted and cooled by insitu mass injection from evolved stars. These processes together naturally result in the observed positive gradient in the average radial iron abundance distribution of the <b>hot</b> <b>gas,</b> even if mass-weighted. This trend is in addition to the X-ray measurement bias that tends to underestimate the iron abundance for the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> with a temperature distribution.

40|$|Deep ROSAT HRI (High-Resolution Imager) imaging of the X-ray-emitting gas {{associated}} with the colliding elliptical galaxy pair NGC 4782 / 4783 reveals {{for the first time}} the complexity of the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> distribution in a pair of close interacting galaxies. The HRI image of NGC 4782 / 4783 shows <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> around each galaxy, a high surface brightness X-ray bridge connecting the galaxy pair, tidal-like tails emerging from the two galaxies, and a sheet of gas at the interaction interface between the two galaxies. The <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> distributions do not peak at the optical centers of the galaxies but are displaced in the same sense as the tidal distensions seen in the optical luminosity distributions. All of these remarkable features show the complexity of structure that develops in the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> distribution when both hydrodynamical and tidal forces come into play during collisions between ellipticals with <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> components. Models by Borne and Colina of the bent two-sided radio jet 3 C 278 ({{associated with}} NGC 4782) indicated that there must be a strong interaction between the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> components of NGC 4782,/ 4783 and that the deflection of the radio jets is likely caused by the ram pressure exerted on the jet plasma by the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> {{associated with the}} passing companion NGC 4783. These conclusions are qualitatively confirmed by the HRI image and substantiate the major role played by the hot interstellar medium, and its asymmetries, in the propagation and entrainment of radio jets in colliding radio host ellipticals...|$|R
40|$|Within protogalaxies, thermal {{instability}} {{leads to the}} formation of a population of cool fragments, confined by the pressure of residual <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> The <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> remains in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium, at approximately the virial temperature of the dark matter halo. It is heated by compression and shock dissipation and is cooled by bremsstrahlung emission and conductive losses into the cool clouds. The cool fragments are photoionized and heated by the extragalactic UV background and nearby massive stars. The smallest clouds are evaporated due to conductive heat transfer from the <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> All are subject to disruption due to hydrodynamic instabilities. They also gain mass due to collisions and mergers and condensation from the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> due to conduction. The size distribution of the fragments in turn determines the rate and efficiency of star formation during the early phase of galactic evolution. We have performed one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of the <b>hot</b> and cool <b>gas.</b> The cool clouds are assumed to follow a power-law size distribution, and fall into the galactic potential, subject to drag from the <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> The relative amounts of the <b>hot</b> and cool <b>gas</b> is determined by the processes discussed above, and star formation occurs at a rate sufficient to maintain the cool clouds at 10 $^ 4 $ K. We present density distributions for the two phases and also for the stars for several cases, parametrized by the circular speeds of the potentials. Under some conditions, primarily low densities of the <b>hot</b> <b>gas,</b> conduction is more efficient than radiative processes at cooling the <b>hot</b> <b>gas,</b> limiting the x-ray radiation from the halo gas.
