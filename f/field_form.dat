The protectors are provided with extensions through {{the structure of the}} aircraft's outer surface and within a static discharger. Protection systems for use in aircraft must protect critical and non-critical electronic equipment. Aircraft lightning protection provides an electrical path having a plurality of conductive segments, continuous or discontinuous, that upon exposure to a high voltage <b>field</b> <b>form</b> an ionization channel due to the system's breakdown voltage. Various lightning protection systems must reject the surge currents associated with the lightning strikes. Lightning protection means for aircraft include components which are dielectrics and metallic layers applied to the ordinarily lightning-accessible surfaces of composite structures. Various ground connection means to the layers comprises a section of wire mesh fusing the various layers to an attachment connecting the structure to an adjacent ground structure. Composite-to-metal or composite-to-composite structural joints are protected by making the interface areas conductive for transfer of lightning current.|$|E
500|$|The {{observation}} of antitails {{contributed significantly to}} the discovery of solar wind. The ion tail is formed {{as a result of the}} ionisation by solar ultra-violet radiation of particles in the coma. Once the particles have been ionized, they attain a net positive electrical charge, which in turn gives rise to an [...] "induced magnetosphere" [...] around the comet. The comet and its induced magnetic <b>field</b> <b>form</b> an obstacle to outward flowing solar wind particles. Because the relative orbital speed of the comet and the solar wind is supersonic, a bow shock is formed upstream of the comet in the flow direction of the solar wind. In this bow shock, large concentrations of cometary ions (called [...] "pick-up ions") congregate and act to [...] "load" [...] the solar magnetic field with plasma, such that the field lines [...] "drape" [...] around the comet forming the ion tail.|$|E

2500|$|For the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics and Paralympics, a major {{reconstruction}} {{project was}} initiated in 2010. The original seating bowl, with a two-tier configuration, was demolished, {{giving way to}} a new one-tier seating bowl. The original stadium's roof in concrete was removed and replaced with a fiberglass tensioned membrane coated with polytetra-fluoroethylene. The new roof covers 95% of the seats inside the stadium, unlike the former design, where protection was only afforded to some seats in the upper ring and the bleachers above the gate access of each sector. [...] The old boxes, which were installed at a level above the stands for the 2000 FIFA Club World Cup, were dismantled in the reconstruction process.

40|$|Summary. Spherical {{harmonic}} expansions {{are derived}} to represent arbitrary current densities and magnetic fields in a spherical region. The expansions {{can be viewed}} as a generalization of the spherical-harmonic, scalar-potential theory to include regions where spatially distributed current densities exist. The new expansions are found in terms of the eigenfunctions of the curl curl operator. It is found that four basic <b>field</b> <b>forms</b> may be present; one of these is the well-known scalar potential expansion originated by Gauss. Electric and magnetic field boundary conditions appropriate to a conducting spherical shell including the case of anisotropic conductivity are presented. They are discussed in terms of their ability to couple the four <b>field</b> <b>forms.</b> It is pointed out that the four <b>field</b> <b>forms</b> can be expressed in five other orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems. ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{historic}} and architecturally significant buildings of Rockwell <b>Field</b> <b>form</b> the southeastern quadrant {{of what is}} today the Naval Air Station, North Island (NAS North Island). The buildings were designed in the Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival Styles. The Kahn-designed Mission Revival Field Officers Quarters (later married officers quarters) are reinforced concrete-framed, in-filled with hollow terra cotta tile and finished in buff color stucco. Kahn's Mission Revival hangars (Buildings 501, 502 and 503 from 1918) are similar in materials with red clay tile, gabled roofs. They were built to the same plan: a rectangle, 135 feet by 70 feet, with 30 feet clear to the ceiling. A low, flat-roofed, lean-to {{on the east side}} of each contained offices. Located on the bluff edge at the North Island end of the Coronado-North Island causeway, the Army-Navy Gate House/Meter Room (Building 505, 1918; later Meter House) functioned as the gatehouse for both Rockwell Field and NAS San Diego. This group of buildings reflects the War Department's plan to create buildings that would be appropriate for Southern California, and illustrates Kahn's [...] "Spanish military" [...] design implemented at Rockwell Field.|$|E
