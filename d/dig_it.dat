5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate or may be exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot <b>dig</b> <b>it</b> up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be dug up at night for fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|The {{margin of}} the Empress Eudocia's copy of the Iliad has a note {{summarizing}} a Hellenistic poet who tells a different story of Orion's birth. Here the gods Zeus, Hermes, and Poseidon come to visit Hyrieus of Tanagra, who roasts a whole bull for them. When they offer him a favor, he asks {{for the birth of}} sons. The gods take the bull's hide and ejaculate or urinate into it and bury it in the earth, then tell him to <b>dig</b> <b>it</b> up ten months later. When he does, he finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.|$|E
5|$|During a {{party at}} the {{community}} centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses Denise Fox (Diane Parish), angering her husband Lucas (Don Gilet), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily preaching to him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and ZsaZsa to replace it, but as they <b>dig</b> <b>it</b> up, they uncover a dead body, that of Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window and she makes Fatboy fix it. He does a bad job so she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy to wait in her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new window and make her a cup of tea.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} {{that if they}} can find the Isolus pod and provide it power, the alien will leave Chloe. A frantic Chloe draws the TARDIS and the Doctor, trapping them both {{in one of her}} sketches and forcing Rose to try to find the pod herself. She rationalises that the pod is located on the hottest spot on the street, a patch of freshly laid tar, and is able to <b>dig</b> <b>it</b> up. Meanwhile, Chloe has caused the entire crowd at the Olympic stadium to disappear and now is set on making everyone in the world disappear. Rose tries {{to find out how to}} power the pod, and uses visual indications from the Doctor's picture to understand that the pod needs heat mixed with emotion. Rose throws the pod towards the Olympic Torch - a symbol of hope, courage, and love - as it passes down the street. The missing children and the crowd at the Olympics reappear, and Rose realises that the drawing Chloe had made of her father will similarly come to life. Rose and Chloe's mother are able to calm Chloe by singing the Kookaburra song, causing the unseen monster - having fed off of Chloe's emotions and fears - to disappear.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, the Central Artery/Tunnel {{project was}} completed.

The Ted Williams Tunnel became the third highway tunnel to East Boston and Logan International Airport as part of the project. The Big Dig also produced the landmark Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge, and will create over 70 acres (280,000m²) of public parks {{in the heart of the}} city. The project as a whole has eased (but not eliminated) Boston's notorious traffic congestion; however, it is the most expensive construction project in United States history and the most expensive construction project in the world.|$|E
