25|$|A thermos of beef tea was the favoured way to {{fend off}} the chill of winter matches for generations of British {{football}} enthusiasts; to this day, Bovril dissolved in hot water is sold in stadiums all over the United Kingdom. Bovril beef tea was the main warm drink that Ernest Shackleton's team <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> when they were marooned on Elephant Island during the Endurance Expedition.|$|E
25|$|During this ceremony, {{the king}} {{also had to}} participate, {{although}} he was a Christian, and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> of the mead that was offered and consecrated for Odin, Njord and Freyja. The peasants also wanted him to eat of the meat, but he only gaped over {{the handle of the}} cauldron and held a linen cloth between his mouth and the meat. The peasants were not at all satisfied with a king who would not participate fully in the blót. The King had however, been seriously humiliated and later he converted to the old faith. The tradition says that he was buried in the old ways.|$|E
25|$|One of few yokozuna to {{hail from}} the city rather than the country, {{he was born in}} what is now Koiwa, Edogawa. He was a fine all round athlete at {{elementary}} school, and although he had no family connections to sumo, he was introduced by a shop owner to Kasugano Oyakata, the former yokozuna Tochigiyama. Tochinishiki made his professional debut in January 1939. He was of such a small size that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> copious amounts of water to meet the weight requirement at his physical. However, his stablemaster, to whom Tochinishiki served as an attendant or tsukebito and was a great influence on him in his early days, expected him to become strong.|$|E

25|$|A former {{swimming}} champion {{while at}} junior high school, Wakahaguro made his professional debut in October 1949, joining Tatsunami stable. To meet the weight requirement, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> {{an enormous amount}} of water prior to his physical. However, he was able to put on more weight as he moved up the ranks. He reached the second highest jūryō division in March 1954 and was promoted to the top makuuchi division in March 1955. His first big success in a tournament came in March 1956 when he won 12 out of 15 bouts and took part in a three way playoff for the championship with ōzeki Wakanohana and sekiwake Asashio. Although he was defeated, he was awarded the Fighting Spirit prize. After three years of steady progress he worked his way up to sekiwake rank and in the September 1959 tournament was runner-up once again. This performance earned him promotion to ōzeki. In his ōzeki debut he took the tournament championship with a 13–2 record, the first ōzeki debutant to do so since Chiyonoyama ten years earlier. After the tournament a party was held at the Imperial Hotel to celebrate both his ōzeki promotion and his engagement.|$|E
500|$|On 15 December, PZPN {{officials}} {{attempted to}} reconstruct the night's events, asking various players and staff to give accounts of what had happened. Several journalists were present. The stories told contradicted each other in several places, notably regarding how much Młynarczyk had <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink.</b> The team's technical staff {{said that he had}} been obviously intoxicated when they had seen him, while the goalkeeper insisted he had taken only [...] "three glasses of champagne and a sip of beer" [...] with his friend. Another point of contention regarded the conversation at the airport, which had caused Kulesza to yield. It was generally agreed that the players had talked the manager around by telling him that Młynarczyk had personal problems, but the non-playing staff now accused them of emotional blackmail. The players said their intention had been to explain the goalkeeper's off-field issues to help the manager make a more informed decision.|$|E

The day began at 6am, changing into costumes and getting onto the actors' bus, which took them to the sets in Kanuria. The actors, including Aamir, all travelled on the same bus. If anyone missed it, it was up to them to reach the sets. One day, Aamir was late and missed the actors' bus. That day, his wife Reena, the executive producer, reprimanded him for being late. She told him he had to set an example {{for the rest of the}} crew. [...] "If he started coming late, how could she tell the others to come on time?" [...] While on the sets, the actors were given call sheets with the day's timetable such as breakfast, hair styling, make-up, costumes, etc.|$|E

500|$|Malley's stay {{increasingly}} involved him in {{the fighting}} in China; his wife would relate three years of night-time air raids to her friends upon the couple's return to Australia in 1940. In May 1938, he advised the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams: [...] "there is a first-class war on here, which must eventually affect Australia and its defence schemes". Williams {{and other members of}} the RAAF may, however, have perceived Malley as exaggerating the importance of his role in China, particularly given his apparent delight in its ceremonial aspects. In one letter, he regaled Williams with stories of an inspection tour around the country, declaring: [...] "I... can just imagine how much you would have enjoyed it– landing on aerodromes that were all polished up for inspection. Being met by provincial dignitaries and lavishly entertained. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> every conceivable Chinese wine that was ever made, and to eat foods unheard of in Australia!" [...] At any rate, Malley's reports of Japanese air tactics, and the value his observations might have held for Australia in the event of war in the Pacific, were largely discounted by his home government.|$|E
2500|$|After the Crown of Castile conquered Gibraltar in the 15th century, the {{aqueduct}} was renovated {{and a pair}} of reservoirs {{was constructed}} around 1694. A medieval reservoir, Nun's Well, still survives at Europa Point in the far south of Gibraltar, though it is unclear who built it and when. When Thomas James saw it in the 1770s, he recorded that it was infested with leeches. This caused problems for the soldiers who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> the water, as the leeches attached themselves to the soldiers' tongues [...] "and sucking for sustenance, caused the discharge of blood, which ... frightened some of the men not a little." ...|$|E
2500|$|The white {{actors who}} portrayed these {{characters}} spoke an exaggerated form of Black Vernacular English. The blackface makeup and illustrations on programs and sheet music depicted them with huge eyeballs, very wide noses, and thick-lipped mouths that hung open or grinned foolishly; one character expressed {{his love for}} a woman with [...] "lips so large a lover could not kiss them all at once". They had huge feet and preferred [...] "possum" [...] and [...] "coon" [...] to more civilized fare. Minstrel characters were often described in animalistic terms, with [...] "wool" [...] instead of hair, [...] "bleating" [...] like sheep, and having [...] "darky cubs" [...] instead of children. Other claims were that blacks <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> ink when they got sick [...] "to restore their color" [...] {{and that they had}} to file their hair rather than cut it.

2500|$|The final {{witness to}} appear for the prosecution, {{forensic}} psychiatrist Park Dietz, began his testimony on February 12. Dietz {{testified that he}} did not believe Dahmer to be suffering from any mental disease or defect {{at the time that he}} committed the crimes, stating: [...] "Dahmer went to great lengths to be alone with his victim and to have no witnesses." [...] He explained that there was ample evidence that Dahmer prepared in advance for each murder, therefore, his crimes were not impulsive. Although Dietz did concede any acquisition of a paraphilia was not a matter of personal choice, he also stated his belief that Dahmer's habit of becoming intoxicated prior to committing each of the murders was significant, stating: [...] "If he had a compulsion to kill, he would not have to drink alcohol. He <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>drink</b> alcohol to overcome his inhibition, to do the crime which he would rather not do." [...] Dietz also noted that Dahmer strongly identified with evil and corrupt characters from both Return of the Jedi and The Exorcist III; particularly the level of [...] power held by these characters. Expounding on the significance of these movies on Dahmer's psyche and many of the murders committed at the Oxford Apartments, Dietz explained that Dahmer would occasionally view scenes from these films before searching for a victim. Dietz diagnosed Dahmer with substance use disorder, paraphilia, and schizotypal personality disorder.|$|E
