The coating, deposited by multistep adsorption from diluted water-based suspensions/solutions, homogenously cover each cotton fibers with average thicknesses below 50 nm and add-on up to 5 % in weight. Combustion characterization evidences the interesting properties: indeed, the so-treated fabrics reached self-extinguishing during <b>horizontal</b> <b>flame</b> spread <b>tests.</b> Furthermore, when the coating add-on reaches 5 %, no ignition has been observed during cone calorimetry tests under 35 kW/m 2 heat flux.

The paper compares data from ignition tests conducted in the Cone Calorimeter and the FIST apparatus with tests conducted using the FMVSS 302 <b>horizontal</b> <b>flame</b> spread apparatus. Ten materials were selected as representative of those used as seat coverings of private and commercial passenger vehicles. The time to ignition of new and used materials subject to exposure heat fluxes between 20 kW/m 2 and 40 kW/m 2 was measured. The results from the ignition tests were analyzed using thermally thick and thermally thin theoretical models. The critical heat flux for sustained piloted ignition was determined from the time to ignition data using the thermally thin approach. Derived ignition temperatures from both the thermally thick and thermally thin methods were compared with measurements using a thermocouple attached to the back surface of materials in selected <b>tests.</b> The <b>flame</b> spread rates in the FMVSS 302 apparatus were determined and a comparison was made between the performance of the materials in the flame spread apparatus, the Cone Calorimeter and the FIST.

40|$|In this paper, an {{intumescent}} {{flame retardant}} treatment, obtained {{by a combination}} of vinylphosphonic acid (VPA) and methacrylamide (MAA), was applied to cotton fabrics. In order to improve the cross-linking degree onto cellulose polymers, potassium persulfate was used as initiator of a radical polymerization technique. The application on cotton was carried out by padding, followed by drying and a curing treatment. The treated samples were characterized by SEM, TGA and FTIR-ATR analyses and tested in terms of flammability and washing fastness. The thermal and fire behavior of the treated fabrics was thoroughly investigated. The results clearly showed that the VPA/MAA coating was able to exert a protective action, giving rise to the formation of a stable char on the surface of textile fibers upon heating, hence improving the flame retardant performance of cotton. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>flame</b> spread <b>tests</b> confirmed that the coated fabrics achieved self-extinction, and the residues well preserved the original weave structure and fiber morphology; at variance, the uncoated fabric left only ashes.

40|$|Textiles {{are very}} {{hazardous}} materials when related to fires, {{because of the}} high surface to mass ratio and the open structure, which simplify the contact with heat and oxygen. Fabrics have a great impact on the development of fatal fires because of their easy ignition and high burning rate. For the flame retardancy of fabrics several strategies have been developed throughout the years, and nowadays additives and reagents are widely used for the different kinds of textiles. The most common commercial durable finishes for cotton fabrics contain phosphorous and nitrogen compounds. These products have been predominant in the field of flame retardants for cotton for 50 years, but recently the request for a reduction of environmental impact and of formaldehyde release during manufacturing and utilisation have pushed researchers towards new kinds of finishing. This Ph. D. work aimed at investigating the effectiveness and the possibilities of the use of biomacromolecules as fire retardants for cellulosic textiles (i. e. cotton). To this aim, three biomacromolecules were taken in consideration: whey proteins, caseins and nucleic acids. Whey proteins and caseins, derived from milk, were applied on cotton fabrics and their thermal and thermo-oxidative stability and fire behaviour were assessed through thermogravimetric analysis, cone calorimetry and <b>horizontal</b> <b>flame</b> spread <b>tests.</b> These biomacromolecules were effective in improving the fire retardancy of the treated fabrics, slowing down the combustion rate in <b>flame</b> spread <b>tests</b> and favouring the formation of a coherent carbonaceous residue (char). Then, the fire retardant behaviour of DNA was thoroughly investigated. First, commercially-available DNA from herring sperm and testes, having different molecular weights, were applied on cotton fabrics: the experimental parameters (i. e., molecular weight of the biomacromolecules, pH of the aqueous solution, number of impregnations needed for achieving the final dry add-on on the treated fabrics) were optimized in order to achieve the highest flame retardant effectiveness. The distribution of the nucleic acids on the underlying fabric was studied through SEM analyses. Thermogravimetric analyses, cone calorimetry and <b>horizontal</b> <b>flame</b> spread <b>tests</b> were carried out for assessing the thermal and thermo-oxidative stability and the fire behaviour of the treated fabrics. In detail, the low-molecular-weight DNA solution prepared either at pH 4 or 8 and applied on cotton with multiple impregnation steps was the most effective flame retardant treatment. Pursuing the research, the problem related to the high cost of commercially available DNA was considered: to overcome this drawback, a novel extraction method, starting from exhausted biomasses or agro-food crops, was developed. This method focused on the extraction of high quantities of nucleic acids, exploiting a low environmental impact approach. Overall, the recovered nucleic acids showed a fire behaviour similar to that of commercially-available counterparts. Finally, the washing fastness of the cotton fabrics treated with the biomacromolecules was considered: in fact, all the selected biomacromolecules are waterborne systems, which easily come off the fabrics when subjected to washing cycles, even in hot water only. This issue was taken on by treating cotton fabrics with nucleic acids and chitosan in mixture or as separate layers and also exploiting the layer by layer technique. The washing fastness of the treated fabrics was significantly improved by subjecting them to UV-curing, thus achieving the grafting of chitosan on cotton and, at the same time, entrapping the nucleic acid in the grafted chitosan coating. Notwithstanding the achieved fire retardancy, the fabrics treated with chitosan and nucleic acids also showed an antibacterial activity, due to the presence of chitosan. Furthermore, 30 bilayers of nucleic acids and chitosan provided the fabrics with self-extinction, either before and after a water washing cycle at 55 °C. As far as the effectiveness of the treatments is concerned, all the selected biomacromolecules conferred fire retardant features to cotton fabrics. In particular, low-molecular-weight nucleic acids and caseins were the most performing biomacromolecules either in forced combustion or in <b>flame</b> spread <b>tests.</b> Cotton fabrics treated with nucleic acids or caseins were able to achieve self-extinction in <b>horizontal</b> <b>flame</b> spread <b>tests,</b> with a reduction of the burning rate and an increase of the residue left. Similar reductions in the HRR were also observed in cone calorimetry tests. The suggested approach is quite simple and does not involve the use of particular chemicals or expensive equipment; furthermore, the selected biomacromolecules are soluble/dispersible in water. In conclusion, the proposed flame retardants for cotton may represent a new sustainable approach to face the challenges related to the increasing awareness of the health and environmental impact of traditional products and processes...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{aiming at}} {{providing}} flame retardant properties to cotton fabrics, {{a novel approach}} based on graft-copolymerization of vinyl monomers, containing P and N, onto cotton fabrics was investigated. The grafting reaction {{was carried out in}} presence of potassium persulfate (KPS) used as radical-initiator. The basic mechanism starts from the creation of free radical sites on both the used vinyl monomers and on cellulosic chains, in order to obtain a permanent combination of vinylphosphonic acid (VPA) and methacrylamide (MAA) with the textile substrate. As a consequence of grafting process, covalent bonds are formed between monomers and polymer, hence providing new functionalities to the treated fabric with high durability. With this goal, VPA and methacrylamide MAA) were chosen as phosphorus and nitrogen sources, respectively. Thermogravimetric analyses, performed both in air and in nitrogen atmosphere, demonstrated the anticipation of the cellulose decomposition due to the presence of the intumescent coating that allows the dehydration of cellulose, and upon decomposition, limits the production of volatile species, favoring the formation of the protective char (confirmed by the final residue). The protection feature was also confirmed by cone calorimetry tests that also highlighted the washing resistance of the coating. According to these results, <b>horizontal</b> <b>flame</b> spread <b>tests</b> showed for the treated samples, either before or after washing, self-extinguishing propertie...|$|R
40|$|Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{has been}} mostly {{considered}} as a carrier of genetic information and gene expression. Recently, we have demonstrated that this biomacromolecule is very effective in providing cellulosic fabrics with flame retardant features, thanks to its intrinsic intumescent-like behaviour. Here, we have investigated {{the role played by}} different parameters on the overall flame retardant features: DNA molecular size, pH of the DNA aqueous solutions, and number of impregnations. For this purpose, herring DNA, at three different molecular sizes, low (100 - 200 base pairs, bp), medium (400 - 800 bp) and high (2000 - 10000 bp), has been selected as model biomacromolecule; its effect as fire protective coating on cotton fabrics has been assessed in terms of resistance to a <b>flame</b> application (through <b>horizontal</b> <b>flame</b> spread <b>tests)</b> and to an irradiative heat flux of 35 kW/m 2 (by cone calorimetry). Furthermore, thermogravimetric analyses have been exploited for evaluating thermal and thermo-oxidative stability of the treated fabrics. The results clearly indicate that, despite a similar composition, the coatings containing low molecular size DNA exert a superior fire protection on the fabric substrate, as clearly indicated by <b>horizontal</b> <b>flame</b> spread and cone calorimetry tests. Multiple impregnation treatment {{turned out to be more}} performing than the single one, being equal the final add-on achieved. More specifically, the use of multiple impregnations at pH= 4 and 8 allowed achieving self-extinction for 86 and 74 % of the tested samples; in addition, 45 and 25 % reductions of total heat release and heat release rate peak under 35 kW/m 2 have been found with respect to untreated cotton. These findings may be attributed to themorphology of the low molecular size DNA coating, which shows a greater penetration into the microfibrillar surfaces of the component fibres within the fabric and to its higher thermal stability in ai...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work reported here is to assess factors that could affect {{the outcome of a}} proposed open <b>flame</b> <b>test</b> for barrier fabrics (BF-open <b>flame</b> <b>test).</b> The BF-open <b>flame</b> <b>test</b> characterizes barrier effectiveness by monitoring the ignition of a flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) layer placed in contact with the upper side of the barrier fabric, exposed to a burner flame from below. Particular attention is given to the factors that influence the ignitibility of the FPUF, including thermal resistance, permeability, and structural integrity of the barrier fabrics (BFs). A number of barrier fabrics, displaying a wide range of the properties, are tested with the BF-open <b>flame</b> <b>test.</b> Visual observations of the FPUF burning behavior and BF char patterns, in addition to heat flux measurements on the unexposed side of the barrier fabrics, are used to assess the protective performance of the BF specimen under the open <b>flame</b> <b>test</b> conditions.
