5|$|The Moran model assumes {{overlapping}} generations. At {{each time}} step, one individual <b>is</b> <b>chosen</b> to reproduce and one individual <b>is</b> <b>chosen</b> to die. So in each timestep, {{the number of}} copies of a given allele can go up by one, go down by one, or can stay the same. This means that the transition matrix is tridiagonal, which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model than for the Wright–Fisher model. On the other hand, computer simulations are usually easier to perform using the Wright–Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, it takes N timesteps to get through one generation, where N is the effective population size. In the Wright–Fisher model, it takes just one.|$|E
