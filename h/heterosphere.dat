5|$|In the Earth's atmosphere, the {{concentration}} of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million. The concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the Earth's atmosphere escapes into space by several processes. In the Earth's <b>heterosphere,</b> {{a part of the}} upper atmosphere, helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements.|$|E

50|$|Above this {{altitude}} {{lies the}} <b>heterosphere,</b> {{which includes the}} exosphere {{and most of the}} thermosphere. Here, the chemical composition varies with altitude. This is because the distance that particles can move without colliding with one another is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing. This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones, such as oxygen and nitrogen, present only {{near the bottom of the}} <b>heterosphere.</b> The upper part of the <b>heterosphere</b> is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.|$|E

5000|$|The {{homosphere}} and <b>heterosphere</b> {{are defined}} by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface-based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere {{does not depend on}} molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence. This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the turbopause found at about 100 km, the very edge of space itself as accepted by the FAI, which places it about 20 km above the mesopause.|$|E
50|$|The {{turbopause}} {{marks the}} altitude in the Earth's atmosphere below which turbulent mixing dominates. The region below the turbopause {{is known as}} the homosphere, where the chemical constituents are well mixed and display identical height distributions; in other words, the chemical composition of the atmosphere remains constant in this region for chemical species which have long mean residence times. Highly reactive chemicals tend to exhibit great concentration variability throughout the atmosphere, whereas unreactive species will exhibit more homogeneous concentrations. The region above the turbopause is the <b>heterosphere,</b> where molecular diffusion dominates and the chemical composition of the atmosphere varies according to chemical species.|$|E
50|$|The F {{region of}} the {{ionosphere}} {{is home to the}} F layer of ionization, also called the Appleton-Barnett layer, after the English physicist Edward Appleton and New Zealander Miles Barnett. As with other ionospheric sectors, 'layer' implies a concentration of plasma, while 'region' is the volume that contains the said layer. The F region contains ionized gases at a height of around 150-800 km above sea level, placing it in the Earthâ€™s thermosphere, a hot region in the upper atmosphere, and also in the <b>heterosphere,</b> where chemical composition varies with height. Generally speaking, the F region has the highest concentration of free electrons and ions anywhere in the atmosphere. It may be thought of as comprising two layers, the F1-and F2-layers.|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{composition}} is kept almost homogeneous to {{a height of}} approximately 90 km (the homosphere) by mixing; above 100 km (the <b>heterosphere),</b> diffusive separation of the atmospheric constituents occurs. The <b>heterosphere</b> is dominated by two energy sources: solar extreme ultraviolet radiation and the solar wind. Many large variations are observed in this region and they can all be related, directly or indirectly, to variations in the intrinsic intensity of these two sources and to variations in {{the location of the}} sources relative to the observer. Atmospheric models can be successfully constructed in which the temperature and density variations are empirically related to solar and geomagnetic parameters. Some of the more recent findings concerning the structure and variations in the <b>heterosphere</b> are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{atmosphere}} below 100 km {{is often}} referred to as the homosphere; the region above, the <b>heterosphere.</b> In the homosphere, constitutents are mixed, and average molecular weight is constant. In the <b>heterosphere,</b> diffusive separation occurs, and species tend to fractionate; average molecular weight decreases with height. Mixing in the homosphere has its source dynamical (wind) energy. Against this background turbulence, intermittent enhancements of turbulent intensity are observed. Some of these enhancements are long lived [...] for example, a turbulent layer at approximately 86 km altitude seems to be almost a permanent feature of the (global) daytime D region, as oserved by partial reflection. This may well be a delineation of the mesopause level, since long-term radio meteor studies have shown approx. 85 km to be the breakpoint between thermospheric circulation above, and mesospheric circulation below. The use of stratosphere-troposphere (ST) radars in the lower atmosphere, and mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere (MST) and partial-reflection radars in the mesosphere for height/time profiles of turbulent intensity is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} atmospheric regions, {{the distinction}} between homosphere and <b>heterosphere,</b> and changing atmospheric composition are discussed. The validity of the barometric law based on a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, for the major part of a planetary atmosphere and its breakdown in the exosphere due to escape of atmospheric particles is considered. The formation and maintenance of photochemical and diffusion-controlled ionospheric layers are treated. Their applicability to planetary ionospheres is dealt with. The spatial extent of magnetic and nonmagnetic planet ionospheres is investigated. Thermal and nonthermal processes responsible for the mass loss of planetary atmospheres are surveyed...|$|E
40|$|The ATS-F {{satellite}} {{will carry}} two cesium ion thrusters. Cesium is a {{material that is}} not present in the upper atmosphere, and there is concern that the introduction of this material may result in some unexpected behavior. A study has been conducted to assess {{the magnitude of the}} effects that are to be expected. No observable effects were found {{as a result of the}} study. Consideration was given to the origin and destination of the material and the various reactions that could occur. The origin was considered to be anywhere in space from altitudes of about 100 km upward. The probable short term destination is in the form of cesium ions trapped in the earth's magnetic field or as ions and atoms in the <b>heterosphere.</b> The maximum possible number of cesium atoms in the field of view of an earth based observer is of the order of one million per square centimeter, far too few to be observable by visible, near-visible, or radio-frequency means. Further, no phenomena could be found that would result in the occurance of an observable event...|$|E
40|$|The {{turbopause}} {{region is}} characterized by transition from the mean molecular mass (constant with altitude) to the mean mass (dependent on altitude). The former is provided by eddy turbulence, and the latter is induced by molecular diffusion. Competition between these processes provides {{the transition from the}} homosphere to the <b>heterosphere.</b> The turbopause altitude can be defined by equalizing the eddy and molecular diffusion coefficients and can be located in the upper mesosphere or the lower thermosphere. The height distributions of chemical inert gases very clearly demonstrate the transition from turbulent mixing to the diffusive separation of these gases. Using the height distributions of the chemical inert constituents He, Ar, and N 2 given by the MSIS-E- 90 model and the continuity equations, the height distribution of the eddy diffusion coefficient in the turbopause region can be inferred. The eddy diffusion coefficient always strongly reduces in the turbopause region. According to our results, eddy turbulence above its peak always cools the atmosphere. However, the cooling rates calculated with the eddy heat transport coefficient equaled to the eddy diffusion coefficient were found to be much larger than the cooling rates corresponding to the neutral temperatures given by the MSIS-E- 90 model. The same results were obtained for the eddy diffusion coefficients inferred from different experimental data. The main cause of this large cooling is the very steep negative gradient of the eddy heat transport coefficient, which is equal to the eddy diffusion coefficient if uniform turbulence takes place in the turbopause region. Analysis of wind shear shows that localized turbulence can develop in the turbopause region. In this case, eddy heat transport is not so effective and the strong discrepancy between cooling induced by eddy turbulence and cooling corresponding to the temperature given by the MSIS-E- 90 model can be removed...|$|E
