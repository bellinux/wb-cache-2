40|$|BACKGROUND: According to the {{predominant}} view, desmin mutations cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We evaluated {{a family with}} restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) associated with a novel desmin mutation and reviewed recent reports regarding the frequency of RCM in patients with desmin myopathy. METHODS: Cardiovascular examination was performed in three affected and five at-risk members of a family from Poland, histopathologic study of skeletal muscle biopsy was done in a single patient, and functional analysis of mutant desmin protein {{was carried out in}} cultured cells. RESULTS: Cardiovascular assessment led to the diagnosis of RCM in affected family members. Histopathological study of skeletal muscle biopsy revealed features characteristic of desmin myopathy. A novel desmin <b>E</b> <b>413</b> K mutation was identified in each affected family member, but not unrelated controls. The pathogenicity of the <b>E</b> <b>413</b> K mutation was confirmed in transfected cell cultures showing inability of mutant desmin to form a cellular filamentous network or support a pre-existing network formed by other intermediate filaments. Three-dimensional modeling and electrostatic calculations indicated that the <b>E</b> <b>413</b> K mutation located in a functionally unique domain of desmin molecule potentially disrupts intramolecular interactions. Analysis of previously reported observations indicates that RCM in desminopathy patients may be as frequent as DCM. CONCLUSIONS: A novel <b>E</b> <b>413</b> K mutation in desmin caused autosomal dominant RCM rather than DCM. The location of the <b>E</b> <b>413</b> K mutation at a highly conserved end of the alpha-helical rod domain {{may be related to the}} phenotypic differences from the previously described DCM-associated desmin mutations.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The {{clinical}} features of myofibrillar myopathies display a wide phenotypic heterogeneity. To this date, no studies have evaluated this parameter {{due to the}} absence of pertinent animal models. By studying two mutants of desmin, which induce subtle phenotypic differences in patients, we address this issue using an animal model based on the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors carrying mutated desmin cDNA. METHODS: After preparation of the vectors, they were injected directly into the tibialis anterior muscles of C 57 BL/ 6 mice to allow expression of wild-type (WT) or mutated (R 406 W or <b>E</b> <b>413</b> K) desmin. Measurements of maximal force were carried out on the muscle in situ and then the injected muscles were analyzed to determine the structural consequences of the desmin mutations on muscle structure (microscopic observations, histology and immunohistochemistry). RESULTS: Injection of AAV carrying WT desmin results in the expression of exogenous desmin in 98 % of the muscle fibers without any pathological or functional perturbations. Exogenous WT and endogenous desmin are co-localized and no differences were observed compared to non-injected muscle. Expression of desmin mutants in mouse muscles induce morphological changes of muscle fibers (irregular shape and size) and the appearance of desmin accumulations around the nuclei (for R 406 W) or in subsarcolemmal regions of fibers (for <b>E</b> <b>413</b> K). These accumulations seem to occur and disrupt the Z-line, and a strong regeneration was observed in muscle expressing the R 406 W desmin, which is not the case for <b>E</b> <b>413</b> K. Moreover, both mutants of desmin studied here induce a decrease in muscle force generation capacity. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we show that AAV-mediated expression of desmin mutants in mouse muscles recapitulate the aggregation features, the decrease in contractile function and the morphological changes observed in patients with myofibrillar myopathy. More importantly, our results suggest that the R 406 W desmin mutant induces a robust muscle regeneration, which is not the case for the <b>E</b> <b>413</b> K mutant. This difference could help to explain the phenotypic differences observed in patients. Our results highlight the heterogeneous pathogenic mechanisms between different desmin mutants and open the way for new advances in the study of myofibrillar myopathies...|$|E

It has been suggested that mutation in hHb 1 produces a less severe phenotype. We have studied hair keratin genes and clinical features in 18 unrelated pedigrees of monilethrix from Germany, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Portugal, in 13 of which mutations have not previously been identified. By examining the rod domains of hHb 1, hHb 3 and hHb 6, we have identified mutations in nine of the new pedigrees. We again found the glutamine-lysine substitution (<b>E</b> <b>413</b> K) in the helix termination motif of hHb 6 in two families, and in another, the corresponding <b>E</b> <b>413</b> K substitution in the hHb 1 gene. In four families a similar substitution E 402 K was present in a nearby residue. In addition two novel mutations within the helix initiation motif of hHb 6 were found in Scottish and Portuguese cases, in whom the same highly conserved asparagine residue N 114 was mutated to histidine (N 114 H) or aspartic acid (N 114 D) residues, respectively. In four other monilethrix pedigrees mutations in these domains of hHb 1, hHb 3, and hHb 6 were not found. The mutations identified predict a variety of possible structural consequences for the keratin molecule. A comparison of clinical features and severity between cases with hHb 1 and hHb 6 mutations does not suggest distinct effects on phenotype, {{with the possible exception of}} nail dystrophy, commoner with hHb 1 defects.

To determine the {{antimicrobial resistance}} situation in bacteria from Swiss veal calves, faecal samples from 500 randomly selected calves originating from 129 farms were collected at four big slaughterhouses. Samples were cultured for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp. and Campylobacter sp. and isolated strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents by the minimal inhibitory concentration technique using the broth microdilution method. From 100 farms, data on farm management, animal husbandry and antimicrobial treatments of the calves were collected by questionnaire. Risk factors associated with antimicrobial resistance were identified by logistic regression. In total, 467 <b>E.</b> coli, <b>413</b> Enterococcus sp. and 202 Campylobacter sp. were isolated. Of those, 68. 7 %, 98. 7 % and 67. 8 %, respectively, were resistant {{to at least one}} of the tested antimicrobial agents. Resistance was mainly observed to antimicrobials frequently used in farm animals. Prevalence of resistance to antimicrobials important for human treatment was generally low. However, a rather high number of quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter sp. were detected. External calf purchase, large finishing groups, feeding of milk by-products and administration of antimicrobials through feed upon arrival of the animals on the farm significantly increased the risk of antimicrobial resistance at farm level. Participation in a quality assurance programme and injection of a macrolide upon arrival of the animals on the farm had a protective effect. The present study showed that veal calves may serve as a reservoir for resistant bacteria.

Objective : To delineate the pattern of occurrence of communicable diseases so as to enable early identification, followed by appropriate and timely response to outbreaks. Materials and Methods : Reports of listed communicable diseases from various departments and centers of Government Medical College, Chandigarh, involved in clinical care and laboratory diagnosis, were collected by the Department of Community Medicine on a weekly basis. Analysis of surveillance data was done {{for a period of}} 1 year - including reports from March 2005 to February 2006. Statistical Analysis : Percentage, normal test of proportions, time series analysis. Results : Out of 19, 378 cases of various communicable diseases, 11, 575, i. e., more than half, were dealt with by health centers. Thus maximum cases of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) [8, 278 (71. 87 &#x 0025;) ] and acute diarrheal diseases (ADDs) [3, 148 (54. 4 &#x 0025;) ] were dealt with by health centers.

40|$|The Norian Steinmergel-Keuper (SMK) {{represents}} a low-latitude cyclically-bedded playa {{system of the}} Mid-German Basin. We investigated a drilling site (core Morsleben) and sections from marginal positions. Dolomite/red mudstone beds form rhythmic alternations that were associated with varying monsoon activity. Hence, low K/Al ratios of dolomite beds suggest increased chemical weathering of the crystalline hinterland and therefore increased monsoonal rainfall. High K/Al ratios in red mudstone beds reflect increased physical weathering of the hinterlands during dryer periods. Dolomite layers reflect the lake stage (maximum monsoon) while red mudstones indicate the dry phase (minimum monsoon) of the playa cycle. We distinguished five major types of cyclic facies alternations, representing specific facies zones in the playa system. We have implemented spectrophotometry {{as a tool for}} high-resolution cyclostratigraphy. The dense sampling increment (up to 1 cm) allows for the recognition of all orbital frequencies. Sediment colour profiles reveal striking hierarchical cycles from semi-precession (SP, 99 kyr) over precession (P, 19. 8 kyr) and obliquity (O, 36 kyr) to eccentricity (E 1 - 2 109 kyr; <b>E</b> 3, <b>413</b> kyr). A significant about 2 Myr-signal is attributed to the longer-term eccentricity E 4. One monsoonal (precession) cycle includes two carbonate precipitation events. We propose that stratified mudstone and red mudstone are associated with maximum and minimum monsoon during the transition of the solstices in perihelion and aphelion, respectively. The two carbonate precipitation events were most likely created when equinoxes were in perihelion and aphelion, respectively. A sedimentary semi-precession response cycle is a novel finding for the Norian strata. The obliquity signal is attributed to incoming atmospheric moisture from the northeast of the SMK basin. The E 4 cycle controls lake-level changes over long times. Apparently, E 4 is responsible whether or not a threshold value is crossed. Bundles of 109 kyr and 413 kyr in red mudstones suggest a dry system with reduced monsoonal activity. In contrast, humid periods reveal thick layers of dolomite beds, indicating that during those intervals the monsoonal activity was strong enough to prevent the playa system from drying out completely...|$|R

Synthesis of ppGpp was required for transmission, as relA spoT mutants were killed during entry to and exit from macrophages. RelA, which senses amino acid starvation induced by serine hydroxamate, is dispensable in macrophages, as relA mutants spread efficiently. SpoT monitors fatty acid biosynthesis (FAB), since following cerulenin treatment, wild-type and relA strains expressed the flaA transmissive gene, but relA spoT mutants did not.

Simultaneous whole genome transcriptional profiling of both bacterial species in their gut habitat and of the intestinal epithelium, combined with mass-spectrometric analysis of habitat-associated carbohydrates, revealed that the presence of B. longum elicits an expansion in the diversity of polysaccharides targeted for degradation by B. thetaiotaomicron (e. g., mannose- and xylose-containing glycans), and induces host genes involved in innate immunity. Although the overall transcriptome expressed by B. thetaiotaomicron when it encounters B. longum in the cecum is dependent upon the genetic background of the mouse (as assessed by a mixed analysis of variance [ANOVA] model of co-colonization experiments performed in NMRI and C 57 BL/ 6 J animals), B. thetaiotaomicron‚Äôs expanded capacity to utilize polysaccharides occurs independently of host genotype, and is also observed with a fermented dairy product-associated strain, Lactobacillus casei.

Merlin is expressed predominantly as two isoforms that differ at their C-termini owing to alternative splicing of exon 16. By expressing merlin isoform I as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated a clone encoding a region of the cytoskeletal protein beta-fodrin. Confirmation of the merlin-fodrin interaction was provided by using the mammalian two-hybrid system and binding assays in vitro. In addition, these assays and co-immunoprecipitation from mammalian cells revealed that the binding site for fodrin is located in the C-terminal half of merlin at a site that is masked in the native protein. Co-expression of the N-terminus of merlin decreased the interaction of its C-terminus with fodrin, implicating homophilic interactions of merlin isoform I in masking the fodrin-binding site. The effect of three disease-associated mutations on the merlin-fodrin interaction and merlin dimerization was also investigated. The mutation L 535 P, but not L 360 P or K <b>413</b> <b>E,</b> significantly decreased the merlin-fodrin interaction but not dimerization, indicating that the tumour suppressor ability of merlin might reside partly in its ability to interact with the cytoskeleton via fodrin...|$|R
40|$|One {{essential}} {{prerequisite for}} genotypic drug susceptibility testing of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the phenotypic characterization of mutations {{identified in the}} viral protein kinase gene UL 97 and the viral DNA polymerase gene UL 54 regarding their quantitative impact on drug susceptibility. We developed a new method for phenotypic characterization of UL 54 mutations with regard to polymerase activity, viral replication, and drug susceptibility. To determine the most suitable viral indicator gene, enhanced green fluorescence protein was C-terminally fused to the HCMV early-late protein UL 83 (pp 65) or the late proteins UL 32 (pp 150) and UL 99 (pp 28), resulting in reporter viruses vTB 65 g, vTB 150 g, and vTB 28 g. vTB 65 g proved to be superior to the other constructs due to its favorable signal-to-noise ratio and was therefore used to establish the optimum conditions for our assay. The UL 54 E 756 K and D <b>413</b> <b>E</b> mutations were introduced into vTB 65 g by markerless bacterial artificial chromosome mutagenesis, resulting in virus strains vE 756 Kg and vD 413 Eg. The drug susceptibility phenotypes of vE 756 Kg and vD 413 Eg were comparable to those previously reported. Further-more, we found a reduced replicative fitness of vE 756 Kg by measuring fluorescence intensity {{as well as by}} conventional virus growth kinetics. Decreased fluorescence signals of vE 756 Kg- and vD 413 Eg-infected cells at late times of infection suggested a reduced polymerase activity, which was confirmed by real-time PCR quantification of the newly synthesized viral DNAs. This new fluorescence-based assay is a highly reproducibl...|$|R

CEMS spectra are satisfactorily fitted by alpha-Fe and an interface layer of random alpha-(Fe, Si) alloy of 20 % of the 57 Fe layer thickness {{on both sides}} of the individual Fe layers. Kerr loops show a fully compensated AF magnetic layer structure. Prompt X-ray reflectivity curves show the structural ML Bragg peak and Kiessig oscillations corresponding to a bilayer period and total film thickness of 4. 12 and 41. 2 nm, respectively. Grazing incidence nuclear resonant Theta- 2 Theta scans and time spectra (<b>E</b> = 14. <b>413</b> keV, lambda = 0. 0860 nm) were recorded in different external magnetic fields (0 < B-ext < 0. 95 T) perpendicular to the scattering plane. The lime integral delayed nuclear Theta- 2 Theta scans reveal the magnetic ML period doubling. With increasing transversal external magnetic field, the antiferromagnetic ML Bragg peak disappears due to Fe layer magnetization canting, the extent of which is calculated from the fit of the time spectra and the Theta- 2 Theta scans using an optical approach. In a weak external field the Fe layer magnetization directions are neither parallel with nor perpendicular to the external field. We suggest that the interlayer coupling in [Fe/FeSi](10) varies with the distance from the substrate and the ML consists of two magnetically distinct regions, being of ferromagnetic character near substrate and antiferromagnetic closer to the surface. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We have {{suggested}} previously {{that both the}} negatively and positively charged residues of the highly conserved Glu/Asp-Arg-Tyr (E/DRY) motif {{play an important role}} in the activation process of the alpha(1 b) -adreneric receptor (AR). In this study, R 143 of the E/DRY sequence in the alpha(1 b) -AR was mutated into several amino acids (Lys, His, Glu, Asp, Ala, Asn, and Ile). The charge-conserving mutation of R 143 into lysine not only preserved the maximal agonist-induced response of the alpha(1 b) -AR, but it also conferred high degree of constitutive activity to the receptor. Both basal and agonist-induced phosphorylation levels were significantly increased for the R 143 K mutant compared with those of the wild-type receptor. Other substitutions of R 143 resulted in receptor mutants with either a small increase in constitutive activity (R 143 H and R 143 D), impairment (R 143 H, R 143 D), or complete loss of receptor-mediated response (R 143 E, R 143 A, R 143 N, R 143 I). The R <b>413</b> <b>E</b> mutant displayed a small, but significant increase in basal phosphorylation despite being severely impaired in receptor-mediated response. Interestingly, all the arginine mutants displayed increased affinity for agonist binding compared with the wild-type alpha(1 b) -AR. A correlation was found between the extent of the affinity shift and the intrinsic activity of the agonists. The analysis of the receptor mutants using the allosteric ternary complex model in conjunction with the results of molecular dynamics simulations on the receptor models support the hypothesis that mutations of R 143 can drive the isomerization of the alpha(1 b) -AR into different states, highlighting the crucial role of this residue in the activation process of the receptor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Several {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} the use of Roche 454 sequencing technology for de novo transcriptome analysis. Low error rates and high coverage also allow for effective SNP discovery and genetic diversity estimates. However, genetically diverse datasets, such as those sourced from natural populations, pose challenges for assembly programs and subsequent analysis. Further, estimating the effectiveness of transcript discovery using Roche 454 transcriptome data is still a difficult task. Results Using the Roche 454 FLX Titanium platform, we sequenced and assembled larval transcriptomes for two butterfly species: the Propertius duskywing, Erynnis propertius (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) and the Anise swallowtail, Papilio zelicaon (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae). The Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) generated represent a diverse sample drawn from multiple populations, developmental stages, and stress treatments. Despite this diversity, > 95 % of the ESTs assembled into long (> 714 bp on average) and highly covered (> 9. 6 √ó on average) contigs. To estimate the effectiveness of transcript discovery, we compared the number of bases in the hit region of unigenes (contigs and singletons) {{to the length of}} the best match silkworm (Bombyx mori) protein [...] this "ortholog hit ratio" gives a close estimate on the amount of the transcript discovered relative to a model lepidopteran genome. For each species, we tested two assembly programs and two parameter sets; although CAP 3 is commonly used for such data, the assemblies produced by Celera Assembler with modified parameters were chosen over those produced by CAP 3 based on contig and singleton counts as well as ortholog hit ratio analysis. In the final assemblies, 1, <b>413</b> <b>E.</b> propertius and 1, 940 P. zelicaon unigenes had a ratio > 0. 8; 2, 866 E. propertius and 4, 015 P. zelicaon unigenes had a ratio > 0. 5. Conclusions Ultimately, these assemblies and SNP data will be used to generate microarrays for ecoinformatics examining climate change tolerance of different natural populations. These studies will benefit from high quality assemblies with few singletons (less than 26 % of bases for each assembled transcriptome are present in unassembled singleton ESTs) and effective transcript discovery (over 6, 500 of our putative orthologs cover at least 50 % of the corresponding model silkworm gene). </p...|$|R

A infectividade dos v√≠rus, em diferentes per√≠odos de armazenamento, foi testada em plantas de datura e glutinosa, para se determinar a longevidade in vitro. Constatou-se que, quando guardados em baixas temperaturas,os extratos preservam por mais tempo a infectividade dos v√≠rus. No caso de datura e glutinosa, por exemplo, resultados positivos foram obtidos at√© <b>413</b> <b>e</b> 282 dias de armazenamento, respectivamente, em congelador. Entretanto, com rela√ß√£o √†s esp√©cies de Chenopodium testadas, mesmo alguns extratos rec√©m-preparados conduziram a resultados negativos, confirmando a presen√ßa de inibidores de infec√ß√£o viral nestas plantas.

EMV-Al (Abelia strain), EMV-Sc (Scottish strain), EMV-ts (type-strain) and TWNV (tomato white necrosis virus) which induce symptoms in Chenopodium amaranticolor, C. murale, C. quinoa (Family Chenopodiaceae), Datura stramonium, Lycopersicon esculentum and Nicotiana glutinosa (family Solanaceae) plants were maintened in leaf extrats obtained from these species. The extracts were kept at room temperature, at about 5 +C and at about 20 +C. Sap containing viruses were periodically inoculated in test-plants (datura and glutinosa) {{in order to}} determine the longevity in vitro. It was verified that viruses remained infective for longer periods if extratcs were kept at low temperatures as compared with those maintained at room temperature. In the case of sap juice from datura and glutinosa plants, EMV isolates remained infective respectively up to 413 and 282 days at about - 20 +C. However, many negative results were obtained with Chenopodium species even when freshly prepared leaf juice were used. This fact may be understood by the presence of virus inhibitors in these plants. Only C. quinoa is a valuable host to be used to preserve four EMV isolates, although for a short period (more than 53 and less than 80 days).

40|$|Embora a anemia falciforme (AF) resulte da homozigosidade de uma √∫nica muta√ß√£o, no codon 6 do locus da ?-globina, fenotipicamente, essa doen√ßa √© muito heterog√™nea, de modo que diferentes pacientes podem apresentar evolu√ß√µes cl√≠nicas significativamente distintas. As complica√ß√µes nestes pacientes normalmente s√£o decorrentes de acometimento {{vascular}} causado pelo ac√∫mulo de hem√°cias falcizadas nos vasos sangu√≠neos. Um dos eventos que vem sendo associados a complica√ß√µes em diversas doen√ßas √© o mecanismo de estresse oxidativo, o qual apresenta- se exacerbado em pacientes com AF. Dentre as fontes de estresse oxidativo nestes pacientes est√£o os eventos de vaso-oclus√£o e isquemia reperfus√£o, os quais s√£o muito frequentes. O estresse oxidativo em n√≠veis elevados pode danificar v√°rias mol√©culas e posteriormente prejudicar o organismo. Alguns polimorfismos em enzimas envolvidas na via de estresse oxidativo foram associados com doen√ßas vasculares como, hipertens√£o, doen√ßa arterial coron√°ria, doen√ßa arterial perif√©rica. Considerando que os pacientes com AF apresentam complica√ß√µes decorrentes de acometimento vascular, esses polimorfismos podem estar contribuindo para as v√°rias manifesta√ß√µes cl√≠nicas e, consequentemente, para a gravidade da doen√ßa. Este projeto se prop√¥s a avaliar tr√™s polimorfismos em genes envolvidos no mecanismo de estresse oxidativo em pacientes com AF e testar a associa√ß√£o com o grau de gravidade da doen√ßa. Os polimorfismos analisados foram o C 242 T e - 930 A/G no gene CYBA <b>e</b> o - <b>413</b> T/A no gene HMOX- 1. Os gen√≥tipos foram identificados por meio das t√©cnicas de PCR e sequenciamento direto, e os escores de gravidade foram obtidos atrav√©s de √≠ndices de severidade, em 169 pacientes. O gen√≥tipo AA do polimorfismo - 930 A/G apresentou-se associado com escores baixos de gravidade, obtidos atrav√©s do √≠ndice pedi√°trico, nas crian√ßas com anemia falciforme. O gen√≥tipo CT do polimorfismo C 242 T esteve associado com crises √°lgicas e o gen√≥tipo TT do polimorfismo - 413 T/A mostrou-se associado a n√≠veis elevados de HbF, atrav√©s de an√°lises dos dados de todos os pacientes. De acordo com este estudo, sugerimos novos marcadores gen√©ticos, os quais podem estar direta ou indiretamente envolvidos com a gravidade da doen√ßa em pacientes com AF na popula√ß√£o brasileira. Estudos futuros em grandes coortes necessitam ser realizados para confirmar esses resultados. Although {{sickle cell}} anemia (SCA) results from the homozygosity for a single mutation at codon 6 of the ?-globin locus, phenotypically this disease is very heterogeneous, so that different patients may have significantly different clinical outcomes. The complications in these patients are usually caused by vascular impairment caused by the accumulation of sickled erythrocytes in the blood vessels. One event that {{has been associated with}} complications in several diseases is oxidative stress, which has increased levels in SCA patients. Among the sources of oxidative stress in these patients are the vaso-occlusion and ischemia reperfusion events, which are very common. Oxidative stress at high levels can damage various molecules and subsequently damage the organism. Some polymorphisms of enzymes involved in the oxidative stress pathway have been associated with vascular diseases as: hypertension, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease. Considering that the complications in SCA patients are due to vascular involvement, these polymorphisms may be contributing to the various clinical manifestations and consequently to the severity of the disease. This project proposes to evaluate three polymorphisms in genes involved in the mechanism of oxidative stress in SCA patients and test the association with the severity of the disease. The analyzed polymorphisms were C 242 T and - 930 A/G in the CYBA gene and the - 413 T/A in the HMOX- 1 gene. The genotypes were identified through PCR and direct sequencing, and severity scores were obtained by severity indexes in 169 patients. The AA genotype of the - 930 A/G polymorphism was associated with low severity scores, obtained from the pediatric index, in children with {{sickle cell anemia}}. The CT genotype of the C 242 T polymorphism was associated with pain crisis and the TT genotype of the - 413 T/A polymorphism was associated with high levels of HbF, after analyzing the data from all patients. According to this study, new genetic markers can be suggested, which may be, directly or indirectly, involved with disease severity in patients with SCA in the Brazilian population. Future studies in larger cohorts have to be conducted to confirm these results...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. March 2016. Major: Food Science. Advisor: Devin Peterson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 188 pages. Flavor research has long utilized targeted methods {{to understand and}} identify flavor active compounds in food systems. While this has advanced the field, there are limitations to only investigating compounds that are directly flavor active. Flavor is a multi-model sensation consisting of {{a complex set of}} chemical stimuli that are perceived as a mixture, and more inclusive investigation can supplement targeted methods. Increasing the number of analytes allows for more comprehensive understanding of food systems which can lead to new discoveries. This dissertation illustrates the development of untargeted analytical methods to identify flavor active materials in citrus extracts that relate to aging. This dissertation uses an untargeted workflow to identify age related compounds, and establish their sensory significance through recombination modeling and structural elucidation. Preprocessing methods were optimized using an uneven multi-level two factor design of experiment and further untargeted modeling. Signal to noise ratio and thresholding were varied during pre-processing which produced data sets varying in size from > 50, 000 features to 500. Part per billion differentiation was achieved using both unsupervised (principle component analysis) and supervised (projection to latent structures) multivariate modeling, indicating a high quality analytical and statistical framework. 	To understand how a food system ages ethanol extracts from different citrus varietals (Navel, Mineola, and Valencia) were aged and chemically profiled using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. Machine learning (Random forest) and multivariate (projection to latent structures) models were implemented to model the age of the extracts. Varietal difference was leveraged and models were adapted to understand the age of the samples, rather than model the varietal differences. Statistically important compounds were isolated using food grade mass spectrometry directed fractionation. These isolated compounds underwent sensory evaluation using descriptive analysis in both a Solvent Assisted Flavor Evaporation (SAFE) extract of orange juice and a volatile orange flavor (VOF) model beverage. The isolated compounds showed significant impact in both tasting mediums. All compounds identified increased with sample age, and when evaluated in the SAFE extract showed significant decrease in orange character. Compound 413 showed a significant increase in cooked character and green bean character and a suppression of floral character. While compound 383 showed a significant increase in green bean character. In the volatile orange flavor (VOF) compound <b>413</b> <b>E</b> 2 and compound 457 showed an increase in sweetness over the control, which was the only noted change to the ‚Äòtaste‚Äô attributes noted among the compounds isolated. Compound 383 showed a decrease in cooked character over the control. Compound 661 showed suppression of floral aroma over the sample blank. Compounds that positively correlated with age were reported to increase the cooked and green bean character and suppression of floral and orange character notes, which indicate degradation in flavor quality, or a deviation from fresh character. Structural elucidation using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1 H, HMBC, TOCSY, HSQC) and accurate mass (TOF) revealed compound 693 was Nomilin 17 -O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, while compounds 383 and 661 were shown to be novel compounds. The systematic name of compound 661 was (5 -(((2 R, 3 S, 4 R, 5 R) - 4, 5 -dihydroxy- 3 -((3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl- 5 -oxohexanoyl) oxy) - 6 -(4 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) - 2, 6 -dimethoxyphenoxy) tetrahydro- 2 H-pyran- 2 -yl) methoxy) - 3, 3 -dimethyl- 5 -oxopentanoic acid. There are two 3 -Hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaric acid units and a dihydrosinapyl alcohol moiety bonded to a sugar backbone. Compound 383 was identified as (3, 5, 5 -trimethyl- 4 -((E) - 3 -oxo- 4 -(((2 S, 3 S, 4 S, 5 S, 6 R) - 3, 4, 5 -trihydroxy- 6 -(hydroxymethyl) tetrahydro- 2 H-pyran- 2 -yl) oxy) but- 1 -en- 1 -yl) cyclohex- 2 -en- 1 -one) and suggested reaction product of a sugar and terpene moiety. 	The final piece of this research was to characterize aging in lemon extracts and identify contextual variable interactions associated statistically significant compounds. Six types of lemon extracts which were aged and profiled using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. The data was modeled using 9 different machine learning algorithms [...] Random Forest produced the highest quality initial model, which went through further development and tuning. Within the random forest model number of trees, features tried at each node, max number of terminal samples were all optimized, as was the final model using both gini and entropy for decision criteria. The final model had a training fit of 0. 951 and test score of 0. 928 (+/- 0. 0049). Statistically important variables from this analysis were investigated for contextual data interactions that would illuminate data trends for further study. This approach aims to help provide additional value from untargeted flavoromics and better understand contextual interactions in data sets...|$|R
40|$|Aims: 1) To {{study the}} {{frequency}} and distribution of acute coronary syndromes {{and other forms of}} ischemic heart disease (IHD) as the cause of hospitalization in the Portuguese National Health Service (NHS); 2) To compare mortality from the various forms of IHD by gender in NHS hospitals in the period 1997 - 2001. Material and Methods: Annual in-patient data based on Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) sent by each NHS hospital to the Informatics and Financial Management Institute (IGIF) using ICD- 9 -CM codes. After quality control of the data by IGIF, the Statistics Department of the Directorate- General of Health (GDS) studied the distribution of codes 410 - 414 by age group and gender. Measures of central tendency were studied and the Student‚Äôs t test was used to evaluate the significance of {{differences between men and women}} in the distribution of IHD in-patients. Results: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (410) caused 7618 hospitalizations (5271 male, 2347 female) in 1997. In 2001 the number was 10 047 (6693 male, 3354 female). Other acute and subacute forms of IHD (411) were 4005 (2522 male, 1483 female) and 4100 (2618 male, 1482 female) respectively during 1997 and 2001. Angina pectoris (413) and other forms of chronic ischemic heart disease (414) were 2479 (1543 male, 936 female) and 11 293 (7951 male, 3342 female) during 1997, and 1993 (1212 male, 781 female) and 12 029 (8277 male, 3752 female) during 2001. The age (meanSD) of in-patients coded as 410 was 63. 1 ¬± 12. 9 / 63. 9 ¬± 17. 0 years in men and 72. 4 ¬± 11. 6 / 73. 1 ¬± 11. 1 years in women over the period 1997 - 2001. Age differences by gender were statistically significant (p < 0. 001). Age for code 411 was similar to AMI in men (62. 9 ¬± 11. 1 years and 63. 8 ¬± 11. 7 years respectively in 1997 and 2001), but was lower in AMI cases in women (68. 4 ¬± 10. 6 years and 69. 3 ¬± 10. 7 years respectively in 1997 and 2001). AMI mortality was higher in 1997 (11. 6 % male, 22. 1 % female) than in 2001 (9. 9 % male, 19. 8 % female). Conclusions: Acute coronary events are the cause of approximately half of the hospitalizations for IHD, in both sexes. The frequency of every form of IHD in men is higher than in women, and hospitalization occurs nine years earlier on average. Between 1997 and 2001, hospitalizations for IHD increased by over 10 %, mainly for AMI (32 %), although with no significant increase in age. Nevertheless, the prognosis for AMI in in-patients has improved in both sexes.

These semantics are in aid of efforts {{such as the}} Alfred Wegener Institute's Frontiers in Arctic Marine Monitoring programme. Knowledge was harvested from numerous resources - such as the review by Boetius et al. (2015, Nat Rev Microbiol 13 : 677 ‚Äì 690) - which are cross referenced in each class. Efforts to align with existing resources have been initiated, e. g. : [URL] Past and ongoing work related to this project is organised in project cryophile. This work has also motivated the general development of the environmental process hierarchy. A number of other requests, such as that for fissures (see # 466) are also bundled in this release. As usual, the hyperlinks to the terms will be live once OntoBee runs its import cycle over the weekend; however, the PURLs are valid immediately. To better axiomatise the new classes and enhance existing ones, we have also imported numerous classes from other OBO projects, detailed below.
