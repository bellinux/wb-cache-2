The texts call Islam and [...] "cultural Marxism" [...] the enemy and advocate the deportation of all Muslims from Europe based on the model of the Beneš decrees, while also claiming that feminism exists to destroy European culture.

Thadden was personally close to the British Union Movement leader Oswald Mosley, on whose initiative the NPE was founded, and was attracted to his concept of Europe a Nation. He specifically denied any accusations of neo-Nazism levelled at him, arguing that he was a supporter of conservative nationalism. However, he was frequently labelled a neo-Nazi due to his prominent opposition to the notion of any German guilt for the Second World War.|$|R
40|$|After {{significant}} declarations: the Sorbonnne declaration (1988), Lisbon declaration (1997) and Bologna declaration (1999), {{there has}} emerged {{a need for}} fundamental changes in the educational systems of many European countries.

Globalization has introduced more radical changes in the educational process than those envisaged by the <b>European</b> <b>declarations.</b> The paper will theoretically consider the syllabus of the mother tongue in the Republic of Serbia {{and the consequences of}} the adaptation of our educational system to the European one.

40|$|The {{case of the}} Norwegian mass murderer, Anders Breivik, {{has created}} {{enormous}} challenges for forensic psychiatry and has also sparked controversy and differences inside this discipline.

Psychosis, from a structural point of view, seems to properly fit both Breivik and the logic that supports it. At the end of the paper we will suggest a diagnosis that in our opinion suits more accurately the actions and intentions of this enigmatic person. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{three of}} the dominating discourses Anders Behring Breivik used in his compendium, the official title of which is 2083 – A <b>European</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Independence, also known as Breivik's Manifesto. It is believed Breivik posted his Manifesto on the Internet shortly before the attacks in Norway in July, 2011. The number 2083 stands for the year when the "Western European Civil War" {{was expected to be}} completed, all traitors executed, and all Muslims deported from Europe. This article will discuss dominating discourses in the Manifesto, seen from a background of a European multicultural backlash, in which the political far-right movement is increasing. Furthermore, this article will end with a discussion of education and the importance of analysis of such phenomena within different subjects...|$|R

Attempts soon followed to co-ordinate this growth in pan-European nationalism, although the European Social Movement and the New European Order were loose networks and a more concrete alliance was called for. The idea came to fruition at the Conference of Venice in 1962 when the leaders of the Union Movement, the Deutsche Reichspartei, the Italian Social Movement, Jeune Europe and the Mouvement d'Action Civique came together to form this group.

40|$|No {{taxation}} without representation! It was the British Crown s {{attempt to}} tax tea that {{laid the groundwork}} for the American Revolution in the 18 th century and, ultimately, the Declaration of Independence. This was neither the first nor the last example in history, but perhaps the most famous one to demonstrate the close connection between tax sovereignty and the civil nation state. Today, sovereignty in matters of taxation is still {{regarded as one of the}} core functions of the nation state. But is it still the nation state s own domain This essay argues that, at least with respect to the European Union, the answer is no. It shows that the EU tax regime influences national policies in important ways, and imposes significant constraints on national tax sovereignty. It will also show that the lost sovereignty at the national level can be found again at the European level. Is it time to advocate a <b>European</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Dependence...|$|R
