6000|$|... 276. And {{because this}} {{question}} {{lies at the}} very root {{of the organization of}} the system of instruction for our youth, I venture boldly to express the surprise and regret with which I see our schools still agitated by assertions of the opposition of Naturalism to Invention, and to the higher conditions of art. Even in this very room I believe there has lately been question whether a sculptor should look at a real living creature of which he had to carve the image. I would answer in one sense,--no; that is to say, he ought to carve no living creature while <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> look at it. If {{we do not know what}} a human body is like, we certainly had better look, and look often, at it, before we carve it; but if we already know the human likeness so well that we can carve it by light of memory, we shall not need to ask whether we ought now to look at it or not; and what is true of man is true of all other creatures and organisms--of bird, and beast, and leaf. No assertion is more at variance with the laws of classical as well as of subsequent art than the common one that species should not be distinguished in great design. We might as well say that we ought to carve a man so as not to know him from an ape, as that we should carve a lily so as not to know it from a thistle. It is difficult for me to conceive how this can be asserted in the presence of any remains either of great Greek or Italian art. A Greek looked at a cockle-shell or a cuttlefish as carefully as he looked at an Olympic conqueror. The eagle of Elis, the lion of Velia, the horse of Syracuse, the bull of Thurii, the dolphin of Tarentum, the crab of Agrigentum, and the crawfish of Catana, are studied as closely, every one of them, as the Juno of Argos, or Apollo of Clazomenæ. Idealism, so far from being contrary to special truth, is the very abstraction of speciality from everything else. It is the earnest statement of the characters which make man man, and cockle cockle, and flesh flesh, and fish fish. Feeble thinkers, indeed, always suppose that distinction of kind involves meanness of style; but the meanness is in the treatment, not in the distinction. There is a noble way of carving a man, and a mean one; and there is a noble way of carving a beetle, and a mean one; and a great sculptor carves his scarabæus grandly, as he carves his king, while a mean sculptor makes vermin of both. And it is a sorrowful truth, yet a sublime one, that this greatness of treatment cannot be taught by talking about it. No, nor even by enforced imitative practice of it. Men treat their subjects nobly only when they themselves become noble; not till then. And that elevation of their own nature is assuredly not to be effected by a course of drawing from models, however well chosen, or of listening to lectures, however well intended.|$|E

Dean graduates, but the experts also believe that Dale's medical problem will prevent her from continuing. Because only one person may leave per episode, Dale is forced to make the final choice. She ultimately chooses to let Dean go free over her own health, making Dean the next to leave the Driver Rehabilitation Centre.|$|E

But then he soon realizes that <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> get rid of the foes. Then he sees that Lucy had the rest of the Gumballs (she enjoys Gumballs so much), and has grown way bigger than anyone else. She grabs the rest of the stinkbugs, stuffs them back inside the spaceship, and hurls them back to Saturn. Fudgie and Cupcake find [...] "Super-Shrinking Saltwater Taffy" [...] and feed it to the two cousins. Once they are back to normal, they throw Sergeant Stinkbug in jail.|$|E

5000|$|Quasi-quotation {{is used to}} {{indicate}} (usually in more complex formulas) that the φ and [...] "φ" [...] in this sentence are related things, that one is the iteration of {{the other in a}} metalanguage.

However, <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to talk about}} sentences with arbitrary predicates in them, and thus, the quasiquotes provided the mechanism to make such statements. Quine had hoped that, by avoiding variables and schemata, he would minimize confusion for the readers, as well as staying closer to the language that mathematicians actually use.|$|R

Then promises that he will see her at their high school reunion {{and if they are}} both still single that he will marry her. Beth smiles and tells him it's a deal. After Beth leaves with Treece and Cammy, Rich proclaims to Denis that he might be gay after all, or perhaps bisexual (plus jokes that after last night's antics he's still more heterosexual than Denis). Denis informs Rich that he was just playing about waiting until the reunion to talk to Beth again. He tells Rich {{that he is going to}} leave Beth a message on Facebook and ask her out. Rich disagrees with him and tells Denis that he should make a grand gesture by going to her house with a boom box and wait for her.

5000|$|The {{first section}} of Sobre los ángeles (1927-8) {{consists}} almost entirely of poems on the loss of love and the poet’s consequent feeling of being emptied. The metres are short and contain many irregular lines while still retaining an overall regularity of assonance and rhythm. The central section explores a sense of betrayal by religion. His childhood beliefs were dispelled very early by his fanatical aunts and the Jesuits of the Colegio but <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> find something to believe in to dispel his feelings of emptiness and rootlessness. The third and final section sees a radical change of style. The short lines of the previous sections give way to much longer lines that grow into the tangled webs of surreal imagery {{that he was to}} use in his next few works - Sermones y moradas, Con los zapatos puestos…., and Yo era un tonto……. The key to understanding this collection is probably the poem [...] "Muerte y juicio" [...] (‘Death and Judgment’). [...] The child has lost his innocence and belief {{in a way that was}} almost predestined before his birth. He recalls one specific incident from his schooldays, when the day-boys played truant and went to the beach to bathe naked and masturbate. They were spotted by a Jesuit teacher and subjected to agonising and humiliating sermons convincing them that they would lose their souls by doing such things.|$|E

In response, Wilmots stated: [...] "I {{wanted to send}} him a clear signal. Just as Zakaria Bakkali, Adnan is a very promising youngster and I would like to integrate him into the group. I {{do not want to}} force his hand. I respect his choice and consider discussing with Adnan and his family". On 16 October, discussing rumours that suggested Januzaj would choose to represent Belgium if he is included in the 2014 FIFA World Cup squad, Wilmots declared: [...] "The boy was born in Belgium, should he say that he wants to play for Belgium - from there, there is no haggling. I'm not going to play that game. If you're at the top level in Manchester or elsewhere, show me your skills and if I need you I will call. I make no promises, to Januzaj or any person". The following day, Januzaj's father told Kosovar TV station KTV that he did not like the Belgian federation's approach: [...] "I am not blackmailing them as I'm not asking for any national team to get my son. It is them who want Adnan. ... you have to be professional in this issue. Belgium should follow the rules as well. I run his career in a sportive sense, and I have Belgium managers running the legal issues." ...|$|E

50|$|Wright cut a {{noticeable}} figure, with his huge frame (188 cm and over 100 kg) and golden blond hair. In the post-war era, all VFL clubs were valiantly scouring the country, looking for big men capable of dominating the rucks and giving their team {{first use of}} the ball at ball-ups and boundary throw-ins. The boundary throw-in disappeared from the game after a 1925 rule change, but the rule reverted to its original form during the war, therefore increasing the emphasis on ruck play. The Tigers could see Wright's rare ability but, due to his truncated early career, felt <b>he</b> <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> learn the subtleties of the game.
