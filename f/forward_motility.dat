40|$|The Panamanian Golden Frog (Atelopus zeteki, Anura: Bufonidae), an {{endemic species}} from Panama, is {{critically}} endangered and {{believed to be}} extinct from the wild. Infectious disease, habitat destruction and pet trade are among the major causes of the populations decline. Conservation initiatives in Panama and the US have established captive breeding programs for the species {{but there is still}} much to be learned about its reproductive physiology to manage and sustain populations using Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs). The main objectives of this dissertation were: 1) characterize the general sperm parameters and assess the effect of hormonal stimulation on <b>motility,</b> <b>forward</b> progressive <b>motility,</b> DNA integrity, sperm morphology and seasonality; 2) identify the effect of extracellular conditions, mainly dilution and temperature, on <b>motility,</b> <b>forward</b> progressive <b>motility,</b> duration of motility, morphology and DNA integrity; and 3) evaluate the effect of cryoprotectants on <b>motility,</b> <b>forward</b> progressive <b>motility</b> and sperm DNA integrity before and after freezing. Results demonstrated that: 1) A. zeteki sperm morphology is similar to that described in other Bufonids; the species successfully produces high quality spermatozoa when stimulated with intraperitoneal injection of Amphiplex, GnRH and hCG; hormonal stimulation is not detrimental to the motility parameters, cell morphology or DNA integrity; and, there is no seasonal effect on the response to the hormonal stimulation. These results indicate that the use of hormone treatments can be included in captive breeding programs to safely collect good quality sperm; 2) dilution of spermic urine in water highly reduces sperm <b>motility,</b> <b>forward</b> progressive <b>motility,</b> DNA and morphological integrity while storage of spermic urine at 4 °C preserves sperm quality for at least 46 min after collection; and 3) some recovery of viable A. zeteki spermatozoa after cryopreservation can be achieved by equilibrating the ARS-diluted samples for 5 min at 4 °C in CPA 3 -REY, using step-wise cooling before plunging the samples in LN 2. Collective results offer missing information on the reproductive biology of the male A. zeteki and lead to the application of ARTs for the captive management of this charismatic but critically endangered species...|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to improve semen quality during cryopreservation process. Total motility, <b>forward</b> <b>motility,</b> acrosome integrity, live spermatozoa, and normal spermatozoa were measured as semen quality. In Experiment 1, the effects of seminal plasma removal were analyzed by using two different extenders (GE and FE). The removal of seminal plasma gave higher and significant (P< 0. 05) effect in the total motility, <b>forward</b> <b>motility,</b> and live spermatozoa after cryopreservation. For two different extenders, however, the differences were not observed on the semen quality. In Experiment 2, three different washing solutions (namely, phosphate buffered saline, normal saline and Tris-based extender) were tested to evaluate the effects of semen quality after cryopreservation. Tris-based extender (TCG) conferred the highest (P< 0. 05) sperm quality values in the total motility, <b>forward</b> <b>motility,</b> and live spermatozoa after cryopreservation. In Experiment 3, the effects of different centrifugation regimes (3000 × g for 3 min, 1600 × g for 10 min, 800 × g for 15 min) were evaluated on Boer semen quality.

Mg++-dependent Forskolin responsive form of transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmAC) of goat spermatozoa was probed for its involvement in FMSF action. Dideoxyadenosine, a selective inhibitor of tmACs, was used to identify the role of this enzyme in the scheme of FMSF-signaling. Involvement of the a-subunit of G-protein in this regard has been inspected using GTPcS. Participation of protein kinase A (PKA) and tyrosine kinase was checked using IP 20 and genistein, respectively.

In an in silico search for germ cell-specific genes, Zpbp 1 and its novel paralog, Zpbp 2, were discovered and confirmed to be expressed only in the testes in both mice and humans. To study the in vivo functions of both ZPBP proteins, we disrupted Zpbp 1 and Zpbp 2 in mice. Males lacking ZPBP 1 were sterile, with abnormal round-headed sperm morphology and no <b>forward</b> sperm <b>motility.</b> Ultrastructural studies demonstrated that absence of ZPBP 1 prevents proper acrosome compaction, resulting in acrosome fragmentation and disruption of the Sertoli-spermatid junctions. Males null for ZPBP 2 were subfertile, demonstrated aberrant acrosomal membrane invaginations, and produced dysmorphic sperm with reduced ability to penetrate zona pellucida. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of ZPBPs from amphibians, birds, and mammals suggests that these paralogous genes coevolved to play cooperative roles during spermiogenesis.

Here, we found that protease activity in the sperm head was potent to widely digest substrates beneath the sperm. The protease activity measured by fluorescein thiocarbamoyl-casein digestion was detected in the supernatant of the sperm after the AR and the activity was inhibited by 4 -(2 -aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), an inhibitor for serine or cysteine protease, suggesting the release of serine and/or cysteine proteases by AR. In an in silico analysis of the testes, acrosins and 20 S proteasome were identified as possible candidates of the acrosomal proteases.

However, excessive circulating serotonin levels may induce harmful effects in the male reproductive system. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether the levels of urinary 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIIA), a major serotonin metabolite, correlate with different classical seminal parameters. Methods Human ejaculates were obtained from 40 men attending infertility counselling and rotating shift workers by masturbation after 4 - 5 days of abstinence. Urinary 5 - HIIA concentration was quantified by using a commercial ELISA kit. <b>Forward</b> <b>motility</b> was assessed by a computer-aided semen analysis (CASA) system. Sperm concentration was determined using the haemocytometer method. Sperm morphology was evaluated after Diff-Quik staining, while sperm vitality was estimated after Eosin-Nigrosin vital staining. Results Our results show that urinary 5 -HIIA levels obtained from a set of 20 volunteers negatively correlated with sperm concentration, <b>forward</b> <b>motility,</b> morphology normal range and sperm vitality. On the other hand, we checked the relationship between male infertility and urinary 5 -HIIA levels in 20 night shift workers. Thus, urinary 5 -HIIA levels obtained from 10 recently-proven fathers were significantly lower than those found in 10 infertile males. Additionally, samples from recent fathers exhibited higher sperm concentration, as well as better <b>forward</b> <b>motility</b> and normal morphology rate. Conclusions In the light of our findings, we concluded that high serotonin levels, indirectly measured as urinary 5 -HIIA levels, appear to play a role as an infertility determinant in male subjects. </p...|$|E

In collected milt; volume of milt, sperm motility percentage, the duration of <b>forward</b> <b>motility,</b> sperm concentration and sperm pH were evaluated. On 9 January 2003; 20 % of the males were spermiating, increasing to 100 % in early February and dropping to 40 % by early April. Sperm motility percentage showed a significant improvement during the spawning season (P< 0. 05). Sperm concentration was significantly (P< 0. 01) improved in milt collected from late of January to early of March. The pH in sperm was significantly (P< 0. 001) higher in February than at any other time of the spawning season. Milt volume and the duration of <b>forward</b> <b>motility</b> showed no obvious differences. In conclusion, the results show that season has a significant influence on semen quality in young rainbow trouts corresponding to spawning season in hot arid. Sperm of good quality was especially collected in february and in March...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 18 hybrid strain Martini male rabbits were {{randomly}} {{divided into three}} experimental groups. The animals {{in the first and}} second groups drank water with 0. 1 and 0. 5 g/l of lycopene addition (B and C groups, respectively), while water without any supplement was administered to the control group rabbits (A group) for 8 weeks. Semen was collected from 18 bucks (6 animals/group) for 5 consecutive weeks. Ejaculate volume was determined by graduated test tube and sperm concentration was calculated by Neubauer chamber. Sperm motility was evaluated subjectively by a phase contrast microscope and <b>forward</b> progressive <b>motility</b> (FPM) scored 1 ÷ 4 (low-high). Sperm viability was assessed by nigrosin/eosin (N/E) staining procedure. At the end of the semen evaluation period, 20 females per group were inseminated on day 11 post partum with a pool of semen collected from each experimental group. Data showed that the highest level of lycopene (C group) resulted in a significantly greater volume of ejaculate and total number of sperm than in the control group (0. 98 vs. 0. 78 ml and 364 vs. 227, P 0. 05). This study shows the positive effects of lycopene supplementation on semen production and refrigerated semen characteristics. Lycopene supplementation of drinking water could have interesting applications in field conditions, although further research into the role of this antioxidant in animal production is needed. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{optimised}} artificial fertilisation and oocyte storage conditions in Limnodynastes tasmaniensis (Myobatrachidae). Data on general reproductive biology, {{the effect of}} sperm motility and concentration, medium osmolality and oocyte storage on artificial fertilisation success are presented. Egg number was most strongly correlated with bodyweight (r = 0. 819). Sperm yield was correlated with testes weight (r = 0. 827), which was strongly correlated with snout–vent length (r = 0. 772). Optimal artificial fertilisation occurred in 0 – 7 mOsm kg– 1 amphibian Ringer, similar to ranid, bufonid and hylid species. High fertilisation rates were achieved using spermatozoa with little <b>forwards</b> progressive <b>motility</b> at comparatively low concentrations (3 × 104 sperm cells mL– 1) and with no relationship between percentage sperm motility and fertilisation success (correlation of fertilisation rate with sperm motility after activation: r = – 0. 145). Oocytes stored in 5 mOsm kg– 1 solutions showed no significant decline in fertilisability after 2 h, showing that swelling of the jelly surrounding the eggs does not prevent sperm from fusing with the oocyte in this species. Fertilisability of oocytes was extended to > 4 h in medium to high osmolality solutions (124 – 271 mOsm kg– 1). These data allow for the future use of L. tasmaniensis in developing assisted reproductive technology protocols for foam-nesting myobatrachid species, {{many of which are}} now threatened with extinction in the wild...|$|R
40|$|Endogenous {{nitric oxide}} (NO) is an {{important}} functional mediator in several physiological systems, including the reproductive system. However, when generated in excessive amounts for long periods, mainly during immunological reactions, NO is cytotoxic and cytostatic for invading microbes, {{as well as for}} the cells generating it and the tissues present around it. Since infertility associated with urogenital tract infection in males and females is also accompanied by reduced sperm motility and viability, it is possible that reduced fertility in these patients is due to NO-induced sperm toxicity. We therefore evaluated the direct effects of NO, chemically derived from S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, 0. 012 - 0. 6 mM) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 0. 25 - 2. 5 mM), on the motility and viability of human spermatozoa. Furthermore, we tested whether inhibition of NO synthesis prevents sperm motility and viability by incubating washed total cells present in the semen (spermatozoa, round cells) with N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME), a NO synthesis inhibitor. Treatment of purified spermatozoa with SNAP or SNP decreased <b>forward</b> progressive sperm <b>motility</b> and straight line velocity, and also increased the percentage of immotile spermatozoa in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the percentage of immotile spermatozoa positively correlated with the percentage of dead spermatozoa. In contrast to freshly prepared SNAP, SNAP preincubated for 48 h had no effect on the motility and viability of the spermatozoa. Furthermore, as compared to untreated controls, a significantly higher percentage of <b>forward</b> progressive sperm <b>motility</b> as well as viability (P < 0. 05) was maintained in washed semen incubated with L-NAME (0. 15 mM). Seminal plasma concentrations of nitrite-nitrate (stabile metabolites of NO/ 106 spermatozoa correlated positively (P < 0. 05) with the percentage of immotile spermatozoa. Our results suggest that NO can cause sperm toxicity as well as inhibit sperm motility. In conclusion, excessive NO synthesis in response to infection and inflammation could be an important factor contributing to functional change of the spermatozoa, leading to their dysfunction and to infertilit...|$|R
