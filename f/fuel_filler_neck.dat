The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> or access panel, and is secured by means of snap fasteners or cord and loops inside the compartment.

2500|$|The 1973 {{model was}} highly popular, {{due to the}} {{previous}} year's improvements, {{as well as the}} new four bolt 15" [...] with newly designed flat hubcaps, which replaced the original [...] "bowl type" [...] covers. The <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> was moved from inside the trunk to the right front quarter panel, just above the fender. Inside, a matte black padded dashboard was introduced, resulting in greater comfort and less eye fatigue. The wiper/washer control was also moved from a button on the dashboard to a lever on the right of the steering column. Later that year, additional improvements appeared, including a four-spoke black steering wheel.|$|E
2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} saw more {{revisions}} to the Torino line. Government safety regulations now required that the rear bumpers must also meet the [...] standard, so all Torinos had the rear bumper and tail lamp panel redesigned. The new rear bumpers were much larger, square shaped, and sat lower on the body. No longer was there a roll pan located below the bumper as on the 1972–73 models. The tail lights were beveled rectangular wrap-around units which eliminated the need for rear side marker lights. The <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> moved to a position above the bumper, rather than below as on 1972–73 models. It was now behind an access door {{in the center of}} the tail light panel just below the trunk lock, rather than behind the licence plate. The front fascia for Gran Torinos was revised for 1974. The new grille was of similar shape to the 1973, but was slightly larger and divided into 8 equal sized vertical sections. The grille had a much finer mesh pattern with vertical parking lamps in the outer sections embossed with the grille pattern on the surface of the lens. The grille emblem was changed and the front bumper was revised to be slightly more pointed, and the bumper guards were moved more towards the center of the bumper compared to 1973 models. The license plate bracket was relocated to the driver's side of the bumper. Torino models carried on with the same front fascia as 1973; however, its front bumpers were revised similarly to the Gran Torinos and the license plate remained in the center. Gran Torino Broughams featured a full width red lens across the rear, but the centre portion was non-functional. Broughams and Squires had a stand-up hood ornament inplace of the emblem on the grille.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. National Fire Protection Association {{does most}} of the {{research}} and code writing to address the potential for explosions of gasoline vapor. The customer fueling area, up to [...] above the surface, normally does not have explosive concentrations of vapors, but may from time to time. Above this height, where most <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>necks</b> are located, there is no expectation of an explosive concentration of gasoline vapor in normal operating conditions. Electrical equipment in the fueling area may be specially certified for use around gasoline vapors.|$|R
50|$|A body lift is {{a common}} and {{affordable}} method to run larger tires on a vehicle.(For body lift involving flight, such as airships or missiles, see Aerodynamic lift)It involves installing spacers where the body mounts to the frame {{in order to increase}} the clearance between tires and the body. This is often used to allow the placement of a larger motor for an engine swap. Body lifts can be built at home from components, or they can be purchased as kits from manufacturers. Properly installed kits are not easily noticed, while home built kits often look incomplete. Complete kits include brackets to realign the bumpers to match the body, and gap guards are purchased to cover the frame. Depending on the model of vehicle, they may also include steering shaft extensions and extensions for <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>necks.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Bladder tanks, or fuel cells, are {{reinforced}} rubberized bags {{installed in}} a section of aircraft structure designed to accommodate {{the weight of the}} fuel. The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. Many high-performance light aircraft, helicopters and some smaller turboprops use bladder tanks. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks. One major plus side is the ability to utilise as much of the aircraft as possible to store fuel.|$|E

Later that year, additional improvements appeared, including a four-spoke black steering wheel.The 1974 models brought further modifications. A 1.6l engine producing 44 HP SAE (50 PS DIN) replaced the previous 1.5l. The front fenders were enlarged, new front turn signals (identical to the ones on American spec Beetles) were added, and round, enlarged taillights were introduced, one year after their appearance on German Beetles (except the 1973 VW 1200). The engine cover remained unchanged, except it no longer had an emblem. Inside, the front seats were re-designed, and the interior colour was changed from gray to black. Also, the front hood release lever was relocated inside the glovebox, as on 1969 and later German Beetles.|$|E
40|$|Known {{handling}} {{units are}} designed as headers which travel on a gantry crane for the filling process. The filling nozzle and the filling tube {{are attached to}} the header, the filling tube is pulled out of the header for filling and inserted in the <b>fuel</b> tank <b>filler</b> <b>neck.</b> If the vehicle moves while the filling tube is approached and inserted, there is a risk that the filling tube no longer enters into the <b>filler</b> <b>neck.</b> In order to introduce the filling tube easily into the <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> of the vehicle, the handling unit is fitted with a docking element to which a position detector is assigned; the position detector is connected to a control unit on the handling unit. Before inserting the filling tube into the <b>filler</b> <b>neck,</b> the docking element is docked onto the fuel tank cap. The docking element can be guided precisely to the tank cap and attached to it by means of the position detector. The handling unit is also suitable if there are relative movements between the vehicle and the unit while t he filling tube is approached...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, vehicle {{emissions}} {{have shown a}} negative impact on environment and human health. A new strategy has been used by automakers to reduce a vehicle’s weight which significantly reduce fuel consumption and C 02 emissions. A very light car consumes very less fuel as it needs to overcome less inertia, decreasing the required power to movie the vehicle. Reducing weight is the easiest way to increase fuel economy and making it by just 10 % can increase its efficiency 6 to 8 percent. For a normal scale 80 % of vehicles weight is shared among chassis, power train and other exterior components. Almost 60 % of the vehicles weight is comprised of steel and the remaining is with cast and extruded aluminum and magnesium alloys. Our main aim is to look for the parts like Fuel tank holder, <b>Fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>neck,</b> Turbo inlet assembly, and Brake lines, Dash board frame which are made from steel and replace them with extruded aluminum alloys, to analyze a conventional rear wheel aluminum drive shaft {{and replace it with a}} new design and with a new aluminum alloy. The current project involves dismantling an automobile and looking for feasible steel parts and making samples, analyzing the hardness of the samples. These parts are optimally analyzed using Ansys Finite element analysis tool, these parts are subjected to the constraints such as three-point bending, tensile testing, hydrostatic pressure and also torsional stress action on the drive shaft, the deformation and stress are observed in these parts. The results show the current steel parts can be replaced with 3000 series aluminum alloy and the drive shaft can be replaced with new design with 6061 -T 6 Al-alloy which decreases 25 % of the shaft weight...|$|E
