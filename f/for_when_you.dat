500|$|Most reviewers {{wrote of}} VVVVVVs {{high level of}} difficulty. [...] McWhertor found that [...] "the game's trial and error moments can seriously test one's patience." [...] However, several critics noted that the game's {{challenge}} is made less frustrating due to its numerous checkpoints, {{as well as the}} player's ability to retry after dying as many times as needed. [...] These additions made VVVVVV [...] "not unforgiving", according to IGN staff writer Samuel Claiborn, while still being [...] "old-school in its demands of player dedication". Independent reviewer Declan Tyson said that he feels [...] "victimised by the game's criminally unforgiving collision detection and over-enthusiastically sensitive controls" [...] but that [...] "it's all worth it <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> reach the next checkpoint and feel that split second of relief".|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Cosby began {{promoting}} Jell-O pudding for General Foods. Cosby said comedian Jack Benny, whose {{program the}} brand sponsored, {{was the only}} previous spokesman for Jell-O, but Kate Smith, Lucille Ball, and Andy Griffith have also pitched the brand. In previous campaigns since the brand's launch in 1902, it was targeted towards parents rather than to children, a practice from which the company departed in 2001. Cosby's early commercials were unscripted, but later were written by comedy writers. Cosby disagreed with the writers, who wanted to say the food was <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were [...] "hungry"; Cosby thought {{there was not enough}} substance to satisfy hunger and wanted to use the word [...] "appetite". In 1979, General Foods introduced Pudding Pops, the company's first frozen dessert product. With Cosby as spokesperson, it sold US$100 million its first year. After introducing Gelatin Pops and frozen Fruit Bars, the company's frozen desserts sales reached $300 million. Cosby was engaged to promote the flagging Jell-O gelatin product line in the mid-1980s, when General Foods introduced a holdable Jell-O product called [...] "Jigglers". Sales increased seven percent {{during the first year of}} the promotion.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{where the}} band had found success with Laid, reviews for Wah Wah were more favourable, despite the {{commercial}} {{failure of the}} album in the country. Dimitri Ehrlich of Entertainment Weekly graded the album [...] "B+", saying the album shows [...] "James at its most inspired and unpredictable" [...] and called the album [...] "a joyride of a record." [...] The Harvard Crimson said [...] "Wah Wah is not ear candy, like much of Laid; it's meant to get inside your head, {{and that may be}} a bit more than you're in the market <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> slap down your money at HMV." [...] Rolling Stone were also favourable to the album.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, the Hexagram {{can be seen}} as the {{combination}} of the four elements. Fire is symbolized as an upwards pointing triangle, while Air (its elemental opposite) is also an upwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. Water is symbolized as a downwards pointing triangle, while Earth (its elemental opposite) is also a downwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. When you combine the symbols of Fire and Water, a hexagram (six-pointed star) is created. The same follows <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> combine the symbols of Air and Earth. [...] When you combine both hexagrams, you get the double-hexagram. Thus, a combination of the elements is created.|$|E
2500|$|Petra {{also used}} the record to defuse the backmasking controversy, which had begun to spread into Christian music, as {{conservative}} church leaders accused Christian artists of hiding subliminal messages {{that could only be}} heard when records were played in reverse. Inserting a blatant piece of backmasking in the break between the title track and hard rocker [...] "Judas' Kiss," [...] the band's message was less than subtle. Played in reverse, the backmasked portion stated: [...] "What are you looking for the devil <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> oughta be looking for the Lord?" [...] It was not the first – nor would it be the last – time Petra weighed in against critics of contemporary Christian music.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Christian {{rock group}} Petra {{included}} in their song [...] "Judas Kiss", from the 1982 album More Power to Ya, the message, [...] "What {{are you looking}} for the devil <b>for,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> ought to be looking for the Lord?" [...] Bloodhound Gang's 1996 controversy-begging track [...] "Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)" [...] mocked the Judas Priest controversy directly, and included the backmasked phrase [...] "Devil child, wake up and eat Chef Boyardee Beefaroni". The band Mindless Self Indulgence released a song titled [...] "Backmaskwarning!", which contains the forward lyrics [...] "Play that record backwards / Here's a message yo for the suckas / Play that record backwards / And go fuck yourself". The backwards messages in the song include, [...] "clean your room", [...] "do your homework", [...] "don't stay out too late", and [...] "eat your vegetables".|$|E
