Although he has {{generally}} tried to keep his personal life private, Booker {{has in the past}} described himself as a [...] "straight male" [...] and has said that he is trying to date more in hopes of finding someone to settle down with. [...] In a 1990 column in the Stanford Daily, Booker admitted that as a teenager he had [...] "hated gays". [...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, [...] "So what does <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> I am? So be it. I hope you are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I'm straight." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the use of}} strikebreakers increased, the Supreme Court {{was forced}} to address several issues arising from the practice. One key issue was motive: Did <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> the use of strikebreakers was {{motivated}} by anti-union animus? In Radio Officers' Union v. NLRB, 347 U.S. 17 (1954), the Supreme Court held that proof of motive was indeed required. However, no proof of motive was needed where employer conduct [...] "inherently" [...] encouraged or discouraged union membership. A second issue involved use of the whipsaw strike. As unionization in an industry spread, unions encouraged employers to bargain as a group. To discourage employers from breaking away from the group, unions developed the whipsaw strike—-in which the union would strike one employer at a time, one after another. Employer groups would counter the whipsaw strike by locking out all workers at all employers belonging to the group, and using strikebreakers to provide temporary or permanent replacements. The question before the Court was whether the lockout was an unfair labor practice. In NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449 ("Buffalo Linen Supply Co."), 353 U.S. 87 (1957), the Court held that such a lockout was not a ULP.|$|E

50|$|A {{microsite}} however, {{will most}} likely not lower PPC cost, because it {{will most likely}} not improve Quality Score. There are nine factors that go into Quality Score, {{one of them is}} the quality of the landing page (how relevant the content is, transparent it is, and the ease of navigation). This factor does not look at the entire website (which can be a common misconception on Quality Score), only the page chosen to land people on from their search query. Thus <b>it</b> does not <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> the website covers a broad spectrum of items, or only one, <b>it</b> <b>matters</b> <b>if</b> that one page's content is specific to that person's search. And considering the other eight factors that go into Quality Score, the main website should typically result in better Quality Scores than a microsite.|$|R
