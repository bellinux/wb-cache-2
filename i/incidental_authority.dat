40|$|Dear Mr. Payne: Please find {{enclosed}} {{an application}} from the City of San Diego for <b>Incidental</b> Harassment <b>Authority</b> by Level B harassment for {{small numbers of}} harbor seals, possibly sea lions and elephant seals during demolition and construction activities of the Children's Pool Lifeguard Station at La Jolla, California. We appreciate your help in preparation {{and look forward to}} the timely and safe accomplishment of the required activities under Sections 101 (a) (5) (A) and (D) of the MMPA (16 U. S. C. 1361 et seq.). The City has pursued open and interactive internal, as well as, public process to develop the plans which include mitigation considering the pinnipeds present at nearby sites (e. g. no construction activities during harbor seal pupping and weaning season and visual barriers to shield activities from beach view). Our staff and our consultant, Dr. Doyle Hanan, have conferred with your staff at Southwest Region as the City progressed through its procedures of planning and approval of this project (please see attached Negative Declaration). Sincerely...|$|R
5000|$|Implied Authority of Contract {{is a legal}} term. In {{contract}} law, it is {{the implied}} ability of an individual to make a legally binding contract {{on behalf of a}}n organization, by way of uniform or interaction with the public on behalf of that organization. When a person is wearing a uniform or nametag bearing the logo or trademark of a business or organization; or if that person is functioning in an obviously authorized capacity on behalf of a business or organization, that person carries an Implied Authority of Contract. Implied Authority is authority that is not express or written into the contract, but which the agent is assumed to have in order to transact the business of insurance for the principal. Implied <b>authority</b> is <b>incidental</b> to express <b>authority</b> since not every single detail of an agent's authority can be spelled out in the written contract.|$|R

5000|$|Implied actual {{authority}}, {{also called}} [...] "usual authority", is authority an agent has {{by virtue of}} being reasonably necessary to carry out his express authority. As such, it can be inferred by virtue of a position held by an agent. For example, partners have authority to bind the other partners in the firm, their liability being joint and several, and in a corporation, all executives and senior employees with decision-making authority by virtue of their position have authority to bind the corporation.Other forms of implied actual authority include customary authority. This is where customs of a trade imply the agent to have certain powers. Wool buying industries it is customary for traders to purchase in their own names.Also <b>incidental</b> <b>authority,</b> where an agent is supposed to have any authority to complete other task which is necessary and incidental to completing the express actual authority. This must be no more than necessary ...|$|E
5000|$|In both Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents (2000) and Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett (2001), the Court {{held that}} Congress had {{exceeded}} {{its power to}} enforce the Equal Protection Clause. In both those cases, Rehnquist was in the majority that held discrimination by states based upon age or disability (as opposed to race or gender) need satisfy only rational basis review as opposed to strict scrutiny.Though the Eleventh Amendment by its terms applies only to suits against a state by citizens of another state, the Rehnquist Court often extended this principle to suits by citizens against their own states. One such case was Alden v. Maine (1999), in which the Court explained that the authority to subject states to private suits does not follow {{from any of the}} express enumerated powers in Article One of the Constitution, and therefore the Alden Court looked to the Necessary and Proper Clause to see if that Clause authorized Congress to subject the states to lawsuits by the state's own citizens. Rehnquist agreed with Justice Kennedy's statement that such lawsuits were not [...] "necessary and proper": [...] Nor can we conclude that the specific Article I powers delegated to Congress necessarily include, by virtue of the Necessary and Proper Clause or otherwise, the <b>incidental</b> <b>authority</b> to subject the States to private suits as a means of achieving objectives otherwise within the scope of the enumerated powers.|$|E
5000|$|In Hans v. Louisiana, the Supreme Court of the United States {{held that}} the Eleventh Amendment re-affirms that states possess {{sovereign}} immunity and are therefore immune from being sued in federal court without their consent. In later cases, the Supreme Court has strengthened state sovereign immunity considerably. In Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, the court explained that we have understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand {{not so much for}} what it says, but for the presupposition of our constitutional structure which it confirms: that the States entered the federal system with their sovereignty intact; that the judicial authority in Article III is limited by this sovereignty, and that a State will therefore not be subject to suit in federal court unless it has consented to suit, either expressly or in the [...] "plan of the convention." [...] States may consent to suit, and therefore waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity by removing a case from state court to federal court. See Lapides v. Board of Regents of University System of Georgia. (Citations omitted). In Alden v. Maine, the Court explained that while it has sometimes referred to the States’ immunity from suit as [...] "Eleventh Amendment immunity," [...] that phrase is a convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer, because the sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from nor is limited by the terms of the Eleventh Amendment. Rather, as the Constitution's structure, and its history, and the authoritative interpretations by this Court make clear, the States’ immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution, and which they retain today (either literally or by virtue of their admission into the Union upon an equal footing with the other States) except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain constitutional Amendments. Writing for the court in Alden, Justice Anthony Kennedy argued that in view of this, and given the limited nature of congressional power delegated by the original unamended Constitution, the court could not [...] "conclude that the specific Article I powers delegated to Congress necessarily include, by virtue of the Necessary and Proper Clause or otherwise, the <b>incidental</b> <b>authority</b> to subject the States to private suits as a means of achieving objectives otherwise within the scope of the enumerated powers." ...|$|E
