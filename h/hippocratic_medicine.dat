5|$|One of the {{strengths}} of <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>medicine</b> was its emphasis on prognosis. At Hippocrates' time, medicinal therapy was quite immature, and often {{the best thing that}} physicians could do was to evaluate an illness and predict its likely progression based upon data collected in detailed case histories.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>medicine</b> {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only were}} herbal texts being produced, but also other medieval texts that {{discussed}} {{the importance of}} the humors. Hildegard of Bingen, a well known abbess, wrote about <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Medicine</b> using humoral theory and how balance and imbalance of the elements affected the health of an individual, along with other known sicknesses of the time, and ways in which to combine both prayer and herbs to help the individual become well. She discusses different symptoms that were common to see and the known remedies for them.|$|E
5000|$|An early {{description}} {{consistent with}} migraines {{is contained in}} the Ebers papyrus, written around 1500 BCE in ancient Egypt. In 200 BCE, writings from the <b>Hippocratic</b> school of <b>medicine</b> described the visual aura that can precede the headache and a partial relief occurring through vomiting.|$|R
50|$|In <b>Hippocratic</b> {{and medieval}} <b>medicine,</b> tears were {{associated}} with the bodily humors, and crying was seen as purgation of excess humors from the brain. William James thought of emotions as reflexes prior to rational thought, believing that the physiological response, as if to stress or irritation, is a precondition to cognitively becoming aware of emotions such as fear or anger.|$|R
50|$|Between 1993 and 2000 {{he served}} as President of the International Hippocratic Foundation of Kos. During his term the Foundation inaugurated, {{under the auspices of}} President Karamanlis, the <b>Hippocratic</b> Museum of <b>medicine</b> and hosted a number of {{international}} activities including the First Medical Olympics (a quadrennial medical symposium of notable international practitioners and academics) that took place on the island of Cos in 1996.|$|R
25|$|Charity, {{the driving}} {{principle}} behind these healing centers, encouraged the early Christians {{to care for}} others. The cities of Jerusalem, Constantinople, and Antioch contained {{some of the earliest}} and most complex hospitals, with many beds to house patients and staff physicians with emerging specialties. Some hospitals were large enough to provide education in medicine, surgery and patient care. St. Basil (AD 330-79) argued that God put medicines on the Earth for human use, while many early church fathers agreed that <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>medicine</b> could be used to treat the sick and satisfy the charitable need to help others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hippocratic</b> <b>medicine</b> {{represented}} learned {{medical practice}} {{beginning with the}} Hippocratic Corpus having been written down, therefore requiring practitioners to be literate. The written treatises within the Corpus are varied, incorporating medical doctrine from any source the Greeks came into contact with. At Alexandria in Egypt, the Greeks learned the art of surgery and dissection,; the Egyptian skill in these arenas far surpassed those of Greeks and Romans due to social taboos on {{the treatment of the}} dead. The early Hippocratic practitioner Herophilus engaged in dissection and added new knowledge to human anatomy in the realms of the human nervous system, {{the inner workings of the}} eye, differentiating arteries from veins, and using pulses as a diagnostic tool in treatment. Surgery and dissection yielded much knowledge of the human body that Hippocratic physicians employed alongside their methods of balancing humors in patients. The combination of knowledge in diet, surgery, and medication formed the foundation of medical learning upon which Galen would later greatly contribute.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hippocratic</b> <b>medicine</b> was {{humble and}} passive. The {{therapeutic}} approach {{was based on}} [...] "the healing power of nature" [...] ("vis medicatrix naturae" [...] in Latin). According to this doctrine, the body contains within itself the power to re-balance the four humours and heal itself (physis). Hippocratic therapy focused on simply easing this natural process. To this end, Hippocrates believed [...] "rest and immobilization [...] of capital importance." [...] In general, the <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>medicine</b> was very kind to the patient; treatment was gentle, and emphasized keeping the patient clean and sterile. For example, only clean water or wine were ever used on wounds, though [...] "dry" [...] treatment was preferable. Soothing balms were sometimes employed.|$|E
50|$|The Ottoman State {{had been}} {{weakened}} by Turkish Islamism. Conservatism was strong both {{in government and}} society. Although the empire was transforming itself, the <b>Hippocratic</b> school of <b>medicine,</b> Ptolemaic astronomy and geography, and other branches of medieval studies were still in force. Many of these studies had been first amended, then discarded in western Europe with the Age of Enlightenment. Except for European military technology, the penetration of European ideas and practices into Turkey was slow.|$|R
5000|$|The ancient Greeks {{also made}} {{important}} discoveries {{in the medical}} field. Hippocrates was a physician of the Classical period, and {{is considered one of}} the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine. He is referred to as the [...] "father of medicine" [...] in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the <b>Hippocratic</b> school of <b>medicine.</b> This intellectual school revolutionized medicine in ancient Greece, establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields that it had traditionally been associated with (notably theurgy and philosophy), thus making medicine a profession.|$|R
40|$|In the <b>Hippocratic</b> era <b>medicine</b> was {{characterized}} {{by the work of}} men who were general practitioners in the fullest sense of the word. Unfortunately in the Middle Ages the growth of the Universities and the prevalent habit of thought which favoured speculation, dogma and logical argument rather than experimental observation and research {{led to the development of}} a sort of horizontal division in medicine. Above the line was the physician who eventually became so occupied with logic and dogma, and so impressed with the dignity of his profession that he did not deign to undertake surgical procedures, but hired an inferior being, a mere craftsman, to do them for him. These craftsmen–below the horizontal line-eventually became known as barber-surgeons, and in those days surgery was rather a dubious trade. The result of this complete separation of medicine and surgery was disastrous. “Medicine without the guidance of anatomy, chemistry or the microscope became a mass of unproved theory, and surgery a rule of thumb for ignorant crafts-men. Progress in either art was almost impossible” (Parker) ...|$|R
500|$|<b>Hippocratic</b> <b>medicine</b> was {{notable for}} its strict professionalism, discipline, and {{rigorous}} practice. The Hippocratic work On the Physician recommends that physicians always be well-kempt, honest, calm, understanding, and serious. The Hippocratic physician paid {{careful attention to}} all aspects of his practice: he followed detailed specifications for, [...] "lighting, personnel, instruments, positioning of the patient, and techniques of bandaging and splinting" [...] in the ancient operating room. He even kept his fingernails to a precise length.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hippocratic</b> <b>medicine</b> and its {{philosophy}} are {{far removed}} from that of modern medicine. Now, the physician focuses on specific diagnosis and specialized treatment, {{both of which were}} espoused by the Knidian school. This shift in medical thought since Hippocrates' day has caused serious criticism over the past two millennia, with the passivity of Hippocratic treatment being the subject of particularly strong denunciations; for example, the French doctor M. S. Houdart called the Hippocratic treatment a [...] "meditation upon death".|$|E
500|$|However, the {{achievements}} of the writers of the Corpus, the practitioners of <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>medicine,</b> and the actions of Hippocrates himself were often commingled; thus very little is known about what Hippocrates actually thought, wrote, and did. Hippocrates is commonly portrayed as the [...] of the ancient physician, and credited with coining the Hippocratic Oath, still relevant and in use today. He is also credited with greatly advancing the systematic study of clinical medicine, summing up the medical knowledge of previous schools, and prescribing practices for physicians through the Hippocratic Corpus and other works.|$|E
500|$|Hippocrates of Kos (Hippokrátēs ho Kṓos; [...] 460 – [...] 370 BC), {{also known}} as Hippocrates II, was a Greek {{physician}} of the Age of Pericles (Classical Greece), and {{is considered one of}} the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine. He is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Father of Medicine" [...] in recognition of his lasting contributions to the field as the founder of the <b>Hippocratic</b> School of <b>Medicine.</b> This intellectual school revolutionized medicine in ancient Greece, establishing it as a discipline distinct from other fields with which it had traditionally been associated (theurgy and philosophy), thus establishing medicine as a profession.|$|R
40|$|Hippocratic {{physicians}} {{sought to}} establish themselves as medical authorities in ancient Greece. An {{examination of the}} deontological texts of the Hippocratic corpus reveals that the Hippocratics created a medical authority based on elite male characteristics. The key quality of the Hippocratic physician was sōphrosunē, a quality closely associated with men and used in the differentiation of genders in the Greek world. Women were not believed to innately possess this quality and so their healing activities were restricted within the Hippocratic framework. Women’s healing activities are only mentioned in the corpus when women {{are involved in the}} treatment of other women or self-treatment. The <b>Hippocratic</b> construction of <b>medicine</b> as a male domain fit within a Classical cultural framework, as the cultural anxiety concerning women healers and women’s use of pharmaka are evident in both Greek myth and literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{roots of}} modem {{medicine}} {{can be traced}} back to the 5 th century BC when <b>Hippocratic</b> rational <b>medicine</b> originated on the Greek islands of Cos and Cnidos. In this study we examine the way in which practitioners conducted their profession in Graeco-Roman times, as well as their training. Medical training was by way of apprenticeship with recognized doctors, but no qualifying examinations existed and the standard of practice thus varied enormously. Even in the Roman era the vast majority of medical doctors were Greek and in private practice as itinerant physicians. Civic doctors in the paid service of local communities appeared in Greek society from the 5 th century BC onwards, but much later in Rome - probably as late as the 4 th century AD. Rome’s unique contributions to medicine lay in public health measures (e. g. their aqueducts, public baths and sewages systems) and an excellent medical service for their armies and navy. Hospitals (valetudinaria) were established for military purposes and for slaves on large Roman estates from the 1 st century BC, but civic hospitals for the general public originated as late as the 4 th century AD. The Greek medical schools of Cos and Cnidos were eventually superseded by the school of Alexandria in Egypt and towards the end of the Roman Empire by that of Carthage in northern Africa. Its gradual demise in the Christian era lowered the curtain on original medical endeavours during antiquity...|$|R
500|$|After Hippocrates, {{the next}} {{significant}} physician was Galen, a Greek who lived from AD 129 to AD 200. Galen perpetuated <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>medicine,</b> moving both forward and backward. In the Middle Ages, the Islamic world adopted Hippocratic methods and developed new medical technologies. After the European Renaissance, Hippocratic methods were revived in western Europe and even further expanded in the 19th century. Notable {{among those who}} employed Hippocrates' rigorous clinical techniques were Thomas Sydenham, William Heberden, Jean-Martin Charcot and William Osler. Henri Huchard, a French physician, said that these revivals make up [...] "the whole history of internal medicine." ...|$|E
2500|$|The four humors of <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>medicine</b> {{are black}} bile ( [...] , [...] ), [...] yellow bile ( [...] , [...] ), phlegm ( [...] , [...] ), and blood ( [...] , [...] ), and each {{corresponds}} {{to one of}} the traditional four temperaments. A humor is also referred to as a cambium (pl. cambia or cambiums).|$|E
2500|$|In most countries, it {{is a legal}} {{requirement}} for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered. In general, this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization, which may ask the applicant to pass exams. This restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards. It is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against charlatans that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain. While the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in [...] "evidence based", Western, or <b>Hippocratic</b> <b>Medicine,</b> they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health.|$|E
40|$|The ancient {{holistic}} medical systems {{help the}} patient by balancing the “elements” {{of the human}} character. This work aims {{to understand the nature}} of these elements and the process of the physician balancing them. Using the concept of poly-ray cosmology we see that the medical systems from ancient India, China and Greek basically share the same inner structure and also the same logic of the treatment processes. We analyze the double concept of yin-yang, the Ayurvedic triadic concepts of Pitta, Kapha and Vata, the four elements of <b>Hippocratic</b> humoral <b>medicine,</b> and the five elements of Chinese medicine, and find that each of these conceptual frameworks make up a “theory” or model of the world that is a perfect wholeness, allowing the physician to interpret the world and his patient in order to identify the imbalances of his or her character that need to be treated. Independently of the system this can be a palliative treatment, if energies are only balanced in present time, or a causal cure if the physician is using the similarity principle to take his patient into regression back to the events in the personal history that originally created the imbalances (the traumas). To help the patient back to the traumas he is exposed to a small dose of the original harming stimulus; this can be an internal process like visualization supported by the therapist words, or an external process provoked by his actions. If the physician is balancing the elements without such a healing of the patient's existential core this can still momentarily help the patient by alleviating the symptoms, but it will not have a permanent effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose and}} nature of {{management}} scholarship is contested, evidenced by debates about the ‘academic–practitioner divide’ and attendant remedies for addressing it, including mode 2 and mode 3 research, engaged scholarship, evidence-based management and design science. In this paper the authors argue that, without a culture of dialogical encounter, management scholarship {{will never be able}} to emerge from its adolescence, and management will not develop into the profession that it should and can become. The central proposition is that the highly fragmented landscape of management (practice and scholarship) lacks sufficient capability for dialogue among the plurality of actors situated across that landscape. Developing the dialogical capability ultimately required to break this fundamental impasse demands, first, a shared sense of purpose and responsibility (akin to the <b>Hippocratic</b> Oath in <b>medicine)</b> and, second, institutional entrepreneurship to establish more and better ‘trading zones’. Drawing on the philosophy of pragmatism, the authors further this endeavour by identifying and proposing key elements of a statement of shared purpose and responsibility. Finally, they explore the nature and characteristics of successful trading zones, highlighting particular examples that have already been created in management studies...|$|R
500|$|The <b>Hippocratic</b> {{school of}} <b>medicine</b> {{described}} well the ailments {{of the human}} rectum and the treatment thereof, despite the school's poor theory of medicine. Hemorrhoids, for instance, though believed {{to be caused by}} an excess of bile and phlegm, were treated by Hippocratic physicians in relatively advanced ways. Cautery and excision are described in the Hippocratic Corpus, in addition to the preferred methods: ligating the hemorrhoids and drying them with a hot iron. Other treatments such as applying various salves are suggested as well. Today, [...] "treatment [...] still includes burning, strangling, and excising." [...] Also, some of the fundamental concepts of proctoscopy outlined in the Corpus are still in use. For example, the uses of the rectal speculum, a common medical device, are discussed in the Hippocratic Corpus. This constitutes the earliest recorded reference to endoscopy. Hippocrates often used lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise to treat diseases such as diabetes, what is today called lifestyle medicine.

40|$|There can {{be little}} doubt, {{at least in the}} Western world, that {{autonomy}} is the ruling principle in contemporary bioethics. In spite of its ‘triumph’ however, the dominance of the utilitarian concept of autonomy is being increasingly questioned. In this paper, I explore the nature of autonomy, how it came to displace the <b>Hippocratic</b> tradition in <b>medicine</b> and how different concepts of autonomy have evolved. I argue that the reduction of autonomy to ‘the exercise of personal choice’ in medicine has led to a ‘tyranny of autonomy’ which can be inimical to ethical medical practice rather than conducive to it. I take the case of Kerrie Wooltorton as an illustration of how misplaced adherence to respect for patient autonomy can lead to tragic consequences. An analysis of autonomy {{based on the work of}} Rachel Haliburton is described and applied to the role of autonomy in a recent bioethical debate — that arising from Savulescu’s proposal that conscientious objection by health-care professionals should not be permitted in the NHS.

40|$|Statement of Problem The {{percentage}} of people {{over the age of}} sixty-five diagnosed with the cardiac condition Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is rising, consequently increasing the risk of cerebral vascular accidents. The current recommendation for treatment of AF is warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist or anticoagulant. As age increases, the risk of falls increases, and warfarin use increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. What is the current standard of practice in the decision-making process regarding prescribing warfarin in patients over the age of 65 with AF and at risk for falls? Sources of Data Four electronic databases were searched including EBSCO Host, CINAHL, PubMed and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed research articles between the years 2006 and 2012. Key concept terms entered into the database included MeSH terms ???atrial fibrillation,??? ???anticoagulant,??? ???warfarin,??? ???decision-making,??? ???aged,??? ???aged over 65,??? ???falls,??? and ???accidental falls. ??? Conclusions Reached This systematic review was inconclusive. The sample of research was heterogeneous and lacked transparency among the studies. This systematic review identifies areas in need of further research regarding decision-making for treatment with warfarin for Atrial Fibrillation among people over the age of 65, who are at risk for falls. Additional research must be conducted and educational tools developed prior to establishing evidenced-based guidelines or recommendations.

40|$|Orthodox {{medicine}} {{works in}} a scientific framework which often discounts knowledge arising outside biomedical models and the statistical means by which these are tested. Alternative medicine cannot meet these standards because it is holistic and individual in its orientations toward the understanding and treatment of human illness. But in fact the dominant model also has problems with surgery and other areas such as family practice as sub-disciplines where individualised caring solutions are important. These prominently include areas in which wider social and economic concerns directly impinge on health care so {{that we need a}} more liberal attitude to medical knowledge and discovery. I suggest that this wider conception is more in keeping with the Hippocratic ethos as a whole and {{with the idea of a}} healing praxis. Because our aim as doctors and health care professionals is to help people, and our knowledge is directed towards furthering this end, medicine is a practical science not able to stand apart and build theories in detached contemplation from within the ivory tower of the academy. However the practicality of medicine and the assurance needed to poison people or inflict grievous bodily harm in an effort to help them often puts a premium on certainties in our thinking about clinical medicine before the scientific basis for such certainty has been established. Therefore, hand in hand with the professional calling that is health care, goes the need for a certain style of belief in what one is doing and its ultimate rightness. This leads to an almost unique profile for medicine among the sciences. Medical science <b>Hippocratic</b> method Alternative <b>medicine</b> Praxis Paradigm...|$|R
40|$|Parmi les {{questions}} discutées en éthique de la recherche, il en est une qui resurgit de façon récurrente, c’est celle de l’usage du placebo. Cette question était au coeur des discussions précédant l’adoption de la dernière révision de la Déclaration d’Helsinki, en octobre 2000 à Édimbourg. Élaborée par l’Association médicale mondiale, la Déclaration d’Helsinki a pour objectif de fournir des recommandations destinées à guider les médecins et autres participants dans leurs recherches sur l’être humain. The {{question of}} the use of the placebo {{is one of the most}} controversial in the field of the ethics of research today. The use of the placebo remains the standard practice of biomedical research in spite of the fact that various revisions of the Helsinki Declaration have sought to limit its use. In Canada, the Tri-council policy statement: Ethical conduct for research involving humans adopted a very restrictive position with respect to the use of placebos, precisely defining the situations in which its use would meet the demands of ethical research. The positions taken by the various ethical decision-making bodies are, however, hardly shared by regulatory bodies such as the Food and drug administration (FDA), the Council for international organization of medical sciences (CIOMS) or the European agency for the evaluation of medicinal products (EMEA). This divergence of opinions reveals two quite different conceptions of what constitutes the ethical. In the case of decision-making bodies in the ethical field, it is clearly <b>medicine’s</b> <b>Hippocratic</b> Oath which explains their reluctance to use placebos. The first responsibility of the doctor is to «do no harm» to his or her patient. This duty is inherent to the medical profession and as such is not grounded in the view of medicine as a contract for care. In the case of regulatory bodies, it is the vision of «medicine as contract» which is in view; and it is this notion that justifies the use of placebos once free and informed consent has been obtained. It is also worth noting that these regulatory bodies make frequent use of arguments based on utilitarian ends. In an unprecedented move, the World medical association published in October 2001 a clarification note about the use of placebos. An analysis of this text raises the question about its real meaning: clarification or concession...|$|R
