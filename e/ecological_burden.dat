The study examines how far this substitution {{is combined with}} a relief of environmental impact or a shift of the <b>ecological</b> <b>burden</b> from air to water path. 38 cases of substitution (all branches of German metal industry) are studied in which the same cleaning task was performed, formerly by chlorinated hydrocarbons, and subsequently by water-based cleaning systems (27 cases) or hydrocarbons (11 cases). For all cases the consumption of matter and energy, emissions and waste products from the equipment, running and waste management, are quantitatively and qualitatively valued. The main results: All three variants of modern process engineering lighten the <b>ecological</b> <b>burden</b> but use more energy. The shift of <b>ecological</b> <b>burden</b> from air to water path is smaller than expected. Concerning environmental impact, the water-based systems are superior. The cost analysis speaks well for aqueous or hydrocarbon cleaning. At the moment, {{it is not possible}} to treat all cases by substituting the chlorinated hydrocarbons.

The weighted amount of a dried sample (approximately 0. 2 g) was digested inside a microwave decomposition device with an addition of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. An optimization of experimental parameters was done for each of the elements before sample measuring. A burner height was optimized and 8 mm height was chosen as a optimum for most elements. Under the optimum condition basic characteristics were measured for each element separately.

North and South America have experienced cases which not only suffer from a scarcity of financial resources, but also institutional limitations. The redevelopment of certain old contaminated areas can be attractive, because it might become a potentially lucrative area for redevelopment projects that can also bring interesting job and research opportunities. The paper presents a recapitulation of studies concerning the application of the decision and stakeholder theories for the solution of environmental problems, focusing mainly on brownfield issues. We also analyzed the decision making processes in the management of contaminated land in the Czech Republic. Brownfield management still lacks legislation in the Czech context; however the treatment of <b>ecological</b> <b>burdens</b> of the past has been regulated within the process of privatization {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 ’s. The last part of the work focuses mainly on the reme- dial decision making for <b>ecological</b> <b>burdens</b> of the past in the Czech Republic. The main objective of this work has been to gather ideas from the local and international context, and to adapt them to the actual decision making processes of the management of historical con- tamination in the Czech Republic. We concluded that the tools provided by the stakeholder theory and the laws governing decision making, which are intended for setting remedial goals, are a key factor for the potential success of brownfield management.

The mining of uranium influenced in considerable way health and quality of miners´ lives, and also lives of their relatives and up to now it still influencing quality of lives of people living near mining locations. Above all the uranium industry made irreparable changes in our country and the leftovers are up to now influencing the quality of our environment. That´s why there is a must to pay special attention to this area. Nowadays in the Czech republic there is registered around 3768 old uranium mines, out of it there is 2523 mining cannons which are obliged to be regularly controlled.

40|$|As the {{pressure}} on the chemical and process industries to improve environmental and economic performance increases, the need to move away from narrow system definitions and concepts in environmental system management is becoming more apparent. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been a gaining wider acceptance as a holistic tool that enables quantification of environmental interventions and evaluation of the improvement options throughout the life cycle of process, product or activity. The stringent environmental legislation, especially in developing countries has warranted the need for intensive research in this field. Moreover, the capital cost for mitigation of emissions have put enormous pressure on the industries to reduce the overall process economic performance. This has not exempted the Pulp and Paper industry, being the producers of highly variable emissions quality and quantity are the prime candidates for the application of the technique. The application of the LCA in process selection has been necessitated by the fact that sometimes a technology intended to reduce wastes has created unanticipated impacts in other media and/or stages of the life cycle. Thus, LCA has been developed as a means to identify and deal with these impacts before they can occur. It differs from other pollution prevention techniques in that it views all the resource and energy inputs to a product (Life Cycle Inventory), as well as the associated wastes, health and <b>ecological</b> <b>burdens</b> (Impact Assessment), and evaluates opportunities to reduce environmental impacts (Improvement Analysis) from cradle to grave. LCA is often confused with other assessment tools, such as life cycle cost (LCC) or sometimes referred to as "environmental life cycle costing. " This study was conducted at Mondi Packaging South African-Piet Retief Mill, a producer of linerboard, since this site has ample opportunity to minimse the environmental burden presented by operation of both Copeland Reactor and Boilers with significant emissions of SOx and NOx, and water effluent. The current mill strategy that is based on tight procurement specification of raw material is unsustainable. The environmental and economic performance analysis for this study followed from a mass balance of the pulp plant, power station, and paper machine as well as black liquor incinerating plant, and {{it was found that the}} most significant emissions come from pulp and steam generating processes. These emissions can be reduced by improving the mill energy efficiency and optimizing the Copeland scrubber absorption efficiency. The optimization of the Copeland scrubbing system will surely lead to improved environmental performance, however, the furnace stacks have to be modified to include the scrubbing system for absorption of SOx and NOx.

40|$|Employees and {{managers}} {{are faced with}} the tensions ensuing between environmentally-appropriate vs. economically-suitable behaviors. An ecologically-concerned person might see little benefit in engaging in pro-environmental behaviors because such activities are futile unless others take part. Against this backdrop of shared responsibility, governments, firms, and individuals all bear the <b>ecological</b> <b>burden.</b> Environmental Locus-of-Control (ELOC) encapsulates perceptions regarding ascriptions of personal and outward obligations for environmental stewardship, which in turn derives from the person’s beliefs concerning each party’s relative abilities (or futility) to effectuate change. Internal-ELOC denotes individuals’ manifold attitudes concerning personal accountability. Individuals can delegate responsibility to powerful others: politicians and public-policy shapers, corporations and senior management; or to non-human control loci (natural earth cycle, and God/Higher-Power). External-ELOC embodies attitudes towards environmental outcomes that individuals deem attributable to extraneous forces. This chapter elucidates the theoretical underpinnings of ELOC, reviews the empirical findings on the concept, and discusses its application to organizational contexts. Economic activities are collectively the largest source of greenhouse gasses; solutions to environmental degradation must include the organizational sphere and all its constituent actors. Since employees and other stakeholders are also consumers, their internal dispositions and responses to social and situational influences are highly relevant when performing either role. The broader foundational concept, locus-of-control (LOC) has been applied to many workplace settings. ELOC shares theoretical linkages with numerous organizational topics, including motivation and task performance, recruitment/retention, as well as leadership and organizational citizenship behaviors.

40|$|Policy {{has so far}} {{not taken}} full {{advantage}} of the tools offered by the “material flows” school of thought. Resource Productivity (RP) is amongst the normative concepts currently popular among policy makers the nearest one to Material Input Per Service unit (MIPS). However, the RP concept falls substantially short of the MIPS idea, as it puts resource use in relation to the monetary value of production, while MIPS makes reference to services actually delivered by the products. Moreover, the indicator currently used by the European Commission for monitoring RP lacks in life-cycle perspective, which is essential in the MIPS concept. The present paper illustrates, by using Italian case evidence, some of the current RP indicator shortcomings and it discusses a possible alternative, by introducing the life-cycle perspective. In Italy, RP has grown faster than both energy and labour productivity since 1980. This apparently shows that Italy is moving in the right direction. However, a deeper and more extensive analysis regarding the country’s natural resource requirements is necessary before a conclusion can be drawn about the sustainability of the Italian socio-economic process. Therefore, on the one hand we disaggregate material consumption (i. e., the denominator of RP) into its components; on the other hand we extend the analysis to overall material requirements, including indirect material flows associated with international trade. These analyses, although limited to used materials (i. e., to resource requirements in Raw Material Equivalents), demonstrate that the Italian success in increasing RP is largely due to the transferring abroad of material flows and <b>ecological</b> <b>burden...</b>|$|E

40|$|Since 1986 {{extensive}} reclamation {{works have}} taken place in the area. Aim of this works is to mend the damaged environment, eliminate impact of uranium processing, reduce contamination of ground water and radiation effects on the area. However after 29 years of reclamation works, risks of chemical and radiation toxicity are still present. Massive development of uranium mining occurred at the beginning of 20 th century. Czech republic was not an exception and czech government decided to build chemical processing plant of uranium under a code name MAPE. chemical processing plantwas built near village Mydlovary, in the southeaster part of Czech republic. Construction began in 1959. Operation started in 1962. Uranium was processed either by acidic or alkalic leaching. During the operation of the plant 36 million tons of sludge were stored in nearby sludge beds. Operation of MAPE ended in the year 1991. This thesis focuses on problems of chemical toxicity in former uranium processing plant MAPE Mydlovary and nearby area. Primary aim was to assess potential risks of chemical toxicity resulting from MAPE operation which could influence health of former employees, citizens of nearby villages and the environment. In order to determine the risks it was necessary to analyse chemical substances used to process uranium, possible signs of uranium intoxication of living organisms, quality and direction of ground water flow in wider area of interest. Among substances used to process uranium were different kinds of gasoline, diesel, ammonia, nitric acid, sulphuric acids and its salts, sodium carbonate and barium chloride dyhydrate. In comparison to dangerousness of particular substances it was found that most occurring types of damage are types of damage to skin or eyes due to irritant or caustic effects. It was difficult to analyse the influence of uranium intoxication on living organisms because of limited availability of useful and relevant information. Therefore assessment of possible effects were established as the result of previous studies. Former employees of MAPE could have been exposed to several kinds of uranium compounds (UO 2, UO 3, (NH 4) 2 U 2 O 7), therefore effects of intoxication by these compounds were taken into the consideration. Most cases of chemical intoxication were localized in the renal and respiratory systems of living organisms. Ground waters of wider area of interest were estimated as main carrier of potential chemical intoxication of residents of nearby villages and environment. Analysis of quality and direction of spreading showed that villages close to processing plant can use ground water only for irrigation (in the village Mydlovary ground water cannot be used even for irrigation). Furthermore there is a small risk of contamination of collecting borehole S 4 near the city of Zliv. Water from this borehole is drinkable and worsening of the quality of this water could result in exceeding limits set by decree no. 274 / 2003. Nowadays former chemical processing plant of uranium MAPE Mydlovary represents one of the most severe <b>ecological</b> <b>burdens</b> in Czech republic.

40|$|The United Kingdom (UK) {{has placed}} itself on a {{transition}} towards a low carbon economy and society, through {{the imposition of}} a legally-binding goal aimed at reducing its ‘greenhouse gas’ (GHG) emissions by 80 % by 2050 against a 1990 baseline. A set of three low-carbon, sociotechnical transition pathways were developed and analysed via an innovative collaboration between engineers, social scientists and policy analysts. The pathways focus on the power sector, including the potential for increasing use of low-carbon electricity for heating and transport, within the context of critical European Union developments and policies. Their development started from narrative storylines regarding different governance framings, drawing on interviews and workshops with stakeholders and analysis of historical analogies. The quantified UK pathways were named Market Rules (MR), Central Co-ordination (CC) and Thousand Flowers (TF); each reflecting a dominant logic of governance arrangements. The aim of the present contribution was to use these pathways to explore what is needed to realise a transition that successfully addresses the so-called energy policy 'trilemma', i. e., the simultaneous delivery of low carbon, secure and affordable energy services. Analytical tools were developed and applied to assess the technical feasibility, social acceptability, and environmental and economic impacts of the pathways. Technological and behavioural developments were examined, alongside appropriate governance structures and regulations for these low-carbon transition pathways, as well as the roles of key energy system 'actors' (both large and small). An assessment of the part that could possibly be played by future demand side response (DSR) was also undertaken {{in order to understand the}} factors that drive energy demand and energy-using behaviour, and reflecting growing interest in DSR for balancing a system with high proportions of renewable generation. A set of interacting and complementary engineering and techno-economic models or tools were then employed to analyse electricity network infrastructure investment and operational decisions to assist market design and option evaluation. This provided a basis for integrating the analysis within a whole systems framework of electricity system development, together with the evaluation of future economic benefits, costs and uncertainties. Finally, the energy and environmental performance of the different energy mixes were appraised on a ‘life-cycle’ basis to determine the GHG emissions and other <b>ecological</b> or health <b>burdens</b> associated with each of the three transition pathways. Here the challenges and opportunities that have been identified over the transition towards a low-carbon future in the UK are described with the purpose of providing a valuable evidence base for developers, policy makers, and other stakeholders...|$|R

The agricultural minister of an EC-country (AM), a philosopher (PH), a neoclassical economist (NE), an ecological economist (EE), one fanner from a fertile region (FI) and a farmer from a marginal region (FII) are sitting in a pub in a small village somewhere in the EC. AM: Gentlemen, thank you very much that you have followed my invitation to discuss informally and frankly ways which might help me to solve my problems. Help yourself (pointing at the beer which has been brought by the waiter) and let us begin with our friend from the faculty of wisdom and ethics (directing himself to the philosopher). PH: {Drinking from the beer and putting, the glass back on the table). Consideration of agriculture makes me sad. Many of the farmers if not the majority of them are involved in an almost desperate struggle for economic survival, during which they use incentives of the economic framework and mobilise existing reserves in order to increase the economic rationality o...|$|E
40|$|The hotel {{management}} affects the general standard of employees, {{the level of}} utility load, the system of <b>ecological</b> <b>burden</b> and businesses in their environment (suppliers, guests, unions, banks, sports and cultural institutions). As hotel companies are capital and labor intensive, the traditional management approach to reducing operating costs is mainly realized through the reduction of salaries. Such an approach of maximizing the financial effects of stockholders provokes discontent of workers (unions), local government and business partners, and consequently reduces {{the overall quality of}} hotel services. However, when as a result of such business endeavors occur management decisions that are in the "gray" zone of ethical and moral responsibility, the measures often taken by workers, trade unions and / or related institutions are aimed at promoting and improving the ethical climate and the social responsibility of the hotel companies. The paper follows the idea that competitive advantages on the market result from the positive differentiation from the competition, and that one of the ways involves a socially responsible approach to business. The authors of the paper believe that these immoral actions can be solved through supportive measures and models of "whistle-blowers" that expose the illegal and / or unethical business actions and decisions. In this sense, the paper intends to explore and demonstrate the mentioned measures as a possible solution for reducing adverse effects and thus improving company performance in the hospitality industry. The research model will be based on hotel companies operating in tourist destinations across the Mediterranean, using benchmarking approach to hotel companies in other and comparable tourist destinations. Research results will be transparent and applicable in practice. In order to reach the goal of the paper, quantitative and qualitative methods will be used in primary and secondary data processing...|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} {{compounds}} structurally similar to bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) propane (bisphenol A, BPA) are called bisphenols (BPs), {{and some of}} them can partially replace BPA in industrial applications. The production and consumption of BPs other than BPA, especially those of bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) methane (bisphenol F, BPF) and bis(4 -hydroxy-phenyl) sulfone (bisphenol S, BPS), have increased recently, leading to their detection as contaminants in the aquatic environment. The three compounds tested 100 % positive for estrus response in 1936 and concerns about their health risks have been increasing. Abundant data on degradation of bisphenols (BPs) has been published, but results for biodegradation of BPs in seawater are lacking. However, several research groups have focused on this topic recently. In this study, the biodegradation behaviors of three BPs, namely BPA, BPF and BPS, in seawater were investigated using TOC Handai (TOC, potential test) and river (sea) die-away (SDA, simulation test) methods, which are both a kind of river-die-away test. The main difference between the tests is that indigenous microcosms remain in the sampled raw seawater for the SDA experiments, but they are removed through filtration and dispersed into artificial seawater for the TOC experiments. The BPs, except for BPS, were degraded using both methods. The SDA method produced better biodegradation results than the TOC method in terms of degradation time (both lag and degradation periods). Biodegradation efficiencies were measured at 75 - 100 % using the SDA method and 13 - 63 % using the TOC method. BPF showed better degradation efficiency than BPA, BPF was > 92 % and BPA 83 % depleted according to the SDA tests. BPS degradation was not observed. As a conclusion, the biodegradability of the three BPs in seawater could be ranked as BPF > BPA >> BPS. BPF is more biodegradable than BPA in seawater and BPS is more likely to accumulate in the aquatic environment. BPS poses a lower risk to human health and to the environment than BPA or BPF but it is not amenable to biodegradation and might be persistent and become an <b>ecological</b> <b>burden.</b> Thus other degradation methods need to be found for the removal of BPS in the environment...|$|E

Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] IMechE 2017. The United Kingdom has placed itself on a transition towards a low-carbon economy and society, through {{the imposition of a}} legally-binding goal aimed at reducing its 'greenhouse gas' emissions by 80 % by 2050 against a 1990 baseline. A set of three low-carbon, socio-technical transition pathways were developed and analysed via an innovative collaboration between engineers, social scientists and policy analysts. The pathways focus on the power sector, including the potential for increasing use of low-carbon electricity for heating and transport, within the context of critical European Union developments and policies. Their development started from narrative storylines regarding different governance framings, drawing on interviews and workshops with stakeholders and analysis of historical analogies. The quantified UK pathways were named Market Rules, Central Co-ordination and Thousand Flowers; each reflecting a dominant logic of governance arrangements. The aim of the present contribution was to use these pathways to explore what is needed to realise a transition that successfully addresses the so-called energy policy 'trilemma,' i. e. the simultaneous delivery of low carbon, secure and affordable energy services. Analytical tools were developed and applied to assess the technical feasibility, social acceptability, and environmental and economic impacts of the pathways. Technological and behavioural developments were examined, alongside appropriate governance structures and regulations for these low-carbon transition pathways, as well as the roles of key energy system 'actors' (both large and small). An assessment of the part that could possibly be played by future demand side response was also undertaken {{in order to understand the}} factors that drive energy demand and energy-using behaviour, and reflecting growing interest in demand side response for balancing a system with high proportions of renewable generation. A set of interacting and complementary engineering and techno-economic models or tools were then employed to analyse electricity network infrastructure investment and operational decisions to assist market design and option evaluation. This provided a basis for integrating the analysis within a whole systems framework of electricity system development, together with the evaluation of future economic benefits, costs and uncertainties. Finally, the energy and environmental performance of the different energy mixes were appraised on a 'life-cycle' basis to determine the greenhouse gas emissions and other <b>ecological</b> or health <b>burdens</b> associated with each of the three transition pathways. Here, the challenges, insights and opportunities that have been identified over the transition towards a low-carbon future in the United Kingdom are described with the purpose of providing a valuable evidence base for developers, policy makers and other stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Mimosa diplotricha is an {{invasive}} perennial, scrambling, thorny, leguminous shrub of neotropical origin {{widely acknowledged}} {{as a major}} economic, agricultural and <b>ecological</b> <b>burden</b> in its introduced ranges. Although the plant {{is thought to have}} been present in Nigeria for well over two decades, its mode and time of introduction is uncertain. In spite of the continuing spread of, and the menace caused by M. diplotricha in Nigeria, no attempt has been made to map the distribution of the plant countrywide. Therefore, we conducted a countrywide survey between 2007 and 2009, sponsored by the Weed Science Society of Nigeria (WSSN) to determine the spread and status of Mimosa diplotricha in Nigeria. A further objective of this paper was to review literatures on Mimosa diplotricha in Nigeria and elsewhere to enable comparison. In this paper, we report on the spread, distribution and problems of Mimosa diplotricha in Nigeria based on the field monitoring surveys conducted. The distribution of this invasive plant in Nigeria has been mapped and is presented together with its ecology and problems being caused. Since the early 1990 s, the weed has started to spread and invade {{many parts of the country}} causing significant damage to many natural and semi natural ecosystems. The different control options used by farmers to control Mimosa diplotricha in Nigeria are discussed. Based on the successful control of this invasive plant using the biocontrol agent, Heteropsylla spinulosa in countries such as Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG), we discussed the biological control prospects for the management of Mimosa diplotricha in Nigeria. Such control attempts stands to benefit from international collaborations between Nigerian institutions and a host of others in Australia, PNG and/or Brazil. Finally three major causes for the massive and continuing spread of this weed in Nigeria are presented with recommendations for the Nigerian government and institutions to : 1) formulate policies and legislations regarding the control and management of invasive alien plant species which is currently nonexistent; 2) enlighten the general public on the dangers of invasive alien plant species such as Mimosa diplotricha; and 3) initiate actions such as early detection and rapid response (EDRR) and biological control in order to prevent further spread of, and invasion by invasive plant species including Mimosa diplotricha. </p...|$|E
40|$|Once {{considered}} a 'green' industry, tourism {{and its associated}} ecological impacts are now widely acknowledged. Focus within tourism planning has aimed to reduce the <b>ecological</b> <b>burden</b> placed on a destination area, and move towards a more sustainable tourism industry. This research proposes {{the use of the}} Ecological Footprint (EF) as a tool to compare the ecological costs of different types of tourism. The EF shows the relative amount of productive land appropriated by the activities and choices of an individual tourist. The main goal {{of this study was to}} analyse and compare the ecological resource use of tourism in Ontario. Surveys were conducted with tourists staying at 9 different types of accommodations throughout Ontario. Additional data were collected from personal interviews with accommodation managers at each location and incorporated into the EF calculation. Four areas of tourism ecological impact were identified; tourists' personal consumption, transportation, activity, and accommodation costs. These four components contributed in varying degrees to each tourist Ecological Footprint, and this variation became the main area of analysis. The findings of this research demonstrated that air travel contributes significantly to the total ecological cost of a particular tourism experience. Comparably, travel by personal car made a much smaller contribution to the tourist EF. Thus, local area tourists who could drive to a destination had a smaller EF than those long-distance domestic and international tourists who flew. Accommodation ecological costs were primarily a factor of the amount of built space available, and total energy usage per guest. Accommodations that had a large number of occupants for a given area and level of energy consumption achieved a scale of efficiency. In this manner, larger, more efficiently constructed accommodations often made smaller contributions to the tourist EF than small-scale, but inefficient accommodations. The main conclusion was that the ecological impacts of tourism can be quantitatively recorded, and that a complete trip view of tourism ecological resource use is necessary. When considering practical applications in the tourism industry, an Ecological Footprint analysis could be used by tourism managers as an evaluative tool to compare the ecological outcome of various construction, programming, and operational changes. For the tourist, the EF can serve as an 'eco-label', to distinguish one type of 'green' tourism from another, creating a more informed consumer. Ultimately, the Ecological Footprint serves one purpose- to demonstrate that less ecologically consumptive tourism choices are possible for both tourists and tourism managers...|$|E
