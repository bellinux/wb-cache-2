25|$|Unsurprisingly, {{security}} and fire protection were major concerns. Horrea were frequently built with very thick walls (as much as 1 m / 3ft thick) {{to reduce the}} <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> and the windows were always narrow and placed {{high up on the}} wall to deter theft. Doors were protected with elaborate systems of locks and bolts. Even the largest horrea usually only had two or three external doors, which were often quite narrow and would not have permitted the entrance of carts. The arduous task of moving goods into, out of and around horrea was most probably carried out by manual labour alone; the biggest horrea would thus have had an enormous staff of labourers.|$|E
25|$|On December 31, 1907, a ball {{signifying}} New Year's Day {{was first}} dropped at Times Square, and the Square {{has held the}} main New Year's celebration in New York City ever since. On that night, {{hundreds of thousands of}} people congregate to watch the Waterford Crystal ball being lowered on a pole atop the building, marking the start of the new year. It replaced a lavish fireworks display from the top of the building that was held from 1904 to 1906, but stopped by city officials because of the <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> Beginning in 1908, and for more than eighty years thereafter, Times Square sign maker Artkraft Strauss was responsible for the ball-lowering. During World War II, a minute of silence, followed by a recording of church bells pealing, replaced the ball drop because of wartime blackout restrictions. Today, Countdown Entertainment and One Times Square handle the New Year's Eve event in conjunction with the Times Square Alliance.|$|E

500|$|In April 1977, Alyeska filed {{a notice}} that it {{intended}} to start filling the pipeline sometime between June 20 and July 1. Engineers {{had to face}} several problems when filling the pipeline. First was the need to balance temperatures: Filled by air, the steel pipeline was about [...] degrees. The oil emerging from wells at Prudhoe Bay was more than [...] degrees, {{and there was a}} danger that if it was introduced before intermediate warming, the pipeline could crack because of thermal expansion. The second problem came when the pipeline needed to be purged of air {{in order to reduce the}} <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> or explosion. Usually, a pipeline is filled with water first, and the oil pushes the water ahead of it, purging the pipeline as it goes. In Alaska, there was a fear that the water would freeze in the pipeline, damaging it. This problem was solved when pressurized nitrogen was used instead of water.|$|E

While most of these older markets have had upgrades in gas, electric and drainage, as well as fire extinguishers installed, sixty percent are in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> due to faulty electrical wiring. Many have insect and rodent infestations. Many of these markets are in unsafe areas, with drug addicts, alcoholics, and delinquents.|$|E
2500|$|A post-war {{success was}} the concert-party entertainment, The Co-Optimists, first staged in 1921. [...] The year 1924 {{saw the first}} West End {{production}} at the theatre of Noël Coward's The Vortex. Juno and the Paycock was mounted in 1925, and Ibsen's Pillars of Society played in 1926. Another hit for the Royalty was in 1932 with While Parents Sleep. [...] By 1936 the <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> from celluloid stores and other adjacent properties overrided the argument made to the Lord Chamberlain that the theatre {{had been on the}} site before the development of the inflammatory trades nearby. J. B. Priestley's I Have Been Here Before was the theatre's last success. The last performance was given at a matinee on 25 November 1938, by the Southern Cross Players.|$|E

2500|$|During the 15th century, {{the street}} became the paved artery road {{it still is}} today, line-up with {{dwellings}} and shops on either side. [...] During the Middle Ages and Vasa era, {{the southern part of}} the street formed part of the district centred on Järntorget, at the time the most prominent quarters in the city inhabited by influential merchants such as Mårten Trotzig, Mårten Leuhusen and Erik Larsson von der Linde. [...] Along the rest of the street craftsmen had their small workshops, and the northernmost section, stretching between Mynttorget and Storkyrkobrinken, was called Stadssmedjegatan ("City's Smith's Street"), because the blacksmiths who were confined outside the city because of the <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> had their headquarters there.

2500|$|In the beginning, {{there were}} no printed catalogs of the library to assist readers in {{choosing}} books and readers were not admitted within the railing to take down books for examination themselves. There was interest in evening hours, but the increased expense this would have entailed and the <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> from gas lighting prevented it. The books were classified using the system in Brunet's Manuel du Libraire which Cogswell thought the most complete and most generally known. Cogswell thought his readers showed good taste in their selections “except the young fry, who employ all the hours {{they are out of}} school in reading the trashy, as Scott, Cooper, Dickens, Punch, and the Illustrated News.” For the first year the average daily use was about 100 volumes, with a total for the year of about 30,000. No one topic seemed to dominate the rest, though on the whole the fine arts collection was the most extensively used. The number of readers in the first year varied from 30 for the lowest day to 150 for the highest. For some time, the library was beset by crowds of schoolboys who “come in at certain hours of the day to read, more for amusement than improvement, and shun their classical lessons by the use of English translations.” On Cogswell's recommendation, the trustees raised the age limit to 16. In Cogswell's judgment, by this act the library “assumed its proper character, and became a place of quiet study, where every one found ample accommodation.” ...|$|E
