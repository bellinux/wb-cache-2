5|$|Northeast Pacific {{resident}} groups {{tend to be}} {{much more}} vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audio-gram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the <b>frequencies</b> <b>used</b> in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.|$|E
5|$|Pirate radio {{met with}} {{increasing}} opposition, {{especially from the}} authorities {{in the form of}} the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) Radio Regulatory Division (and later the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) after it became responsible for radio regulation) which had claimed since the late 1960s that pirate radio caused interference to licensed broadcasters and could interfere with <b>frequencies</b> <b>used</b> by emergency services. Nonetheless the growth of pirate radio in the 1980s was so rapid that at one point pirate radio operators outnumbered legal broadcasters. Pirate stations such as Radio Invicta, JFM, and London Weekend Radio continued to gain popularity and increasingly operated openly. Pirate radio targeted music communities ignored by mainstream broadcasting, such as reggae, hip hop, jazz, indie rock, indie pop and rhythm and blues. Stations like London Greek Radio, which broadcast to the Greek and Greek Cypriot community, also catered to ethnic minorities.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{interference}} to receivers, licensing authorities will avoid assigning common IF frequencies to transmitting stations. Standard intermediate <b>frequencies</b> <b>used</b> are 455kHz for medium-wave AM radio, 10.7MHz for broadcast FM receivers, 38.9MHz (Europe) or 45MHz (US) for television, and 70MHz for satellite and terrestrial microwave equipment.

25|$|The {{advantage}} of the B–T system in terms of mechanical simplicity was generally difficult to use in this role due to the normally small amount of energy it could tune. Several competing systems were also developed, including omni-directional antennae with motorized wire-mesh reflectors, {{as well as a}} Telefunken system that had multiple dipole antennae periodically switched by a large motorized distributor. In the end none of these systems proved very popular, and the success of B–T systems and small moving-loops suitable for higher <b>frequencies</b> <b>used</b> for aircraft communications allowed DF systems to be carried on the vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} free {{electrons}} in the ionosphere, {{in conjunction with}} the earth's magnetic field, causes Faraday rotation, a sort of circular birefringence. This is the same mechanism which can rotate the axis of linear polarization by electrons in interstellar space as mentioned below. The magnitude of Faraday rotation caused by such a plasma is greatly exaggerated at lower frequencies, so at the higher microwave <b>frequencies</b> <b>used</b> by satellites the effect is minimal. However medium or short wave transmissions received following refraction by the ionosphere are strongly affected. Since a wave's path through the ionosphere and the earth's magnetic field vector along such a path are rather unpredictable, a wave transmitted with vertical (or horizontal) polarization will generally have a resulting polarization in an arbitrary orientation at the receiver.|$|E
25|$|The {{microwave}} <b>frequencies</b> <b>used</b> in {{microwave ovens}} are chosen based on regulatory and cost constraints. The {{first is that}} they should be in one of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands set aside for non-communication purposes. For household purposes, 2.45 GHz has the advantage over 915 MHz in that 915 MHz is only an ISM band in the ITU Region 2 while 2.45 GHz is available worldwide. Three additional ISM bands exist in the microwave frequencies, but are not used for microwave cooking. Two of them are centered on 5.8 GHz and 24.125 GHz, but are not used for microwave cooking because of the very high cost of power generation at these frequencies. The third, centered on 433.92 MHz, is a narrow band that would require expensive equipment to generate sufficient power without creating interference outside the band, and is only available in some countries.|$|E

25|$|A {{direct current}} flows uniformly {{throughout}} the cross-section of a uniform wire. An alternating current of any frequency is forced {{away from the}} wire's center, toward its outer surface. This is because the acceleration of an electric charge in an alternating current produces waves of electromagnetic radiation that cancel the propagation of electricity {{toward the center of}} materials with high conductivity. This phenomenon is called skin effect. At very high frequencies the current no longer flows in the wire, but effectively flows {{on the surface of the}} wire, within a thickness of a few skin depths. The skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63%. Even at relatively low <b>frequencies</b> <b>used</b> for power transmission (50Hz – 60Hz), non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick conductors. For example, the skin depth of a copper conductor is approximately 8.57mm at 60Hz, so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost. Since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors, the effective cross-section of the conductor is reduced. This increases the effective AC resistance of the conductor, since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. The AC resistance often is many times higher than the DC resistance, causing a much higher energy loss due to ohmic heating (also called I2R loss).|$|E

2500|$|At the {{microwave}} <b>frequencies</b> <b>used</b> in many parabolic antennas, [...] waveguide {{is required to}} conduct {{the microwave}}s between the feed antenna and transmitter or receiver. [...] Because of {{the high cost of}} waveguide runs, in many parabolic antennas the RF front end electronics of the receiver is located at the feed antenna, and the received signal is converted to a lower intermediate frequency (IF) so it can be conducted to the receiver through cheaper coaxial cable. [...] This is called a Low-noise block downconverter. [...] Similarly, in transmitting dishes, the microwave transmitter may be located at the feed point.|$|E

[...] In addition to lowering implementation costs by [...] "piggybacking" [...] on a planned satellite launch, this also allowed the signal to be broadcast from geostationary orbit, which meant {{a small number of}} satellites could cover all of North America.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was during}} {{experiments}} with Shiva that another serious unexpected problem appeared. The infrared light {{generated by the}} Nd:glass lasers was found to interact very strongly with the electrons in the plasma created during the initial heating {{through the process of}} stimulated Raman scattering. [...] This process, referred to as [...] "hot electron pre-heating", carried away a great amount of the laser's energy, and also caused the core of the target to heat before it reached maximum compression. This meant that much less energy was being deposited {{in the center of the}} collapse, both due to the reduction in implosion energy, as well as the outward force of the heated core. Although it was known that shorter wavelengths would reduce this problem, it had earlier been expected that the IR <b>frequencies</b> <b>used</b> in Shiva would be [...] "short enough".
