5|$|Aberdeen are {{the only}} senior team in the third largest city in Scotland, a city which is {{relatively}} remote, geographically, from other large population centres, {{and as a result}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> catchment area of potential supporters. The average attendance in the 2015–16 Scottish Premiership is currently 13,530.|$|E
5|$|Longitudinal {{acceleration}} {{has been}} shown to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> and complex effect on lateral dynamics. In one study, positive acceleration eliminates self stability, and negative acceleration (deceleration) changes the speeds of self stability.|$|E
5|$|Reduce {{proteolytic}} susceptibility. The rate {{at which}} proteins are broken down can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> impact on their activity in cells. Since termini are often accessible to proteases, designing a circularly permuted protein with less-accessible termini can increase the lifespan of that protein in the cell.|$|E

5|$|Tires <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{influence}} over bike handling, especially on motorcycles, {{but also on}} bicycles. Tires influence bike dynamics in two distinct ways: finite crown radius and force generation. Increase the crown radius of the front tire {{has been shown to}} decrease the size or eliminate self stability. Increasing the crown radius of the rear tire has the opposite effect, but to a lesser degree.|$|E
30|$|The {{results in}} Tables  1 and 2 {{lead to the}} {{following}} observations: When the null hypothesis is true, we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> probability to accept the null hypothesis. When the alternative hypothesis is true we also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> probability to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, using the test method obtained by us, we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> probability to make a correct judgment.|$|R

5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Farke and {{his colleagues}} in 2014 {{published}} {{a description of a}} new neoceratopsian, Aquilops americanus, through the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE. They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these groups would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E
5|$|At some {{distance}} {{back from the}} leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> amount of the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E

5|$|Chalukyan temples {{fall into}} two {{categories}} – the first being temples with a common mantapa (a colonnaded hall) and two shrines (known as dvikuta), and the second being temples with one mantapa and a single shrine (ekakuta). Both kinds of temples have two or more entrances giving access to the main hall. This format differs from both the designs of the northern Indian temples, which have a small closed mantapa leading to the shrine and the southern Indian temples which generally <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> open, columned mantapa.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented {{by a large}} muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill {{so that they can}} be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower mandible applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E
5|$|During her lifetime, Maria, {{too young}} to become a Red Cross nurse like her elder sisters during World War I, was patroness of a {{hospital}} and instead visited wounded soldiers. Throughout her lifetime she was noted for her interest {{in the lives of}} the soldiers. The flirtatious Maria had a number of innocent crushes on the young men she met, beginning in early childhood. She hoped to marry and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> family.|$|E

5|$|Fruit is rich {{in sugar}} but {{deficient}} in other nutrients, {{so it must be}} eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water is less of a problem.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Jakarta, an {{epidemic}} of the flu is underway. Among those who fall ill is President Sukarno, who writes to Chairman Mao Zedong to request some doctors. Mao sends doctors, who give Sukarno poison to paralyze him and aid the 30 September Movement in overthrowing the government. The slow acting poison causes Sukarno to faint after he and his ministers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> party with haraam events, including the consumption of pork and frog and zina (sex outside of marriage).|$|E
5|$|Most of Amarillo's {{population}} growth and commercial development are occurring in the southern and northwestern parts of the city. Similar to many towns in the Texas Panhandle, the city's downtown has suffered economic deterioration throughout the years. To help revitalize it, the organization Center City of Amarillo was formed to establish partnerships with groups who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> presence in the city. Since its conception in the 1990s, Center City has sponsored public art projects and started block parties in the downtown area.|$|E

5|$|Most of Barnet lies over London Clay, {{which is}} poor for agriculture, and open land is mainly used for {{activities}} such as horse grazing, playing fields, parks and golf courses. Features of the traditional agricultural landscape have survived, such as old hedgerows, ancient trees and areas of herb-rich grassland. Some hay meadows <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> diversity of wild flowers, and the London Ecology Unit (LEU) described them as one of Barnet's most important ecological assets.|$|E

Despite that, both he and Leslie <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> amount of respect for one another. Ron has been married twice; both of his ex-wives are named Tammy.
