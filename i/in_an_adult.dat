5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has been}} shown to be toxic to humans and is also toxic to {{domestic}} pets such as cats and dogs. A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg body weight (mL/kg) of pure substance. That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 4 mL for a 20kg child. Poison control centers often use more than a lick or taste in a child or more than a mouthful <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> as a dose requiring hospital assessment.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} {{are located on}} both sides of the body in the retroperitoneum, above and {{slightly}} medial to the kidneys. In humans, the right adrenal gland is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left is semilunar or crescent shaped and somewhat larger. The adrenal glands measure approximately 3.0cm in width, 5.0cm in length, and up to 1.0cm in thickness. Their combined weight <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> human ranges from 7 to 10grams. The glands are yellowish in colour.|$|E

50|$|A fetus, {{receiving}} oxygen via the placenta, {{is exposed}} to much lower oxygen pressures (about 21% of the level found <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult's</b> lungs), so fetuses produce another form of hemoglobin with a much higher affinity for oxygen (hemoglobin F) to function under these conditions.|$|R

5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} in {{a newborn baby}} are much larger as a {{proportion}} of the body size than <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> For example, at age three months the glands are four {{times the size of the}} kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage of the cortex. The cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4–5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop to an adult weight of about 4 grams each. In a fetus the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Reubens {{decided to}} take a sabbatical from Pee-wee. In July 1991, Reubens was arrested for indecent {{exposure}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> theater in Sarasota, Florida. The arrest set off a chain reaction of national media attention that changed the general public's view of Reubens and Pee-wee. The arrest postponed Reubens' involvement in major projects until 1999 when he appeared in several big-budget projects including Mystery Men and Blow and started giving interviews as himself rather than as Pee-wee.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for acute adrenal {{insufficiency}} requires the administration of intravenous saline or dextrose solution; volumes of over two liters may be required <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> This {{is followed by the}} administration of hydrocortisone, which is pharmaceutical grade cortisol, intravenously or into a muscle. The drug dexamethasone has similar properties, but its use is not recommended unless it is required to reduce swelling in the brain around the area of hemorrhage. Some are well enough not to require immediate cortisol replacement; in this case, blood levels of cortisol are determined at 9:00AM (as cortisol levels vary over the day). A level below 550nmol/l indicates a need for replacement.|$|E

5|$|Salicylates are {{excreted}} {{mainly by}} the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. When small doses (less than 250 mg <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult)</b> are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h. When higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15 h to 30 h), because the biotransformation pathways {{concerned with the}} formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated. Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH. A 10- to 20-fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8. The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination.|$|E
5|$|The orally {{lethal dose}} in humans has been {{reported}} as approximately 1.4 mL/kg of pure ethylene glycol. That is approximately 224 mL (7.6 oz.) of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 56 mL (2 oz.) for a 20kg child. Although survival with medical treatment has occurred with doses much higher than this, death has occurred with 30 mL of the concentrate <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> In the EU classification of dangerous substances it is 'harmful' (Xn) while more toxic substances are classified as 'toxic' (T) or 'very toxic' (T+). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency generally puts substances which are lethal at more than 30 g to adults in Toxicity Class III.|$|E
5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including thiamine and pyridoxine are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid. The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or alcoholic patients.|$|E
