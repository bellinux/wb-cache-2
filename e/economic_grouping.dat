30|$|The joining of <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> {{constitutes}} another innovative transversal strategy {{adopted by}} women where the members put their efforts together {{in order to}} enhance entrepreneurship development. Women entrepreneurs who are working jointly in <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> guarantee themselves to acquire loans from microfinance institutions, by using the group as guarantor. In other words, in case that one of the group members default, the rest of the members can assume responsibilities for the left member’s share. Therefore, this strategy of working in <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> is a panacea to socio-cultural constraints of getting finance for business development and finally support family well-being (e.g., paying school fees for their children, etc.). Furthermore, it enable, women entrepreneurs to tackle other challenges, for instance, food processing technology, packaging materials, access to resources, unequal economic power, inequality in education hence results into enhancing women power to participate in decision making in the household and higher organs. Therefore, working in <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> in an innovative strategy of developing women entrepreneurship by eliminating challenges embedded in socio-cultural perspective and create a conducive environment for doing business as their counterpart male entrepreneurs.|$|R

50|$|The Molotov Plan was {{the system}} {{created by the}} Soviet Union in 1947 {{in order to provide}} aid to rebuild the {{countries}} in Eastern Europe that were politically and economically aligned to the Soviet Union. It can be seen to be the USSR's version of the Marshall Plan, which for political reasons the Eastern European countries {{would not be able to}} join without leaving the Soviet sphere of influence. Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov rejected the Marshall Plan (1947), proposing the Molotov Plan the Soviet-sponsored <b>economic</b> <b>grouping</b> which was eventually expanded to become the COMECON. The Molotov plan was symbolic of the Soviet Union's refusal to accept aid from the Marshall Plan, or allow any of their satellite states to do so, because of their belief that the Plan was an attempt to weaken Soviet interest in their satellite states, through the conditions imposed, and by making beneficiary countries economically dependent on the United States. The plan was a system of bilateral trade agreements which also established COMECON to create an economic alliance of socialist countries. This aid allowed countries in Europe to stop relying on American aid, and therefore allowed Molotov Plan states to reorganize their trade to the USSR instead. The plan was in some ways contradictory however, because at the same time the Soviets were giving aid to Eastern bloc countries, they were demanding that countries who were members of the Axis powers pay reparations to the USSR.|$|E

40|$|In {{modern day}} Chile the {{economic}} entrepreneurial landscape {{is made up}} of large multinational conglomerates, local <b>economic</b> <b>groups,</b> and so-called emerging <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> (that burgeoned with the transformation of former government employees into owners of important parts of state-owned companies). This last group is mainly comprised of the neoliberal technocracy that designed the economic policy of the Pinochet dictator-ship. The power of these emerging technical groups in democratic Chile is based not only on direct private property, but also on their participation as high-ranking officials that dominate strategic decision-making in companies and conglomerates. Their power has been consolidated with the so-called second wave of privatizations (1985 – 90), as they took advantage of both profound neoliberal convictions and the unconditional support for multinational companies, which technocratic officials consider to be the materialization of the globalization of the Chilean economy. In turn, many of these technocrats operate as agents or strategic executives, associating with local <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> and transnational conglomerates. The analysis of the origin and formation of the <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> and conglomerates that today dominate the globalized Chilean economy is the main objective of this article...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} whether the dynamic integration across a large set of developed and emerging Islamic stock markets allows potential diversification benefits in tranquil and turmoil periods. Using the multivariate cointegration test, we find the presence of long-run equilibrium relationship among Islamic stock markets of similar <b>economic</b> <b>grouping.</b> While, Islamic stock markets from different <b>economic</b> <b>grouping</b> are partially segmented. Empirical results of estimated Vector Error Correction Model provide a lowest level of short run integration among the <b>economic</b> <b>grouping</b> of European-Asian emerging markets, MENA-Latin American and European-Latin American Islamic stock markets. In addition, the level of integration and causality relations among Islamic stock markets tends to change over time, mainly during periods characterized by financial crises.
