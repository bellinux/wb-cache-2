40|$|Key words: life quality, {{permanent}} <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulator,</b> patient This bachelor {{thesis is}} aimed at {{the problems of the}} life quality of the patients with the <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulator.</b> The theoretical part of this work deals with the pieces of knowledge about the people with <b>implanted</b> permanent <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulator</b> and their life quality. In the first chapter there is the description of anatomy and the physiology of cardiovascular system. The next one deals with the problems of cardiostimulation. The third chapter is focused on nursing care before and after the implantation. Thereinafter the education of the patiences is described. The important chapter in the theoretical part is about the life quality. The last point mentioned is the introduction with the notion home monitoring. The practical research was done to discover if there was a life change after the implantation in the patients'lives. The anonymous nonstandard questionnaire was used for this research. A few questions were used from the questionnaire LHFQ (Living with heart failure questionnaire). The research was done from December 2007 to March 2008 in the cardiology consulting room and in internal sick-bed ward of the hospital in Havlickuv Brod...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Implanted</b> <b>cardiac</b> pacing {{systems are}} widely used medical devices for the {{treatment}} of electrophysiological disorders. This study examines morphological and histological characteristics of the foreign body response observed in postmortem human subjects with long term <b>implanted</b> <b>cardiac</b> pacing devices. Four implanted pacing systems were retrieved from cadavers. Tissues were fixed, sectioned and stained with Hæmatoxylin and Eosin, Wright-Giemsa, and Masson’s Trichrome. Fibrous capsules and inflammatory cells were identified and characterized; each fibrous capsule was measured for thickness and classified according to the identity of the material in the tissue-material interface and anatomical location. The surrounding tissues exhibited defined collagen capsules and other evidence of inflammatory cells adjacent to certain materials. Capsule thickness and amount of cellular activity were correlated with position and material in contact with the tissue as well as duration of implant...|$|R

30|$|As {{with all}} MR studies, {{absolute}} contraindications related to magnetic field exposure {{need to be}} respected. Principally, these are implantable material (<b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulators,</b> neurostimulators, cochlear <b>implants</b> etc.), certain types of cardiac valves, ferromagnetic material and metallic foreign bodies. Osteosynthesis material is not an absolute contraindication to MR studies, but when situated {{in close proximity to}} the region of interest, magnetic susceptibility artefacts may worsen image quality to the extent of rendering image interpretation impossible. For that reason, we elect not to perform MR arthrography of the hip for patients with osteosynthesis material {{at the level of the}} cotyle or at the upper extremity of the homolateral femur.|$|R

40|$|Due to an ageing {{population}} and demographic changes worldwide, a higher prevalence {{of heart disease}} is forecasted, which causes an even higher demand for <b>cardiac</b> <b>implants</b> in future. The increasing high incidence of clinical adverse events attributed especially to high-risk medical devices has led an advocated change from many stakeholders. This holds especially true for devices like <b>cardiac</b> <b>implants,</b> with their high-risk nature and high complication rates associated with considerable mortality, due to their frequent use in older populations with frequent co-morbidities. To ensure patients' safety, {{the objective of this}} study is to analyze different <b>cardiac</b> <b>implants</b> recall reasons and different recall systems, based on an overview of the recalls of <b>cardiac</b> <b>implant</b> medical devices in the last decade. On the basis of the results from this structured analysis, this study provides recommendations on how to avoid such recalls from a manufacturer perspective, as well as how to timely react to an adverse event from a post-surveillance system perspective. A systematic search of <b>cardiac</b> <b>implant</b> recalls information has been performed in the PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus databases, as well as data sources in regulatory authorities from 193 UN Member States. Data has been extracted for the years 2004 - 2014 with the following criteria applied: <b>cardiac</b> <b>implant</b> medical device recalls and reasons for recall, associated harm or risk to patients. From the data sources described above, eleven regulatory authorities and 103 recall reports have been included in this study. The largest <b>cardiac</b> <b>implant</b> categories include ICDs 40. 8 %, pacemakers 14. 5 % and stents 14. 5 %. Regarding the recall reasons, the majority of reports were related to device battery problems (33. 0 %) and incorrect therapy delivery (31. 1 %). From a total of 103 recall reports, five reported death and serious injuries. Our review highlights weaknesses in the current <b>cardiac</b> <b>implant</b> recall system, including data reporting and management issues and provides recommendations for the improvement of safety information and management. Due to the mortality associated with the nature of <b>cardiac</b> <b>implants,</b> the traceability and transparency of safety hazards information is crucial. By a structured analysis of recall reasons and their efficient management, important knowledge is gained to inform an effective safety-reporting system for monitoring the safety of <b>cardiac</b> <b>implanted</b> patients, ideally by building up <b>cardiac</b> <b>implant</b> registries worldwide in the future...|$|R

50|$|An <b>implanted</b> <b>cardiac</b> {{resynchronization}} {{device is}} a medical device used in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). It resynchronizes the contractions of the heart’s ventricles by sending tiny electrical impulses to the heart muscle, which can help the heart pump blood throughout the body more efficiently. CRT defibrillators (CRT-D) also incorporate the additional function of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, to quickly terminate an abnormally fast, life-threatening heart rhythm. CRT and CRT-D have become increasingly important therapeutic options for patients with moderate and severe heart failure.|$|R

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Until recently, {{concepts}} {{of care for}} people with heart failure had rarely included preparation for unavoidable imminent death or caring for the dying. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on current end-of-life issues specific to heart failure patients. Recent findings Mortality in the heart failure population remains high, especially shortly after the first acute heart failure hospitalization. Patients with systolic heart failure die more frequently from progressive heart failure or sudden cardiac death; patients with diastolic heart failure for noncardiovascular reasons and sudden cardiac death. The mode of haemodynamic decline leading to heart failure death can be characterised by low cardiac output (with or without secondary end-organ dysfunction), congestion, {{or a combination of}} both. A new model of end-of-life trajectories has been proposed which takes into account influence of comorbidities on the prognosis of heart failure. Advance care planning for patients with <b>implanted</b> <b>cardiac</b> devices {{has been shown to be}} unsatisfactory. A recent strategy for managing implantable cardioverter defibrillators in patients approaching death is presented. Summary There is an emerging need to define specific challenges for end-of-life care for approaching death in heart failure patients. More research and education are needed to improve care for dying heart failure patients, including those with <b>implanted</b> <b>cardiac</b> devices...|$|R
50|$|While at MGH/MIT, Cywinski {{developed}} bio-galvanic implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>stimulators.</b> In 3-5 year {{tests performed}} by Professor Allan Hahn {{and his team}} at the Animal Research Center of the University of Missouri, the bio-galvanic pacemakers implanted in dogs functioned well with a projected lifespan of over 50 years. This {{was in the early}} 1970s when the industry-wide standard was to use mercury batteries in implantable cardiac pacemakers, which lasted only two years. At the same time, the leading manufacturer of pacemakers heavily invested in the development of nuclear batteries with similar projected life spans of 50-80 years. They were quickly abandoned due to nuclear waste handling problems. Cywinski’s bio-galvanic pacemakers were not adopted by the industry, either. In the end, all implantable power sources were narrowed down to lithium cells which then became the industry standard.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that once a part of an <b>implanted</b> <b>cardiac</b> device becomes infected, it is usually impossible to cure the infection without completely removing all prosthetic material from the body. Consequently the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) included the pocket infection or erosion as a class I indication for pacemaker lead exctraction. However, the procedure still carries {{a high risk of}} life-threatening complications due to fibrotic attachments between leads, veins, valves or other endocardial structures, notwithstanding specific tools and techniques that have been developed to assist the lead removal, preventing tissue laceration...|$|R
30|$|However, these {{portable}} {{technologies are}} still not as reliable as conventional virtopsy technologies (e.g. MRI or CT). In general, ultrasound imaging cannot match these technologies in terms of data quality, detail and resolution. Nevertheless, these hand-held devices cost far less and {{may be the best}} alternative for individuals with metallic heart valves, pacemakers, <b>implanted</b> <b>cardiac</b> defibrillators, or high body mass index (preventing them from being able to physically fit in a medical imaging scanner)—currently unsuitable for conventional virtopsy. Diagnosis with these portable devices can potentially prevent contamination and spread of communicable diseases in such regions, as well as increasing public acceptance of usage.|$|R
50|$|Azimilide {{dihydrochloride}} is a chlorophenylfuranyl compound, which slows repolarization of {{the heart}} and prolongs the QT interval of the electrocardiogram. Prolongation of atrial or ventricular repolarization can provide an anti-arrhythmic benefit in patients with heart rhythm disturbances, and this has been the primary interest in the clinical development azimilide. In rare cases, excessive prolongation of ventricular repolarization by azimilide can result in predisposition towards severe ventricular arrhythmias. Most recent clinical trials have investigated the use of azimilide in reducing the frequency and severity of arrhythmias in patients with <b>implanted</b> <b>cardiac</b> pacemakers-defibrillators, where rare pro-arrhythmic events are rescued by the device.|$|R

Increasing use of microwave commercially in communications and domestically, as in micro-ovens, increases the hazard of exposure to microwave.

40|$|With {{advances}} in cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery, several newer implantable cardiac devices have become {{common in the}} surgical population. Multichamber pacemakers, <b>implanted</b> <b>cardiac</b> defibrillators and ventricular assist devices are frequent in current day practice. Many of the newer implantable cardiac electronic devices are targeted at managing heart failure. While managing such patients for non-cardiac surgeries, specific issues related to equipment characteristics and troubleshooting should be a priority for the anaesthesiologists. There is a possibility of malfunction of the devices resulting in catastrophic outcomes. Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} understand the pathophysiology, device characteristics and troubleshooting before embarking on anaesthetising patients with implantable cardiac electronic devices...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cardiac</b> {{pacemakers}} and <b>implanted</b> <b>cardiac</b> defibrillators (ICDs) {{are used}} increasingly in clinical practice, and no evidence exists indicating that performing routine electrodiagnostic studies on patients with these devices pose a safety hazard. However, there are theoretical concerns that electrical impulses of nerve conduction studies (NCS) could be erroneously sensed by devices {{and result in}} unintended inhibition or triggering of output or reprogramming of the device. In general, the closer the stimulation site is to the pacemaker and pacing leads, the greater the chance for inducing a voltage of sufficient amplitude to inhibit the pacemaker. Despite such concerns, no immediate or delayed adverse effects have been reported with routine NCS.|$|R
