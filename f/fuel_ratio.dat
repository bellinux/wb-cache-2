25|$|Since {{heavy water}} is less {{efficient}} at slowing neutrons, CANDU needs a larger moderator to <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> {{and a larger}} core for the same power output. Although a calandria-based core is cheaper to build, its size increases the cost for standard features like the containment building. Generally nuclear plant construction and operations are ≈65% of overall lifetime cost; for CANDU costs are dominated by construction even more. Fueling CANDU is cheaper than other reactors, costing only ≈10% of the total, so the overall price per kWh electricity is comparable. The next-generation Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR) mitigates these disadvantages by having light water coolant and using a more compact core with less moderator.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>fuel</b> {{injection}} <b>ratio</b> on the combustion and emission characteristics of stratified lean mixture combustion was investigated for a spray-guided liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) direct injection engine. Inter-injection spark-ignition combustion—a specially designed combustion strategy for LPG fuel derived from a two-staged injection—was employed to maximize the improvement in thermal efficiency when combustion stability is secured. When changing the <b>fuel</b> injection <b>ratio,</b> the optimum spark advance and fuel injection timings were experimentally determined to maximize the thermal efficiency based on sweeping timings. The optimum <b>fuel</b> injection <b>ratio</b> with the highest thermal efficiency (42. 76 %) and stable operation was 60 %/ 40 %, with the optimization of the spark advance and fuel injection timing, because of the locally rich mixture region in the recirculation zone.

Four different fuel loads were used for wood pellets (10, 20 and 30 kW) and one fuel load for straw (10 kW).
