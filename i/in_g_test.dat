This is particularly important in test generation, since recent work suggests that random search may in practice be equally effective, whereas the reformulation as a many-objective problem seems to be more effective. To shed light on the influence of the search algorithms, we empirically evaluate six different algorithms on a selection of non-trivial open source classes.

The ERE membership problem asks whether a word w of size n {{belongs to the}} language of an ERE R of size m.

In each group nine bone-plate constructs were tested until failure, three each in bending, compression and torsion. In each group, 21 bone-plate constructs were tested for failure in fatigue testing, seven each for bending, compression and torsion. In all static testing {{no significant differences were}} found between G 1 and G 2, except ultimate moment <b>in</b> torsion <b>test</b> (<b>G</b> 2 >G 1; P= 0. 008). Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between groups in axial compression fatigue <b>testing</b> (<b>G</b> 1 >G 2; P< 0. 05) and four-point bending fatigue <b>testing</b> (<b>G</b> 1 <G 2; P< 0. 05) in maximum load, minimum load, maximum moment, and minimum moment. In conclusion, screw length can affect the mechanical properties of locking reconstruction plate. Compared to bicortical screws, monocortical screws were less resistant to bending than axial compression. This must be considered when choosing implant, particularly in fractures under high axial loads...|$|R

In this paper, we present a Reconfigurable 5 <b>G</b> <b>Testbed</b> Solution used to support different V 2 X and Industry 4. 0 use cases. Enabling Cooperative Collision Avoidance for automated driving using 5 G technology to improve the road safety. 5 G enhanced with low-latency, high reliability and throughput {{is one of the}} crucial goals fitting the diverse requirements for V 2 X communications. 5 G is also a key enabler for new industry addressing challenging solutions. We discuss different V 2 X and industrial use cases implemented in real field test, using a 5 <b>G</b> radio <b>testbed</b> based on flexible and re-configurable software defined radio that is designed for cooperative automated driving and new generation industrial communication. The use cases of Emergency Brake, Teleoperated Driving and Robot As A Service are elaborated and tested with the same 5 <b>G</b> <b>Testbed.</b> We present our 5 <b>G</b> <b>testbed</b> solution showing system design and technical enablers that can achieve the most stringent linklevel communication requirements.
