Environmental data was collected within representative spaces within the hospital, with some difficulty, over a two year period revealing overheating in mild conditions relative to a 24 o C threshold for sleep but concealed within the customary 28 o C threshold marking the upper limit of acceptable conditions. The building was modeled against current climate data to predict 2010 conditions, calibrated against observed data in 2010, and then against the CIBSE predictive climate database for the 2030 ’s for the location suggesting a progressive deterioration in peak conditions. Four adaptive intervention schemes were subsequently developed: an ‘enlightened’ industry standard ‘passiv-haus’ option of super <b>insulation,</b> <b>sealed</b> glazing and heat recovery; a lower technology based scheme promoting natural cross-ventilation by providing greater opening glazing area, opening up the plan, sun shading and additional insulation; an enhanced natural ventilation scheme glazing over the courtyards to provide supply air winter gardens, and an advanced natural ventilation option pursuing Passive Downdraught Cooling.

40|$|Verifying {{the quality}} of a large TPS {{structure}} component’s material and therefore providing its flight readiness capability, belongs {{to one of the most}} challenging objectives for non-destructive evaluation techniques. Especially when different components of fibre ceramic composites are joined together or attached to other parts of differing materials (e. g. bulk ceramics, metals, <b>insulations,</b> <b>seal</b> elements), it is always of great interest to obtain proper information about the interfaces between these parts. Well known and approved NDE methods such as radiography, ultrasound inspection or lock-in thermography only offer a two-dimensional view of a three-dimensional structure with a projection of all detectable features through the structure’s thickness. This gives way to sometimes quite distinct interpretations of microstructural features and defects. Furthermore, some of these inspection techniques do not allow to scan structural components without using a coupling media such as water or at least a contact gel as used with ultrasound transducers. Other NDE techniques are not suitable to inspect special regions which are located at inaccessible areas as for example the inner side of a curved structure with joined stiffeners as reinforcement elements. Sometimes it is just the penetration depth that is not sufficient to get the necessary information of failure critical areas. However, with X-ray based computed tomography (CT), non-destructive evaluation will be enforced with a powerful tool that provides three-dimensional data with exceptional high resolution. CT inspections allow the detection of flaws such as microcracks, voids and porosity distributions in the microstructure and joining interfaces between different structure components in every part of the structure’s volume. Eight years ago, DLR was successfully using computed tomography for the first time to prove the good quality of the joining interfaces between the X- 38 nose cap structure and its CMC load introduction attachments. Because there was no CT available at that time, it was decided to use a medical CT facility at a hospital nearby. Though it was not possible to obtain images of a higher resolution, the interfaces of the outer CMC shell (nose cap) and each load introduction attachment or pressure port plug was inspected in detail. In the meantime, DLR is operating its own CT test facilities for systematic non-destructive material inspections. In the following it is shown how the large CT facility v|tome|x L 450 was successfully used for an in-situ evaluation of the load introduction attachments of EXPERT’s CMC nose cap structure. ...|$|R
