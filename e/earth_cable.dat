This distinction makes Siena the first city in Italy to complete Telecom's Socrates Project (Progetto Socrate). As a result, the town can claim that almost every house is wired for cable. The wiring, built by private companies in partnership with the city, helped to create a civic public station (Channel Civic Sienese) cable that transmits information and local news and gives access to Internet broadband. In 2007, however, the station was privatised, separating the TV from the Internet.

50|$|Equipotential bonding {{involves}} joining together metalwork that is {{or may be}} earthed {{so that it is}} at {{the same}} potential (i.e., voltage) everywhere. Such is commonly used under transformer banks by power companies and under large computer installations. Exact rules for electrical installations vary by country, locality, or supplying power company. Equipotential bonding is done from the Service Panel consumer unit (also known as a fuse box, breaker box, or distribution board) to incoming water and gas services. It is also done in bathrooms where all exposed metal that leaves the bathroom including metal pipes and the earths of electrical circuits must be bonded together to ensure that they are always at the same potential. Isolated metal objects, including metal fittings fed by plastic pipe, are not required to be bonded. In Australia and South Africa, a house's earth cables must be connected both to an earthing rod driven into the ground and also to the plumbing or gas pipe.In Australia a house's <b>earth</b> <b>cable</b> must be connected to all reinforcing mesh in any concrete under any bathroom and in any swimming pool.|$|E
40|$|In 1952 Stanley Miller and Harold Urey {{conducted}} an experiment that would simulate {{the conditions of}} early earth (Miller, 1953). The purpose was to observe the chemical origins of life, and the conclusion supported an earlier theory that such conditions favor the synthesis of more complex organic compounds from simpler inorganic molecules. The research conducted in Dr. Sebree’s lab {{is an extension of}} these early findings. It is believed that early Earth was composed mostly of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane as opposed to our atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen today. Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, has qualities relatively comparable to those of Earth. It is the only body in our solar system, besides Earth, that displays clear evidence of surface liquid. Titan also is unique due to its dense atmosphere. Titan’s atmosphere is largely composed of nitrogen, like Earth, with methane and other minor components leading to the formation of organic hazes. Where Earth has water cycles, Titan has similar methane cycles. In fact, it is believed that Titan’s atmospheric behavior {{is similar to that of}} early <b>Earth</b> (<b>Cable,</b> 2011). Titan’s atmosphere can only provide oxygen through carbon monoxide in relatively small quantities, contrary to the abundant amounts of molecular oxygen on Earth. Through new studies it has been shown that biological molecules can possibly form from Titan’s trace oxygen present (Horst, 2012). If biological molecules, such as amino acids, can be photochemically synthesized in laboratory settings from carbon monoxide and other components of Titan’s atmosphere, this may open up a new understanding of the earliest earth. However there is not a lot of recent research being done in this area, except for what we are doing currently. Hence, there is a smaller selection of related pieces of literature out there that would aid in our research. In a way, the research that is being conducted is filling a void for this field of study. In fact many of the the projects taking place in the lab are going on to be published, because of the new information that they are providing. One major driving force for this research is to provide the scientific community with the data that this study is able to collect in the lab, because there is not a lot of similar work being done elsewhere. This research project will modify concepts developed during my previous research with Dr. Sebree to study the sources of oxygen on Titan that could possibly produce aerosols in our lab. For the majority of this work, the sources of oxygen will be carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and molecular oxygen. These components will be individually combined with methane in order to form products. The goal of this research project is to observe glyoxylic acid and glycolic acid derivatives, which will be done by manipulating the methane/oxygen ratios. A lot of this research will be conducted using the GM/MS instrument in the biochemistry department. The results of this research project will include diagrams and tables showing the various compounds discovered in the aerosol product, as well as comparison of the oxygen reactants tested throughout the proposed method...|$|E

This bridge was made of boats secured by iron chains which were attached to eight different cast iron statues located on each river bank, cast in the shape of recumbent oxen. The flood pulled the oxen from the sandy banks into the river, where they sunk to the bottom; after this loss, the local officials issued a proclamation for submission of ideas on how to recover the statues.

40|$|Abstract—The {{influence}} of earth stratification on underground power cable impedances is investigated in this paper. A rigorous so-lution {{of the electromagnetic}} field for the case of underground con-ductors and a two-layer earth is presented. Analytic expressions for the self and mutual impedances of the cable are derived. The in-volved semi-infinite integrals are calculated by a novel, numerically stable, and efficient integration scheme. Typical single-core cable arrangements are examined for a combination of layer depths and earth resistivities, based on actual measurements. The accuracy of the results over a wide frequency range is justified by a proper fi-nite-element method formulation. The differences in cable imped-ances due to earth stratification are presented.

40|$|In modern {{developing}} world, ICT (Information and Communication Technology) usage {{is rapidly}} increasing and all commercial buildings comprise with very sensitive telecommunication equipments {{in order to}} facilitate day to day requirements. All such equipments are interconnected with network cable wiring system unless few remote operating equipments exist. On the other hand, building electrical wiring system is also laid throughout the building. In this context, it may have opportunity to interfere unwanted electrical noise to the data and voice systems hence malfunction or giving flaw data outputs. Electrical noise cause for an abnormal humming sound of the voice signals and thereby degrade the quality of sound systems. Such interference can happen due to both radiated and conductive electrical noise. One of major reasons for the conducted noise is, operation of switched mode power supplies hence lead to create of earth loops that should eliminate at the design and installation stages. Analysis of electrical noise in the system and design filtering systems need to be practiced, when noise issues are raised after the commissioning of electrical installations. It is required to do analyzing of electrical noise in the building in order to come across comprehensive conclusion for root cause for the disturbances. In doing so, harmonic levels, noise in the live wires, noise through the earth wire and earth loop possibilities are investigated. The most important part is to identify major frequency components filter those from the system. Different type of filter arrangements can be used to evaluate its performances against the noise level of the site. Similarly, installation guide lines can be followed prior to the site erection and that is the very effective method to avoid unnecessary noise induced in sensitive equipments. Though general filter arrangements eliminate noise, some frequency ranges need to be filtered separately, according to the site conditions. Since calculated L and C values can’t be exactly found out, next closet practical values were chosen thereby cutoff frequency is slightly shifted. Simulation results, for common mode noise filtering indicate, 106 Hz to 107 Hz minimal variation of cutoff frequency and 0. 03 variation in damping factor. Earth leakage currents drastically reduced with increasing of the earth line choke and that is possible way to control common mode noise. Introducing separate <b>earth</b> <b>cables</b> instead of single copper tape in the vertical busbar trunking system, is the elimination method of the earth loops between floors at far apart in the high rise building.

Thus, any point on Earth can be served by a space elevator. Also a whole network of orbital rings can be built, which, by crossing over the poles, could cover the whole planet and be capable of taking over most of freight and passenger transport. By an array of elevators and several geostationary ring stations, asteroid or Moon material can be received and gently put down where land fills are needed.

By using a counterweight, a cable would be lowered from geostationary orbit to the surface of Earth, while the counterweight was extended from the satellite away from <b>Earth,</b> keeping the <b>cable</b> constantly over the same spot {{on the surface of the}} Earth.
