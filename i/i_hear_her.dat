6000|$|I {{see her in}} the dewy flowers, [...] I see {{her sweet}} and fair: [...] <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> in the tunefu' birds, [...] <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> charm the air: [...] There's not a bonie flower that springs, [...] By fountain, shaw, or green; [...] There's not a bonie bird that sings, [...] But minds me o' my Jean.|$|E
6000|$|Freedom, {{as every}} schoolboy knows, [...] Once shrieked as Kosciusko fell; [...] On every wind, indeed, that blows [...] <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> yell.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hollo!' said Harry, starting, 'now I {{begin to}} believe in Mrs. Ernescliffe, when <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> drawing down herself as an example to Flora.' ...|$|E
60|$|BURKE--[Scornfully.] No, and <b>I</b> wasn't <b>hearing</b> <b>her</b> say the sun {{is shining}} either.|$|R
60|$|Lady Bracknell. In {{spite of}} what <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> must see her at once. Let her be sent for.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you've {{done this}} sort of thing before," [...] she reproached, calling loudly, so that <b>I</b> might <b>hear,</b> <b>her</b> lips close to my ear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hark! <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> {{battered}} side, [...] With a low and sullen shock, [...] Dashed, {{amid the}} foaming tide, [...] Full upon a sunken rock.|$|E
60|$|DAVID [determinedly]. Younger. Whist! <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> winding the clock. Mind, not a {{word about}} the {{minister}} to her, James. Don't even mention religion this day.|$|E
6000|$|One woman sulkier {{than the}} rest [...] Would still refuse her food,-- [...] O Jesus God! <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> cries-- [...] I see her in her blood! ...|$|E
6000|$|Nora {{suddenly}} {{held up her}} finger. [...] "Isn't {{that the}} car?" [...] she asked. [...] "Why, it must be mummy, here already. Yes, <b>I</b> can <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> voice!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too far away, Mary. If lost Margaret {{called me}} <b>I</b> mightn't <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> there. <b>I</b> must {{be here when}} my time comes. It can't be very far off now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Papa!" [...] she cried, [...] "you {{have been}} cruel to Chris. The door is locked; <b>I</b> can <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> crying--why {{have you been}} cruel?" [...] Without waiting to be answered, she flew out again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw her, in the fire, but now. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> in music, in the wind, in {{the dead}} stillness of the night," [...] {{returned}} the haunted man.|$|E
6000|$|Wood. I am {{sensible}} of it, little Judith; there's {{a time to}} come shall pay for all. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> returning: not a word; away. [...] [Exit JUDITH.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, I {{think it}} is; {{especially}} when we are expecting the Marquise,' Effie responded. Then she added, 'But here she comes now; <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> carriage in the court.' ...|$|E
6000|$|To die--that {{does not}} disturb me; we {{of the service}} never care for death. But if I could see her once more! if <b>I</b> could <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> bugle sing again and say, [...] "It is I, Soldier--come!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{waited for}} me to go on. She was deeply interested. <b>I</b> could <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> breath coming fast, though we were walking at a snail's pace. I longed to confide in her absolutely, but I dared not.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is not an}} old cat, Lizzie! and <b>I</b> won't <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> called so. If {{you think}} so, you shouldn't come here. And she hasn't interfered. That is, she has done nothing that she ought not to have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Sadie, I hope {{with all}} my heart that {{you will be able to}} say the same when you are the same age as your Aunt. Surely <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> calling!" ...|$|E
6000|$|But hark! methinks <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> hallow'd tongue! [...] In distant trills it echoes o'er the tide; [...] Now meets mine {{ear with}} warbles wildly free, [...] As swells the lark's {{meridian}} extacy.|$|E
60|$|For {{that season}} {{we must be}} apart, For a little length of years, Till my life's last hour nears, And, above the beat of my heart, <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>Her</b> voice in my ears.|$|E
6000|$|... "For why? You {{would that}} I PLAY it, {{and when my}} uncle say 'Where go Pepita? She is loss,' someone shall say, 'Oh! <b>I</b> have <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> tink-a-tink {{in the garden of}} the Americano, who lif alone.' And then--it ess finish!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--no; {{nor will}} I have aught of them," [...] exclaimed the traveller, {{starting}} from his seat, and pacing rapidly across the room. [...] "My father, I know, is dead, and I have forgiven him. My mother--what could <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>her</b> but misery? <b>I</b> will <b>hear</b> nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|Christmas was coming, I have said, and Marjorie {{was wild}} with expectation. <b>I</b> could <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> merry treble entreating Mariposilla {{to tell how}} Santa Claus could ever come to California, {{where there was no}} snow, except upon the tops of the mountains.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{absolutely}} unaccountable," [...] said the captain. [...] "But {{we must go}} back to Mrs. Cliff. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> calling. And if Maka has come to his senses, perhaps he can tell us something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “There is one at Northrop just now, and it {{is rather}} more than likely that you will see him this {{afternoon}} if he suspects that Violet Wayne is coming here. I think <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> now.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is very odd, sir. I {{can hardly}} believe it myself: and yet it must be true. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> voice even at this moment. Oh! my dear Mr. Dacre, I am the happiest fellow that ever breathed!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall start East {{as soon as}} {{the captain}} sails," [...] replied his sister, [...] "and I do not know what Mrs. Cliff will do until <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> from <b>her,</b> and as for Cheditafa and Mok, we shall take them with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She ain't that;--she ain't that,' said John. 'She ain't that at all. She's no slut. <b>I</b> won't <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> called so;--not by her grandfather. But, oh, {{she has a}} mind to put me so abouts, that I'll have to go {{home and}} hang myself' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{attend to}} this, Julian. I {{am going to}} pass from my memory of what {{happened}} a week ago to my memory of what happened five minutes since. You were present; I {{want to know if}} you heard it too." [...] He paused, and, without taking his eyes off Julian, pointed backward to Mercy. [...] "There is the lady who is engaged to marry me," [...] he resumed. [...] "Did I, or did <b>I</b> not, <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> say that she had come out of a Refuge, and that she was going back to a Refuge? Did I, or did <b>I</b> not, <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> own to my face that her name was Mercy Merrick? Answer me, Julian. My good friend, answer me, for the sake of old times." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> hurrying feet,--awake, awake, Thou laggard in love's battle! once {{at least}} Let me drink deep of passion's wine, and slake My parched {{being with the}} nectarous feast Which even gods affect! O come, Love, come, Still {{we have time to}} reach the cavern of thine azure home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I want {{so much to}} hear Madame Laurin sing," [...] she sobbed. [...] "I feel lak I {{could die}} easier if <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> sing just one leetle song. She is Frenchwoman, too, and she sing all de ole French songs--de ole songs my mudder sing long 'go. Oh! I so want to hear Madame Laurin sing." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was ages ago, When I {{was quite}} strong: I have waited since,--O, I have waited so long! - Yea, I set me to own The house, where now lone I dwell in void rooms Booming hollow as tombs! But I never come near her, Though nightly <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b> And my cheek has grown thin And my hair has grown gray With this waiting therein; But she still keeps away! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is, indeed," [...] replied Tip, gravely. [...] "These pills may be {{of great}} use to us. I wonder if old Mombi knew {{they were in the}} bottom of the pepper-box. <b>I</b> {{remember}} <b>hearing</b> <b>her</b> say that she got the Powder of Life from this same Nikidik." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but I want to {{hold her}} hands while the {{drumming}} takes place. <b>I</b> want to <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> voice {{at the same time}} with 'Mitchell's.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Looking up despairingly.] <b>I</b> can <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> voice now. <b>I</b> can see {{the look}} of her eyes. She asked me to give her another chance, and I refused. It was so pitiful to hear the way she appealed to me, only I was mad, and I couldn't feel it.|$|R
