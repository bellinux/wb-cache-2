5|$|When the {{announcer}} {{at the ball}} asks {{if there is a}} doctor in the house, Mac puts <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up,</b> to Caroline's embarrassment. Things get more embarrassing when Guy also volunteers, and asks why Caroline is sitting next to Mac when she is Guy's fiancée. A unconscious patient lies on an operating table. Guy touches her breasts, takes pictures of her naked body under the blanket, and kisses her. Caroline alleges that the patient is transgender, which repels Guy. Sue White then appears in a tutu, claiming that the patient is stalking Mac, and repeating the assertion that the patient is transgender.|$|E
25|$|Poke check: When the goaltender {{wants to}} poke the puck {{away from an}} {{opposing}} player, he quickly slides <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> the stick, thrusting forward towards the puck. An improperly played poke check is a risky play; the goaltender may miss, and the puck-carrier will be left with an unguarded net. In tight situations, a quick, hard jab could be used.|$|E
25|$|As a consequence, certain traditions {{stated that}} popes {{throughout}} the medieval period {{were required to}} undergo a procedure wherein they sat on a special chair {{with a hole in}} the seat. A cardinal would have the task of putting <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> the hole to check whether the pope had testicles, or doing a visual examination. This procedure is not taken seriously by most historians, and there is no documented instance. It is probably a scurrilous legend based on the existence of two ancient stone chairs with holes in the seats that probably dated from Roman times and may have been used because of their ancient imperial origins. Their original purpose is obscure.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} peered around, stealthily came closer, {{still with}} <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{force had}} navigated fairly far up river {{when they came}} under {{unexpected}} fire from Spanish Florida. The British soon silenced the fire, but Phillott decided to retreat as the river ahead was narrow (only 30 to 40 yards wide), with commanding heights and houses to their rear. During the withdrawal, the expedition was exposed to harassing fire for over ten hours. In all, the expedition cost the British three men killed and 15 wounded. Bartholomew, of Erebus, was hit four times. He took his first hit {{in his head and}} then a second ball hit his middle finger and thumb when he put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> to feel the first wound. He was also hit in the neck and throat. Phillott too was wounded twice.|$|E
500|$|In early April 1945, Anna {{arranged}} for Rutherfurd {{to come over}} from her South Carolina estate in Aiken to meet her father at his [...] "Little White House" [...] in Warm Springs, Georgia, the small plain rustic cottage built at the polio therapy center by the heated mineral water springs resort that Roosevelt helped develop beginning in the 1920s. Rutherfurd and Shoumatoff along with two female cousins were sitting there as the artist worked on her painting of FDR as he sat at a card table by the living room stone fireplace, fine-tuning a future speech and reading over some other papers on the early afternoon of April 12, 1945. In this quiet domestic scene as the two had just been smiling at each other, Roosevelt suddenly placed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> on his forehead and temple, saying [...] "I have a terrific headache", then slumped over losing consciousness. Later his two doctors called in quickly said he suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. Since a thorough medical exam a year before, he had received increasingly more intensive care and concern from a young recently recruited private physician.|$|E
500|$|Pearson {{finished}} third in the 1974 points after competing in 19 of 30 events. It was the only season where drivers were awarded points based on their money earnings, which ended up rewarding drivers who finished high in the big-money races. He won seven races, including the Winston 500 by 0.17 seconds over Benny Parsons. Pearson began to earn the nickname of [...] "silver fox" [...] after the 1974 Firecracker 400. Entering the final lap, he was leading followed closely by Petty. Fearing that Petty would do a slingshot pass, he slowed a little, pulled his car off to the side to simulate a blown motor, and threw <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> in the air as a motion of defeat. Petty quickly passed opening a lead of several car lengths exiting turn 2.Using the draft, Pearson closed in quickly down the backstretch and through turns 3 and 4 and drew right behind Petty. Coming out of the final corner, Pearson pulled to the inside and did a slingshot pass back to win the race by a car length. The International Race of Champions (IROC) invited him to participate in their first annual all-star stock car racing series for the 1973–74 season and he finished fourth of the twelve drivers.|$|E
60|$|Sewell held <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up,</b> {{and though}} small and well-shaped they were scarred and brown.|$|R

500|$|Star Wars is {{frequently}} referenced in 30 Rock, {{beginning with the}} pilot episode where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting {{that he is a}} Jedi. Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and saying she dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four Halloweens. Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference [...] "started happening organically" [...] when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference [...] "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on [...] "it became a thing where [...] tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a [...] "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to Robert Carlock, who she described as [...] "the resident expert". In this episode, Star Wars is referenced twice: once when Liz tells Floyd that she and Pete are watching the movies on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list, but they only own Star Wars and Tootsie so they keep watching those two films. It is again referenced during Tracy's dream, when Thomas Jefferson holds <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> to Tracy and says [...] "May the Force be with you".|$|E
500|$|The [...] "enhanced" [...] video {{states that}} there are 724 {{references}} to Twin Peaks in the episode's closing scene. Among them, Jack Smith wears an eye patch and a red suit and dances funny, referencing not only the aforementioned [...] "One Eyes Jacks" [...] brothel and Nadine Hurley, but a dream sequence in Peaks, where a character known as the Man from Another Place wore a similar suit and danced in a bizarre fashion. In the final scene Carlton is seen holding <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> and stating [...] "that is a damn fine cup of cider". In the Twin Peaks pilot Agent Cooper holds his hand {{the same way and}} states [...] "that is a damn fine cup of coffee." [...] Additionally, Carlton is later holding a cup of coffee on its side, displaying that the coffee is now solid in a fashion mimicking the same action by Agent Cooper in the final episode. A seven-foot tall man (John DeSantis) wearing a bow tie looks much like the giant from Agent Cooper's dream. Randy is seen at the end barking out the window like Bobby Briggs did to James Hurley in the holding cells. Bob Barker is seen dancing with a picture just as Leland Palmer did in Twin Peaks. The episode's end credits are accompanied by soap opera-type music and a shot of Paula's prom picture; Twin Peaks credits did exactly the same thing with Laura's photo.|$|E
2500|$|One day in 1977 [...] {{he ran a}} {{race for}} me at Calder. [...] I walked up to him after he finished. He put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> to wave, {{and there was a}} {{powerful}} explosion. [...] A bolt of lightning came out of the sky and hit him.|$|E
60|$|The captain {{shut his}} eyes tight like a child: he held <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> at last with a tragic and ridiculous gesture.|$|R
60|$|Young Wickson put <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> first, {{then turned}} to confront Biedenbach, who held a thirty-thirty {{automatic}} rifle on him. Wickson was imperturbable.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated and understood. He threw <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> in a queer half-theatrical gesture. He had no word to say. He {{turned from}} her.|$|R
2500|$|On 7 May 2006, The Sunday Times quoted Linda McDougall, wife of Austin Mitchell, {{as saying}} that in 1978 Prescott had pushed her [...] "quite forcefully" [...] against a wall and put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> her skirt {{as she opened the}} door for him to a meeting in her own house just after her husband became an MP; Prescott had not met McDougall before.|$|E
2500|$|Jaan Puhvel notes {{similarities}} between the Norse myth in which the god Týr inserts his hand into the wolf Fenrir's mouth while the other gods bind him with Gleipnir, only for Fenrir to bite off Týr's hand when he discovers he cannot break his bindings, and the Iranian myth in which Jamshid rescues his brother's corpse from Ahriman's bowels by shoving <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> Ahriman's anus and pulling out his brother's corpse, only for his hand to become infected with leprosy. In both accounts, an authority figure forces the evil entity into submission by inserting his hand into the being's orifice (in Fenrir's case the mouth, in Ahriman's the anus) and losing it. Fenrir and Ahriman fulfill different roles in their own mythological traditions and {{are unlikely to be}} remnants of a Proto-Indo-European [...] "evil god"; nonetheless, {{it is clear that the}} [...] "binding myth" [...] is of Proto-Indo-European origin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said little}} Abraham, brightly, from the window-bench; [...] "and I seed it! {{and it did}} twinkle when he put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> to his mistarshers.

50|$|In {{addition}} to Johnson, several {{witnesses to the}} shooting of Michael Brown described him as having <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>up</b> during the encounter. However, no one else recalled Brown asking Wilson not to shoot his firearm.|$|R
60|$|Then Allonby lurched unsteadily to the door, {{and held}} <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> {{as he opened}} it.|$|E
