40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} counterrotating fast discharge homopolar generator (HPG) and a counterrotating active rotary <b>flux</b> <b>compressor</b> (CARFC) for space application is reported. The HPG is a counterrotating spool-type homopolar with superconducting field coil excitation. It delivers a 20 -ms, 145 -kJ pulse to a magnetoplasmahydrodynamic thruster. The peak output current is 42. 7 kA at 240 V. After 20 ms the current is 29. 7 kA at 167 V. The CARFC delivers ten 50 -kJ, 250 microsecond pulses at 50 -ms interval to six Xenon flash lamps pumping an Nd glass laser. The <b>flux</b> <b>compressor</b> is counterrotating for torque compensation. Current is started in the machine with a 5 -kV, 5 -kJ pulse-charged capacitor.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} {{to use a}} high-voltage pulse transformer for impedance matching an explosive generator to a higher impedance load. Also, a particular application may require high-voltage rather than the high current which <b>flux</b> <b>compressor</b> generators (FCGs) normally deliver when driving suitable low impedance loads. We have designed and built transformers for use with FCGs. They are air-core transformers with measured coupling coefficients {{in the range of}} 0. 88 to 0. 94. The turns ratio for these transformers vary from 10 to 40. We have used these transformers in FCG shots and have measured 250 kV and 250 kA on the secondary, simultaneously and without breakdown. So far the FCG and not the transformer have limited the voltage. Experiments to determine a voltage limit are ongoing. Our design and results are presented...|$|E

Because of recent changes in Russia, there are {{opportunities}} to acquire and evaluate technologies for ultrahigh-magnetic-field <b>flux</b> <b>compressors</b> and ultrahigh-energy, ultrahigh-current pulsed-power generators that could provide inexpensive access to various extreme matter conditions and high-energy-density physics regimes.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{and electrical}} properties of superconductors were {{a challenge for}} many inventors and designers to use superconducting materials {{in the construction of}} fully superconducting voltage and current sources commonly called fluxpumps. In the past twenty years a large variety of mechanically or electrically driven devices have been proposed an d successfully operated. In this review the basic principle of operation of each class of devices is shown and specific material problems and limitations are reported. The review wil l be published in two parts. Part 1 deals with mechanical devices such as <b>flux</b> <b>compressors</b> and dynamos. Although those devices must have been of great importance for technical application, their con-struction and operation offered great experience with regard to the properties of superconducting materials, their joint techniques witching and mechanical and magnetic stability under ac and dc conditions. In this part also a start is made with the more promising class of electrically driven rectifier fluxpumps. With these rectifiers, current levels over 10 kA can be obtained with high efficiency.

40|$|This is the Final Report for LDRD 04 -ERD- 086, 'Electro-Thermal-Mechanical Simulation Capability'. The accomplishments {{are well}} {{documented}} in five peer-reviewed publications and six conference presentations and hence {{will not be}} detailed here. The purpose of this LDRD was to research and develop numerical algorithms for three-dimensional (3 D) Electro-Thermal-Mechanical simulations. LLNL {{has long been a}} world leader in the area of computational mechanics, and recently several mechanics codes have become 'multiphysics' codes with the addition of fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and chemistry. However, these multiphysics codes do not incorporate the electromagnetics that is required for a coupled Electro-Thermal-Mechanical (ETM) simulation. There are numerous applications for an ETM simulation capability, such as explosively-driven magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>compressors,</b> electromagnetic launchers, inductive heating and mixing of metals, and MEMS. A robust ETM simulation capability will enable LLNL physicists and engineers to better support current DOE programs, and will prepare LLNL for some very exciting long-term DoD opportunities. We define a coupled Electro-Thermal-Mechanical (ETM) simulation as a simulation that solves, in a self-consistent manner, the equations of electromagnetics (primarily statics and diffusion), heat transfer (primarily conduction), and non-linear mechanics (elastic-plastic deformation, and contact with friction). There is no existing parallel 3 D code for simulating ETM systems at LLNL or elsewhere. While there are numerous magnetohydrodynamic codes, these codes are designed for astrophysics, magnetic fusion energy, laser-plasma interaction, etc. and do not attempt to accurately model electromagnetically driven solid mechanics. This project responds to the Engineering R&D Focus Areas of Simulation and Energy Manipulation, and addresses the specific problem of Electro-Thermal-Mechanical simulation for design and analysis of energy manipulation systems such as magnetic flux compression generators and railguns. This project compliments ongoing DNT projects that have an experimental emphasis. Our research efforts have been encapsulated in the Diablo and ALE 3 D simulation codes. This new ETM capability already has both internal and external users, and has spawned additional research in plasma railgun technology. By developing this capability Engineering has become a world-leader in ETM design, analysis, and simulation. This research has positioned LLNL to be able to compete for new business opportunities with the DoD in the area of railgun design. We currently have a three-year $ 1. 5 M project with the Office of Naval Research to apply our ETM simulation capability to railgun bore life issues and we expect to be a key player in the railgun community...|$|R
40|$|The electron-positron {{accelerator}} for the DAFNE {{project has}} been built and is in test at Titan Beta in Dublin, CA. This S-Band RF linac system utilizes four 45 MW sledded klystrons and 16 - 3 m accelerating structures to achieve the required performance. It delivers a 4 ampere electron beam to the positron converter and accelerates the resulting positrons to 550 MeV. The converter design uses a 4. 3 T pulsed tapered <b>flux</b> <b>compressor</b> along with a pseudo-adiabatic tapered field to a 5 KG solenoid over the first two positron accelerating sections.

40|$|We report {{here on a}} joint {{experimental}} shot {{series with}} teams from Russia and the United States. The program was based largely upon the MC- 1 generator, a high magnetic field explosive <b>flux</b> <b>compressor,</b> developed by the Pavlovskii group at Arzamas- 16. The series was of historical interest {{in that it was}} carried out in a Los Alamos security area, the first time for such a collaboration. We discuss a number of technical issues involved in matching Russian hardware with Los Alamos explosives, initiation systems and the seed field energy source, as well as comparison of field measuring diagnostics fumished by the two teams. We conclude with a discussion of an investigation of the high temperature superconductor YBa{sub 2 }Cu{sub 3 }O{sub 7 } (YBCO), employing these generators.

40|$|Since 1995, MIT {{has been}} {{developing}} the technology for a micro gas turbine engine capable of producing tens of watts of power in a package less than one cubic centimeter in volume. The demo engine developed for this research has low and diabtic component performance and severe heat transfer from the turbine side to the compressor side. The goals of this thesis are developing a dynamical model and providing a simulation platform for predicting the microengine performance and control design, as well as giving {{an estimate of the}} microengine behavior under current design. The thesis first analyzes and models the dynamical components of the microengine. Then a nonlinear model, a linearized model, and corresponding simulators are derived, which are valid for estimating both the steady state and transient behavior. Simulations are also performed to estimate the microengine performance, which include steady states, linear properties, transient behavior, and sensor options. A parameter study and investigation of the startup process are also performed. Analysis and simulations show that there is the possibility of increasing turbine inlet temperature with decreasing fuel flow rate in some regions. Because of the severe heat transfer and this turbine inlet temperature trend, the microengine system behaves like a second-order system with low damping and poor linear properties. This increases the possibility of surge, over-temperature and over-speed. This also implies a potentially complex control system. The surge margin at the design point is large, but accelerating directly from minimum speed to 100 % speed still causes surge. Investigation of the sensor options shows that temperature sensors have relatively fast response time but give multiple estimates of the engine state. Pressure sensors have relatively slow response time but they change monotonically with the engine state. So the future choice of sensors may be some combinations of the two. For the purpose of feedback control, the system is observable from speed, temperature, or pressure measurements. Parameter studies show that the engine performance doesn't change significantly with changes in either nozzle area or the coefficient relating heat <b>flux</b> to <b>compressor</b> efficiency. It does depend strongly on the coefficient relating heat <b>flux</b> to <b>compressor</b> pressure ratio. The value of the compressor peak efficiency affects the engine operation only when it is inside the range of the engine operation. Finally, parameter studies indicate that, to obtain improved transient behavior with less possibility of surge, over-temperature and over-speed, and to simplify the system analysis and design as well as the design and implementation of control laws, it is desirable to reduce the ratio of rotor mechanical inertia to thermal inertia, e. g. by slowing the thermal dynamics. This can in some cases decouple the dynamics of rotor acceleration and heat transfer. Several methods were shown to improve the startup process: higher start speed, higher start spool temperature, and higher start fuel flow input. Simulations also show that the efficiency gradient affects the transient behavior of the engine significantly, thereby effecting the startup process. Finally, the analysis and modeling methodologies presented in this thesis can be applied to other engines with severe heat transfer. The estimates of the engine performance can serve as a reference of similar engines as well. by Chunmei Liu. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Being {{part of a}} model which simulates {{the whole}} {{consecutive}} overall compression process in a scroll compressor by solving equations of mass, momentum and energy balance for fluid refrigerant (Rovira et al., 2006), an updated version is presented. In this new model, an energy balance over the scroll wraps is implemented; where temperatures and heat fluxes are obtain ed dividing the wall into 36 parts (slices) each turn. The scroll wrap is divided into different solid slices; energy balance is carried out, taking into account: i) conduction along the scroll wrap; ii) convection heat transfer between each slice and each fluid chamber, with special attention on solid slice - fluid chamber contact at each time step. The numerical model shows the one dimensional and transient temperature, pressure and mass flow rate, at each fluid chamber along the scroll compressor, among detailed solid wrap temperature distribution. The whole numerical model has been experimentally validated against experimental data from technical literature (Halm, 1997) (Chen et al., 2004 a) (Chen et al., 2004 b), comparing mass flow rate, discharge temperature, compression work and power consumption. Finally, the influence of wall temperatures and wall heat <b>fluxes</b> on the <b>compressor</b> performance and other output variables is analyzed. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|A high energy, massive liner experiment, {{driven by}} an {{explosive}} <b>flux</b> <b>compressor</b> generator, was conducted at VNIIEF firing point, Sarov, on August 22, 1996. We report results of numerical modeling and analysis we have performed on the solid liner dynamics of this 4. 0 millimeter thick aluminum liner as it was imploded from an initial inner radius of 236 mm onto a Central Measuring Unit (CMU), radius 55 mm. Both one- and two-dimensional MHD calculations have been performed, with emphasis on studies of Rayleigh-Taylor instability {{in the presence of}} strength and on liner/glide plane interactions. One-dimensional MHD calculations using the experimental current profile confirm that a peak generator current of 100 - 105 MA yields radial liner dynamics which are consistent with both glide plane and CMU impact diagnostics. These calculations indicate that the liner reached velocities of 6. 9 - 7. 5 km/s before CMU impact. Kinetic energy of the liner, integrated across its radial cross-section, is between 18 - 22 MJ. Since the initial goal was to accelerate the liner to at least 20 MJ, these calculations are consistent with overall success. Two-dimensional MHD calculations were employed for more detailed comparisons with the measured data set. The complete data set consisted of over 250 separate probe traces. From these data and from their correlation with the MHD calculations, we can conclude that the liner deviated from simple cylindrical shape during its implosion. Two-dimensional calculations have clarified our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these deformations. Many calculations with initial outer edge perturbations have been performed to assess the role of Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Perturbation wavelengths between 4 - 32 mm and amplitudes between 8 - 240 {mu}m have been simulated with the experimental current profiles. When strength is omitted short wavelengths are observed to grow to significant levels; material strength stabilizes such modes in the calculations...|$|E
