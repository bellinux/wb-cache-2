Both basal (IC 50 = 193. 75 (57. 5) nmol/l (mean (SEM)) and NaF stimulated (IC 50 = 188. 0 (44. 0) nmol/l) adenylate cyclase activity was strongly inhibited by free [Ca 2 +] greater than 90 nmol/l. Free [Ca 2 +] less than 90 nmol/l had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity. NaF stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was inhibited by 50 % at 2. 5 mmol/l EGTA.

40|$|Much of the {{environmental}} impacts of which a product will potentially have during its life cycle are determined during the design phase by choices such as type of materials and manufacturing processes.

To illustrate the utility of causal maps, <b>household</b> <b>washing</b> machines and conventional passenger cars are chosen as case studies.

The stimulation of kinase activity is manifested by increased phosphorylation of ribosome-associated polypeptides having approximate molecular weights of 135, 000, 120, 000, 85, 000, 68, 000, 65, 000, 40, 000, 28, 000, 25, 000, and 21, 000. The Mr 68, 000 phosphoprotein is structurally identical to the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (P 1) which phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eucaryotic initiation factor- 2 (eIF- 2). A similar protein of Mr 68, 000 is more phosphorylated in poliovirus-infected cells than in mock-infected cells. Increased phosphorylation of P 1 protein in poliovirus-infected cells, however, does not result in an increased phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of endogenous or exogenously added eIF- 2, both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that a mechanism must exist in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells which prevents further phosphorylation of eIF- 2 by the activated kinase...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Boric acid {{is one of}} {{the widely}} used {{inorganic}} compound in pharmaceutical industry. We find its utilization as an antiseptic, in eye <b>wash</b> <b>preparations,</b> as an insecticidal, as a buffering agent etc. In this present work, a comparative study of the UV-Vis spectras of the boric acid solution in different solvents have been done. A variety of solvents like water, ethanol, methanol, glacial acetic acid, hexane, Tetrahydrofuran and 0. 2 M HCl solution have been employed for spectral analysis. When water was taken as a solvent, aqueous boric acid solution gave negative absorbance in complete range of UV-Vis analysis i. e. 1100 nm to 190 nm. In contrary to this, when methanolic solution of boric acid was taken, positive absorbance in the complete range of spectrum was noticed. Purely on the basis of spectras obtained for boric acid solution in different solvents, best solvent out of those have been regarded as the most suitable solvent for carrying out the UV-Vis analysis for boric acid.

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of prostaglandin E (PGE) by {{normal and}} neoplastic macrophages is intrinsically linked to their synthesis of, and exposure to, myeloid colony-stimulating factors (CS-factors). The defect in responsiveness to endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by macrophages from C 3 H/HeJ mice extends equally to {{the synthesis of}} CS-factor and PGE. However, C 3 H/HeJ macrophages can be stimulated to synthesize PGE by treatment with agents other than LPS [zymosan, tuberculin purified protein derivative, concanavalin A, poly(I). poly(C) ], which also stimulate CS-factor production, or {{by the addition of}} various preparations of soluble CS-factor. In peritoneal <b>wash</b> <b>preparations,</b> constitutive PGE synthesis occurred in rapidly sedimenting macrophage cells, whereas constitutive CS-factor production and inducible PGE synthesis occurred in slower sedimenting adherent cells. A similar functional heterogeneity in CS-factor and PGE production was found in neoplastic macrophagae cell lines. The association of elevated CS-factor levels and PGE synthesis by macrophages suggests a role for CS-factor in many of the physiological responses heretofore associated with elevated tissue levels of the E type prostaglandins...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which endotoxins enhance the secretory response of <b>washed</b> <b>preparations</b> of human platelets to aggregated immunoglobulins (Agg-HGG) has been examined. Preparations of endotoxins from several rough mutants of bacteria enhance, by approximately 50 -fold, the release of serotonin initiated by Agg-HGG. Endotoxins from smooth strains do not manifest this enhancement, and all endotoxin preparations are completely inactive {{in the absence of}} Agg-HGG. Preincubation and wash experiments have demonstrated that the critical initial interaction is the formation of complexes between the endotoxin and the Agg-HGG stimulus and is not dependent on an initial endotoxin-platelet interaction. Pretreatment of platelets with substimulatory concentrations of Agg-HGG, followed by the addition of endotoxin, causes a temporal decay in the degree of endotoxin-induced enhancement, which is inversely related to the concentration of Agg-HGG. This stimulus-specific desensitization suggests that the endotoxin-Agg-HGG complexes initiate release by a pathway similar to that initiated by Agg-HGG alone. We postulate that the endotoxin either enhances or stabilizes a localized platelet membrane perturbation or deformation, initiated by the Agg-HGG stimulus...|$|R

40|$|Two {{fractions}} of agglutination activity towards fluorescent pseudomonads were detected in root washes of potato, tomato, wheat, and bean. High-molecular-mass (> 106 Da) components in crude root washes agglutinated only particular saprophytic, fluorescent Pseudomonas isolates. Ion-exchange {{treatment of the}} crude root <b>washes</b> resulted in <b>preparations</b> of lower-molecular-mass (105 to 106 Da) fractions which agglutinated almost all Pseudomonas isolates examined. Also, components able to suppress agglutination reactions of pseudomonads with the lower-molecular-mass root components were detected in crude root washes of all crops studied. Pseudomonas isolates were differentially agglutinated by both types of root components. The involvement of {{these two types of}} root components in short-term adherence and in colonization was studied in potato, tomato, and grass, using Pseudomonas isolates from these crops. Short-term adherence of isolates to roots was independent of their agglutination with either type of root components. With agglutination-negative mutants, the high-molecular-mass components seemed to be involved in adherence of Pseudomonas putida Corvallis to roots of all crops studied. Short-term adherence to roots of four Pseudomonas isolates could be influenced by addition of both crude and ion-exchange-treated root washes, depending on their agglutination phenotype with these root <b>wash</b> <b>preparations.</b> Potato root colonization by 10 different isolates from this crop, over a period of 7 days, was not correlated with their agglutination phenotype. Agg- mutants of P. putida Corvallis were not impaired in root colonization.

40|$|<b>Household</b> <b>washing</b> {{machines}} (WMs) launder soiled {{clothes and}} textiles, {{but do not}} sterilize them. We investigated the microbial exchange occurring in five household WMs. Samples from a new cotton T-shirt were laundered together with a normal laundry load. Analyses were performed on the influent water and the ingoing cotton samples, {{as well as the}} greywater and the washed cotton samples. The number of living bacteria was generally not lower in the WM effluent water as compared to the influent water. The laundering process caused a microbial exchange of influent water bacteria, skin-, and clothes related bacteria and biofilm-related bacteria in the WM. A variety of biofilm-producing bacteria were enriched in the effluent after laundering, although their presence in the cotton sample was low. Nearly all bacterial genera detected on the initial cotton sample were still present in the washed cotton samples. A selection for typical skin- and clothes related microbial species occurred in the cotton samples after laundering. Accordingly, malodour-causing microbial species might be further distributed to other clothes. The bacteria on the ingoing textiles contributed for a large part to the microbiome found in the textiles after laundering...|$|R

This data grants the ability to count actual laundry loads of a household from observing when washing machines energy consumption changes from zero to positive. Utilizing a treatment effect created by a partnership with LG and Pecan Street Inc. to provide select households with energy efficient washer and dryers, I estimate that load rebound is not statistically different from zero with the upper bound of a 95 % confidence interval that households would at most increase their loads of laundry by 20 %.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to develop a new zero-tension {{lysimeter}} (ZTL) as a leachate sampler in a greywater irrigation plot. Greywater is known as a wastewater that is generated from baths, showers, washing machines, laundry troughs, dishwashers and kitchen sinks; but excludes toilet wastes. The use of greywater is becoming increasingly acceptable to supply non-potable irrigation needs. However, some questions have been raised about the pollution risk of soil and receiving waters due to the content of different pollutants from the <b>household</b> <b>washing</b> activities. In this study, the new ZTLNs were trialled to compare the quantity and quality of leachate collected with the conventional pan lysimeter (ZTLP) in the pilot scale study. The calculated leachate volume incorporated a water balance using the Penman-Monteigh model. The results indicate that the new lysimeter designated as ZTL (N 1), produced the lowest mean percentage deviation from the calculated volume (CV), 3. 90 %. ZTL (N 1) was also cost effective and required limited effort to install using an auger, which also minimises soil disturbance. to install at household sites.

40|$|Many of the {{sustainability}} challenges our society currently face have arisen as unanticipated {{side effects of}} our own modern developments. This thesis investigates if unintended consequences and perspectives are fully addressed by traditional methods for providing decision-making support within {{the sustainability}} domain. For that purpose, Systems Thinking is utilised in three cases: in the first, Systems Thinking is used to analyse sustainability issues relating to the current product design paradigm. In the second case, Systems Thinking is applied to two product systems – <b>household</b> <b>washing</b> machines and conventional passenger vehicles. The third case discusses different stakeholder perspectives in environmental decision-making and proposes a way to combine the ESA tools LCA, LCC and CBA in order to consider the different stakeholder perspectives. Results of the first case {{point out that the}} practices within the current design paradigm are focused on innovations and improvements in material and energy efficiency. These practices have led to the following unintended consequences: consumption rebound effects, increased waste, pollution, negative externalities, economic inequalities and other environmental and social negative impacts. These unintended consequences are represented in a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD). The diagram graphically illustrates how these unintended consequences influence one another and interact by means of cause-effect linkages and reinforcing feedback loops. A novel conceptual framework named Sustainability-Driven Systems-Oriented Design is proposed to work within broader system boundaries in order to address possible negative side effects that micro-level gains could have on macro-level losses. In the case of the two product systems, a CLD for <b>household</b> <b>washing</b> machines and conventional passenger vehicles is developed. The CLDs represent how selected variables interact by means of cause-effect associations to affect environmental impacts of the products. The CLD technique appears to be a useful way to connect quantitative assessment (from Life Cycle Assessment) with qualitative analysis (from Systems Thinking). In the third case it is argued that stakeholders tend to adopt different system boundaries and make assumptions according to their perspective when they use ESA tools in environmental decision-making. A way to combine ESA tools is suggested to facilitate the observation of the environmental decision from different viewpoints. It concludes, to some extent, that traditional methods for providing decision-making support can handle certain parameters that may result in unintended consequences. Systems Thinking may assist in the process of performing qualitative analyses of what is important to consider in order to strengthen the robustness of, and improve on the recommended actions from, quantitative detailed analyses.
