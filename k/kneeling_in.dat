5|$|Mary is {{presented}} as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> prayer in the now lost opposite panel. The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just momentarily paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before him, as if embodiments of his prayer.|$|E
5|$|The copy of John Lydgate's 15th century Life {{written for}} Henry VI of England {{is now in}} the British Library. The Wilton Diptych was painted during the reign of Richard II of England and is the most famous {{representation}} of Edmund in art. Painted on oak panels, it shows Richard <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> front of three saints—one of whom is Edmund—as they present the young king to the Virgin and Child.|$|E
5|$|The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished {{is a large}} painting, 399cm (13ft 1in) across. It {{depicts a}} {{defeated}} soldier, <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> front of another soldier. The defeated fighter strains to free himself from {{the grip of the}} victorious warrior, who stands, raising a sword. A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe. The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies beside him on the ground.|$|E

5|$|The {{exterior}} {{consists of}} the two donor wings, a pair of saints, and two panels with Gabriel presenting himself to Mary. The donors are on the outer wings, <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> front of prayer books. Four imitation statues in grisaille make up the inner panels. The lower two depict Saint Sebastian and Saint Anthony. Sebastian was the saint of plagues and an intercessory against epidemics, Anthony {{the patron saint of}} skin diseases and ergotism, known in medieval times as St Anthony's Fire. The two saints had strong associations with the Burgundian court as well: Philip the Good was born on St Anthony's day, he had an illegitimate son named Anthony, and two of Rolin's sons were named Anthony. St Sebastian was the patron saint of Philip the Good's chivalric Order of the Golden Fleece, of which Rolin was a member.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Santa Monica Park was renamed Beverly Gardens and was {{extended}} to span the entire two-mile (3-kilometer) length of Santa Monica Boulevard through the city. The Electric Fountain marks the corner of Santa Monica Blvd. and Wilshire Blvd. with a small sculpture {{at the top of}} a Tongva <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> prayer. In April 1931, the new Italian Renaissance-style Beverly Hills City Hall was opened.|$|E
25|$|Artworks, {{including}} paintings, mosaics and carvings of {{the coronation}} of Mary as Queen of Heaven, became increasingly popular from the 13th century onward. Works follow a set pattern, showing Mary <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> the heavenly court, and being crowned either by Jesus alone, or else by Jesus and God the Father together, with the Holy Spirit, {{usually in the}} form of a dove, completing the Trinity. The Coronation of Mary is almost entirely a theme of western art. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, although Mary is often shown wearing a crown, the coronation itself never became an accepted artistic subject.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday afternoons at 3pm, between May and October, Rosary processions are held. These are {{traditionally}} attended {{by thousands of}} visitors. The rosary {{is led by the}} parish priest, a tradition started by Fr. Taylor and carried on by his successor, Fr. George Mullen (later Canon George Mullen). The priest would stand on the parapet of the Glass Chapel, from which a clear view could be obtained, both of the Grotto itself and of the movement of the procession along the shrine's gravel paths. Each Sunday procession culminated in Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament in the upper Glass Chapel. Many local people remember the discomfort of <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> the gravel as children, at the moment of adoration in the Benediction service.|$|E

25|$|Mother Mechtilde of the Blessed Sacrament pioneered {{perpetual}} {{adoration of}} the Eucharist on request of Père Picotte. Père Picotte was the confessor of Anne of Austria who {{asked him for}} a vow for the deliverance of France from war and the order was formed {{in response to that}} vow. A small house was bought on Rue Feron in Paris and a Benedictine convent, founded for this purpose, began perpetual adoration there on 25 March 1654, one or more nuns <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> front of the altar in adoration each hour of the day and night. The simple Benedictine rules with which the nuns started were amended and formal approval for perpetual adoration was provided by the Camera Apostolica in Rome in 1705.|$|E
25|$|Shapland {{had murdered}} Springer, who had caught {{her while she}} was searching the Sports Pavilion for the jewels. She also murdered Mademoiselle Blanche, the would-be blackmailer. But she did not kill Miss Vansittart, and has a perfect alibi for that night. Vansittart was killed by Chadwick, in an unpremeditated fit of passion. Chadwick had found Vansittart, whom she disliked, in the Sports Pavilion the second night, <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> front of Shaista's locker. Chadwick was {{carrying}} a sandbag for protection, and there was Vansittart in a perfect position to be coshed. Chadwick apparently suffered a psychotic break and bludgeoned Vansittart. The same murderer committed {{the first and third}} murders, while the second and third murders were by the same method (a sandbag); Shapland had used the sandbag only to make it seem that the second and third murders were linked.|$|E
25|$|In the {{tympanum}} {{there are}} {{scenes from the}} birth of Christ: from the left to right: the Annunciation (of the angel indicating to Maria that she would give birth); the Nativity (the birth of the Christ child); and the Epiphany (the adoration of the magi). Two angels hold the arms of Portugal, close to the archivolt. The splays {{on each side of}} the portal are filled with statues, among them are statues of King Manuel I and Queen Maria of Aragón <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> a niche under a lavishly decorated baldachin, flanked by their patrons: Saint Jerome and Saint John the Baptist, respectively. The supporting corbels are decorated with little angels holding the coat-of-arms and, at the side of the king, an armillary sphere and, at the side of the queen, three blooming twigs. Renaissance elements include angels in Roman garb, cherubs, the detail and realism of the kings and the nude study of Saint Jerome.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{his life}} he also started {{designing}} stained-glass windows. The windows in the north transept of the St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral in Brussels depict members of the House of Habsburg (Charles V and his wife Isabella of Portugal), Charlemagne and Elisabeth of Hungary, and scenes from the Legend of the Miraculous Host, while the windows in the south transept depict Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia and his wife Maria of Austria, sister of Charles V, <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> front of a vertical Trinity with St Louis and the Virgin with Child. These windows mark a change in style. The royal dynasty was still embedded within a religious framework, but the donor was now emphasized and not the venerated saint. It was also no longer deemed necessary to legitimize the position of the sovereign by a genealogical tree, as Philip the Handsome, the father of Charles V, was not represented. These windows can be ascribed with certainty to drawings by Bernard van Orley. They were executed by the master glass-worker Jean Haeck.|$|E
25|$|He was {{a member}} of Company C, 325th Glider Infantry, on 9 June 1944 {{advancing}} with the forward platoon to secure a bridgehead across the Merderet River at La Fière, France. At dawn the platoon had penetrated an outer line of machineguns and riflemen, but in so doing had become cut {{off from the rest of}} the company. Vastly superior forces began a decimation of the stricken unit and put in motion a flanking maneuver which would have completely exposed the American platoon in a shallow roadside ditch where it had taken cover. Detecting this danger, Pfc. DeGlopper volunteered to support his comrades by fire from his automatic rifle while they attempted a withdrawal through a break in a hedgerow 40 yards to the rear. Scorning a concentration of enemy automatic weapons and rifle fire, he walked from the ditch onto the road in full view of the Germans, and sprayed the hostile positions with assault fire. He was wounded, but he continued firing. Struck again, he started to fall; and yet his grim determination and valiant fighting spirit could not be broken. <b>Kneeling</b> <b>in</b> the roadway, weakened by his grievous wounds, he leveled his heavy weapon against the enemy and fired burst after burst until killed outright. He was successful in drawing the enemy action away from his fellow soldiers, who continued the fight from a more advantageous position and established the first bridgehead over the Merderet. In the area where he made his intrepid stand his comrades later found the ground strewn with dead Germans and many machineguns and automatic weapons which he had knocked out of action. Pfc. DeGlopper's gallant sacrifice and unflinching heroism while facing insurmountable odds were in great measure responsible for a highly important tactical victory in the Normandy Campaign.|$|E
500|$|Leo, {{traditionally}} {{a sleeping}} figure smaller than Francis, is here given equal size. Surrounded by barren rocks, he faces {{away from the}} seraph, his feet positioned near a small stream, which signifies redemption or salvation, gushing from the rocks. On Francis's left are symbols of life: plants, a river valley, a cityscape and mountains. [...] Snyder writes that for van Eyck a mystical vision had to be presented with great subtlety, and that in these paintings he captures the event perfectly, because Francis is shown as {{he is said to}} have reacted to the vision– <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> quiet meditation.|$|E

500|$|Most {{art historians}} see the panel as {{the left wing}} of a {{dismantled}} diptych; presumably its opposite wing was a votive portrait. Near-contemporary copies by the Master of 1499 and Jan Gossaert pair it with two very different right-hand images: one is of a donor <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> an interior setting; the other is set outdoors, with the donor being presented by St Anthony. Both painters made significant alterations to van Eyck's composition, which may have brought the image more up to date with contemporary styles, but the copies {{have been described as}} [...] "spiritually if not aesthetically disastrous to the original concept".|$|E
500|$|Netherlandish diptychs tend to {{illustrate}} {{only a small}} range of religious scenes. There are numerous depictions of the Virgin and Child, reflecting the Virgin's contemporary popularity as a subject of devotion. The inner panels consisted mainly of donor portraits – often of husbands and their wives – alongside saints or the Virgin and Child. The donor was nearly always shown <b>kneeling</b> <b>in</b> full or half length, with hands clasped in prayer. The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right, reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the [...] "place of honour" [...] alongside the divine.|$|E
500|$|According to an eye witness, an {{assistant}} janitor at that time, in his prison cell, Kolbe led the prisoners in prayer to Our Lady.

[...] After two weeks of dehydration and starvation, only Kolbe remained alive. “The guards wanted the bunker emptied, so they gave Kolbe a lethal injection of carbolic acid. Kolbe is said to have raised his left arm and calmly waited for the deadly injection. His remains were cremated on 15 August, the feast day of the Assumption of Mary.|$|E
