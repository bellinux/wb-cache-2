40|$|Intersections often {{experience}} severe rutting in {{the asphalt}} concrete layers due to slow moving, high loads, acceleration, deceleration and turning. This thesis aims {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam,</b> open graded asphalt with its voids filled with cement grout, as a pavement material at intersections. This was done by investigating the properties of <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> through a literature review and performing a life-cycle cost analysis comparing <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> and asphalt concrete as pavement materials at an intersection. <b>Grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> {{is found to be}} similar to asphalt concrete concerning the relation between stiffness and temperature and frequency as well as fatigue behaviour. The main differences are that <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> is stiffer, stronger and not prone to rutting. Thus it would be suitable to address rutting problems. The main drawbacks are that construction demands extra time and precision and that it is expensive compared to asphalt concrete. The life-cycle cost analysis showed that assuming that the <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> has a service life of twenty years and rehabilitation of the asphalt concrete in the form of mill and refill takes place every fourth year the life-cycle costs are approximately the same. A sensitivity analysis was performed that showed that local variations can have large impact on the life-cycle costs. The main conclusion is that <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> can be effective as a pavement material at intersections that experiences severe rutting and frequently reoccurring rehabilitations. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{conventional}} <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> is {{manufactured by}} producing a highly porous asphalt skeleton (25 - 35 % voids), and filling the voids with a selected highly flowable cementitious grout. <b>Grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> combines {{some of the}} best qualities of concrete and asphalt pavements, namely the flexibility and absence of joints which characterise asphalt and the high static bearing capacity and wear resistance of concrete. Moreover <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> layers are impermeable and efficiently distribute the stresses in the underlying base layer. The speed of construction of <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> surfacings and the short duration required prior to opening to traffic is a major advantage over conventional concrete. Current fields of applications include: airport pavements, industrial floors, harbours, bus terminals, distribution centres, and other heavily stressed areas. The aim of this investigation was to assess the fatigue behaviour of a range of <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> mixtures. Indirect tensile fatigue tests and two point bending tests were conducted on laboratory manufactured specimens and on samples extracted from a trafficked pavement test facility. The experimental work provided interesting data on the influence of mixture composition on fatigue life and highlighted differences between strain and stress-controlled fatigue tests on performance of <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> mixtures compared with conventional asphalts...|$|E
40|$|<b>Grouted</b> <b>macadam,</b> a {{material}} {{that consists of}} a porous asphalt skeleton with 25 – 35 % voids, filled with a cementitious grout, has traditionally {{been used as a}} specialist surfacing with excellent resistance to both deformation and fuel spillage. However, the actual engineering properties of the material have rarely been investigated in depth and design of pavements incorporating <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> has relied heavily on past experience. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the consequences of applying analytical pavement design methods to pavements incorporating <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> layers. Two different design methodologies were tested: 1) a conventional approach based on the traditional fatigue criterion used for bituminous materials; and 2) an iterative approach, which took realistic account of the actual damage accumulation within the material. For both methodologies, a comparison was made between a <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> and a conventional bituminous mixture. The main conclusion drawn from this study is that extended fatigue life can be obtained from pavements incorporating <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> although this advantage will be overlooked if design is carried out using the traditional fatigue failure criterion...|$|E

40|$|Four-point bending {{tests are}} {{commonly}} {{used to assess the}} fatigue resistance of bi-tuminous bound materials that are used in road pavements. However, it is difficult to establish a reliable relationship between the laboratory test results and the field performance of the mate-rial. In order to predict the real life of the pavement, shift factors are normally used to convert the fatigue results obtained in the laboratory onto the actual fatigue life of the material in the field. Those shift factors depend on the type of test used, the testing conditions and the type of mixture used. In this study, an attempt was made to establish a shift factor for grouted mac-adams, based on four-point bending fatigue test results carried out with rest periods between the loading cycles. The result obtained was used to define a fatigue criterion for pavement design with <b>grouted</b> <b>macadams...</b>|$|R
40|$|Grouted macadams {{can be seen}} as semi-flexible materials. Their {{behavior}} is still not well understood. This paper presents a series of laboratory tests, carried out at the University of Nottingham, with the goal of contributing {{to a better understanding of}} the fatigue performance of such materials. Two types of fatigue tests were used in this investigation (2 - and 4 -point bending tests), and the results obtained for the <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> mixture are compared with those obtained for a conventional asphalt mixture in the United Kingdom. Rest periods between load applications were varied in another series of 4 -point bending fatigue tests, with the aim of determining a shift factor for <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> fatigue characteristics, in order to use the laboratory determined results in the design of pavements incorporating <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> mixtures. The analysis of the results obtained during this investigation has shown that the traditional failure criterion used in fatigue tests may not properly represent the fatigue life of grouted macadams...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper investigates {{and compares}} the {{magnitude}} of restrained temperature stresses {{that can be achieved}} in both a rigid pavement and a flexible pavement with a <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> surfacing. The analysis is based on well known Westergrad equation that commonly applicable for concrete and BISAR from Shell that used for flexible pavement A hypothetical pavement is designed to assess the properties of the materials under traffic induced stresses and temperature restrained stresses. The results indicate that grouted macadams could be as vulnerable to combinations of thermal and traffic stress as concrete and with respect to traffic induced stresses at the underside of the surfacing layer. Westergaard's analysis is more applicable to a concrete slab and BISAR is more suitable for <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> surfacing...|$|E
40|$|Grouted macadams form a semi-flexible {{class of}} {{composites}} whose behaviour lies somewhere between concrete and conventional asphalt materials, having both excellent rut resistance and {{a degree of}} flexibility. This paper presents a series of pavement design computer simulations, based on results obtained from laboratory fatigue and stiffness tests on <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> and conventional asphalt mixtures. The design variables explored include the application of grouted macadams both as surface and binder/base course layers. Comparisons were made with conventional asphalt surface and base course constructions. The resultant stresses, strains and fatigue lives were determined based on four classes of pavement foundations with increasing bearing capacity. In order to simulate traffic loading more realistically, the fatigue characterisation tests carried out on the <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> mixtures incorporated and examined the effect of rest periods on fatigue performance. This paper discusses key findings and includes results {{in the form of}} design charts for both composite types. The main conclusion drawn from this project was that lhe incorporation of grouted macadams is likely to provide an economical solution in many pavement design circumstances owing to their superior stiffness and fatigue characteristics...|$|E

It comprises a surface course with a semi-flexible material that provides significant advantages in comparison to both concrete and conventional asphalt, having both rut resistance and a degree of flexibility.

40|$|Applying {{cement grout}} {{with a high}} {{compressive}} strength to a porous layer made of asphalt concrete results in a pavement with the properties of an intermediate type that combines the characteristics of both flexible and rigid pavements. This solution is known as <b>Grouted</b> <b>Macadam</b> (GM). Despite {{a wide range of}} test results on the GM pavements presented in the literature, there are very few advanced modelling solutions formulated in the scope of bearing capacity measured in situ be means of a Falling Weight Deflectometer. This paper turns out that the seemingly small frequency of loading (≈ 20 [*]Hz) generated during pavement deflection measurements using a Falling Weight Deflectometer-like device, has {{a significant impact on the}} backcalculation results of GM pavements. The study shows that, introducing frequency normalisation of both the pavement loading and vertical displacements to the backcalculation, can limit the statistical scatter of backcalculation results by close to a half in comparison with the classical backcalculation procedure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSemi-flexible {{pavements}} {{are manufactured}} by producing a very open porous asphalt skeleton and filling the voids with selected cementitious grouts. The resultant composites, {{referred to as}} “grouted macadams”, combine {{the flexibility of the}} bituminous component with the strength and rigidity of the cementitious component. Grouted macadams thus combine the best qualities of concrete and asphalt pavements, namely the flexibility and freedom from joints that characterize asphalt and the high static bearing capacity and wear resistance of concrete. The properties of the <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> composites were assessed using a range of engineering, compressive strength is the most common strength test for rigid pavements since it is relatively easy to conduct compared to other tests and numerous correlations exist to predict other material properties based on compressive strength values Since semi-flexible pavements possess mechanical properties in between bituminous mixtures and concrete, the compressive properties of the grouted macadams designed in this study have been investigated. The unique correlations between each component, namely asphalt skeleton, grout, aggregate type and size were established also the comparison to the other type of investigations and conventional concrete...|$|E
40|$|Grouted macadams form a {{class of}} {{material}} which provides significant advantages in comparison to both concrete and conventional asphalt, having both rut resistance and a degree of flexibility. This paper presents a series of laboratory tests on several <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> mixtures, for stiffness, fatigue and low temperature fracture. The variables explored include binder grade and content, aggregate size and gradation, and grout strength. Although the material is found to perform fundamentally as an asphalt, there are several {{significant differences in the}} form of fatigue behavior found compared to that usually expected from an asphalt. In particular the effect of varying binder content is found to be markedly different. The results are discussed in terms of optimizing mixture design in order to obtain the most desirable combination of properties (stiffness, fatigue strength, low temperature fracture resistance). Discussion is also presented regarding the possible role of grouted macadams as base or binder courses within highway pavements, and the conclusion is drawn that they are likely to provide an economical solution in many circumstances owing to their superior mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|<b>Grouted</b> <b>Macadam</b> {{composite}} pavement (GMCP) {{is generally}} a composite pavement which is manufactured by preparing a highly workable fluid mortar which is specially designed {{with a very}} high early and 28 day strength (1 day - 45 MPa, 28 day - 105 MPa) by filling the flowing fluid mortar into a very open porous asphalt skeleton (25 - 32 Voids in Mix - VIM). The combination of both components will produce a semi-rigid pavement or GMCP which has the best features of both rigid concrete and flexible bituminous pavement where it will replace the conventional wearing course. This paper will investigate the significance difference of GMCP produced by the 3 different aggregate gradations by Road Engineering Association of Malaysia (REAM) in volumetric properties, durability and strength. The best quality fluid grout was chosen to fill the porous asphalt skeleton and GMCP was subjected for compression test, VIM and indirect tensile test (IDT) to check on its performance. The {{results show that the}} 3 different aggregate gradations significantly affect the volumetric properties, durability and strength. Furthermore it will also help in reducing pollution and helps with the current environmental problems. Â© 2010 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|This article {{concerns}} {{road safety}} in tunnels and focuses {{specifically on the}} behaviour of pavements during accidental fires. Their role is investigated through a comparative laboratory investigation of materials used worldwide: hot mix asphalts (HMAs) and Portland cement concrete (PCC). In addition, the investigation also considers a relatively new material made of an open-grade bituminous mixture filled with cement mortar, in literature known as <b>grouted</b> <b>macadam</b> (GM). The comparison is carried out by developing an experimental plan with four main goals: assessment {{of the effect of}} fire exposure, evaluation of the effect of exposure to high temperatures, measurement of the decay of mechanical characteristics as a result of fire and exposure to high temperatures, and assessment of the types and concentration of smoke emitted during fire exposure. Results from the investigation led to the conclusion that HMA is the least suitable material for tunnel applications as it showed the worst performance in all four test categories. PCC shows the best performance in the tunnel-fire scenario and GM may also be considered suitable for tunnel-pavement application as it showed a similar or even better performance compared to PCC...|$|E
