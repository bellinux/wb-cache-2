50|$|Dedicated word {{processors}} and WP software for general-purpose computers that rose in {{popularity in the}} late 1970s and 1980s would use features such as microspacing (usually by 1/120 of an inch horizontally and, possibly, 1/48 of an inch vertically) to implement subscripts, proportional spacing, underlining, and so on. The more rudimentary software packages would implement bold text by overtyping the character {{in exactly the same}} spot (for example, using the backspace control code), but better software would print the letter in 3 slightly different positions. Software did exist to (slowly) produce pie charts on such printers (and on some <b>daisywheels</b> the dot was reinforced with metal to cope with extra wear).|$|R
50|$|IBM 5219 - A <b>daisywheel</b> {{impact printer}} not {{far removed from}} the IBM typewriters. It was good for about 40 {{characters}} per second (CPS).|$|E
50|$|Many impact printers, {{such as the}} <b>daisywheel</b> printer and {{dot matrix}} printer, used a print head that printed a {{character}} then moved on until an entire line was printed. Line printers were much faster, as each impact printed an entire line.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to earlier}} consumer-oriented color {{printers}}, inkjet printers {{have a number}} of advantages. They are quieter in operation than impact dot matrix or <b>daisywheel</b> printers. They can print finer, smoother details through higher resolution. Consumer inkjet printers with photographic-quality printing are widely available.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} {{best known for the}} HyType I, HyType II, and Diablo 630 <b>daisywheel</b> printers, but also {{produced}} the hard disk drives that were resold by DEC as the RK02 and RK03. Lead engineers Jonny Skolnick and Eli Fenyes headed operations at the division.|$|E
50|$|Several other I/O {{devices were}} {{developed}} for the Alto, including a TV camera, the Hy-Type <b>daisywheel</b> printer and a parallel port, although these were quite rare. The Alto could also control external disk drives {{to act as a}} file server. This was a common application for the machine.|$|E
5000|$|Soon after {{completing}} his term as Principal Speaker, Baker {{resigned from the}} Green Party and joined the Liberal Democrats. He became the editor of Challenge, {{the journal of the}} Green Liberal Democrats group. [...] He subsequently devoted his time to campaigning on corporate social responsibility, leading the Business in the Community charity, and subsequently his own <b>Daisywheel</b> Interactive agency, while writing for Ethical Corporation.|$|E
5000|$|Kaypro 2X - The Kaypro 2X {{was similar}} to the Kaypro 4, but it lacked the {{built-in}} 300 baud modem that was available in the Kaypro 4. Kaypro 2X's were often sold in a bundle with the Wordstar word processing software suite, spreadsheet and database software. The impact printer that was also included in the bundle was labeled as the [...] "Kaypro Printer," [...] but was actually a re-branded Juki 6100 <b>daisywheel</b> printer.|$|E
5000|$|An {{updated version}} of this {{computer}} called the model 16/8 ran dual CPUs, an 8-bit Z80 and 16-bit Intel 8086, which could be booted jointly or separately. The operating system was 8-bit CP/M 80 and 16-bit CP/M 86, and it was supplied with the Word Perfect word processor and dBase II database management system. It had double 8" [...] floppy disk drives, a 12" [...] monochrome monitor and a <b>daisywheel</b> printer. Later in 1984 double 5.25 floppy disk drives, a portrait-size blue monitor, and a laser printer were offered. The Model 16/8 is also called a Xerox 823.|$|E
50|$|Most {{models of}} PCW were bundled with a 9-pin {{dot matrix printer}} mechanism, with the later 9512 and 9512+ models using a <b>daisywheel</b> (with a {{different}} cable; the printers were not interchangeable with the dot matrix models). These PCW printers could not, of course, be used on other computers, and the original PCW lacked a then-standard Centronics printer port. Instead, the Z80 bus and video signals were brought to an edge connector socket {{at the back of}} the cabinet. Many accessories including parallel and serial ports were produced for this interface. Some of the later models included a built-in parallel port; these could be bundled with either the dedicated Amstrad printer, or a Canon Bubblejet model.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 Olivetti {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{manufacturers}} to introduce electronic <b>daisywheel</b> printer-based word processing machines called TES 401 and TES 501. Later the ET series typewriters without (or with) LCD and different levels of text editing capabilities were popular in offices. Models in that line were ET 121, ET 201, ET 221, ET 225, ET 231, ET 351, ET 109, ET 110, ET 111, ET 112, ET 115, ET 116, ET 2000, ET 2100, ET 2200, ET 2250, ET 2300, Et 2400 and ET 2500. For home users in 1982 the Praxis 35, Praxis 40 and 45D were some of the first portable electronic typewriters. Later, Olivetti added the Praxis 20, ET Compact 50, ET Compact 60, ET Compact 70, ET Compact 65/66, the ET Personal series and Linea 101. The top models were 8 lines LCD based portables like Top 100 and Studio 801, with the possibility to save the text to 3.5 inch floppy disk.|$|E
5000|$|Impact {{printers}} {{rely on a}} forcible {{impact to}} transfer ink to the media. The impact printer uses a print head that either hits {{the surface of the}} ink ribbon, pressing the ink ribbon against the paper (similar to the action of a typewriter), or, less commonly, hits the back of the paper, pressing the paper against the ink ribbon (the IBM 1403 for example). All but the dot matrix printer rely on the use of fully formed characters, letterforms that represent each of the characters that the printer was capable of printing. In addition, most of these printers were limited to monochrome, or sometimes two-color, printing in a single typeface at one time, although bolding and underlining of text could be done by [...] "overstriking", that is, printing two or more impressions either in the same character position or slightly offset. Impact printers varieties include typewriter-derived printers, teletypewriter-derived printers, <b>daisywheel</b> printers, dot matrix printers and line printers. Dot matrix printers remain in common use in businesses where multi-part forms are printed. An overview of impact printing contains a detailed description of many of the technologies used.|$|E
50|$|From {{the start}} Robert Temple Catalogues were {{set on a}} computer: {{originally}} on magnetic tape, but then, as this was difficult to edit when re-cataloguing unsold stock, they very soon went over instead to setting catalogues on the handier magnetic cards that were enjoying a brief vogue in about 1980-81. In 1982 they acquired their first P.C. from Premier Business Systems, a firm but recently founded by Charles Ross. This used a rudimentary program written in machine-code and designed for booksellers. The program incorporated a 'user-level' language, which was fairly basic, and in this Allen wrote a program capable of outputting catalogues in a style and format similar to those they had previously published. Up to this point all the catalogues had been produced as hard copy on a <b>daisywheel</b> printer, but Premier Business Systems morphed, first into Owl Microsystems, then, in December 1983, into 'The Clue Computing Company' (later to be bought by Bristol Office Machines), and they produced a system written in a higher-level language called CLUE, which {{was the brainchild of}} another bookseller, Mark Westwood. Allen produced his own system in this language (which is still in use by the firm to-day), and went over to producing hard-copy on a laser-printer. The original floppy discs were replaced in 1984 by Tandon Datapacs, and then, in 1990, after the advent of the cheap Winchester, by the conventional hard-discs we know to-day.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Technology) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1988 Brown Davis and McCorquodale {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{suppliers}} of cheques to the banking industry. To produce these cheques they use a number of different print systems, one of which comprises of a minicomputer, an industry standard tape deck and two printers, a Diablo <b>daisywheel</b> and a Control Data Corporation (CDC) printer which was extensively modified to cater for the requirements of the cheque printing industry. The CDC printer is used to print the code line on the cheques using magnetic ink. After each line is printed the computer sends a form feed command which causes the printer to throw paper. This throw is controlled by a paper tape, known as a Vertical Format Unit tape, or rather a VFU tape. This tape has holes punched into it at specific places which determine the amount of paper throw also known as vertical feed. The holes are sensed by brushes which are pulled up to 5 volt when they pass over a hole and touch a roller connected to the 5 volt line. This system, being of an electro-mechanical nature, is prone to faults and causes much down time due to mechanical wear on the brushes and dirt on the roller. This means that the brushes have to be adjusted and therefore also means that the timing has to be readjusted each time. The timing relationships are discussed in Section 2. ...|$|E
