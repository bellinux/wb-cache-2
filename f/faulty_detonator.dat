2500|$|Another IRA {{technique}} used in 1990 on three occasions was the [...] "proxy bomb", where a victim was kidnapped {{and forced to}} drive a car bomb to its target. All three victims were Catholic men employed by the security forces. Their families were held hostage to ensure the proxies did as they were directed. The first proxy, at Coshquin (near Derry), died, along with six soldiers. The second proxy, at Cloghoge (or Cloghogue; near Newry), escaped but a soldier was killed. The third incident, at Omagh, produced no casualties due to a <b>faulty</b> <b>detonator.</b> This practice was stopped, reportedly due to the revulsion it caused among nationalists.|$|E
50|$|At {{about the}} same time, there was a third {{attempted}} proxy bombing in County Tyrone. A third man was strapped into a car and forced to drive it to Lisanelly Camp in Omagh while his family was held at gunpoint. This third bomb weighed 1500 lb but, due to a <b>faulty</b> <b>detonator,</b> the main explosive charge failed to explode.|$|E

50|$|Her {{first two}} {{attacks on the}} enemy were doomed to failure by the <b>faulty</b> {{magnetic}} <b>detonators</b> in her torpedoes. After the inactivating of the magnetic features on her remaining torpedoes, Scamp scored two hits, one on an unidentified target {{on the night of}} 20 March and the other damaged Manju Maru early the next morning. The submarine stopped at Midway Island again on 26 March and returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 April.|$|R
50|$|The alleged John Paul II {{assassination}} folder {{was behind}} the 1991 publication of an immensely popular book entitled Zabić tego Polaka (To Kill that Pole) printed in Warsaw by Wydawnictwo ROK publishing, with 100,000 copies. The book claimed that the action was conducted not in 1979, but in 1983; and not in Częstochowa, but in Warsaw; {{and that the only}} reason why it did not succeed was the <b>faulty</b> bomb <b>detonator.</b> It is suspected that the story was based on a counterfeit police report produced by the Ministry of Public Security.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 October 1990 the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{developed}} the tactic by introducing the so-called [...] "human proxy bomb". Three men deemed by the IRA to be [...] "collaborators" [...] (i.e. helping {{the security forces}} in some way) were strapped into three vehicles and forced to drive to three British military targets. However, unlike the earlier proxy bombings, they were not {{given the chance to}} escape. The three synchronised attacks took place at Coshquin (near Derry), Cloghoge (near Newry), and Omagh in the early morning of 24 October 1990. The Coshquin attack was the deadliest, killing the human proxy and five soldiers. One soldier was killed at Cloghoge, but the proxy survived. At Omagh there were no fatalities due to a <b>faulty</b> <b>detonator.</b>|$|E
