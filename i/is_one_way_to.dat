5|$|Scully {{decides to}} join Mulder in the game, {{and the two}} fight Maitreya together. Maitreya begins to {{duplicate}} herself, making the task of killing her more difficult. Finally, Maitreya sits atop a virtual tank and aims it at the agents. Phoebe admits there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> stop the game, but doing so will erase the entire program. Despite protests from Ivan, Phoebe gives Byers the kill command, effectively destroying Maitreya along with the game while saving Mulder and Scully. During Mulder's narration, we {{see that in the}} control room one of the monitors is still active. There, Ivan sees Maitreya's avatar, but with Scully's face.|$|E
5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight times their weight.|$|E

25|$|Small seed size: wild Oryza {{species have}} small seeds, but larger seeds {{are easier to}} thresh and clean. Larger seeds {{germinate}} more vigorously. Increasing seed size <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> increase grain yield.|$|E
25|$|Along with {{potentially}} useful genes for rhizomes, stress tolerance and disease resistance, undesirable genes from O. longistaminata are also still present in breeding populations. Back-crossing to high-yielding rice varieties <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reduce {{the frequency of}} these wild alleles.|$|E
25|$|In many {{functional}} programming languages macros are implemented using parse-time substitution of parse trees/abstract syntax trees, {{which it is}} claimed makes them safer to use. Since in many cases interpretation is used, that <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> ensure that such computations are only performed at parse-time, and sometimes the only way.|$|E
50|$|During World War II a need {{sometimes}} also arose for a heavy fighter, {{which could}} not be met by a new design in the time needed. Joining two examples of an existing lighter aircraft <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> achieve this.|$|R

Children's Hospital Oakland Hip Evaluation Scale (CHOHES) is a modification of the Harris hip score that is currently being evaluated.|$|E
25|$|Fundamentally, {{an atomic}} orbital is a one-electron wave function, {{even though most}} {{electrons}} do not exist in one-electron atoms, and so the one-electron view is an approximation. When thinking about orbitals, we are often given an orbital vision which (even {{if it is not}} spelled out) is heavily influenced by this Hartree–Fock approximation, which <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reduce the complexities of molecular orbital theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{surge current}} rating of film {{capacitors}} {{can be enhanced}} by various internal configurations. Because metallization is the cheapest way of producing electrodes, optimizing {{the shape of the}} electrodes <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> minimize the internal resistance and to increase the current-carrying capacity. A slightly thicker metallization layer at the schoopage contact sides of the electrodes results in a lower overall contact resistance and increased surge current handling, without losing the self-healing properties throughout the remainder of the metallization.|$|E
50|$|Thick {{separators}} <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reduce self-discharge, {{but take}} up space and reduce capacity, while thin separators tend {{to raise the}} self-discharge rate. Some batteries may have overcome this tradeoff using thin separators with more precise manufacturing and by using a more advanced sulfonated polyolefin separator.|$|R
50|$|The Tsarist {{government}} {{before the}} Russian Revolution had already tried to foster {{an interest in}} Russian decorative arts.

50|$|Some analysts {{identify}} a volume ASP as a fifth type. This {{is basically a}} specialist ASP that offers a low cost packaged solution via their own website.

25|$|In topology, a ring torus is homeomorphic to the Cartesian {{product of}} two circles: S1×S1, {{and the latter}} is taken to be the {{definition}} in that context. It is a compact 2-manifold of genus 1. The ring torus <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> embed this space into three-dimensional Euclidean space, but another {{way to do this}} is the Cartesian product of the embedding of S1 in the plane. This produces a geometric object called the Clifford torus, a surface in 4-space.|$|E
25|$|Adenoviruses {{are often}} {{transmitted}} by expectorate, {{but can also}} be transmitted by contact with an infected person, or by virus particles left on objects such as towels and faucet handles. Some people with adenovirus gastroenteritis may shed the virus in their stools for months after getting over the symptoms. The virus can be passed through water in swimming pools {{that do not have}} enough chlorine in them. As with many other illnesses, good handwashing <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> inhibit the spread of adenoviruses from one person to another. Heat and bleach will kill adenoviruses on objects.|$|E
25|$|Source {{information}} is {{one type of}} episodic memory that suffers with old age; this kind of knowledge includes where and when the person learned the information. Knowing the source and context of information can be extremely important in daily decision-making, so {{this is one way}} in which memory decline can affect the lives of the elderly. Therefore, reliance on political stereotypes <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> use their knowledge about the sources when making judgments, and the use of metacognitive knowledge gains importance. This deficit may be related to declines in the ability to bind information together in memory during encoding and retrieve those associations at a later time.|$|E

25|$|Manufacturers {{of these}} items must take into {{consideration}} when creating these products whether the product {{could be construed as}} counterfeiting. Overlapping note images and/or changing the dimensions of the reproduction to be at least 50% smaller or 50% larger than the original <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> avoid the risk of being considered a counterfeit. But in cases where realism is the goal, other steps may be necessary. For example, in the stack of bank notes seat mentioned earlier, the decal used to create the product would be considered counterfeit. However, once the decal has been affixed to the resin stack shell and cannot be peeled off, the final product is no longer at risk of being classified as counterfeit, even though the resulting appearance is realistic.|$|E
25|$|Tublat (Keith David) – A rogue ape and {{a former}} member of Tarzan's gorilla family. He {{challenged}} Kerchak for leadership but he was defeated and cast out. He is considered dangerous by all the gorillas due to his aggressive and sociopathic behavior. He is based on Kala's husband (and Tarzan's foster father) in the original Tarzan novel. His personality is also very much like the original Kerchak or Terkoz from the novel. Conversely, Kerchak's personality in the 1999 film is just like Tublat's in the original novel. He once took over another gorilla family that Gobu belonged to, but inspired by Tarzan the family overthrew him and Gobu replaced him. He often calls Tarzan a hairless runt. He has four toes on his right foot (it is possible he lost one in a fight), and this <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> tell he is in the area. In the series, he plots to dispose of Tarzan so that he can take over the gorilla pack for himself and makes no secret of his hatred against Tarzan, believing him to be unworthy of leading the gorilla family (despite Tarzan's actual success as a leader of the gorillas).|$|E
500|$|Part of {{what this}} {{argument}} shows {{is that there is}} a least upper bound of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc.: a smallest number that is greater than all of the terms of the sequence. [...] One of the axioms of the real number system is the completeness axiom, which states that every bounded sequence has a least upper bound. [...] This least upper bound <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> define infinite decimal expansions: the real number represented by an infinite decimal is the least upper bound of its finite truncations. [...] The argument here does not need to assume completeness to be valid, because it shows that this particular sequence of rational numbers in fact has a least upper bound, and that this least upper bound is equal to one.|$|E
