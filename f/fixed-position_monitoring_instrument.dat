Detailed investigation in to the factors responsible for roof fall was carried out in an underground coal mine situated in Central India. The investigation was supplemented by In-situ stress assessment by drilling yield measurements and convergence recording by strata <b>monitoring</b> <b>instruments.</b> It was observed that strata <b>monitoring</b> <b>instruments</b> gives early indications about initiation of strata movement and potential roof fall. The proper analysis and interpretation of the readings from strata <b>monitoring</b> <b>instruments</b> is very much helpful in updating the risk assessment and preventing the roof fall by risk management...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a program}} to {{characterize}} and baseline environmental parameters, ambient radon- 222 (Rn) monitoring was conducted in the rural community of Amargosa Valley, NV, the closest community to Yucca Mountain. Passive integrating and continuous Rn <b>monitoring</b> <b>instruments</b> were deployed adjacent to the Community Environmental Monitoring Program (CEMP) station in Amargosa Valley. The CEMP station provided real-time ambient gamma exposure and meteorological data used to correct the integrated Rn measurements, verified the meteorological data collected by the continuous Rn <b>monitoring</b> <b>instrument,</b> and for provided instrumentation for evaluating the relationships between meteorological conditions and Rn concentrations. Hourly Rn concentrations in air measured by the continuous Rn <b>monitoring</b> <b>instrument</b> (AlphaGUARD®) were compared to the average hourly values for the integrating Rn measurements (E-PERM®) by dividing the total Rn measurements {{by the number of}} hours the instruments were deployed. The results of the comparison indicated that average hourly ambient Rn concentrations as measured by both methods ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 4 pico-curies per liter of air. Ambient Rn values for the AlphaGUARD exhibited diurnal variations. When Rn concentrations were compared with measurements of temperature (T), barometric pressure, and relative humidity, the correlation (inversely) was highest with T, albeit weakly...|$|R
