25|$|Railroading in Seattle closely paralleled {{development}} and early <b>hopes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Like communications networks today, 19th century railroading represented more than track, stock, and trade. Romantic and practical potential wooed {{communities across the}} West, much as Web commerce and bandwidth today (bandwidth was narrow, desire high, competition passionate). Travel between America's coasts had taken months, whether overland by wagon or by sailing ship or steamer around Cape Horn, until the Union Pacific reached San Francisco in 1869 and the Northern Pacific opened to Tacoma in 1887.|$|E
25|$|In early May 1948, Miller was loaned out again, {{this time}} to 20th Century Fox for West of Tomorrow—her first leading lady role. The {{screenplay}} was based on William Bowers' play of the same name. During WW2 in New Guinea, a US Army Air Force squadron has been assigned to protect Australia and despite having inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese, they supernaturally had none themselves. Miller played Jean Gillis, a Broadway actress and former anti-war activist, who joined the USO after her husband's death at Dunkirk. By happenstance, she ends up having to entertain the airmen by herself when she finds {{out the rest of}} her troupe is stranded. During an improvised “dinner dance,” she learns about the pilots' wives and girlfriends and their <b>hopes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> but equally learns about herself. Arthur Franz makes his film debut as Miller's love interest. The next morning, all but the squadron leader and Jean are killed after an attack on the airstrip. Similar to Death Takes a Holiday (1934), the airmen reach the epiphany of their lives in the few hours they spend with Jean. The resulting film was released as Jungle Patrol (1948), the sole film that Miller had 1st-place billing. Despite Miller's preference for Bowers' original title, the film is her personal favorite.|$|E

[...] Originally intended to show Gin's life before meeting Hotaru, Omori allowed the viewer to decide its relationship in time with the main story. [...] Omori also opted to start Hotaru's narration from a time after the story's main events; showing Hotaru as an 18-year-old who had just graduated high school and heading back to visit her relatives near the forest. [...] By having Hotaru tell the story in retrospect, Omori thought it provided a more human feel and gave more meaning to the final scene, where Hotaru expresses her <b>hopes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> by saying, [...] "Come on, let's go." ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} extent to which a change in {{perceived}} interpersonal discrimination was associated with a change in <b>the</b> levels of <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> global self-worth and perceived academic competence among a multiracial sample of adolescents attending a four-week, summer positive youth development program. Method: We first estimated means with standard errors of continuous variables and percentages within categorical variables in our total sample, and between those returning to PALS and those who were new to PALS. We then examined the correlation between perceived interpersonal racial/ethnic discrimination and the three outcome variables at the beginning and end of the program. Finally, a multivariate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was conducted to assess the relationship between discrimination and <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> global self-worth and perceived academic competence. Data was obtained from the 2013 Purdue Athletes Life Success program, a sample of 372 8 - 14 year old adolescents. Dependent variables included <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> global self-worth, and perceived academic competence. Results: The students who were new to PALS and reported an increase in discrimination, experienced more negative changes in <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> over <b>the</b> course of the program (beta= - 0. 43, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) compared to the low stable group. In regards to global self-worth, an increase in discrimination was associated with a decrease in global self-worth over the course of the program (beta= - 0. 27, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) for those students who were new to PALS when compared to the students that consistently experienced low levels of discrimination over both time points. Returning students who experienced high stable discrimination experience more negative changes in academic competence (b= - 0. 25 p 3 ̆c 0. 01) as compared to the low stable group. As discrimination increased, <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> global self-worth and perceived academic competence decreased. However, discrimination, at both time points, was not statistically correlated with <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Conclusions: These results suggest experiences of perceived discrimination may affect adolescents 2 ̆ 7 levels of <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> global self-worth, perceived academic performance. ...|$|R

It was believed that these five teams had intended to leave the SHL league after the 2009–10 season; they terminated their shareholders' agreements with Hockeyligan, the name at that time for the SHL's governing body. The teams also formed an interest group to investigate the possibility of forming a continental hockey league spanning several European countries.

2500|$|The {{contents}} of the treaty divided the Irish Republic's leadership, with the President of the Republic, Éamon de Valera, leading the anti-treaty minority. The Treaty Debates were difficult but also comprised a wider and robust stock-taking of the position by the contending parties. Their differing views {{of the past and}} their <b>hopes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> were made public. The focus had to be on the constitutional options, but little mention was made of the economy, nor of how life would now be improved {{for the majority of the}} population. Though Sinn Féin had also campaigned to preserve the Irish language, very little use was made of it in the debates. Some of the female TDs were notably in favour of continuing the war until a 32-county state was established. Much mention was made of '700 years' of British occupation. Personal bitterness developed; Arthur Griffith said of Erskine Childers: [...] "I will not reply to any damned Englishman in this Assembly" [...] and Cathal Brugha reminded everyone that the position of Michael Collins in the IRA was technically inferior to his.|$|E
2500|$|Unemployment {{for those}} under 25 has been {{reported}} to be 50%. Spain's current generation is considered the most educated that the country has ever had, yet it faces the greatest rate of unemployment in Europe. Roughly 68% of young people are willing to leave the country to search for a job, and those with college degrees are willing to settle for working at so-called minijobs for a paycheck. The State Secretary for Unemployment states that higher education is a way for the current generation to battle this issue; however, government cuts are occurring that slash university staff salaries and increase the number of students per class. For those paying their own way through college, the tough economy has made it nearly impossible to find a job and study simultaneously. [...] <b>Hopes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> are dwindling as Spain's unemployment rate is almost as high as it was for the United States during the Great Depression. People are beginning to fear the transformation of this generation into one referred to as a [...] "Lost Generation" [...] that is constantly looking for work and whose futures are closed off from [...] "good careers". The stress of unemployment has also affected personal relationships, with many young adults separating from partners. Youth unemployment is about double overall unemployment.|$|E

("The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues"). Sally appears next, dressed as a torch singer, singing of her passion for Ben from the past- and her obsession with him now ("Losing My Mind"). In a jazzy dance number, accompanied by a squadron of chorus boys, Phyllis reflects on the two sides of her personality, one naive and passionate and the other jaded and sophisticated and her desire to combine them ("The Story of Lucy and Jessie"). [...] Resplendent in top hat and tails, Ben begins to offer his devil-may-care philosophy ("Live, Laugh, Love"), but stumbles and anxiously calls to the conductor for the lyrics, as he frantically tries to keep going. Ben becomes frenzied, while the dancing ensemble continues as if nothing was wrong. Amidst a deafening discord, Ben screams at all the figures from his past and collapses as he cries out for Phyllis.|$|E
