5000|$|Stellaria holostea, the addersmeat or <b>greater</b> <b>stitchwort,</b> is a {{perennial}} herbaceous flowering {{plant in the}} carnation family Caryophyllaceae.|$|E
50|$|Despite its busy urban setting, {{the churchyard}} {{maintains}} {{an atmosphere of}} calm and its grassland is a haven for wildlife. Over a hundred plant species are found here, including many traditionally found in churchyards, for example Germander speedwell (Angel’s eyes), Snowdrops (Eve’s tears) and <b>Greater</b> <b>stitchwort</b> (Easter bell).|$|E
50|$|Sightings of a {{range of}} bird and land life have been noted here. The fauna {{includes}} kingfishers, brown hare, grass snakes , bitterns, ruddy darters, and the great crested grebe. Plant life includes common twayblade, common spotted orchid, spindle, small leaved lime, woodruff, <b>greater</b> <b>stitchwort,</b> sanicle, and the early purple orchid.|$|E
60|$|They started, but {{presently}} {{they came}} to high banks that showed such masses of bluebells, ragged Robin, <b>great</b> <b>stitchwort</b> and the like that Belinda {{was not to be}} restrained. She clamoured to stop the car and go up the bank and pick her hands full, and so they drew up by the roadside and Sir Richmond and Miss Grammont sat down near the car while Belinda carried her enthusiastic onslaught on the flowers up the steep bank and presently out of earshot.|$|R
5000|$|Much of the {{grassland}} {{is dominated}} by perennial rye-grass, with a good diversity of common wild flowers, {{and there are also}} areas of dry acid grassland. Several damp hollows, probably former ponds, contain tussocky grassland with uncommon wild flowers such as <b>great</b> burnet, bog <b>stitchwort</b> and common marsh-bedstraw. A map of the 1840s shows fourteen ponds, but only Laurel Farm Pond survives. This is frequented by large numbers of geese and mallards. Trees include pedunculate oak, beech and horse chestnut.|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{daffodil}} flowering is over (usually about March), {{the site}} remains {{of interest for}} its hedgerows and meadow flora. Species recorded include cowslip, hoary plantain, common dog-violet and meadow vetchling, which are meadow varieties. Hedgerow varieties include hop, sweet violet, dog's mercury, barren strawberry, hedge bedstraw and <b>greater</b> <b>stitchwort.</b>|$|E
50|$|The woods have tall oaks above a {{layer of}} sweet chestnut, rowan and birch, {{and there are several}} areas of grassland. Plants include wood anemone, {{bluebell}} and <b>greater</b> <b>stitchwort</b> and in at the southern end there is a small pond with amphibious bistort and brooklime. In the north there is acid grassland.|$|E
50|$|Standing on the north-west {{slope of}} the Mow Cop ridge, Limekiln Wood {{is part of a}} larger wood complex that has cloaked the ridge since the end of the last ice age. The trees reflect the thin soils and exposed {{location}} rising above the Cheshire plain: oak, downy birch and rowan predominate, with alder in the wetter patches and dense stands of holly beneath the canopy. There are a number of wet flushes through the wood, and these are home to a particularly rich ground flora; opposite-leaved golden saxifrage, marsh marigold, yellow pimpernel, meadowsweet and lesser celandine are all abundant. In drier areas honeysuckle, <b>greater</b> <b>stitchwort,</b> wood sorrel and foxglove add colour. In the autumn, varieties of fungi including foxy spot, stinkhorn and blushing bracket can be found.|$|E
