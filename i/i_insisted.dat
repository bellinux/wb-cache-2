25|$|The {{refusal of}} Hadrian II to ordain a {{candidate}} approved by Boris exhausted {{the patience of}} the Bulgarian prince. After a three-month stay in Bulgaria Silvester returned to Rome with {{a letter to the}} Pope in which for the last time Boris <b>I</b> <b>insisted</b> that either Formosus or Marinus be ordained, but the Pope declined the proposal once again. During that time the Bulgarian ruler had already started negotiations with the Patriarch of Constantinople Ignatius, who was trying to improve the relations with Rome, which had been strained after the mutual anathemas made in 863 by his predecessor Photios I and Pope Nicolas I. Just like Photios, however, Ignatius did not want to allow a permanent establishment of the Roman Church in Bulgaria. In order to settle {{the differences between the two}} Churches, the Eighth Ecumenical Council was planned to be held in Constantinople in 869. After a long stay in Rome (868–869), Peter returned to Bulgaria and was immediately sent to participate in the council.|$|E

I {{did not believe that}} a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. <b>I</b> <b>insisted</b> that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it. [...] "I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things." ...|$|E
500|$|Olivier and Esmond {{married on}} 25 July 1930 at All Saints, Margaret Street, {{although}} within weeks both realised they had erred. Olivier later recorded {{that the marriage}} was [...] "a pretty crass mistake. <b>I</b> <b>insisted</b> on getting married from a pathetic mixture of religious and animal promptings.... She had admitted {{to me that she}} was in love elsewhere and could never love me as completely as I would wish". Olivier later recounted that following the wedding he did not keep a diary for ten years and never followed religious practices again, although he considered those facts to be [...] "mere coincidence", unconnected to the nuptials.|$|E

500|$|In the song's final bridge section, at 2:58, {{the spoken}} phrase [...] "Fucking hell!" [...] appears. Scott admits that {{although}} he was told about it, he could not hear the words originally. Lennon attributed the expletive to McCartney, according to Emerick, who reports Lennon's comment in his autobiography: [...] "'Paul hit a clunker on the piano and said a naughty word,' Lennon gleefully crowed, 'but <b>I</b> <b>insisted</b> we leave it in , buried just low enough {{so that it can}} barely be heard. Most people won't ever spot it ... but we'll know it's there.'" [...] Womack considers that the expletive was actually uttered by Lennon. Malcolm Toft, the mix engineer on the Trident recording, also attributes it to Lennon. In Toft's recollection, Lennon was overdubbing his harmony vocal when, in reaction to the volume being too loud in his headphones, he first called out [...] "Whoa!" [...] then, two seconds later, swore as he pulled the headphones off.|$|E
500|$|Lee Garlington {{was cast}} as Claire the Waitress, who {{in an earlier}} draft of the episode was called [...] "Meg". Though {{initially}} cast as a series regular, the character was replaced with Elaine Benes when the series was picked up for a first season. Accounts differ on {{the reason why the}} character was replaced. Warren Littlefield has said that it was because the character's occupation: [...] "I thought that as a waitress she'd never be one of the gang. She'd be relegated to pouring coffee, catching up. So <b>I</b> <b>insisted</b> they create a female character they wanted to spend time with". Dennis Bjorklund of Seinfeld Reference has suggested that the character was dropped in favor of a female character with more sex appeal. However, Alexander said that Garlington was written out of the series because she had re-written her scene and given it to David, who was not happy with this. Seinfeld has, however, stated that this was not the reason the character was removed from the show, but rather that the producers were looking for [...] "someone who was more involved". Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who would go on to replace Garlington, has stated that she was not aware of the pilot before becoming a regular on the show, and she will never watch it out of superstition.|$|E

2500|$|Theodore's successor, Pope Martin <b>I</b> <b>insisted</b> {{on being}} consecrated {{immediately}} {{without waiting for}} imperial approval, and was (after a delay due to the revolt of Olympius, the exarch of Ravenna) abducted by imperial troops to Constantinople, found guilty of treason, and exiled to Crimea where he died in 655. Although Martin I's main crime was {{the promotion of the}} Lateran Council of 649, the council itself was a [...] "manifestly Byzantine affair" [...] by virtue of its participants and doctrinal influences (particularly its reliance on florilegia). The council's ecumenical status was never acknowledged, for the time solidifying the idea that the convening of ecumenical councils was an imperial prerogative. Within four years of the council's adjournment, both Martin I and Maximus the Confessor were arrested and tried in Constantinople for [...] "transgressing the Typos".|$|E
2500|$|In her autobiography, A Lonely Life, Davis gave a {{different}} version {{about having to}} see Bankhead in the play. [...] "A great admirer of hers, I wanted in no way {{to be influenced by}} her work. It was Willie's intention that I give {{a different}} interpretation of the part. <b>I</b> <b>insisted</b> that Tallulah had played it the only way it could be played. Miss Hellman's Regina was written with such definition that it could only be played one way." [...] "I had to do that part exactly the way Tallulah did it, because that's the way Lillian Hellman wrote it. But I was always sad that Tallulah couldn't record Regina from the theatre, because she was marvelous." [...] Charles Dingle, Carl Benton Reid, Dan Duryea, and Patricia Collinge all reprised their critically acclaimed Broadway performances. Critics preferred Bankhead's rendition of the role to Davis's, though the supporting cast was highly praised.|$|E
2500|$|When white {{students}} learned that Maud Cuney and another African American, Florida L. Des Verney, {{were living in}} a campus dormitory, some of them tried to have the young women excluded. Fearing financial pressure from white southern families, the Conservatory requested that the women find other lodgings, implying that their safety could not be guaranteed. Maud Cuney told the school that she refused to move. Her father also refused to move her, criticizing the school for dishonoring [...] "the noble men and women" [...] abolitionists of Massachusetts who had fought against prejudice. Members of the Boston black community spoke out against the Conservatory, as did black students, including Harvard Cambridge student W.E.B. Du Bois. The Colored National League took up the issue, and the Conservatory eventually reversed its position. Though Des Verney moved away, Maud Cuney stayed. She later wrote, [...] "I refused to leave the dormitory, and because of this, was subjected to many petty indignities. <b>I</b> <b>insisted</b> upon proper treatment." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{creating}} {{lyrics and}} melodies for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kiedis has drawn {{from various sources}} for inspiration. [...] His first musical memory was hearing Neil Young's [...] "Heart of Gold" [...] at age eleven: [...] "It moved me so much that <b>I</b> <b>insisted</b> my mother buy me the 45." [...] In high school, he was highly influenced by the rap-style vocals of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's [...] "The Message" [...] and the [...] "in-your-face sexual lyrics" [...] of Prince's [...] "Dirty Mind". Kiedis writes most of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' lyrics. Starting with 1989's Mother's Milk album, John Frusciante and Flea have written {{nearly all of the}} music (excluding melodies) for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Kiedis adds lyrics and melodies he hears during instrumental jams by his bandmates. Kiedis said in 2006, [...] "Somehow I find songs... in the bigness of what they're doing." [...] His lyrical style has varied over the years. During the band's early years, Kiedis wrote many lyrics detailing his enjoyment of sex, drugs, and life in Los Angeles. As his musical tastes expanded and his outlook on life changed, he began writing songs about a wider spectrum of subjects. His lyrics include many of the same themes as the writings of Charles Bukowski, Kiedis' main literary influence.|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. <b>I</b> <b>insisted</b> that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
