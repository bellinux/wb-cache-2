40|$|Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) in {{conjunction}} with a 4 -DPSK modulation format has been proposed for the future <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> system (<b>DAB),</b> that should provide compact disk sound quality in portable, vehicular and fixed receivers. With properly chosen parameters, this system should be appropriate for both terrestrial and satellite transmission. In this paper the influence of the nonlinear distortions introduced by the high power amplifier (HPA) of the transmitter is examined. In particular, the degradation in power efficiency due to intermodulation effects and backoff operating, as well as spectral degradations are investigated. It is shown for three different kinds of limiting amplifier models, that even with an output backoff (OBO) in the region of 5 - 6 dB, the degradation of, e. g., a 512 -carrier 4 -DPSK/OFDM system relative to the linear case is below 1. 7 dB, while the regenerated sidelobes of the transmitted spectrum are kept below - 20 dB...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} 20 th century radio {{has been an}} {{important}} source of information and entertainment for people of various ages and backgrounds. Almost every Australian home and car has at least one radio and most Australians listen to radio regularly. The introduction of new radio technology—digital terrestrial radio—which can deliver a better listening experience for audiences, therefore has the potential to influence people’s lives significantly. Digital radio in a variety of technological formats has been established in a number of countries for some years, but it is expected only to become a reality in Australia sometime in 2009. Unlike the idea of digital television however, digital radio has not fully captured the imagination of audiences and in some markets there are suggestions that it is no longer relevant. This paper provides a simple explanation of the major digital radio standards and a brief history of their development. It particularly examines the standard chosen for Australia, the Eureka 147 standard (known also as <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> or <b>DAB).</b> The paper also traces the development of digital radio policy in Australia and considers issues which may affect the future of the technology...|$|R
40|$|Two {{new methods}} using an FM-radio channel for {{transmission}} of digital data to mobile terminals are examined: 1. A {{modification of the}} radio data system (RDS) In RDS, additional digital information is multiplexed with a stereo sound signal. A new system is suggested where the data signal can be multiplexed with a mono audio signal. This causes extension to the bandwidth available for the data signal, and therefore the RDS bitrate can be increased. Error calculations are performed both for the original RDS system and for the new system. 2. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) OFDM {{is used in the}} <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> System (<b>DAB),</b> which is designed to transmit <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> in the FM band. In OFDM a signal is divided over a large number of 2 - or 4 -PSK modulated orthogonal subcarriers. The subcarriers of 6 different programmes are multiplexed in one beam to reduce the effects of frequency selectivity of the transmission channel. A new system based on OFDM is proposed, in which the carriers of each programme are transmitted in one FM-channel with a bandwidth of 200 kHz instead of multiplexed with the carriers of other programmes. Error calculations are performed for the subcarriers used in the OFDM modulation method. 1...|$|R
40|$|Wireless Communication {{has gained}} much {{popularity}} {{in the field of}} Communication because of its ability to transfer the data at high rate with much more increased high quality, low cost and better performance. Also it offers variety of services for the wide range of applications. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is becoming widely applied in wireless communications system due to its high rate transmissions capability with high bandwidth efficiency and its robustness with regard to multipath and delay. It has been used in <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>broadcasting</b> systems (<b>DAB),</b> <b>digital</b> video <b>broadcasting</b> (DVB) systems, digital subscriber line (DSL) standards, and wireless LAN standards such as the American IEEE std. 802. 11 (WiFi) and WiMAX (stands for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), are one of the standards of IEEE which utilizes the idea of OFDM, and is aimed to provide high-throughput broadband connections over long distances. Conventially we use discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in OFDM system. This thesis presents the simulation of 4 Qudrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) orthogonal frequency divison multiplexing (OFDM) baseband system and channel estimation which uses inverse discrete Hartley transform (IDHT) and discrete Hartley transform (DHT). As the calculation of DHT and IDHT involves real operations hence the computational complexities are less as comapred to DFT and IDFT. Moreover as IDHT is same as DHT hence we can use same hardware for both, while the DFT and IDFT require separate hardware to implement. As compared to DFT based OFDM system, the simulated DHT based OFDM system achieves approximately the same transmission performance with less computational complexity and hardware requirements. ...|$|R

40|$|M ulti-carrier {{modulation}} (MCM) {{has recently}} gained relevance among modulation schemes {{thanks to its}} intrinsic robustness in frequency selective fading channels. This {{is one of the}} reasons that made MCM a candidate for systems such as <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> and Video <b>Broadcasting</b> (<b>DAB</b> and DVB-T), Digital Subscriber Lines (x-DSL), and Wireless LAN. One of the major drawbacks of any MCM system, which is often an obstacle to its use, is the fact that the signal has a non-constant envelope, i. e. it exhibits peaks whose power strongly exceeds the mean power: the signal is said to have a high Peak-to-Average power Ratio (PAR). This prevents from the use of high-efficiency amplification devices (High Power Amplifiers, HPA), which exhibit deep non-linearities that give rise to intermodulation products; the latter cause in-band distortion and increase Out-Of-Band Radiation (OOBR), which results in a disturbing Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI) and a Bit-Error-Rate (BER) increase. To counteract such an effect, a reduction of the working point of the amplifier (Output Back-Off, OBO) is traditionally used, with a consequent reduction of the HPA efficiency; given the transmitted power, this leads to a growth of power consumption and costs. OOBR appears even when signal pre-distortion is used to force the amplifier to behave as an ideal clipper. Objective of this research work is the study of techniques for processing the signal at the transmitter side of a multi-carrier linearised system, which are capable of reducing the PAR of the original multi-carrier signal. After a short introduction to MCM and a description of PAR, its statistical description and its effects, PAR reduction techniques found in literature are introduced, described and discussed. A detailed analysis of features, performance, computational complexity follows, along with some considerations regarding the implementation of the techniques which have been judged most promising; such analysis is carried out also with the aid of extensive simulations of their operation, performed in MATLABTM environment...|$|R
