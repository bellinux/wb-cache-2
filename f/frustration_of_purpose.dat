2500|$|For many years, the Willard {{decision}} {{was the leading}} case in contract law regarding intent and enforcement. The case is still considered the leading decision on <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> regarding inflation in contracts. The Willard Court's conclusion that coin rather than paper currency be the form of payment (even though coin was no longer used) has drawn criticism from modern commentators, who found it inequitable. At least one modern commentator has characterized the decision [...] "temporizing and cautious". Another has observed that the ruling never attempts to distinguish legitimate inflation from speculation or economic bubbles. The fact-specific nature of the Court-fashioned relief has also tended to limit the ruling's applicability. In part, {{this may be because}} modern contracts often require an independent re-appraisal of the land prior to sale.|$|E

5000|$|Often {{there may}} be a {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> congressional <b>purpose</b> or the state law standing as an obstacle to congressional intent.

50|$|<b>Frustration</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> {{is often}} {{confused}} with the closely related doctrine of impossibility. The {{distinction between the two}} is that impossibility concerns the duties specified in the contract, but <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> concerns the reason a party entered into the contract. An example is if entrepreneur Emily leases space from landlord Larry so that she can open a restaurant that serves only Tibetan Speckled Lizard meat. If the city rezones the property to forbid commercial uses or if the property is destroyed by a tornado, both Larry and Emily are excused from performing the contract by impossibility.|$|E

50|$|In {{the law of}} contracts, <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> is {{a defense}} to {{enforcement}} of the contract. <b>Frustration</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> occurs when an unforeseen event undermines a party's principal purpose for entering into a contract such that {{the performance of the}} contract is radically different from performance of the contract that was originally contemplated by both parties, and both parties knew of the principal purpose at the time the contract was made. Despite frequently arising as a result of government action, any third party or even nature can frustrate a contracting party's primary purpose for entering into the contract. The concept is also called commercial frustration.|$|E
50|$|In dissent, Welsh JA {{stated that}} neither {{doctrine}} applied, as the provincial Act did not trench on {{the core of}} the federal power over navigation and shipping (being a workers’ compensation scheme which does not engage issues of negligence), and the fact that s. 44 restricts the scope of the right granted under s. 6(2) of the MLA was not sufficient to establish the <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> a federal <b>purpose.</b>|$|R
50|$|A further {{judgment}} {{was given by}} Lord Collins, with whom Lords Hope and Mance concurred. Lord Collins, in his brief judgment, offered further thoughts on the approach to interpretation.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the Article 50 TEU {{debate and}} the argument that for the UK Government to trigger the formal withdrawal process without explicit parliamentary authorisation would be unlawful, because it would inevitably result in the removal of rights enjoyed under EU law and the <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the statutes giving those rights domestic effect. After a brief survey of Article 50, this article argues first of all that the power to trigger Article 50 remains within the prerogative, contesting Robert Craig's argument in this issue {{that it is now}} a statutory power. It then suggests a number of arguments as to why the frustration principle may be of only doubtful application in this case, and in doing so it re-examines one of the key authorities prayed in aid of it - the Fire Brigades Union case...|$|R

60|$|You can imagine, then, {{that the}} christening dinners were none the less merry for the {{presence}} of the parson. The farmers relished his society particularly, for he could not only smoke his pipe, and season the details of parish affairs with abundance of caustic jokes and proverbs, but, as Mr. Bond often said, no man knew more than the Vicar about the breed of cows and horses. He had grazing-land of his own about five miles off, which a bailiff, ostensibly a tenant, farmed under his direction; and to ride backwards and forwards, and look after the buying and selling of stock, was the old gentleman's chief relaxation, now his hunting days were over. To hear him discussing the respective merits of the Devonshire breed and the short-horns, or the last foolish decision of the magistrates about a pauper, a superficial observer might have seen little difference, beyond his superior shrewdness, between the Vicar and his bucolic parishioners; for it was his habit to approximate his accent and mode of speech to theirs, doubtless because he thought it a mere <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> language to talk of 'shear-hogs' and 'ewes' to men who habitually said 'sharrags' and 'yowes'. Nevertheless the farmers themselves were perfectly aware of the distinction between them and the parson, and had not at all the less belief in him as a gentleman and a clergyman for his easy speech and familiar manners. Mrs. Parrot smoothed her apron and set her cap right with the utmost solicitude when she saw the Vicar coming, made him her deepest curtsy, and every Christmas had a fat turkey ready to send him with her 'duty' And in the most gossiping colloquies with Mr. Gilfil, you might have observed that both men and women 'minded their words', and never became indifferent to his approbation.|$|R

5000|$|A legal {{doctrine}} {{is a body}} of inter-related rules (usually of common law and built {{over a long period}} of time) associated with a legal concept or principle.

These include all of the traditional basis by which the formation of a contract may be challenged (e.g., lack of capacity, lack of consideration, the statute of frauds) and all of the traditional bases by which non-performance on the contract may be excused (e.g., failure of consideration, impossibility, illegality, <b>frustration</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose).</b>|$|E
