25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> {{there are}} easily {{more than one}} hundred million people with {{recognizable}} Portuguese ancestors, due to the colonial expansion and worldwide immigration of Portuguese from the 16th century onwards to India, the Americas, Macau (see Macanese people), East-Timor, Malaysia, Indonesia and Africa. Between 1886 and 1966, Portugal lost to emigration more than any West European country except Ireland. From the middle of the 19th century to the late 1950s, nearly two million Portuguese left Europe to live mainly in Brazil and with significant numbers to the United States. About 40 million Brazilians have relatively recent Portuguese background, due to massive immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. About 1.2 million Brazilian citizens are native Portuguese. Significant verified Portuguese minorities exist in several countries (see table).|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the money}} she gave up, her family stayed poor because her salary was only 207 RMB, which was equal to 20 dollars a month. And her {{research}} and work place was very poor. However, she never gave up. After coming back to China, she began working as soon as possible. In 1957, her workplace-Institute of Semiconductor CAS—finished making the first mono-crystalline germanium in China. By virtue of the working experience in Sylvania Company, she knew all the processes in making the mono-crystalline silicon. However she could not get any equipment because of embargoes from other countries. So she changed the process and made the first mono-crystalline silicon in China in 1958. China became the third country to make mono-crystalline silicon by itself. In 1962, she designed the mono-crystal furnace. This furnace had been merchandized to many countries. In the same year, she made the first mono-crystalline gallium arsenide in China. Lanying Lin’s gallium arsenide reached the highest mobility at that time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
25|$|WZT-2 (Wóz Zabezpieczenia Technicznego - Armoured {{recovery}} vehicle) - Polish ARV {{built on}} T-55 hull. It {{was built to}} perform repairs on T-55 and T-55A tanks. When it entered service in 1973 {{it was not only}} the best ARV in the whole Warsaw Pact but probably <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world.</b> It is still able to carry out tasks that NATO gives ARVs of its class. Unlike the T-55 and the WZT-1, the WZT-2 is still the basic ARV of the Polish army used for field repairs. It's able to perform repairs not only on Soviet tanks like the T-54/T-55 and T-72 but also on Polish PT-91 and German Leopard 2A4. However, because all tanks currently in Polish service weigh more than 40 tons it is unable to tow them. It is used to tow lighter vehicles like BWP-1 and 2S1. A total number of 600 was produced. 80 were in service as of 2004. Some are used by Ratownictwo Kolejowe (Railroad emergency respond services). Many have private owners who bought them from the Polish Army. 196 of these vehicles were also sold to India. The vehicles were also bought by Iraq and Yugoslavia.|$|E

Immediately {{upon arrival}} in Germany, Brundage became {{headline}} news {{when he and}} the AOC dismissed swimmer Eleanor Holm Jarrett, a gold medalist in 1932 and expected to repeat, for activities on shipboard. Rumors and accounts of the married swimmer's pursuits on board vary, but include statements that she was at an [...] "all-night party" [...] with playwright Charles MacArthur, who was traveling without his wife, actress Helen Hayes. Brundage discussed the matter with fellow AOC members, then met with Jarrett. Although the AOC attempted to send her home, Jarrett, after pleading in vain for reinstatement, remained in Berlin as a journalist, [...] "to the AOC's horror". In later years, she claimed that Brundage had kicked her off the team because he had propositioned her, and she had turned him down. According to Guttmann, [...] "Brundage has appeared, ever since , {{in the guise of}} a killjoy." [...] Butterfield noted that through the efforts of sportswriters who supported Jarrett, [...] "Brundage became celebrated as a tyrant, snob, hypocrite, dictator and stuffed shirt, as well as just about the meanest man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> of sports".|$|E

500|$|Michael Manley {{described}} Roach as [...] "swashbuckling", playing risky but attractive shots outside off stump. He {{could play}} with equal ability {{from either the}} front foot—with his weight going forward into a batting shot—or back foot. George John, his former coach, believed {{that he was more}} effective on the back foot, and sometimes failed to move his feet when batting, but that his ability to deflect the ball by the movements of his wrist was unsurpassed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world.</b> John also suggested that Roach might struggle to play one delivery but then hit the next for six. The writer C. L. R. James described how he attacked the short ball outside off stump: [...] " [...] his right foot back and across as far as it will go, and then let him lift his bat as high as he possibly can and from that position let it go like a piston at the unfortunate ball." [...] The resulting stroke left little chance for the fielders." [...] From this description, the journalist Frank Keating suggested a playing resemblance to Gordon Greenidge. On another occasion, James described Roach as [...] "an untalkative but cheerful soul." [...] Roach's form may have been affected by his lack of a regular partner to open the batting; he frequently had different partners from one Test to the next. He was a very effective fielder, especially in the covers.|$|E
