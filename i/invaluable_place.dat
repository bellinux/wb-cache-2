During this field campaign, a comprehensive characterisation of trace gases and radicals, involved in the production and destruction of O 3, {{as well as of}} chemical, physical and optical properties of the aerosol was done. Atmospheric gases and aerosols were measured continuously over the 5 weeks period, in order to characterize their background concentrations in the free troposphere and their respective differences in air containing dust aerosols advected from Africa. Due to its location and elevation, Mt Cimone gets free tropospheric air both from the Mediterranean and from the Po Valley, which makes it an <b>invaluable</b> <b>place</b> to study gas/aerosol interactions. A global chemical model coupled to a GCM was used to simulate based upon ECMWF reanalysis the ozone over the region during the period of the field study. The heterogeneous reactions of O 3, N 2 O 5, HNO 3 and NO 3 were accounted for. We estimate that during the field campaign, the effect of heterogeous reactions was to reduce by 8 to 10 % the ozone concentration at MTC in cases when air had passed over the Mediterranean Sea. When air was coming from the Atlantic or continental Europe, the reduction of ozone is still 4 %. This reduction is mostly due to the large uptake of HNO 3 and is the the topic of ongoing work to assess how it affects the global cycle of O 3 and the global nitrogen budget...|$|E

But, for South Asianists {{looking for a}} recalibration of kinship in the subcontinent, the news is not so good. Apart from a passing reference to the Andaman Islanders (via a passage in Claude Lévi-Strauss ’ Elementary structures of kinship), just two works from South Asia {{find their way into}} the Sahlins ’ diptych. 1 This is not entirely an omission on Sahlins ’ part, for we need to acknowledge that certain pretheoretical commitments in the scholarship about contemporary South Asia have resulted in producing an ostensible absence of focus on kinship in its normative form. For a context that is home (or {{at least one of the}} early homes) to the “dividual, ” where all manner of exchange relations are undergoing violent transformations, and where new reproductive technologies have affected a vast number of family formations in ways distinct from similar interventions elsewhere, the thinness of a contemporary scholarly corpus on kinship in India is therefore curious. Equally, as alerted by Andrew Shryock (this volume), summative accounts, such as Sahlins’, often cast themselves at a distance in and through the state, capital, and religion in both familiar and new ways. 2 These two analytical impasses (South Asianist and anthropological) are not the same, but are, in fact, coconstitutive—and are, perhaps, different responses to the same question, as I will explain below. Sahlins ’ book provides a useful prompt to reflect on both these hesitations, but also helps us to understand what a (renewed) interest in South Asian kinship might bring to anthropology...|$|E

Sedimentological, geochemical, magnetic and ferromagnetic resonance properties divide the sediment columns into three biogeochemical zones. In the upper sediments, the dominant magnetic mineral is magnetite, produced by magnetotactic bacteria and dissimiliatory microbial iron metabolism. At lower depths, above or near mean tide level, microbial iron reduction dissolves most of the magnetic particles in the sediment. In some cores, magnetic iron sulfides precipitate in a bottom zone of sulfate reduction, likely coupled to the oxidation of decaying mangrove roots. The remanent magnetization preserved in all oriented samples appears indistinguishable from the modern local geomagnetic field, which reflects the post-depositional origin of magnetic particles in the lower zone of the parasequence. While we cannot comment on the effects of late-stage diagenesis or metamorphism on remanence in carbonates, we postulate that early-cemented, thin-laminated parasequence tops in ancient peritidal carbonates are mostly likely to preserve syn-depositional paleomagnetic directions and magnetofossil stratigraphies...|$|R

40|$|With the {{launches}} of the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) and the X-ray Multimirror Mission (XMM) and {{the upcoming}} {{launch of the}} Japanese mission ASTRO-E, high resolution X-ray spectroscopy of cosmic sources has begun. Early, deep observations of three stellar coronal sources will provide not only invaluable calibration data, but will also give us benchmarks for the atomic data under collisional equilibrium conditions. Analysis of the Chandra X-ray Observatory data, and data from other telescopes taken simultaneously, for these stars is ongoing {{as part of the}} Emission Line Project. Goals of the Emission Line Project are: (1) to determine and verify accurate and robust diagnostics and (2) to identify and prioritize issues in fundamental spectroscopy which will require further theoretical and/or laboratory work. The Astrophysical Plasma Emission Database will be described in some detail, as it is introducing standardization and flexibility into X-ray spectral modeling. Spectral models of X-ray astrophysical plasmas can be generally classified as dominated by either collisional ionization or by X-ray photoionization. While the atomic data needs for spectral models under these two types of ionization are significantly different, there axe overlapping data needs, as I will describe. Early results from the Emission Line Project benchmarks are providing an <b>invaluable</b> starting <b>place,</b> but continuing work to improve the accuracy and completeness of atomic data is needed. Additionally, we consider the possibility that some sources will require that both collisional ionization and photoionization be taken into account, or that time-dependent ionization be considered. Thus plasma spectral models of general use need to be computed over a wide range of physical conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} two hydrochemical time-series {{derived from}} stream samples {{taken in the}} Upper Hafren catchment, Plynlimon, Wales. One time-series comprises data collected at 7 -hour intervals over 22 months (Neal et al., 2012 -this issue), while the other is based on weekly sampling over 20 years. A subset of determinands: aluminium, calcium, chloride, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon, iron, nitrate, pH, silicon and sulphate are examined within a framework of non-stationary time-series analysis to identify determinand trends, seasonality and short-term dynamics. The results demonstrate that both long-term and high-frequency monitoring provide valuable and unique insights into the hydrochemistry of a catchment. The long-term data allowed analysis of long-term trends, demonstrating continued increases in DOC concentrations accompanied by declining SO 4 concentrations within the stream, and provided {{new insights into the}} changing amplitude and phase of the seasonality of the determinands such as DOC and Al. Additionally, these data proved <b>invaluable</b> for <b>placing</b> the short-term variability demonstrated within the high-frequency data within context. The 7 -hour data highlighted complex diurnal cycles for NO 3, Ca and Fe with cycles displaying changes in phase and amplitude on a seasonal basis. The high-frequency data also demonstrated the need to consider the impact that the time of sample collection can have on the summary statistics of the data and also that sampling during the hours of darkness provides additional hydrochemical information for determinands which exhibit pronounced diurnal variability. Moving forward, this research demonstrates the need for both long-term and high-frequency monitoring to facilitate a full and accurate understanding of catchment hydrochemical dynamics...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} wireless sensor networks, as illustrated by speck-nets, as an appropriate platform for developing novel immune-inspired algorithms. Properties {{of the immune system}} and wireless sensor networks are examined in parallel, revealing a potential mapping between the two. The cognitive view of the immune system is identified as appropriate for further investigation at the theoretical level, while the functionality of dendritic cells becomes the focus in terms of biology. An agent-based model is developed as an exercise in under-standing the dendritic cell function, emphasising the aspect of mobility. The model is then developed into a simulated implementation for specknets, using the application problem of temperature monitoring and control. The thesis concludes with an analysis about certain aspects the immune system and the specknet, and the proposal of a methodology to allow blending of ideas derived from two such complex systems. i Acknowledgements Preparing this thesis for submission is {{one of the hardest things}} I ever did.

40|$|Instead of {{allowing}} diversity {{of race and}} culture to become a limiting factor to human exchange and development, we must refocus our understanding, discern in such diversity the potential for mutual enrichment, and realise {{that it is the}} interchange between great traditions of human spirituality that offers the best prospect for the persistence of the human spirit itself. For too long such diversity has been treated as a threat rather than as a gift…” World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (2000) “Tolerance and Diversity: A vision for the 21 st century”, Vision Statement, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Geneva. In our current climate in the postmodern world, the concept of knowledge as a commodity has became a viable and accepted custom. Intrinsic to this notion of knowledge as capital, culture is viewed as a production in itself and as an artefact by which to examine both the dimensions and layers of thinking pertinent to the navigation of cultural demarcations. This paper contends that the principal framework of ‘doing business’ needs to engender Cultural Connectivity and that this should be placed at the forefront of interpersonal interactions. Cultural Connectivity utilises both cultural intelligence as the thinking within culturally diverse exchanges; and cultural competence as the dexterity of the user to successfully negotiate through the maze of cultural contexts. Cultural Connectivity is the broader construct of how we can perceive similarities within culturally diverse contexts to make connections at a ‘humanness’ level. American President Barrack Obama, as an effective example of this practice, is tendered as representational of the positive role model in this instance. As a recognizable ‘global citizen’, he is in a strong, tenable position to be accepted across a range of cultural boundaries. Our own Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is yet another example, whereby his speech in fluent Mandarin Chinese, acted as a cultural connector with both the Chinese government and people. Both of these political figures have successfully engaged in business utilising the theory of cultural connectivity. This paper will discern why it should be considered an <b>invaluable</b> resource to <b>placing</b> Australia in a strong position upon the global stage...|$|R
