We’re fun, like to dance and party, and we didn't really get {{to do a lot of}} that on the first album. Even going to festivals and seeing big bands live, like Coldplay or Bruce Springsteen, we knew the second time around we wanted something fun. It’s the kind of song where the whole band can get up and jam and have this Earth, Wind and Fire kind of moment".|$|E
500|$|Black Eye is {{the only}} {{full-length}} album by the English punk rock band Fluffy. The band formed in London in late 1994 by singer and guitarist Amanda Rootes, guitarist Bridget Jones, bassist Helen Storer, and drummer Angie Adams. Unsatisfied with the Britpop invasion at the time, the band sought to recapture the punk rock phenomenon. According to Rootes, [...] "We want to infiltrate and conquer the masses. It's like, Americans think English music's shit – 'cause <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>We</b> want [...] to gain a little respect that we haven't had for a while." [...] The band also felt more comfortable in North America than in the UK because the British press [...] "can't handle {{the concept of a}} sexually frank all-girl band"; the name of the band comes from a lesbian novel titled Fluffy Butch, which Rootes thought was funny.|$|E
500|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{painting}} were positive; one review called it [...] "beyond question {{one of the finest}} landscapes ever painted in this country", adding, [...] "Its artistic merits are in some respects unrivalled: and added to these it has the advantage of being a representative painting of a portion of the most sublime and beautiful scenery on the American Continent." [...] The painting won a prize at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867. At the same time, there were also critical voices; in particular, some American Pre-Raphaelites found his brushwork wanting. One such critic complained {{that it would have been}} better [...] "if the marks of the brush had, by dexterous handling, been made to stand for scrap and fissure, crag and cranny, but as <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> have only too little geology and too much bristle." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{abstract}} {{patterns in}} dazzle camouflage inspired artists including Picasso. With characteristic hyperbole, he claimed credit for camouflage experiments, {{which seemed to}} him a quintessentially Cubist technique. In a conversation with Gertrude Stein shortly after he first saw a painted cannon trundling {{through the streets of}} Paris he remarked, [...] "Yes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> who made it, that is cubism". In Britain, Edward Wadsworth, who supervised dazzle camouflage painting in the war, created a series of canvases after the war based on his dazzle work on ships. In Canada, Arthur Lismer used dazzle ships in some of his wartime compositions. In America, Burnell Poole painted canvases of United States Navy ships in dazzle camouflage at sea. The historian of camouflage Peter Forbes comments that the ships had a Modernist look, their designs succeeding as avant-garde or Vorticist art.|$|E
500|$|... "Marry You" [...] {{is one of}} {{the eleven}} songs {{composed}} and produced by The Smeezingtons, the collaboration of Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, and Ari Levine, for Mars's debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans. Lawrence explained the inspiration behind the song in an interview with American Songwriter stating, [...] "e had this image of a slow-mo video in Vegas of a couple running, and she’s in her gown and he’s in his tux, the wedding party is behind them. This sort of crazy, daring, wedding feeling". Lawrence was surprised at the impact of the song after watching some YouTube videos. He stated that [...] "e always {{thought it was a good}} song and catchy, but we didn’t think it would affect pop culture the way that it has. The first time we saw one of those YouTube videos...we were almost in tears... the power of what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> can create. These ideas, words, and lyrics and how they can get into the fabric of society and affect people’s lives in such an amazing way." [...] In an interview with Idolator Bruno Mars said that the song had its beginning by [...] "just playing the chords," [...] and then freestyling the lyrics [...] "I think I wanna marry you!". He continued, [...] "you’re in Vegas...had way too many drinks, and you love everybody, and you want to do something that you probably shouldn’t do and you’ll regret in the morning." ...|$|E
500|$|By October 2013, Marvel was {{preparing}} four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, {{to present to}} video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest. In November 2013, {{it was announced that}} Disney would provide Netflix with live-action series based on Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Netflix was chosen to air the shows, [...] "when Disney realized it could use the streaming service as a way to grow the popularity of the characters". He added that, if the characters prove popular, they could become feature films. Loeb later stated that Marvel was not [...] "interested in making four pilots and then hoping someday that they could all get together. Netflix really understood what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do. They're very open to directors that might not have that same opportunity in broadcast television. The notion of having all 13 episodes at one time, particularly in serialized storytelling, is very appealing." [...] Loeb also added that the four characters chosen [...] "all had a previous existing relationship and all grew up on the same kind of stoop in New York [...] So it lent itself to a world. Does that mean these shows {{are going to be the}} same? No. They can't be. The characters have different issues, different problems, different feelings about them ... the example that I continually give is that I cannot think of two films that are more different in tone than [...] and Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, if you watch them back to back, they feel very Marvel. They feel very much like, 'Oh, it is still the same universe that I'm in.'" ...|$|E

500|$|After {{taking a}} five-month hiatus at the {{beginning}} of 2006, From Autumn to Ashes returned and played the length of the 2006 Vans Warped Tour, adding Rob Lauritsen in place of Cox. In September 2006, the band rented practice space and began writing material for what would become Holding a Wolf by the Ears. Brian McTernan was chosen as producer because he had previously worked with Mark and Newton on their side project Biology's album, and the members opted for this release to have a less refined feel than the last albums. As From Autumn to Ashes prepared to begin studio recording for the album, Mark noted that Perri [...] "never came out to any of the practices and he had no involvement. But that was also the way it was when we wrote Abandon Your Friends." [...] Perri had then declared that he would no longer {{be a part of the}} band. [...] As Mark explains, [...] "I thought there was a more considerate way he could have gone about leaving the band", but it was ultimately [...] "cool of him to recognize that he just didn't have the passion for the band anymore." [...] Deciding to move on without Perri as a member, Mark then became lead vocalist, providing both clean and screaming vocals in addition to his already recorded drums. [...] Mark, as the band's lyricist explained that he [...] "work very hard and writing and revising very personal lyrics" [...] and found that a part of him did not want to hand over the lyrics to another to sing, however, with Perri's departure and when Mark began recording vocal tracks, [...] "It immediately seemed like that’s the way things had been all along". Mark stated the bulk of the album's lyrics had been [...] "just about living" [...] and [...] "the idea that extremes are dangerous." [...] Recorded in about a month's time, Holding a Wolf by the Ears was named for the quotation by Thomas Jefferson, [...] "But as <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other." [...] Reviewer Drew Beringer of Absolute Punk had praised the change in the band's line up, stating that [...] "Mark is three times the front man Perri was", and gave [...] "passion that had been severely lacking while Perri was in the band." ...|$|E

2500|$|Deleuze adapts the {{doctrine}} of univocity to claim that being is, univocally, difference.

Moreover, it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> and our individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being." [...] Here Deleuze at once echoes and inverts Spinoza, who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one substance, God or Nature. For Deleuze, there is no one substance, only an always-differentiating process, an origami cosmos, always folding, unfolding, refolding. Deleuze summarizes this ontology in the paradoxical formula [...] "pluralism = monism".|$|E
