40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the realm of}} Web resource re-discovery: the location of previously visited material to enable its further use. As the Web continues to grow, new tools for managing references to useful information - aiding the ever growing numbers of users - must be developed. Retro, a personal {{information storage and retrieval}} system, is a prototype of such a tool. Examination of current practice identified two primary tools in use. The first, global indexes were shown to be inadequate - they {{do not have access to}} the full content of the Web, and therefore cannot fully support re-discovery; the second, <b>hotlists,</b> required manual intervention, disrupting the primary task: reading and understanding the content. To avoid problems associated with resource discovery systems, and to enable creation of automatic <b>hotlists,</b> Retro moves document indexing to the user's desktop. Problems involved in recording and comparing Web content were present. Personal Web proxies were used to intercept addresses and content of every visited page. Suggestions for possible use of proxy hierarchies, providing shared Web memories, were discussed. Content of HTML pages was extracted into summaries using a two stage SGML parsing technique. Document validity of only 13 % indicated that such tools must be used with care. Analysis of Retro, in a limited real-world environment, indicated document re-use at a level suitable for supporting creation of automatic <b>hotlists.</b> Such lists provide useful supplements to existing tools. Projected requirements for personal index storage, over twelve months, averaged 15 Mbytes for the Retro filter. This is within acceptable limits for modern desktop computers. Aliases, identified as a serious potential threat for re-discovery tools, were found in 1 % of recorded material. Evidence demonstrates that Retro tools provide a useful supplementary environment for re-discovery, and indicates that future research to improve and extend this system is desirable...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to conduct an exploratory investigation into how individuals use the World Wide Web (also known as the "Web"). Specifically, the study examined Web users' information search behavior; their motivations behind using the Web and their preferences for certain Web sites; as well as the effects of the Web on their consumption of traditional media. In order to investigate the above issues, the study draws upon theoretical research in such areas as external memory and <b>hotlists</b> (Coupey, 1996; Hoffman and Novak, 1996); consideration sets (Schmidt and Spreng, 1996); the consumer information search process (Punj and Staelin, 1983); instrumental and ritualized media orientations (Rubin, 1984; 1993); and the Web's effects on the use of traditional media (Georgia Tech Research. Corporation, 1996 a; 1996 b). To conduct this qualitative analysis of Web use, behaviors, and motivations, relationships were proposed and telephone interviews were used to solicit responses. The interview transcripts were studied in detail, respondents' comments, feelings, and opinions were gathered, while tables and matrices were developed to systematically analyze the data. Findings indicated that some relationships investigated were found to exist. Specifically, Web users tend to add a site to their <b>hotlists</b> when they expect to return to the site and when the site serves their specific interest(s). Results also showed that a negative relationship exists between Web use and the traditional media vehicles investigated, namely, television, newspapers, and magazine...|$|R

40|$|A Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) allows {{effective}} {{identification of}} a large number of tagged objects without physical or visual contact. RFID systems are a promising technology for supply chain management and inventory control. As individual item tagging becomes a reality, privacy concerns over RFID use come to the fore. The shared radio medium allow eavesd- ropping and unauthorized tag reading which poses threats to individual’s privacy. Moreover, due to the mode of use of RFIDs, newthreats emerge. The limited size and cost considerations do not allow to implement conventional cryptographic systems on RFIDs. there are several type of attacks on RFID such as tracking, <b>hotlisting</b> and profiling etc. To protect against these attacks RFID systems uses blocking,in which a tag stops communication whenever it suspects an attack against it. However blocking poses the problem of reduced availability. In this paper an algorithm is proposed for efficient RFID authentication. The proposed algorithm will be secure against the anticipated threats to RFID systems and also free from blocking thus increasing availability of tag. The algorithm does not require computationally expensive cryptographic mechanisms; it relies on rather simple matrix multiplication...|$|R

Interestingly, Web pages appear to have been clustered according to their rhetorical/discoursal types (informational, instructional, argumentative, etc.), rather than genre classes (e. g. sermons and editorials, both argumentative, belong to the same cluster).

40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{upgrading}} passports to an electronic version {{is making it}} hard for criminals or anybody to counterfeit or illegally duplicate them. A practical way of doing so is {{through the use of}} digital signatures because it is computationally hard to counterfeit them. So all the contents of e-passports are now digitally signed by the Document Signer of the issuing country. The e-passport has thus achieved its central objective however it suffers from several security and privacy issues. Many of these issues are due to the technology being used in it. For example, use of RFID provides platform for skimming, tracking and <b>hotlisting</b> etc. Similarly, possibility of eavesdropping in the communication is always there. The current protocols used by the e-passports have also not been designed with adequate security. The standard put forward by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the body responsible for standardizing protocols related to e-passports, suffers from several security issues. Many of these issues threaten the privacy of the e-passport owner. An improved version of it, as proposed by European Union (EU) is known as Enhanced Access Control (EAC). But it also suffers from some inaccuracies. So it very important to analyze these issues and put forward a better solution. This thesis analyzes the security and privacy issues in these protocols. It highlights several weaknesses in the ICAO s protocol and EAC. It then proposes a more secure and better protocol, named Secure Electronic Passport Access Protocol (SEPAP). SEPAP makes the terminal authentication more accurate and the design of the protocol itself mandates terminal to be authenticated before the e-passport chip. So, it is more dependable then EAC or other e-passport protocols. In addition to informal analyses, the thesis also performs formal verification of this proposed protocol. Formal verification has been done with ProVerif and Scyther. It is equally important to see if the primitives necessary for the protocol can be practically implemented. So the thesis also provides a sample implementation of the protocol. Finally, the thesis attempts to see if e-passports can be used in other areas as well, besides border control. As a case study, the thesis performs this analysis on electronic voting and puts forward some recommendations on how e-passports, following different e-passport protocols, may be used with different e-voting schemes. </p...|$|R
