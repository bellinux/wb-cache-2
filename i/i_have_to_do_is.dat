In the footage, her stylist said that the {{inspiration}} for the video was [...] "trailer-trash, ghetto fabulous, out-there, [...] edgy." [...] During the footage Beyoncé said [...] "I like this video. It's no choreography, no pressure. All <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> party and have a good time." [...] She also revealed that the video is supposed to reflect her simplistic childhood, adding: [...] "Growing up, I had really amazing parents and I had a great childhood. We went from nicer homes to being in apartments with our lights cutting off. It didn't matter where we were 'cause we had love and we had so much fun. It's great when you don't have as much how you improvise and you have more fun." ...|$|E
500|$|While Leng {{considers}} that, lyrically and musically, [...] "Something" [...] reflects [...] "doubt and {{striving to}} attain an uncertain goal", author Ian Inglis writes of the confident statements that Harrison makes throughout regarding his feelings for Boyd. Referring to {{lines in the}} song's verses, Inglis writes: [...] "there is a clear and mutual confidence in the reciprocal nature of their love; he muses that [...] 'attracts me like no other lover' and 'all <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> think of her,' but he is equally aware that she feels the same, that 'somewhere in her smile, she knows.'" [...] Similarly, when Harrison sings in the middle eight that [...] "You're asking me will my love grow / I don't know, I don't know", Inglis interprets the words as [...] "not an indication of uncertainty, but a wry reflection that his love is already so complete that it may simply be impossible for it to become any greater". Richie Unterberger of AllMusic describes [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song" [...] written at a time [...] "when most of the Beatles' songs were dealing with non-romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics {{even when they were}} writing about love".|$|E
500|$|Angelou was an {{inspiration}} to the modern hip-hop community. [...] Artists such as Danny Brown, Lupe Fiasco, Jean Grae, and The Roots mention her in their songs. [...] Tupac Shakur, who appeared in the film Poetic Justice, which featured Angelou's poetry, named his album Still I Rise, released in 1999 after his death, for Angelou's poem. Nicki Minaj wrote a song also called [...] "Still I Rise", for her 2009 mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty. [...] Although Minaj's song does not mention Angelou explicitly, its themes of overcoming hardship echo the themes in Angelou's poem. [...] Angelou inspired the work of Kanye West, who has referenced Angelou throughout his career, including in a remix of Talib Kweli's [...] "Get By", which West produced in 2002, and in his own song, [...] "Hey Mama" [...] from the album Late Registration, produced in 2005. [...] Common collaborated with Angelou in 2011 in his song, [...] "The Dreamer", which featured her reciting a poem {{at the end of}} the song. [...] Angelou admitted later that his use of profanity in the song [...] "surprised and disappointed" [...] her. [...] According to Time, Angelou believed that rap music was an avenue for young people to discover poetry, and that she was optimistic about the future of poetry, telling one of its reporters, [...] "“All <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> listen to hip-hop or some of the rappers".|$|E

500|$|On February 12, 2012, Lil' Wayne {{said that}} Christina Milian had joined Young Money, and will release her fourth album through Young Money Entertainment. The next day, a song titled [...] "Mr. Valentine" [...] leaked onto the internet. Milian told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio. [...] "Yeah, I've signed with Young Money. It was pretty awesome. This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so all <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E
500|$|Dean Martin's song [...] "Naughty Lady of Shady Lane" [...] was {{the first}} to have a number-one in the Record Mirror chart but not to be awarded the top spot in NME 's chart. There are five more songs that, like Martin's, reached number-one on the Record Mirror chart but are not {{classified}} as number-one by the UK Singles Chart. Additionally, the Record Mirror and other charts differed about what they classified as the top song of the year. Record Mirror classified The Everly Brothers' [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Is</b> Dream"/"Claudette" [...] as the top single of 1958 while the UK Singles Chart best-selling single of that year was Elvis Presley's [...] "Jailhouse Rock". Furthermore, despite never reaching number-one, Pat Boone's [...] "Love Letters in the Sand" [...] was classified by Record Mirror as the best-selling song of 1957; the song entered the chart at number eleven on 13 July and, later, charted in the top three positions for 9 consecutive weeks. This is because the top lists for the whole year, were based on a points system. It has to be noted that Tony Jasper's Top 20 book (which takes info from Record Mirror) does actually fall into mistakes between August & December 1958, as Tony says there was no chart for the first week of August, but there was. The charts he prints for 9th Aug onwards are all dated wrongly. The 9th Aug is the 2nd Aug, the 16th is the 9th & so on until 27th Dec 1958, when the dated chart for 27th is actually 20th Dec. He then fails to print the 27th Dec chart. From 1959, he gets it correct again. Though through this mistake, he misses a top 20 entry by Martinas & His Orchestra [...] "Cha Cha Momma Brown", which sneaked into the chart at #18 at the end of December 1958, & then quickly fell out again.|$|E

2500|$|His {{romance with}} Principal also ended shortly {{thereafter}} {{when she gave}} him an ultimatum to choose between her or drugs, but not before they recorded and released a duet of the Everly Brothers' [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Is</b> Dream" [...] {{in the summer of}} 1981. He reportedly heard her singing in the shower and convinced her to go into the studio with him. This would be Gibb's last official single, and his last US chart entry, peaking at number 51. [...] In 1984 and 1985 Gibb did finish two successful contracts at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas.|$|E

2500|$|Orbison {{had some}} success at Sun Records, however, and was {{introduced}} to Elvis Presley's social circle, once {{going to pick up}} a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac. Orbison sold [...] "Claudette"—a song he wrote about Claudette Frady whom he married in 1957—to the Everly Brothers and their subsequent recording of it was released as the B-side of their smash hit [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Is</b> Dream". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled him to make a down-payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas, and then quit performing for seven months in 1958. In dire financial straits, his car repossessed, he turned to family and friends for funds.|$|E
2500|$|One such {{threat was}} {{delivered}} by fur trader James McDougall, who {{is quoted as}} saying to a gathering of local chiefs, [...] "You know the smallpox. Listen: I am the smallpox chief. In this bottle I have it confined. All <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to pull the cork, send it forth among you, and you are dead men. But this is for my enemies and not my friends." [...] Likewise, another fur trader threatened Pawnee Indians that if they didn't agree to certain conditions, [...] "he would let the smallpox out of a bottle and destroy them." [...] The Reverend Isaac McCoy was quoted in his History of Baptist Indian Missions as saying that the white men had deliberately spread smallpox among the Indians of the southwest, including the Pawnee tribe, and the havoc it made was reported to General Clark and the Secretary of War. [...] Artist and writer George Catlin observed that Native Americans were also suspicious of vaccination, [...] "They see white men urging the operation so earnestly they decide that it must be some new mode or trick of the pale face by which they hope to gain some new advantage over them." [...] So great was the distrust of the settlers that the Mandan chief Four Bears denounced the white man, whom he had previously treated as brothers, for deliberately bringing the disease to his people.|$|E
