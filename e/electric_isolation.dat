This research examines coupling mechanisms in a RF-targeted high-resistivity partially-depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) IC process and applying similar coupling mitigation strategies from {{higher levels of}} design, proposes techniques to reduce coupling between sub-circuits on-chip. A series of test structures was fabricated {{with the goal of}} understanding and reducing the electric and magnetic field coupling at frequencies up to C-Band. Electric field coupling through the active-layer and substrate of the SOI wafer is compared for a variety of isolation methods including use of deep-trench surrounds, blocking channel-stopper implant, blocking metal-fill layers and using substrate contact guard-rings. Magnetic coupling is examined for on-chip inductors utilizing counter-winding techniques, using metal shields above noisy circuits, and through the relationship between separation and the coupling coefficient. Finally, coupling between bond pads employing the most effective <b>electric</b> field <b>isolation</b> strategies is examined. Lumped element circuit models are developed to show how different coupling mitigation strategies perform. Major conclusions relative to substrate coupling are 1) substrates with resistivity 1 kΩ·cm or greater act largely as a high-K insulators at sufficiently high frequency, 2) compared to capacitive coupling paths through the substrate, coupling through metal-fill has little effect and 3) the use of substrate contact guard-rings in multi-ground domain designs can result in significant coupling between domains if proper isolation strategies {{such as the use of}} deep-trench surrounds are not employed. The electric field coupling, in general, is strongly dependent on the impedance of the active-layer and frequency, with isolation exceeding 80 dB below 100 MHz and relatively high coupling values of 40 dB or more at upper S-band frequencies, depending on the geometries and mitigation strategy used. Magnetic coupling was found to be a strong function of circuit separation and the height of metal shields above the circuits.

Many sections of DOE Order 5400. 1 have been replaced by DOE Order 231. 1 (DOE, 1995), which is the driver for the Annual Site Environmental Report (ASER) and the guidance source for preparing many environmental program documents. The WIPP project is operated by Westinghouse <b>Electric</b> Company, Waste <b>Isolation</b> Division (WID), for the DOE. This plan defines the extent and scope of the WIPP's effluent and environmental monitoring programs during the facility's operational life and also discusses the WIPP's quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program as it relates to environmental monitoring. In addition, this plan provides a comprehensive description of environmental activities at WIPP including: A summary of environmental programs, including the status of environmental monitoring activities A description of the WIPP project and its mission A description of the local environment, including demographics An overview of the methodology used to assess radiological consequences to the public, including brief discussions of potential exposure pathways, routine and accidental releases, and their consequences Responses to the requirements described in the Environmental Regulatory Guide for Radiological Effluent Monitoring and Environmental Surveillance (DOE, 1991). This document references DOE orders and other federal and state regulations affecting environmental monitoring programs at the site. WIPP procedures, which implement the requirements of this program plan, are also referenced. The DOE regulates its own activities for radiation protection of the public under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U. S. C. 2011). The effluent and environmental monitoring activities prescribed by DOE Order 5400. 5 and the DOE/EH- 0173 T guidance manual are designed to ensure that DOE facilities implement standards and regulations to protect members of the public and the environment against undue risk from radiation. Effluent and environmental monitoring also provide 1999 Environmental Monitoring Plan DOE/WIPP 99 - 2194 the data necessary to demonstrate compliance with applicable environmental protection regulations. Other federal agencies, such as the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are empowered through specific legislation to regulate certain aspects of DOE activities potentially affecting public health and safety or the environment. Presidential Executive Order 12088, Federal Compliance with Pollution Control Standards (43 FR 47707), requires the heads of executive agencies to ensure that all federal facilities and activities comply with applicable pollution control standards and to take all necessary actions for the prevention, control, and abatement of environmental pollution. Beyond statutory requirements, the DOE has established a general environmental protection policy. The Environmental Policy Statement (issued by then Secretary Herrington on January 8, 1986, and extended on January 7, 1987) describes the DOE's commitment to national environmental protection goals in that it conducts operations ''in an environmentally safe and sound manner... in compliance with the letter and spirit of applicable environmental statutes, regulations, and standards'' (DOE, 1986). This Environmental Policy Statement also states the DOE's commitment to ''good environmental management in all of its programs and at all of its facilities in order to correct existing environmental problems, to minimize risks to the environment or public health, and to anticipate and address potential environmental problems before they pose a threat {{to the quality of the}} environment or public welfare. '' Additionally, ''it is DOE's policy that efforts to meet environmental obligations be carried out consistently across all operations and among all field organizations and programs'' (DOE, 1986).

However, {{little or no}} {{attention has been given}} to the atrial arterial circulation during the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation techniques. Methods and Results-We examined the atrial arterial circulation in areas involved in AF ablation in 24 heart specimens by colored resin injection and careful dissection. The sinus node artery (SNA) arose from the circumflex artery in 42 % of case; proximal to the LA appendage in 29 %, crossing the left atrium (LA) anterior wall; and after the LA appendage in the remaining 13 %, crossing the mitral isthmus and passing close to the left pulmonary veins (PVs), the LA roof, and the right superior PV. In 58 %, the SNA arose from the right coronary artery. Major arteries (>= 1 mm in external diameter) were found in the mitral isthmus in 54 %, at the LA roof in 54 %, and at the LA anterior wall in 29 %.

Second, the garnet thin films are fully characterized using various magnetic and optical techniques. Novel optical techniques are suggested, that allow the local measurement of properties such as magnetostriction constants and magnetic anisotropy of garnets.

The pulmonary veins and left atrium were best visualized with CE- 3 D-tFLASH (scores 4. 50 +/- 0. 52 and 4. 59 +/- 0. 43) and ECG/breath-gated CE- 3 D-TrueFISP (4. 47 +/- 0. 49 and 4. 63 +/- 0. 39). Conspicuity of the oesophagus was optimal with CE- 3 D-TrueFISP and 2 D-TrueFISP (4. 59 +/- 0. 35 and 4. 19 +/- 0. 46) but poor with CE- 3 D-tFLASH (1. 03 +/- 0. 13) (p > 0. 05). Acquisition times were shorter for 2 D-TrueFISP (44 +/- 1 s) and CE- 3 D-tFLASH (345 +/- 113 s) compared with ECG/breath-gated 3 D-TrueFISP (634 +/- 197 s) and ECG/breath-gated CE- 3 D-TrueFISP (636 +/- 230 s) (p > 0. 05). In conclusion, an MR imaging protocol comprising CE- 3 D-tFLASH and 2 D-TrueFISP allows assessment of the pulmonary veins, left atrium and oesophagus in less than 7 min and can be recommended for pre-procedural imaging before <b>electric</b> <b>isolation</b> of pulmonary veins...|$|E
40|$|Pilhas a combustível de óxido sólido (PaCOS) são sistemas capazes de {{converter}} energia de uma reação química diretamente em energia elétrica de maneira limpa, silenciosa e se diferenciam das demais técnicas por ter todos os seus componentes no estado sólido. Suas configurações geométricas mais comuns são: a tubular e a planar. A geometria planar além dos componentes usuais (anodo, catodo e eletrólito) necessita de interconectores e selantes. E a busca por materiais adequados para esses componentes é atualmente o maior desafio encontrado para a produção das pilhas. Os selantes precisam apresentar estabilidade química em altas temperaturas, provocar isolamento elétrico e ter coeficiente de dilatação térmica compatível com os demais componentes. Por apresentarem essas características os materiais vitrocerâmicos são os mais recomendados para a aplicação. Neste trabalho fez-se o estudo da substituição parcial da Zr 02 pela Al 2 O 3 no sistema LZS visando a formação do sistema LZAS, isso com a adição 10, 20 e 30 % em massa de espodumênio natural. As composições foram fundidas a uma temperatura de 1500 °C e depois resfriadas rapidamente com o objetivo de continuarem amorfas. Cada composição foi moída para obtenção de um pó com diâmetro médio de aproximadamente 3 μm e caracterizada pelas técnicas de DRX, FRX, MEV, dilatometria e granulometria. Posteriormente as amostras foram preparadas por compactação e tratadas termicamente com temperaturas no intervalo entre 700 - 1000 °C, com patamar de 10 min e 1 h. As análises para as amostras tratadas foram: dilatometria, DRX, FRX, condutividade elétrica e aderência. Os resultados apontam para a viabilidade do sistema LZAS para uso como selante uma vez que apresentaram bons resultados como isolante elétrico, aderiram a um material com coeficiente de dilatação térmica (α) semelhante a dos componentes de uma PaCOS e apresentaram fases cristalinas estáveisCells {{the solid}} oxide fuel are systems capable to directly convert {{energy of a}} chemical reaction into electric energy in clean, quiet way and if its components in the solid state differentiate of excessively the techniques for having all. Its more common geometric configurations are: the tubular one and to glide. Geometry to glide beyond the usual components (anode, cathode and electrolyte) needs interconnect and sealant. E the search for materials adjusted for these components is currently the biggest challenge found {{for the production of}} the cells. The sealants need to present chemical stability in high temperatures, to provoke <b>electric</b> <b>isolation,</b> to have coefficient of compatible thermal expansion with the excessively component ones. For presenting these characteristics the glass-ceramics materials are recommended for the application. In this work the study of the partial substitution of the ZrO 2 for the Al 2 O 3 in system LZS became it aiming at the formation of system LZAS, this with the addition of natural spodumene with 10, 20 and 30 % in mass. The compositions had been casting to a temperature of 1500 °C and later quickly cooled with the objective to continue amorphous. Each composition was worn out for attainment of a dust with average diameter of approximately 3 μm and characterized by the techniques of DRX, FRX, MEV, dilatometric analysis and particle size analysis. Later the samples had been conformed and treated thermally with temperatures in the interval between 700 - 1000 °C, with platform of 10 minutes and 1 hour. The analyses for the treated samples had been: dilatometric analysis, DRX, FRX, electrical conductivity and tack. The results point with respect to the viability of the use of system LZAS for use as sealant a time that had presented good results as isolating electric, they had adhered to a material with similar α of the components of a SOFC and had presented steady crystalline phase...|$|E
