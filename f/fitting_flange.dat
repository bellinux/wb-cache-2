5000|$|<b>Flange</b> <b>fittings</b> are {{generally}} used for connections to valves, inline instruments or equipment nozzles. Two surfaces are joined tightly together with threaded bolts, wedges, clamps, or {{other means of}} applying high compressive force. Although a gasket, packing, or O-ring may be installed between the flanges to prevent leakage, it is sometimes possible to use only a special grease or nothing at all (if the mating surfaces are sufficiently precisely formed). Although <b>flange</b> <b>fittings</b> are bulky, they perform well in demanding applications such as large water supply networks and hydroelectric systems.|$|R

50|$|The {{faceplate}} may {{be attached}} to the lathe in several ways: the two most common are a thread and a precision cone arrangement or threaded studs and a circular recess <b>fitting</b> a <b>flange</b> {{on the end of the}} spindle. Increasingly common is the camlock arrangement where shaped studs and cams replace threaded studs for rapid exchanging of the faceplate with other accessories, such as three or four jaw chucks.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{materials}} used in aircraft industry beside the light specific weight, must respond to some specific requirements for creation of new materials and also {{the improvement of the}} material properties used in the present. In modern aircraft construction there are many casting pieces, such as props, <b>fittings,</b> <b>flanges,</b> handles, crossing tight bodies, etc. Casting alloys used are based on aluminum alloys, magnesium-lithium alloys, vanadium-aluminum alloys, titanium alloys, etc. Aluminum alloy, the ones which are light and have good physical and mechanical properties, are part of common {{materials used}} in producing some components found in aircraft technology. In terms of experimentally point of view, the application of different artificial ageing heat treatments leads to an improvement of the mechanical properties compared with the results registered by natural aging. Experimental researches made on samples of ATSi 6 Cu 4 Mn aluminum alloy artificially aged by unconventional heat treatments highlights the obtaining of improved mechanical properties, the results representing a very useful database {{under the terms of the}} data being properly recorded. The verification by a statistical test of the experimental data registration in a normal distribution represents in this case the necessary condition for the validation of the results...|$|R

Swan-neck tow balls are often removable to avoid the inconvenience of a tow ball protruding from the vehicle when not required. Some manufacturers are introducing retractable tow balls as an option.|$|R
5000|$|SAF 2205, {{also known}} as Sandvik SAF 2205, is a Sandvik-owned {{trademark}} for a 22Cr duplex (ferritic-austenitic) stainless steel. SAF derives from Sandvik Austenite Ferrite. The nominal chemical composition of SAF 2205 is 22% chromium, 5% nickel, 3.2% molybdenum and other alloying elements such as nitrogen and manganese. The UNS designation for SAF 2205 is S31803/S32205 and the EN steel no. is 1.4462. SAF 2205 or Duplex 2205 is often used {{as an alternative to}} expensive 904L stainless steel owing to similar properties but cheaper ingredients. Duplex stainless steel is available in multiple forms like bars, billets, pipes, tubes, sheets, plates and even processed to <b>fittings</b> and <b>flanges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ports are {{passages}} that allow fluid {{to pass through}} the valve. Ports are obstructed by the valve member or disc to control flow. Valves most commonly have 2 ports, but may have as many as 20. The valve is almost always connected at its ports to pipes or other components. Connection methods include threadings, compression <b>fittings,</b> glue, cement, <b>flanges,</b> or welding.|$|R

50|$|The extreme {{vibration}} in {{this location}} {{leads to a}} considerable load on the pulse generator bearing, which, with this method of installation has to carry not only the relatively small mass of the pulse generator shaft but that of the entire pulse generator. When we consider that bearing life reduces with at least the third power of the load {{we can see that}} a reliable and durable pulse generator for such a situation cannot merely be adapted from the more common standard pulse generator for outside-journal bogies merely by <b>fitting</b> and intermediate <b>flange</b> or similar construction. It really is necessary to have a pulse generator with a modified design adapted to the requirements of such a location.|$|R

25|$|It was {{believed}} that the leak was in the crossfeed flange area – a problem with associated seals. On 18 October 2010, after an afternoon review, engineers were asked to double-check the torque on six bolts around the suspected leaky <b>flange</b> <b>fitting</b> and tighten if necessary. Subsequent leak tests showed again signs of seepage, and the task of solving the issue required the draining of {{both the left and}} right OMS tanks of the shuttle and a unique in-situ repair at the pad to avoid a rollback. On 23 October 2010, engineers completed the removal and replacement of the two seals on the right OMS crossfeed flange, after the education (a vacuum-related procedure, used to completely clear the plumbing of the toxic MMH) of the plumbing was completed ahead of the schedule by over a day. Later, testing indicated that the new seals were properly seated and holding pressure with no signs of additional seepage. Normal pad operations commenced soon after allowing managers to press forward with the confirmation of a 1 November 2010 target launch date, with fuel reloading into the OMS tanks beginning on the morning of 24 October 2010.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether a single 7 / 8 ” nominal diameter stud bolt and nuts assembly would fail to perform its required function in a flange assembly when the nut was corroded. This work was undertaken to form a basis for further work in development of a Fitness-For-Service (FFS) assessment for corroded nuts. No current quantitative assessments exist for this area. A failure criterion was defined as a minimum 206. 8 MPa stress in the stud, based on the bolting requirements stated in ASME B 16. 5 - 2003 Pipe <b>Flanges</b> and <b>Flanges</b> <b>Fittings.</b> A simple test rig was manufactured for testing the compliance of the corroded nuts subjected to the 206. 8 MPa stress level and the corrosion was simulated by removing uniform layers of material from the surface of the nut. Finite Element Analysis (ANSYS 12. 0) was also performed to evaluate the test rig and to consider the interaction between the nut and stud at the thread roots. It was found that no failure occurred in the threading and that failure of the assembly only occurred when there was a > 60 % material loss from the nut. The failure mode experienced was deformation of the flange plate. This analysis proved that a nut can experience significant effective material loss without damaging the flange integrity...|$|R
40|$|In today's globalized economy, {{we cannot}} live without {{imported}} products. Most {{people do not}} realize how thin the safety net of regulation and inspection really is. Less than three percent of imported products receive any form of government inspection prior to sale. Avoid flea markets, street vendors and deep discount stores. The sellers of counterfeit wares know where to market their products. They look for individuals who are hungry for a brand name item but {{do not want to}} pay a brand name price for it. The internet provides anonymity to the sellers of counterfeit products. Unlike Europe, U. S. law does not hold internet-marketing organizations, responsible for the quality of the products sold on their websites. These organizations will remove an individual vendor when a sufficient number of complaints are lodged, but they will not take responsibility for the counterfeit products you may have purchased. EBay has a number of counterfeit product guides to help you avoid being a victim of the sellers of these products. Ten percent of all medications taken worldwide are counterfeit. If you do buy medications on-line, be sure that the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites (VIPPS) recommends the pharmacy you choose to use. Inspect all medication purchases and report any change in color, shape, imprinting or odor to your pharmacist. If you take generic medications these attributes may change from one manufacturer to another. Your pharmacist should inform you of any changes when you refill your prescription. If they do not, get clarification prior to taking the medication. Please note that the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate supplements. The FDA only steps in when a specific supplement proves to cause physical harm or contains a regulated ingredient. Due to counterfeiting, Underwriters Laboratories (UL) changed their label design three times since 1996. The new gold label should be attached to the cord or body of most office and home electrical products (please see the picture to the left). Holiday lights may have the UL marking in red or green instead of the universal black. A red UL mark indicates the product is approved for outdoor as well as indoor service. The green UL mark indicates the product is only to be used indoors. A small number of home electrical products may bear an Interteck (ETL) approval. This label is also acceptable. An Interteck label includes black print on a white background bearing the circular ETL logo. Most manufacturers are proud of their products and strive to gain name recognition as well as foster repeat business. This is not true of counterfeiters. The very first thing most counterfeiters try to do is make their products untraceable. Their products may bear the nation of origin but that is all. This is a common practice with metal components such as pipe <b>fittings</b> and <b>flanges.</b> This is also true of hoisting and rigging equipment such as shackles, turnbuckles and chain. Sadly, this has also occurred with the purchase of some safety equipment such as arc-flash retardant coveralls. Learn the national standards associated with products you are purchasing. Clearly specify these requirements on the procurements you make...|$|R
