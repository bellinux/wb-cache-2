5|$|Tintin and I (2003), a {{documentary}} by Danish director Anders Høgsbro Østergaard based on Numa Sadoul's 1971 interview with Hergé, includes restored {{portions of the}} interview that Hergé had heavily edited and rewritten in Sadoul's book.

5|$|Born in Sydney on 7 November 1944, Windle {{grew up in}} {{the eastern}} Sydney suburb of Waverley. Windle and his sister Norma learnt to swim at nearby Bronte Beach. His family later {{relocated}} to Bexley North, and he swam for his school team at Marist College Kogarah. Windle was coached by Frank Guthrie at the Enfield pool from the age of 12. After a fortnight of training, he entered the district age group championships and won a place in the top three. From then on, he began training {{three or four times a}} week, and his father <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Enfield for morning training. By the age of 15, he was training every day.|$|E

50|$|His job <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> close <b>to</b> {{a mental}} breakdown. On 21 November 1905 twenty-five Azeris were shot by Armenians in Tiflis. Illarion was so desperate he gave 500 guns to the Mensheviks {{to keep the}} peace.|$|R
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of the}} self, and his conscience <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|Since his death, {{multiple}} {{people have}} been arrested for helping Clemmons {{during and after the}} Lakewood shooting. Authorities claim the accomplices misled police about his whereabouts, gave him cell phones and money, applied first aid to his gunshot wounds and tried to help him leave the state. Among those arrested were Clemmons' sister, who bandaged his wounds and provided him transportation. Authorities arrested five other people for assisting Clemmons: Letricia Nelson, Quiana Williams, Douglas Davis, Eddie Davis, and Ricky Hinton. Darcus Allen {{was arrested and charged with}} aggravated first-degree murder for his alleged role as Clemmons' getaway driver. Allen claims he did not know Clemmons' plans when he <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the coffee shop, but authorities argued he had known for days that Clemmons planned to murder police officers.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{approaches}} Alistair as {{a fellow}} man of science, who is replacing components that form a time machine that he has constructed within his body. Walter professes that Alistair's attempt to jump back several months would require {{a great deal more}} power than Alistair has predicted, possibly killing hundreds in the area near where he appears. Alistair, aware of this, recalls an empty field where he was at, a few blocks from where his fiancée died, and plans to use this field where only the vegetation will die out from his arrival. Walter tells Alistair how to correct the mistake that caused him to jump to the train but warns him of the other consequences that changing events will bring, explaining that stealing Peter from the parallel universe has left him wracked with regret. Despite being a man of science, Walter's torment over the years <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> believe in a higher power, and he hopes for a sign of God's forgiveness—and thus, eventually, Peter's—in the form of a white tulip.|$|E
50|$|Lang was unimpressed {{with the}} motel property, so, {{according}} to Tiber's account, {{he told him}} about Yasgur's farm, which was located nearby, and <b>drove</b> with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> meet with Yasgur.|$|R

25|$|Wong filmed more {{newsreels}} covering Japanese {{attacks in}} China, including the Battle of Xuzhou in May 1938 and aerial bombings in Guangzhou in June.

50|$|To {{retrieve}} this disaster, Mahmud {{set about}} preparing another army, {{and four years}} later, on 11-12 October 1446 A.D. he went towards Mandalgarh with a large army.

25|$|In 1994, {{the writer}} Jablow Hershman and the {{psychiatrist}} Julian Lieb published their joint book A Brotherhood of Tyrants. Based on known Hitler biographies, they developed {{the hypothesis that}} Hitler – just like Napoleon Bonaparte and Stalin – had bipolar disorder, which <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> enter politics and become a dictator.|$|E
25|$|Michael Ryan {{was found}} lying to clients about the {{progress}} of their cases. Ryan was put to the Discipline Committee of the Law Society of New Brunswick. In his defence he argued that {{he was suffering from}} psychological and health problems which <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> his actions. The committee disbarred him.|$|E
25|$|Livy and Cicero's {{version of}} the Dream of Scipio, which are rebuilt in the poem, {{complement}} each other and are sources of the Africa.

50|$|On his {{way back}} to the Continent, a violent storm <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> back <b>to</b> the English coast.

25|$|In December 2013, Farah was {{the second}} {{favourite}} sportsperson behind Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray to become the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

25|$|In {{his trial}} Gómez-García {{claimed that he}} only wanted to scare the {{officers}}, but the arresting officers and his ex-girlfriend testified that he was proud to have murdered Officer Young.

25|$|In 1986 {{he founded}} Shooto, finally realizing {{his dream of}} {{becoming}} a martial arts trainer. He taught the art of shooting to fighters like Yorinaga Nakamura, Yuki Nakai and Rumina Sato, among others. During this time Sayama hosted the Vale Tudo Japan event, leading to the introduction of Brazilian jiu-jitsu in Japan, which <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> change the rules of Shooto to adapt them to the vale tudo. In 1996 he left Shooto due to disagreements with the board of directors, and was sucedeed by Taro Wakayabayshi.|$|E

He is not mentioned thereafter in the Bible.|$|R
25|$|On February 7, 1997, Gregory Bruce Owen (born March 17, 1971) hid {{near the}} couple's home in Auburn.

25|$|On March 5, 1966, Speck {{bought a}} 12-year-old car. The {{following}} evening, he burglarized a grocery store, stole 70 cartons of cigarettes, sold {{them out of}} the trunk of his car in the grocery store's parking lot, and then abandoned the car. The police traced the car to Speck and issued a warrant for his arrest for burglary on March 8. An arrest, his 42nd in Dallas, would mean another prison term, so on March 9, 1966, Speck's sister Carolyn <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the Dallas bus depot, where he caught a bus to Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
5000|$|In 1639 Rogers succeeded Randolph Jewett as organist of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin.

Occupied with composition and teaching, Rogers maintained himself, {{with the help of}} a small government allowance, in the neighbourhood of Windsor.|$|R
6000|$|Raleigh {{knows that}} the {{handwriting}} is there. The spirit which <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> forth <b>to</b> Virginia and Guiana is fallen asleep: but he longs for Sherborne and quiet country life, and escapes thither during Essex's imprisonment, taking Cecil's son with him, and writes as only he can write about the shepherd's peaceful joys, contrasted with 'courts' and 'masques' and 'proud towers' - ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{he took a}} {{step towards}} me, but again the nozzle of my pistol <b>drove</b> <b>him</b> back. <b>To</b> have pistoled <b>him</b> there and then as he {{deserved}} would have brought the household about my ears, and that would have defeated my object. To have fallen upon him and slain him with silent steel would have equally embarrassed me, as you shall understand anon.|$|R
