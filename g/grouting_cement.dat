40|$|Fixation, barriers, and {{containment}} of existing landfills and other disposal areas are often performed by in-situ auger type soil mixing and jet <b>grouting.</b> <b>Cement</b> or other chemical reagents {{are mixed with}} soil to form both vertical and horizontal barriers. Immobilization of contaminants can be economically achieved by mixing soil and the contaminants with reagents that solidify or stabilize the contaminated area. Developed in Japan, and relatively new to the United States, the first large scale application was for a vertical barrier at the Jackson Lake Dam project in 1986. This technology has grown in both the civil and environmental field since. The paper describes current United States practice for Deep Soil Mixing (over 12 meters in depth), and Shallow Soil Mixing for vertical barriers and stabilization/solidification, and Jet Grouting for horizontal and vertical barriers. Creating very low permeability barriers at depth with minimal surface return often makes these techniques economical when compared to slurry trenches.

40|$|Disintegrator {{technology}} was {{widely used in}} the construction industry and in the oil and gas industry. In the process of drilling wells, powdery materials are used, the quality of which often determines the results of the well construction as an engineering structure. The application of disintegrator technology in the processing of clay powders which are one of the main components used to produce washing liquids has shown the high efficiency of this technology. One of the main multi-tonnage materials used in the construction of deep wells for oil and gas is Portland cement. However, the specific conditions of the well and work performance technology establish additional requirements for both <b>grouting</b> <b>cement</b> and also mortar and stone which are obtained from this binder. That refers to high water-cement ratios, rigid frames for density, water loss, sedimentation stability of solutions, high strength and low permeability of the stone. High corrosive activity of reservoir fluids and high temperatures, which often exceeds 100 – 150 о C, set increased requirements to corrosion and thermal resistance of hardening products. The use of modifying additives and mechanoactivation of cements and grouting mixtures allows us to effectively solve these problems. The results of the study how mechanochemical activation of siliceous additives effects on the structure of their surfaces are presented and the increase in the rate of interaction of silica with calcium hydroxide, which is necessary for increasing the life of a plugging stone, is experimentally proven.

In particular, during cement carbonation from {{the mixing of}} brine/saline water and CO 2, {{the maintenance of the}} long-term mechanical and geochemical stability of well <b>grouting</b> <b>cement</b> is considered as a very important investigation component. For the investigation of the long-term stability, we attempted to investigate the degree of reactivity with carbon dioxide and the change of the material properties along with the mass mixing ratio between cement (API G class) and flyash. We also attempted to identify the relationship between the geochemical composition and property changes. The applied reaction durations between cement and carbon dioxide in this study were 1, 10, and 100 days, but the 1 -day and 10 -day samples were not considered in this study. To investigate the cement material changes of the samples, the porosity, uniaxial compressional strength and tensile strength of each cement sample were measured. The applied mixing percentages of the flyash were in the range of 0 ∼ 35 %. Before the reaction, the porosity range of the original cement sample was in the range of 20. 61 ∼ 26. 67 %. The porosity of the cement sample shows a positive correlation with the mixing percentage of the flyash and water. Regarding the uniaxial compressional strength, it was noted that the correlation between the mass percentage of the flyash and the uniaxial compressional strength is negative (53 ∼ 78 MPa). However, we did not find a significant correlation between the flyash percentage and the tensile strength. We also attempted to identify the geochemical composition changes in cement samples, reacted with carbon dioxide via XRD and FE-SEM. We plan to conduct an additional examination of the 100 - day sample. Based on the XRD results, a relative quantitative analysis of cement carbonation is planned to be applied to the quantification of the geochemical composition of the cement samples. After the quantitative analysis, the correlation between the material property changes and the cement compositions can be investigated. The carbonation rates of KS type-I samples are much higher than those of the G class sample, and the change in the mechanical strength is in agreement with the carbonation rate. In contrast, the permeability levels after the reaction are 6. 5 ∼ 16. 2 times higher. It is thought that the disagreement between the mechanical properties and permeability is caused by the crack on the sample surface after the reaction...|$|E

In the present study the rheological characterization of <b>cement</b> <b>grout</b> with water/binder ratio (W/B) is fixed at 0. 5. The effect of the replacement of cement by bentonite (2 to 10 % wt) in presence of superplasticizer (0. 5 % wt) was investigated.
