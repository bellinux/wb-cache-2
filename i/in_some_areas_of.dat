5|$|According to Hobsbawm, the Fasci were a {{prime example}} of {{primitive}} agrarian movement that became modern by aligning itself with socialism and communism. Many of its leaders continued in the Socialist Party and continued the struggle for land rights and land reform once they were released. Despite the 1894 defeat, permanent movements were set up <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> Sicily using modern socialist models of organisation.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt {{is prohibited}} altogether {{except on the}} highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate {{at the sides of}} the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E

5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland was {{subjected}} to glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch.

5|$|Epilepsy is a {{group of}} {{neurological}} disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the world experience stigma due to the condition.|$|E
5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around {{half of those}} who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone. This vaginal ring appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is currently available <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 and 2007, a {{team from}} the University of West Bohemia, {{together}} with Salahaddin University in Arbil, carried out an extensive survey and evaluation of the entire citadel. As part of this project, geodetic measurements of the citadel were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create a map and digital 3D model of the citadel mound and the houses on top of it. Geophysical prospection was carried out <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the citadel to detect traces of older architecture buried under the present houses. Archaeological investigations included an archaeological survey on the western slope of the citadel mound, and the excavation of a small test trench {{in the eastern part}} of the citadel.|$|E

5|$|Invasive plants include {{fountain}} grass, tamarisk, Malta starthistle, {{and many}} others, but {{by far the}} most severe threat to the native ecosystem is buffelgrass. This drought-tolerant plant, native to parts of Africa and Asia, was imported to the United States in the 1930s and planted near Tucson and elsewhere to create cattle forage and to control erosion. First detected in the park in 1989, it has dispersed widely in both districts. Competing with other plants for sustenance, buffelgrass fills the empty spaces normally found between native desert plants and creates a significant fire hazard. The noxious weed, considered impossible to completely eliminate, is managed <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the park and in Tucson residential zones by hand-pulling and, during periods of wet weather, application of glyphosate-based herbicides.|$|E
5|$|Most common ravens prefer wooded {{areas with}} large expanses of open land nearby, or coastal regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> dense human population, such as California in the United States, they take {{advantage}} of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers. On coasts, individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs. Common ravens are often located in coastal regions because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources. Also, coastal regions have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Some Hydnellum {{species have}} been shown to be in decline in Europe, {{including}} the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Norway, and Scotland. In the United Kingdom, several are listed in the biodiversity action plan for stiped hydnoid fungi: H. aurantiacum is classified as critically endangered; H. caeruleum, H. ferrugineum are listed as endangered, while H. concrescens, H. spongiosipes, H. peckii, and H. scrobiculatum are considered vulnerable. H. ferrugineum and H. peckii are sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a forestry practice used <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{governors}} of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware declared states of emergency. Isabel {{was the first}} major hurricane to threaten the Mid-Atlantic States and the Upper South since Hurricane Floyd in September 1999. Isabel's greatest effect was due to flood damage, the worst <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> Virginia since 1972's Hurricane Agnes. More than 60million people were affected to some degree—a similar number to Floyd but more than any other hurricane in recent memory.|$|E

When the green and golden bell frog was found there, the tennis courts were built elsewhere, and the population has since been monitored. This frog has become an unofficial mascot for the Homebush Bay area. It has also been introduced to places in Sydney in its natural habitat, without much success.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} accent and/or dialect spoken by natives {{throughout}} Texas is {{sometimes referred to}} as Texan English, which itself is a sub-variety of a broader category of American English known as Southern American English.

5|$|Ultimately, the Marine Corps {{determined}} that the 37mm gun of the M2s and M3s was not powerful enough to defeat Japanese bunkers, and so they would be replaced with tanks armed with 75mm guns.
