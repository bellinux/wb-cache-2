40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} cardiovascular {{recovery and}} examine the possible relationship of vagal activity and reflexes to risk for heart disease. Methods: Subjects performed cold pressor and mental arithmetic tasks. <b>Heart</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>heart</b> period <b>variability,</b> and pre-ejection period were obtained for 1 minute before, during, and after each task (Experiment 1). In the second experiment, subjects performed a Stroop color-word task and a mental arithmetic task. <b>Heart</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>heart</b> period <b>variability,</b> blood pressure, and baroreflex sensitivity were obtained during the 5 -minute baseline, task, and recovery periods (Experiment 2). Results: In Experiment 1, <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> during recovery was lower than baseline despite continued pre-ejection period shortening, whereas recovery heart period variability was higher than baseline. In Experiment 2, blood pressure increased throughout the session. However, recovery <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> after mental arithmetic was lower than baseline <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> and <b>heart</b> period <b>variability</b> was higher during both recovery periods than during baseline. Vagal rebound, {{a sharp increase in}} variability in the first minute of recovery, was reduced in men in Experiment 1 and in individuals with a family history of cardiovascular disease in Experiment 2 and was associated with degree of change in baroreflex sensitivity between task and rest. Conclusions: Cardiovascular recovery from stress is associated with increased vagal modulation despite residual sympathetic activation. Vagal rebound may be involved in mechanisms resetting the baroreflex sensitivity at the onset and offset of stress.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{which is}} associated with altered neuroplasticity and increased relative cardiac sympathic activity, enhances the risk of cardiovascular pathologies. Interaction between cardiac sympatho-vagal indexes and delta sleep power is probably altered in MDD. METHOD: Sleep characteristics and cardiac sympatho-vagal indexes of 10 depressive patients were compared to 10 control men across the first three non-rapid eye movement (NREM) -REM cycles. Interaction between normalized high frequency (HF) and delta power bands was studied using coherence analysis. RESULTS: Patients showed increased sleep latency, stage 1 and wake durations. No differences in <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> <b>variabilities</b> were observed: Total power, HF and RR-interval decreased from NREM to REM sleep and wakefulness in both groups. Gain value was lower in patients while coherence and phase shift were similar between groups. Modifications in HF appear 8 min before modifications in delta. CONCLUSION: Major depressive disorder is related to an altered link between cardiac vagal influence and delta sleep, suggesting disorders in cardiovascular controls and an altered neuroplasticity.

In this paper, we propose a principal-component-regression- (PCR-) based method for estimating RT variability. The main benefit of the method {{is that it does not}} necessitate T-wave detection. The proposed method is compared with traditional RT interval measures, and as a result, it is observed to estimate RT variability accurately and to be less sensitive to noise than the traditional methods. As a specific application, the method is applied to exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings.|$|R
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, causing disabling symptoms, risk of thromboembolic events and increased mortality. Some patients with AF are asymptomatic, but to what extent these patients differ from patients with symptoms is unclear. Electric cardioversion mostly restores sinus rhythm, but recurrence of AF is frequent, even with the use of antiarrhythmics. Considering the drugrelated side effects and the risk of proarrhythmias with antiarrhythmic treatment, more knowledge about clinical factors predicting successful electric cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion, as well as new alternative treatments, is necessary. Magnesium (Mg) is the second most common intracellular cation. Mg has a decisive role in the maintenance of the Na, K and Ca gradient across the cell membrane and thereby for the resting potential of the cell. Electrophysiological effects have been shown after intravenous administration of Mg, and Mg has shown efficacy in the treatment of ventricular and supraventricular tachycardias. The main purpose of the present studies was to investigate: the prevalence of symptoms and left ventricular dysfunction, predictive factors for successful electric cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion, and, the effect of Mg on <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>rate</b> <b>variability</b> and its effect as a prophylactic agent in order to reduce recurrence of AF after cardioversion, in patients with AF. The prevalence of symptoms and left ventricular dysfunction was investigated in 280 patients with persistent AF, duration > 2 months. A careful history of symptoms, clinical investigation, echocardiographic assay and 24 hours ECG was performed in all patients. 189 patients (68 %) had symptoms that could be related to the arrhythmia, 91 patients (32 %) were asymptomatic. Symptoms of irregular pulse, rapid palpitations or congestive heart failure were reported in 30 %, 35 % and 91 % of the symptomatic patients, respectively. In logistic regression analysis, including data from clinical, echocardiograpic and 24 hours ECG examination, the only independent predictor of symptoms was the presence of valvular heart disease. Left ventricular dysfunction (EF < 40 %) was observed, in 56 patients (23 %). Presence of male gender, ischemic heart disease, higher mean <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and an increased LVED were independently associated with impaired left ventricular function. Clinical factors predicting successful cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm were evaluated in 166 patients with persistent AF elected to their first cardioversion. Independent predictors of successful elective electric cardioversion were; short duration of AF and low weight. Short duration of AF, treatment with [beta]-blockers or calcium antagonists and right atrial area/dimension (adjusted for BSA) were independent predictors for maintenance of sinus rhythm. Patients with unknown duration were comparable to patients with known duration regarding successful elective electric cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm. THe effect of intravenous Mg, two different doses (10 mmol and 16 mmol), on <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>rate</b> <b>variability</b> was studied in 30 patients with chronic AF, in a double blind placebo controlled fashion. Intravenous Mg showed no effect on <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> or <b>rate</b> <b>variability,</b> and therefore seems to have no clinically relevant effects on the atrioventricular conduction in patients with chronic AF. Intraindividual variation of <b>rate</b> <b>variability</b> over time was low. The effect of orally given Mg, as a prophylactic treatment {{in order to reduce the}} recurrence of AF after elective electrical cardioversion, was evaluated in two studies. Oral Mg (20, 6 mmol daily) or placebo was given to A) 170 patients with persistent AF elected to their first cardioversion without concomitant antiarrhythmics. B) 131 patients with recurrence of persistent AF after elective electrical cardioversion, as an adjuvant to sotalol. No influence on the recurrence rate of AF was seen with either of the treatments. In conclusion, the presence of valvular heart disease is an independent factor predicting symptoms in patients with persistent AF, with a prevalence of asymptomatic patients of approximately 30 %. Approximately 20 % of patients with persistent AF have left ventricular dysfunction, and, male gender, a higher <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and presence of ischemic heart disease is more likely to occur among these patients. In patients with persistent AF elected to their first cardioversion, only short duration of AF and low weight are independent predictors of successful elective electric cardioversion. Short duration of AF, treatment with [beta]-blockers or calcium. antagonists and right atrial area/dimension (adjusted for BSA) are independent predictors for maintenance of sinus rhythm. In patients with chronic AF, intraindividual variation of <b>rate</b> <b>variability</b> over time is low. Intravenous Mg has no effect on <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> or <b>rate</b> <b>variability.</b> Oral treatment with Mg alone, or as an adjuvant to sotalol, does not influence the recurrence rate of AF after elective cardioversion of patients with persistent AF...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background We {{investigated}} {{the association between}} <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and its <b>variability</b> with the parameters that assess vascular, renal and cardiac target organ damage. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed including a consecutive sample of 360 hypertensive patients without <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> lowering drugs (aged 56 ± 11 years, 64. 2 % male). <b>Heart</b> <b>rate</b> (HR) and its standard deviation (HRV) in clinical and 24 -hour ambulatory monitoring were evaluated. Renal damage was assessed by glomerular filtration rate and albumin/creatinine ratio; vascular damage by carotid intima-media thickness and ankle/brachial index; and cardiac damage by the Cornell voltage-duration product and left ventricular mass index. Results There was {{a positive correlation between}} ambulatory, but not clinical, <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and its standard deviation with glomerular filtration rate, and a negative correlation with carotid intima-media thickness, and night/day ratio of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. There was no correlation with albumin/creatinine ratio, ankle/brachial index, Cornell voltage-duration product or left ventricular mass index. In the multiple linear regression analysis, after adjusting for age, the association of glomerular filtration rate and intima-media thickness with ambulatory <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and its standard deviation was lost. According to the logistic regression analysis, the predictors of any target organ damage were age (OR = 1. 034 and 1. 033) and night/day systolic blood pressure ratio (OR = 1. 425 and 1. 512). Neither 24 HR nor 24 HRV reached statistical significance. Conclusions High ambulatory <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and its <b>variability,</b> but not clinical HR, are associated with decreased carotid intima-media thickness and a higher glomerular filtration rate, although this is lost after adjusting for age.
