40|$|Abstract. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a {{material}} or a structure {{is derived from}} fatigue tests of standard specimens. However, many researches have reported that test results of standard specimens {{are very different from}} those of real structures or components. One reason for this difference is the constraint effects according to the geometrical difference. Therefore, to calculate more accurate fatigue life, the constraint effect must be considered by comparing test results of standard specimens with those of real structures or components. Another reason for this difference is the surface condition. All surfaces of a standard specimen are polished to obtain similar conditions in a fatigue test. However, in a piping system, surface conditions of components are different from each other and very different from that of a standard specimen. Because fatigue life is effected by a surface condition, to evaluate the fatigue life of a piping system, fatigue tests must be conducted with a specimen extracted from a pipe with the same surface condition. The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the <b>fatigue</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a real waterworks pipe by conducting fatigue tests with standard specimens and non-standard specimens of base metal and weld metal. Standard fatigue specimens and non-standard specimens were extracted from a steel pipe used in waterworks. Also, fatigue tests of pipes used in water service were carried out and then compared with those of standard specimens and non-standard specimens. From these results the relation between the S-N diagram of a specimen and that of a pipe specimen was evaluated...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the <b>fatiguing</b> <b>characteristics</b> of muscle-tendon units (MTUs) within skeletal muscles during static isometric contraction tasks. The deltoid {{was selected as the}} target muscle and three head-related static isometric contraction tasks were designed to activate three heads of the deltoid in different modes. Nine male subjects participated in this study. Surface electromyography (SEMG) signals were collected synchronously from the three heads of the deltoid. The performances of five SEMG parameters, including root mean square (RMS), mean power frequency (MPF), the first coefficient of autoregressive model (ARC 1), sample entropy (SE) and Higuchi’s fractal dimension (HFD), in quantification of fatigue, were evaluated in terms of sensitivity to variability ratio (SVR) and consistency firstly. Then, the HFD parameter was selected as the fatigue index for further muscle fatigue analysis. The experimental results demonstrated that the three deltoid heads presented different activation modes during three head-related fatiguing contractions. The <b>fatiguing</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the three heads were found to be task-dependent, and the heads kept in a relatively high activation level were more prone to fatigue. In addition, the differences in fatiguing rate between heads increased with the increase in load. The findings of this study can be helpful in better understanding the underlying neuromuscular control strategies of the central nervous system (CNS). Based on the results of this study, the CNS was thought to control the contraction of the deltoid by taking the three heads as functional units, but a certain synergy among heads might also exist to accomplish a contraction task...|$|R
