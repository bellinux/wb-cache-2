After the recognition of <b>impairment</b> <b>losses,</b> ROA was improved. That time-series movement is consistent with the conventional view. However, profit margin did not change in such a clear manner. Although, some firms with <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> smoothed earnings, we can find only weak evidence on earnings increasing management. On the other hand, we detect the strong evidence of "big bath" accounting. Our results imply the defects in accounting standards of impaired assets, which permits the large room of managerial discretion. ...|$|R

The results of the research show {{an increase in the number}} of companies which disclosed <b>impairment</b> <b>losses,</b> as well as an increase in the value of <b>impairment</b> <b>losses,</b> in which the <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> of accounts receivable constitute the largest part in the structure of impaired assets...|$|R

50|$|The {{difference}} between the price paid (consideration) for the business combination and the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired represents goodwill (IFRS3.41). Goodwill {{is not subject to}} amortization, but is assessed for impairment at least annually (IAS36.10). <b>Impairment</b> <b>loss,</b> if any, is charged to the income statement (IAS36.60). Such losses are not subsequently reversed (IAS36.124).|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{deducting}} {{the value}} of goodwill annually {{over a period of}} maximal 40 years, companies are now required to determine the fair value of the reporting units, using present value of future cash flow, and compare it to their carrying value (book value of assets plus goodwill minus liabilities.) If the fair value is less than carrying value (impaired), the goodwill value needs to be reduced so the carrying value is equal to the fair value. The <b>impairment</b> <b>loss</b> is reported as a separate line item on the income statement, and new adjusted value of goodwill is reported in the balance sheet.|$|E

40|$|Research Objective The {{objective}} of the research {{is to find out}} how well EU area listed firms comply with the requirements of goodwill impairment testing mandated by the IFRS 3 and IAS 36 standards. More specifically, the hypothesized relationship between recorded goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> and future operational cash flows is being examined. An attempt is made to study how recorded goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> are linked to underlying economics. Sample Data and Research Methods Sample data consists of financial and earnings data for EU area listed companies during years 2006 - 2008. Sample data is gathered from Thomson One Banker Worldscope and Datastream databases. The utilized research methods are descriptive analysis and regression analysis. Results The results of the estimated regression model show that recorded goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> are not fully associated with underlying economics. Weak evidence was found suggesting that EU area firms might be managing fair value estimates when conducting goodwill impairment testing. Possible explanations for the missing association between recorded goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> and underlying economics are untimely recording of goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>losses,</b> challenges in <b>impairment</b> testing due to global financial crisis and earnings management. Following possible motives are identified for managing fair value estimates when conducting goodwill impairment testing: income smoothing, big bath –theory, signaling effect, meeting the covenant requirements, utilizing tax shield and unrealized expected synergy benefits...|$|R
40|$|We {{conduct an}} {{experiment}} to investigate how regulatory requirements in the accounting for impairment, namely, reversibility of <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> and disclosure of impairment assumptions, influence managers’ {{bias in the}} processing of impairment information. Our results show that regulatory requirements influence managers’ information evaluation bias but not their bias in the search process. We find that managers’ evaluation of impairment information is not biased when <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> are reversible. When <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> are not reversible, the direction of bias depends on whether managers are required to make a full or partial disclosure of the impairment assumptions. When managers are required to disclose all assumptions regardless of their impairment decisions, managers tend to exhibit favorable evaluation of positive information about the asset and unfavorable evaluation of negative information about the asset. However, when managers are required to disclose assumptions only when <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> are recognized, a reverse behavior is observed, with managers being more prone to evaluate negative information favorably. Despite the significant information bias, we do not find a link between information bias and managers’ decisions to recognize impairment. Future research involving more experienced managers will investigate this issue...|$|R
50|$|Under an {{expected}} loss impairment model, estimates of future cash flows {{used to determine}} the present value of the investment are made on a continuous basis and do not rely on a triggering event to occur. Even though there may be no objective evidence that an <b>impairment</b> <b>loss</b> has been incurred, revised cash flow projections may indicate changes in credit risk. Under the expected loss model, these revised expected cash flows are discounted at the same effective interest rate used when the instrument was first acquired, therefore retaining a cost-based measurement. Calculating the Impairment cost {{is the same as the}} Incurred Loss Model.|$|E
50|$|According to U.S. {{accounting}} rules (US GAAP), {{the value of}} an asset is impaired when the sum of estimated future cash flow from that asset is less than the book value of the asset. At this point an <b>impairment</b> <b>loss</b> should be recognized, which is done by taking the difference between the fair market value and the book value and recording this amount as the loss. This basically records the asset as if it were being acquired brand new at its fair market value, recording this as its new book value. This is a common occurrence for goodwill where a company will purchase another company for more than the value of the net assets of the target company. Under US GAAP, goodwill is tested annually for impairment.|$|E
50|$|Intangible {{assets are}} {{typically}} expensed {{according to their}} respective life expectancy. Intangible assets have either an identifiable or indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic or legal life, whichever is shorter. Examples of intangible assets with identifiable useful lives include copyrights and patents. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reassessed each year for impairment. If an impairment has occurred, then a loss must be recognized. An <b>impairment</b> <b>loss</b> is determined by subtracting the asset's fair value from the asset's book/carrying value. Trademarks and goodwill are examples of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Goodwill has {{to be tested for}} impairment rather than amortized. If impaired, goodwill is reduced and loss is recognized in the Income statement.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{factors that influence}} managers? choice to recognize goodwill impairment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (SFAS 142). The debate surrounding SFAS 142 ?s effectiveness centered on whether the managerial discretion allowed by the standard could lead to biased decisions in managers? determination of goodwill impairment. I use a conditional logistic regression to compare 130 firms that did recognize the existing <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> (write-off firms) to a control sample of 130 matching firms that did not recognize the existing <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> (no write-off firms). I find that the likelihood of recognizing the existing <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> significantly decreases when the managers have sizable holdings of in-the-money stock options. On the other hand, the likelihood of recognizing the existing <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> significantly increases when firms have stronger corporate governance, as measured by percentage of outside directors, percentage of outside directors? ownership, number of busy directors, and separation of CEO and Chair titles. Additionally, I find that during the period {{leading up to the}} SFAS 142 write-off, there have been more favorable changes in corporate governance structures of the writeoff firms, compared to that of no write-off firms. These favorable changes in governance structures occurred to a greater extent in firms that have delayed the recognition of existing <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> to the sample period compared to the firms that have been recognizing the write-offs on a timely basis. These results are consistent with the notion that favorable changes in corporate governance induce firms to take SFAS 142 <b>impairment</b> <b>losses,</b> which managers have avoided taking in the prior period. Overall, the results imply that managerial incentives do affect the implementation of standards that expand managerial discretion and highlight the importance of corporate boards in the monitoring of discretion allowed by such standards...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} causes and consequences of the goodwill reporting choices made by Canadian firms following the adoption of revised standards on purchased goodwill in 2002. Standard setters believed that by forcing firms to test goodwill for impairment every year, its economic value would be better reflected on the balance sheet, and its reliability and relevance improved. However, critics were worried that the fair value could not be measured reliably enough to warrant the move towards an impairment-only approach, {{they were concerned about}} the potential for management interpretation and bias, and they doubted that goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> would provide timely information to market participants. The empirical analyses contained in this dissertation are motivated by this debate. First, the dissertation shows that transitional goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> are associated with managers' incentives to both overstate and understate them, after controlling for economic impairment. Furthermore, independent board of directors and audit committees act as a constraint on Canadian managers' transitional goodwill reporting choices to ensure that the economic value of goodwill is better reflected in financial statements. Second, it is shown that investors perceive goodwill as an asset, and goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> as sufficiently reliable measurements of a reduction in the value of goodwill to incorporate them in their valuation assessments. Lower valuation weights are put on transitional goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> reported by firms with an independent board of directors while a higher valuation weight is put on transitional goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> recorded by firms with market value of equity lower than book value. Finally, the dissertation shows that transitional goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>losses</b> were impounded in stock prices prior to the adoption of SFAS 142 /Section 3062. Overall, the empirical evidence contained in the dissertation is consistent with SFAS 142 /Section 3062 improving the quality of the financial information on goodwill provided in the financial statements...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{international}} {{accounting standard}} regarding goodwill gives opportunities to several accounting procedure choices, as goodwill is a complex, intangible asset. The valuation of goodwill affects equity/asset ratio and income statement, which gives that the stakeholders’ impression of the group’s financial statement {{is affected by the}} valuation of this asset. It has been pointed out that difficult economic times bring <b>impairment</b> <b>loss</b> to the fore. During financial crisis, equity/asset ratio may be significant as the economy of the groups is expected to be strained. Purpose: The purpose of this essay is to explain the appearance of the possible relationship between a group’s <b>impairment</b> <b>loss</b> for goodwill and their equity/asset ratio, during financial straits. Watts and Zimmerman’s debt/equity hypothesis serve as the starting point for our study. This hypothesis expresses, ceteris paribus, that the larger debt/equity ratio, {{the more likely it is}} to select accounting procedures that shift reported earnings from future periods to the current period. According to the hypothesis there should be a positive relationship between a group’s equity/asset ratio and their percentage share of goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>loss.</b> A high equity/asset ratio would motivate a higher <b>impairment</b> <b>loss</b> for goodwill, as a lower equity/asset ratio would induce a lower <b>impairment</b> <b>loss.</b> Method: We decided to investigate all groups with the parent company listed on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm within the sectors financials and industrials. In financials, banks were excluded. The data was collected from annual reports of 2008 and was analyzed with the statistical analyzing methods correlation and regression. Result/conclusion: For those industrial groups which have had <b>impairment</b> <b>loss</b> for goodwill, the result is in accordance with Watts and Zimmerman’s hypothesis. A strong positive linear relationship could be found for those groups, but not for the sector as a whole. The equity/asset ratio therefore seems to not affect the decision of whether to lose impairment or not, but when the decision is made, the ratio of equity/asset seems to affect the size of the <b>impairment</b> <b>loss.</b> Within the financial sector, no relationship could be found – neither for the groups which have had <b>impairment</b> <b>loss</b> nor the sector as a whole...|$|E

40|$|A {{major concern}} with the {{adoption}} of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is the accounting discretion allowed under the IFRS, and its potential opportunistic use by managers.

On the other hand, the signaling theory explains that goodwill impairment losses is considered as bad news by investors because it relates to the decrease of the firm’s ability to generate cash inflow in the future, that will ultimately affect the value of the firm. We find that the reporting incentive (income smoothing), firm performance, `and auditor quality affects the firm’s tendency to report goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>loss,</b> while the debt covenant does not affect the firm’s tendency to report goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>loss.</b> We also find that reported goodwill <b>impairment</b> <b>loss</b> affects the firm’s value...|$|E
