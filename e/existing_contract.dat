5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2006–07 season, Cloutier {{signed a}} two-year, $6.2 million {{contract}} extension with the Kings on September 27, 2006. He had one year, valued at $2.55 million, remaining on his <b>existing</b> <b>contract,</b> which was transferred over from the Canucks. Cloutier moved to the Kings alongside Head Coach Marc Crawford, who {{was hired by the}} team shortly after being let go by the Canucks in the 2006 off-season.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{appearance}} in the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, the Penguins had {{less than three weeks}} before free agency began to settle numerous contract decisions. The Penguins added nine free agents and lost ten to other teams. Head Coach Michel Therrien also signed a new three-year contract that replaced {{the last year of his}} <b>existing</b> <b>contract,</b> with an increase in salary. The new contract was projected to keep him with the Penguins through the 2010–11 season.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, he was dealt, {{along with}} defenseman Nick Boynton and a second-round {{pick in the}} draft, to the Florida Panthers in {{exchange}} for forward Olli Jokinen. Upon trading for Ballard, Florida head coach Jacques Martin heralded him as the club's number-two defenseman, behind Jay Bouwmeester. Prior to the 2008–09 season, Ballard signed a six-year, $25.2 million contract extension with the Panthers. The deal came with a season remaining on his <b>existing</b> <b>contract,</b> previously signed with the Coyotes.|$|E

5|$|Having {{played the}} final year of his <b>existing</b> <b>contract,</b> Bieksa {{addressed}} his pending unrestricted free agency by telling the media he was ready to re-sign for less than market value in order to remain with the Canucks. Shortly thereafter, on June 27, 2011, Bieksa signed a five-year, $23 million contract extension. The deal came with a no-trade clause and was reported to be front-loaded, with Bieksa making $7 million in his first year, followed by $4.5 million, $5 million, $4 million and $2.5 million annual salaries. The deal kept the popular defenceman amongst the core for another chance at winning a Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Bure left Moscow {{with his}} father and brother on September 6, 1991, staying {{temporarily}} in Los Angeles. His mother arrived shortly afterward. The Canucks began negotiating a contract with Bure, but before one could be finalized, the issue of his <b>existing</b> <b>contract</b> with the Central Red Army had to be settled. The Canucks management and officials from the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation met in late-October 1991 in a Detroit court, where they bartered for a cash settlement. After the Canucks offered US$200,000, Bure stood up in the courtroom to offer an additional $50,000, bringing the total to $250,000. The Soviet officials accepted, and Canucks management paid the full $250,000. Bure signed a four-year contract worth a reported $2.7 million with an $800,000 signing bonus. The deal made Bure the Canucks' second highest paid player behind team captain Trevor Linden.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of his fortune, however, came from moneylending. Up until their expulsion in 1290, the major moneylenders in England were Jews, who were not covered by Christian bans on usury. During the reign of Henry III, however, the Jews were taxed at extortionate rates, and many were forced to sell acquired debts at reduced prices. These debts were lucrative, because the buyers were not bound by the <b>existing</b> <b>contract.</b> They could demand higher rates, or sometimes even take forfeit in land. Stratton {{was one of the}} greater beneficiaries of the opportunities offered by trading in Jewish debts. From at least 1271 he was also associated with the Riccardi, a major Italian financier family.|$|E

50|$|The {{conciliation}} and arbitration {{power had}} arisen following the bitter and protacted strikes of the 1890s, particularly the 1890 martime strike and the shearer's strikes of 1891 and 1894. By reference to this history, O'Connor J characeterised an industrial dispute as being characterised as unable {{to be resolved}} by ordinary tribunals as it was not about the breach or observance of <b>existing</b> <b>contracts,</b> but rather grievances that had developed under the <b>existing</b> <b>contracts</b> and for securing a new agreement.|$|R

5|$|A mid-credits scene teasing X-Men: Days of Future Past was {{attached}} to the theatrical release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in April 2014. In the scene, which is set during the Vietnam War, Mystique tries to infiltrate a military camp led by William Stryker to recruit fellow mutants Havok, Ink, and Toad. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 director Marc Webb had an <b>existing</b> <b>contract</b> with Fox Searchlight Pictures to direct another film following 500 Days of Summer (2009). After The Amazing Spider-Man, Webb's negotiations with Sony Pictures Entertainment stalled because of his commitment to Fox. Fox eventually agreed to allow Webb to direct the sequel of The Amazing Spider-Man, and in exchange, Sony promoted the X-Men film without charge. In addition, three viral websites were launched before the release of the filmTrask-Industries.com in July 2013, TheBentBullet.com in November 2013 and 25Moments.com in April 2014. To further promote the film, Jackman made a guest appearance on the April 28, 2014, episode of WWE Raw. The segment received mixed reactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{authorities}} {{responded to}} the chaos with emergency legislation; the Ordinance of Labourers was passed in 1349, and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, making {{it a crime to}} refuse work or to break an <b>existing</b> <b>contract,</b> imposing fines on those who transgressed. The system was initially enforced through special Justices of Labourers and then, from the 1360s onwards, through the normal Justices of the Peace, typically members of the local gentry. Although in theory these laws applied to both labourers seeking higher wages and to employers tempted to outbid their competitors for workers, they were in practice applied only to labourers, and then in a rather arbitrary fashion. The legislation was strengthened in 1361, with the penalties increased to include branding and imprisonment. The royal government had not intervened in this way before, nor allied itself with the local landowners in quite such an obvious or unpopular way.|$|E
5|$|Concerns over future player {{contracts}} {{were raised}} {{just days after}} the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals. Approximately a dozen players, including Marian Hossa, Jarkko Ruutu, Ryan Malone and Brooks Orpik, had fulfilled the final year on their contracts. On June 28, the Penguins traded the contract negotiation rights to Gary Roberts and Ryan Malone to the Tampa Bay Lightning for a conditional draft pick; it became a third-round pick when both Malone and Roberts signed with the Lightning on June 30. Evgeni Malkin was offered a contract from a Russian team in the newly formed Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) worth approximately $12.5million, tax exempt, per year, which would make him the highest-paid hockey player in the world. However, Malkin turned down the offer to remain with the Penguins, and the IIHF released a statement saying that it would not honor the offer, as Malkin was already under an <b>existing</b> <b>contract</b> with the Penguins at the time. Malkin agreed to a five-year contract extension worth $8.7million per year—the same value as Sidney Crosby's contract—with the Penguins on July 2. On July 3, the Penguins agreed to a seven-year deal with restricted free agent goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in addition to one-year contracts with free agents Miroslav Satan and Ruslan Fedotenko. On October 8, the Penguins made several roster adjustments, placing Kris Beech, who was already in Europe looking for a new team, on unconditional waivers and sending Janne Pesonen, John Curry and Jeff Taffe, who first had to clear waivers, to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. The next day, on October 9, the Penguins acquired Michael Zigomanis from Phoenix for future considerations. On December 19, the team extended their agreement with Maxime Talbot for an additional two seasons.|$|E

50|$|To {{avoid the}} {{language}} of Bowman's <b>existing</b> <b>contracts,</b> Topps sold its 1951 cards with caramel candy instead of gum. However, because Bowman had signed many players in 1950 to contracts for that year, plus a renewal option for one year, Topps included in its own contracts the rights to sell cards with gum starting in 1952 (as it ultimately did). Topps also tried to establish exclusive rights through its contracts by having players agree not to grant similar rights to others, or renew <b>existing</b> <b>contracts</b> except where specifically noted in the contract.|$|R

25|$|In the 2009–10 Premier League season, Essien {{put in an}} {{excellent}} performance against Blackburn Rovers on 24 October 2009 and scored his first goal {{of the season with}} a swerving 35-yard shot on 52 minutes in a 5–0 victory at Stamford Bridge. He scored his first brace for Chelsea against Wolverhampton Wanderers with a header and a low shot from outside the box, and came close to completing his first hat-trick for the club with a flurry of second half shots, one of which was tipped onto the bar by Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey. Essien was injured on international duty during the 2010 African Nations Cup and missed the remainder of the English domestic season. On 4 June 2010, he signed a two-year extension to his <b>existing</b> <b>contract</b> which would have kept him at the club until 2015.

25|$|Erik Hamrén {{was hired}} as a new manager, but his <b>existing</b> <b>contract</b> {{hindered}} him starting until July, so Henriksen continued until then.

The club qualified for the UEFA Cup by co-winning the Intertoto Cup after beating NAC Breda; in the UEFA Cup, Rosenborg advanced to the group stage. In his second season, Hamrén succeed at winning the league, although the club lost for Kazakhstan's Qarabağ in the qualification for the Europa League and lost 5–0 for Molde in the cup quarter-final. Hamrén left the club midways during the 2010 season to become manager for Sweden. Eggen took over as manager again, and led them to the league title, without having lost a single league match.
