Abe uses this box to travel six hours into his own past—as part of this process, Original-Abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room, {{so as not to}} interact or interfere with the outside world, after which Original-Abe enters the box, waits inside the box for six hours (thus <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> time six hours), and becomes Future-Abe, who travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the self-storage facility housing the box. At the end of the overlap-timespan, Original-Abe enters the box and ceases to exist.|$|E

25|$|However, {{usually the}} {{syndicate}} re-formed {{for the next}} calendar year with {{more or less the}} same membership and the same identifying number. In this way, a syndicate could have a continuous existence <b>going</b> <b>back</b> (<b>in</b> some cases) 50 years or more, but each year was accounted for separately. There would have been 50 separate incarnations of this example syndicate, each one a separate trading entity that underwrote insurance for one calendar year only.|$|E
25|$|Until early 2010, {{the album}} {{was going to be}} called 18 Good Reasons with the album cover stylised to recall the Motown era. But the chance {{discovery}} of a photograph of 13-year-old Collins playing drums in the Getty Images library caused a change in direction, resulting in the album being called <b>Going</b> <b>Back.</b> <b>In</b> an interview on Today in September 2010, Collins noted he actually had to pay for use of the picture of himself as the cover image. However, the 2016 reissue of the album will use an entirely new cover photograph featuring present-day Collins instead of recreating or reusing the original cover.|$|E

25|$|In a {{different}} present day created by Flash's <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{time to stop}} his mother's death, Aquaman is shown to be more ruthless and bulkier. He and Wonder Woman attempted to have an alliance between Atlantis and Themyscira, ending up having an affair; his wife saw them and ended up perishing {{in a fight with}} Wonder Woman to defend her claim on her husband. The resulting war caused chaos on a global scale, resulting in Aquaman's capture of Captain Atom; he had him used as the source of a bomb to take out the Amazons and himself as a last resort. At the end of the film, he does just that, forcing Flash to head back in time to avert the disaster and restore the true present day.|$|E
25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E

500|$|Roger Sutton from Horn Book Magazine {{felt that}} the moment Marcus {{explains}} this flaw to Miranda is the first exchange that shows the novel to be complicated and mysterious. Quattlebaum noted, [...] "The story's structure– an expert interweaving of past, present and future– brilliantly contradicts Miranda's commonsensical belief that the end can't happen before the middle." [...] Stead explained her view of time travel in her novel, where <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> time is fulfilling the future, rather than changing it. She hoped to make the time travel element logical to show that [...] "Miranda wasn't struggling to understand the seeming randomness and infinity of the universe, but learning that her world has value and that people do care about her".|$|E
500|$|Palpatine's {{role in the}} prequel films {{required}} McDiarmid to play {{two dimensions}} of the same character. Recalling the initial days of shooting The Phantom Menace, McDiarmid stated, [...] "Stepping onto the set of Episode I {{for the first time}} was like <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> time, due to my experience in Jedi. Palpatine's an interesting character; he's conventional on the outside, but demonic on the inside [...] he's on the edge, trying to go beyond what's possible." [...] McDiarmid added another layer to the character in Attack of the Clones. He noted, [...] " [...] is a supreme actor. He has to be even more convincing than somebody who isn't behaving in a schizophrenic fashion, so he's extra charming, or extra professional [...] and for those who are looking for clues, that's almost where you can see them." [...] McDiarmid illuminated on the scene where Padmé Amidala is almost assassinated: ...|$|E

500|$|Pepsi aired the {{commercial}} during the global telecast of the 31st Grammy Awards in February 1989. A week later, the advertisement was premiered during NBC's sitcom The Cosby Show, {{which was one}} of the most popular shows of that time. Titled [...] "Make a Wish", the two-minute commercial portrayed Madonna <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> time to her childhood memories. It starts as the singer watches a video of her childhood birthday party. While reminiscing, she interchanges places with her young self. The young Madonna roams aimlessly around the grown-up Madonna's room, while the latter dances with her childhood friends on the street and inside a bar. The commercial continues as Madonna dances inside a church, surrounded by a choir and her child self discovering her old doll. As both of them are interchanged again, the grown-up Madonna looks towards the TV and says, [...] "Go ahead, make a wish". Both the Madonnas raise their Pepsi cans to each other, and the young Madonna blows out the candles on her birthday cake.|$|E
500|$|The Back to the Future trilogy is parodied and {{referenced}} {{throughout the}} episode, {{along with many}} other movies and famous people throughout the 1980s. Other cultural references include how after <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> time, Peter becomes excited about his new prospects in life, and states to Cleveland {{that he is going to}} [...] "raise more hell than Hellraiser" [...] from the 1987 horror film Hellraiser. It also depicts Pinhead as weak and ridiculous, stating that the worst he can do is unscrew a salt shaker and trick someone into using it, causing salt to come out all over their food. The first scene where Lois appears at the swimming pool is a reference to a scene from the 1980 film Caddyshack, featuring the song [...] "Mr. Night" [...] by Kenny Loggins. Once Lois appears, she asks Peter if he would like to see the 1982 film Zapped!. Rejecting her offer, Peter decides to go partying with Cleveland instead and play the video game Menstrual Ms. Pac-Man, in addition to making out with actress Molly Ringwald. While there, Brian gets into a fight, and instructs the bar patron to meet him on top of the World Trade Center to fight him at eight A.M. on September 11, 2001. While downstairs in the alternate universe, Peter makes a reference to the Twilight Zone episode, [...] "The Eye of the Beholder." [...] The joke about the World Trade Center has been edited from current versions of the show accessible on Netflix as of January 2012. Returning to the present, Peter and Brian decide to watch television, and are shocked to discover that actor Chevy Chase is now the host of The Tonight Show. They also discover that former Vice President Al Gore is now President of the United States, and flying cars running on vegetable oil exist. A parody of the 1962 ABC animated series, Hanna-Barbera's The Jetsons, is then shown. In the alternate reality, Death refers to the Dick Cheney hunting accident, explaining that the [...] "Chairman of Halliburton" [...] accidentally shot and killed Karl Rove, Antonin Scalia, and Tucker Carlson (Brian groans that Peter and he can't change this wonderful future, but Peter flatly says [...] "I don't know who any of those people are"). The main plot of the episode, complete with the scene in which Peter and Brian are in the living room, with Brian explaining to Peter what happened using a chalk board, is a reference to the alternate universe scene in Back to the Future Part II.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{following}} episode, [...] "Tikka to Ride" [...] (1997), Lister mentions {{in a video}} log that the future Starbug destroying the Starbug of the present meant the time drive they had used ceased to exist in both {{the present and the}} future, or in other words, killing the present crew of Starbug in the present also killed the crew in the future, making it impossible for the future crew from ever <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> time to kill themselves in the present.

The Tenth Doctor warns another character against trying to alter his own timeline as such meddling would [...] "destroy two-thirds of the universe" [...] and resists an offer by Krillitane Mr Finch, using the Skasis Paradigm, which {{would have given the}} Doctor the ability to reorder the universe and allowed him to stop the war.
