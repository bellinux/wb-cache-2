5|$|After the FBI {{finds out}} that they believe Michael is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> break Sara out of prison they contact Mahone. Mahone is offered his old job back with the FBI if he agrees to give them {{credible}} information that leads to proof of Michael's plans. Mahone gives up the blind spot in the cameras that Michael had found, which the FBI fixes and then demands more information from Mahone. Mahone eventually decides not to turn his back on Michael but instead to use the connection to his advantage. Mahone informs the FBI that Michael is going to parachute into the prison, and when a dummy is parachuted into the prison Michael has enough of a distraction to break Sara out. Once Sara has escaped safely, Mahone gives her and Lincoln a tape from Michael that explained why he sacrificed himself for Sara.|$|E
500|$|Boyle {{acknowledged}} that the extravagance of the 2008 opening ceremony was an impossible act to follow — [...] "you can't get bigger than Beijing" [...] — and that this realisation had in fact liberated his team creatively. He said [...] "..obviously I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> build on Beijing, because how could you? We can't, and you wouldn't want to, so we're {{going back to the}} beginning. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> give the impression that we're rethinking and restarting, because they've (opening ceremonies) escalated since Los Angeles in 1984. They've tried to top themselves each time and you can't do that after Beijing." [...] Beijing's budget had been £65m, whereas London's final budget was £27m, which was twice the original provision. The London stadium had the same number of seats as Beijing's, but was half the size; this intimacy of scale meant that Boyle felt he could achieve something personal and connecting.|$|E

This {{was the first}} victory for Lucien Laurin in his four {{attempts}} to win the Preakness. Jockey Ron Turcotte secured his second Preakness victory, having previously won with Tom Rolfe in 1965.

It was also covered in Mandarin by Taiwanese girl group S.H.E and released on their studio album Encore (2004). Their version was retitled [...] "Bié Shuō Duìbùqǐ" [...] ( [...] "Don't Say Sorry").

[...] "Everytime" [...] was used during the 2009 Irish production of the 1896 play The Seagull. Jackie Evancho covered the song for her debut album Prelude to a Dream (2009). On August 19, 2010, her version debuted at number three on Billboards Classical Digital Songs chart. British singer Cher Lloyd covered the song live on The X Factor in the United Kingdom in 2010. This caused the song to re entry the top 50 singles chart in the UK.| On July 27, 2012, Kelly Clarkson covered the song during the Las Vegas stop of her summer tour, as an audience request. Clarkson had a harpist accompany her during the performance, and told the audience, [...] "This song {{is one of my}} favourite songs.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Will Be" [...] {{was shot in}} New York City on 18 December 2008, and {{features}} Gossip Girl actor Chace Crawford {{as one of the}} characters. A reporter for People explained how the inclusion of Crawford in the video came to fruition, writing that [...] "Chace went to London a couple months ago for meetings and to promote Gossip Girl. He went to a party and ended up meeting Leona. [...] hit it off and talk {{every once in a while}} and have become fast friends. A couple weeks ago Leona called Chace and asked if he would be in her next video. He obviously said yes." [...] In the video, it is presumed that Lewis and Crawford have stolen a large amount of money, as it opens with dialogue between the pair and how they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> arrange to meet each other at a later date, due to the police closing in on them. As the song begins to play, Lewis sings the first verse on the car bonnet in which they were shown sitting in previously. As she sings the first chorus, she stands up and faces Crawford in the car, and begins to walk away in a car park as she sings the second verse. For the second chorus, Lewis is shown to evade the police by trying to escape by car park stairways, but is confronted by policemen in most directions she goes. For the final chorus, Lewis makes it out onto the road and runs from the police in their cars, but is ultimately blocked from escape in all directions as they close in on her, arrest her, and place her in the back of a police car. People ranked the video as one of the most anticipated videos to be released in January 2009.|$|E

Rusbridger said that [...] "...if the Prince of Wales is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> influence public policy in a particularly frank way then I don't think he is acting as a private citizen and therefore like any other lobby group there ought to be transparency about what he's trying to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{work had}} its genesis in a {{commission}} from the dancer Ida Rubinstein, who asked Ravel {{to make an}} orchestral transcription of six pieces from Isaac Albéniz's set of piano pieces, Iberia. While working on the transcription, Ravel was informed that the movements had already been orchestrated by Spanish conductor Enrique Fernández Arbós, and that copyright law prevented any other arrangement from being made. When Arbós heard of this, {{he said he would}} happily waive his rights and allow Ravel to orchestrate the pieces. However, Ravel changed his mind and decided initially to orchestrate one of his own works. He then changed his mind again and decided to write a completely new piece based on the musical form and Spanish dance called bolero. While on vacation at St Jean-de-Luz, Ravel went to the piano and played a melody with one finger to his friend Gustave Samazeuilh, saying [...] "Don't you think this theme has an insistent quality? I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> repeat it a number of times without any development, gradually increasing the orchestra as best I can." [...] This piece was initially called Fandango, but its title was soon changed to [...] "Boléro". According to Idries Shah the main melody is adapted from a melody composed for and used in Sufi training.|$|E

One of the Milki Masters then fires another meteor at the meteor <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Earth <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> destroy it. She misses and Earth is destroyed. Tommy's parents (who had said they're name's were Bonny and Clive) then allowed themselves to die so they could turn back time. A different Milki Master takes the shot this time - and hits.
