5000|$|In telecommunication, a {{combined}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (CDF) is a <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> that combines {{the functions of}} main and intermediate <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> and contains both vertical and horizontal terminating blocks.|$|R
50|$|Intermediate <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> {{for more}} about {{vertical}} and horizontal main <b>distribution</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{intermediate}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (IDF) is a <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> in {{a central}} office or customer premises, which cross-connects the user cable media to individual user line circuits and {{may serve as a}} distribution point for multipair cables from the main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF) or combined <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (CDF) to individual cables connected to equipment in areas remote from these frames.|$|R

50|$|Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame</b> (AMDF), (automated {{switching}} matrix, automated <b>distribution</b> <b>frame,</b> Loop Management System (LMS)), {{a technology}} to provide connectivity between subscriber (local loop, outside plant) - and office equipment (inside plant) lines {{in a telephone}} exchange (central office, CO) main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF).|$|R
50|$|A {{complete}} LMS has {{software and}} hardware components. The latter is usually a switch fabric connected both to all required lines and line equipment at {{either side of a}} line. The functionality is similar to one performed by a Main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> or any other <b>distribution</b> <b>frame,</b> so sometimes is referred to as Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame.</b> A software component implies implementing management operations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Distribution</b> <b>frames</b> {{may grow}} to {{extremely}} large sizes. In major installations, audio <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> can {{have as many}} as 10,000 incoming and outgoing separate copper wires (balanced audio signals require two wires plus earth ground for each signal). Telephone signals do not use a separate earth ground wire, but some urban exchanges have about 250,000 wires on their MDF. Installing and rewiring these jumpers is a labour-intensive task, leading to attempts in the industry to devise so-called active <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> or Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frames.</b> The principal issues which {{stand in the way of}} their widespread adoption are cost and reliability.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, a main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF or main frame) is {{a signal}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> for {{connecting}} equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate {{on the same}} MDF or on a separate trunk main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (TMDF).|$|R
50|$|<b>Distribution</b> <b>frames</b> are cheaper, {{but less}} convenient.|$|R

5000|$|The Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame</b> (MDF) is {{at level}} 1 West (Ground Floor is Level 13).|$|R
50|$|In telecommunications, a <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> is {{a passive}} device which terminates cables, {{allowing}} arbitrary interconnections to be made.|$|R
50|$|Secondary {{feeder lines}} run to a streetside cabinet {{containing}} a <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> called a Serving Area Interface (SAI).|$|R
5000|$|Many of {{the first}} {{responders}} to the fire were employees of Bell Companies and Western Electric. Five thousand employees collaborated to restore service. A main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> was ordered and shipped to Manhattan for installation. The main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> typically takes six months to install because its massive framework supports {{hundreds of miles of}} wire. Remarkably, it only took them four days to install. Twenty four days later, service was restored entirely.|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> the MDF {{provides}} {{flexibility in}} assigning facilities, at lower cost and higher capacity than a patch panel.|$|R
50|$|A typical outdoor MSAN cabinet {{consists}} of narrowband (POTS), broadband (xDSL) services, batteries with rectifiers, optical transmission unit and copper <b>distribution</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the DOD defines {{outside plant}} as the {{communications}} equipment located between a main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF) and a user end instrument.|$|R
5000|$|The commune has no Main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> for ADSL {{installed}} {{nor is it}} {{connected to}} a fibre optic network. Telephone lines are connected to exchanges located in Bar-sur-Aube and Ville-sur-Terre ...|$|R
50|$|An {{automated}} main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> provides, {{after an}} initial installation of all relevant subscriber- and office equipment lines, remote controlled and locally performed connectivity by switching via the switching matrix of an AMDF.|$|R
50|$|Split 50 66 blocks {{are still}} used as network {{interface}} blocks in <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> to interconnect circuits with bridging clips, but are primarily limited to narrowband circuits such as POTS/DSL, DS0, or DS1 circuits.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the turn}} of the 21st century, DSLAMs became an {{important}} part of telephone company inside plant. Inside plant will also have <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> and other equipment including passive optical network (name depends on the Service Provider).|$|R
5000|$|All the cabling and {{equipment}} {{installed in a}} telecommunications facility, including the main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF) and all the equipment extending inward therefrom, such as PABX or central office equipment, MDF heat coil protectors, and grounding systems.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1980s {{the site was}} subject to a phased closure after large {{quantities}} of blue asbestos {{were found on the}} site. By 1995 only the main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> was still in service. This reportedly has been removed.|$|R
5000|$|Optical {{distribution}} networks {{can also}} be designed in a point-to-point [...] "homerun" [...] topology where splitters and/or active networking are all located at the central office, allowing users to be patched into whichever network is required from the optical <b>distribution</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
50|$|A Main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> {{is located}} in the commune. In 2013, it is {{unbundled}} by several alternative operators (SFR, Free, and Bouygues Telecom) in addition to the incumbent operator, Orange. ADSL , ADSL2+, Re-ADSL 2, and ADSL television are available in the commune.|$|R
50|$|Punch-down blocks are {{intended}} to connect individual conductors punched down into each position in the block with a special punch-down tool. Punch-down terminations are also generally seen in telephone and network connectors, in patch panels and <b>distribution</b> <b>frames,</b> and in telephone equipment such as PBXs.|$|R
50|$|The SAI is {{connected}} to the main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame,</b> located at a Telephone exchange or other switching facility, by one or more primary feeder lines which contain hundreds of copper twisted pairs. An SAI may also contain a Digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) supporting DSL service.|$|R
5000|$|COSMOS (computer {{system for}} main frame operations) was a {{record-keeping}} system for main <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> (MDFs) in the Bell System, the American Bell Telephone Company and then, subsequently, AT&T-led system which provided telephone services {{to much of}} the United States and Canada from 1977 to 1984.|$|R
5000|$|Main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF): a wiring rack {{that connects}} outside {{subscriber}} lines with internal lines.
