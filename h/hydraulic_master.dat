2500|$|The Urban Flood Prevention and Drainage Program (APL) is {{the result}} of a {{government}} commitment to flood prevention and risk management. The program places emphasis on risk prevention, and developing a strategy that guides targeted Provinces from protection to a full risk management scheme. [...] This program targets urban areas from the most exposed provinces at a cost of US$200 million. The first phase of this project was directed towards the City of Buenos Aires where a portion of the funding was a $130 million direct loan from the World Bank. Overall government strategy beginning in 1992 has aimed at evolving from a disaster response to a risk prevention approach, introducing a water basin approach and strengthening of the institutions. The program is being implemented within the framework of the Buenos Aires <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Master</b> Plan, which involves the entire city in implementing non-structural measures and then the Maldonado Basin for the first stage of the structural measures. Planned investments will benefit about 500,000 people over an area that suffers losses estimated at US$50 million annually.|$|E

40|$|This work {{examined}} {{effects of}} hard surface polishing grits and activation on electroless-nickel (EN) plating on cast aluminium alloy substrates in sodium hypophosphite baths. As-received aluminium alloy sample sourced from automobile <b>hydraulic</b> brake <b>master</b> cylinder piston was melted in electric furnace and sand cast into rod. The cast samples were polished using different grits (60 [*]μm– 1200 [*]μm) before plating. The effects on adhesion, appearance, {{and quantity of}} EN deposits on substrates were studied. Observation shows that the quantity of EN deposit is partly dependent on the alloy type and roughness of {{the surface of the}} substrates, whereas the adhesion and brightness are not solely controlled by the degree of surface polishing. The best yield in terms of adhesion and appearance was obtained from the activation in zincate and palladium chloride solutions. Higher plating rates (g/mm 2 /min) of 3. 01 E- 05, 2. 41 E- 05, and 2. 90 E- 05 were obtained from chromate, zincate, and chloride than 8. 49 E- 06, 8. 86 E- 06, and 1. 69 E- 05 as obtained from HCl etched, NaOH, and H 2 O activated surfaces, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Additional Thesis work {{performed}} {{as part of}} the <b>master</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> Engineering at Delft University of Technology in collaboration with University of Southampton, Ocean and Earth Sciences, Physical Oceanography - In this research the outcome of several realisations of 10 different models from the CMIP 5 program is used to predict the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). With her extreme phases ’El Niño’ and ’La Niña’, ENSO is probably the most infamous oceanographic and climate phenomenon in the physical climate system with a great influence on the world’s climate and weather systems. Despite the fame amongst public and the high importance in research programmes throughout the last decades, the potential causes, cyclicity patterns and the possible forcing of ENSO are still not fully understood. Even with state of the art models its predictability (up to 12 months ahead) remains quite low compared to the time scale of the phenomenon (2 - 5 years). In this study a statistical model is developed to predict ENSO with a transfer operator framework based on model output from 10 models. This method is based on a recent study by Sévellec [19] and transforms a deterministic single time series evolution of sea surface temperature in the Tropical Pacific, extracted from existing coupled atmosphere-ocean model data, into a probabilistic method to determine the evolution of an observational initial condition in time. The main goal of this research is to explore and define by means of hindcasting (predicting the past) the predictive skills and reliability of this statistical method. The results show that the reliability is similar to previous studies. Where the most computational extensive coupled ocean-atmosphere models show a good prediction skill up to 9 months, with this quick model a similar skill is sustained up to a prediction window of 5 months. Since {{this is the first time}} this method applied on ENSO, recommendations are done for further development of the model as well as for the application on ENSO. Suggestions for potential other systems this model could be applied to are made. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic EngineeringEnvironmental Fluid Mechanic...|$|R

ABSTRACT: Reports of many functional deficiencies are these days rampant in many aluminium products flooding the Nigeria markets. These emanate from the local aluminium manufacturing, cottage foundry industries and much more from goods imported in the country. The study investigates the metallurgical properties of as-received and cast aluminium alloy samples used in the floating piston/calliper of the automobile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>master</b> brake cylinder. Commercially available aluminium alloy is procured from which callipers were cast and characterised. The study compares the physical properties by Hardness test, microstructural properties using high resolution metallurgical microscope, X-Ray Diffraction, chemical composition using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. The as-received samples are characterised by poor metallurgical qualities such as variation in weight and density, low HBN, low tensile strength, high porosity and sand inclusions from the previous poor casting practices, hence abnormalities result under usage. The aluminium alloy was technically cast at pouring temperature higher than 750 oC using sand mould of high permeability. The casting gave higher HBN values of eutectic-AlSi structured aluminium alloy. The tensile strength calculated as approximate relationship between the hardness and the tensile strength, gave lower 329. 09 Mpa and 154. 78 Mpa strength for as-received samples {{as compared with the}} cast alloy having 353. 58 Mp...|$|E
