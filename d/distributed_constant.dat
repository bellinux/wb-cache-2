40|$|Abstract　In {{various kinds}} of {{electronic}} circuits, transformers are practically utilized, which have been designed or analysed mainly with lumped constant circuit theory. 　In very high speed pulse circuits, however, travelling time within transformer becomes significant. 　Thus the lumped constant theory is no longer adequate for analysis, and transformers must be considered as <b>distributed</b> <b>constant</b> circuits. In some books, a few descriptions can be found about transmission-line pulse transformers. However, those turn ratio is limited to 1 : 1 and those discussions are rather quantative. 　This paper presents a <b>distributed</b> <b>constant</b> circuit theory for transformer of arbitrary turn ratio n: 1, and evaluates the pulse rise-time responses more accurately and regorously than in a lumped constant circuit theory. 　　変成器は種々の電子回路において実用されているが，その設計および解析は主として集中定数回路理諭によってなされている。しかし，ひじょうに高速のパルス回路においては変成器内部の伝搬時問が重要になり，集中定数論はもはや成立しなくなるので分布定数諭で考えなければならなくなる。伝送線路形パルス変成器に関する文献はわづかであり，しかも巻線１：１の場合に限られており，その説明も定性的である。　　本論文は任意の巻線比ｎ：１の変成器に関する分布定数論を提供するものであって，集中定数論におけるよりもさらに正確で厳密なパルス応答の立上り特性を求めている...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} two interrelated {{tasks in}} a synchronous n-node ring: <b>distributed</b> <b>constant</b> colouring and local communication. We investigate {{the impact of}} the amount of knowledge available to nodes on the time of completing these tasks. Every node knows the labels of nodes up to a distance r from it, called the knowledge radius. In <b>distributed</b> <b>constant</b> colouring every node has to assign itself one out of a constant number of colours, so that adjacent nodes get different colours. In local communication every node has to communicate a message to both of its neighbours. We study these problems in two popular communication models: the one-way model, in which each node can only either transmit to one neighbour or receive from one neighbour, in any round, and the radio model, in which simultaneous receiving from two neighbours results in interference noise. Hence the main problem in fast execution of the above tasks is breaking symmetry with restricted knowledge of the ring. We show that <b>distributed</b> <b>constant</b> colouring and local communication are tightly related and one can be used to accomplish the other. Also, in most situations the optimal time is the same for both of them, and it strongly depends on the knowledge radius. For knowledge radius r = 0, i. e., when each node knows only its own label, our bounds on time for both tasks are tight in both models: the optimal time in the one-way model is Theta(n), while in the radio model it is Theta(log n). For knowledge radius r = 1 both tasks can be accomplished in time 0 (log log n) in the one-way model, if the ring is oriented. For 2 {{less than or equal to}} r less than or equal to clog(*) n, where c < 1 / 2 the upper bounds on time are 0 (log ((2 r)) n) in the one-way model and 0 (log((2 [r/ 2])) n) in the radio model; the lower bound is Omega(log(*) n), in both models. For r greater than or equal to (log(*) n) / 2 both tasks can be completed in constant time, in the one-way model, and <b>distributed</b> <b>constant</b> colouring also in the radio model.

40|$|We {{have a set}} of {{processors}} (or agents) and a set of graph networks defined {{over some}} vertex set. Each processor can access a subset of the graph networks. Each processor has a demand specified as a pair of vertices $ $, along with a profit; the processor wishes to send data between $u$ and $v$. Towards that goal, the processor needs to select a graph network accessible to it and a path connecting $u$ and $v$ within the selected network. The processor requires exclusive access to the chosen path, in order to route the data. Thus, the processors are competing for routes/channels. A feasible solution selects a subset of demands and schedules each selected demand on a graph network accessible to the processor owning the demand; the solution also specifies the paths to use for this purpose. The requirement is that for any two demands scheduled on the same graph network, their chosen paths must be edge disjoint. The goal is to output a solution having the maximum aggregate profit. Prior work has addressed the above problem in a distibuted setting for the special case where all the graph networks are simply paths (i. e, line-networks). <b>Distributed</b> <b>constant</b> factor approximation algorithms are known for this case.
