50|$|Upon {{arrival in}} California, Heck and Guide {{personnel}} {{in consultation with}} the Scripps Institution developed formulas that allowed accurate <b>echo</b> <b>sounding</b> of depths in all but the shallowest waters and installed hydrophones at La Jolla and Oceanside, California, to allow experimentation with radio acoustic ranging. Under Hecks direction, Guide then conducted experiments off the coast of California during the early months of 1924 that demonstrated that accurate <b>echo</b> <b>sounding</b> was possible utilizing the new formulas. Experiments with radio acoustic ranging, despite initial difficulties, demonstrated that the method was practical, although difficulty with getting some of the explosive charges to detonate hampered some of the experimental program. In April 1924, the Coast and Geodetic Survey concluded that both <b>echo</b> <b>sounding</b> and radio acoustic ranging were fundamentally sound, with no foundational problems left to solve, and that all that remained necessary was continued development and refinement of both techniques during their operational use. Heck turned over continued development of <b>echo</b> <b>sounding</b> and radio acoustic ranging to Guides commanding officer, Commander Robert Luce, and returned to his duties in Washington, D.C.|$|R

25|$|<b>Echo</b> <b>sounding</b> is {{a process}} used to {{determine}} the depth of water beneath ships and boats. A type of active sonar, <b>echo</b> <b>sounding</b> is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and echo return, after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin. The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well. The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water(averaging 1,500 meters per second) by the time between emission and echo return.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Echo</b> <b>sounding</b> {{is a type}} of sonar used to {{determine}} the depth of water by transmitting sound pulses into water. The time interval between emission and return of a pulse is recorded, which is used {{to determine}} the depth of water along with the speed of sound in water at the time. This information is then typically used for navigation purposes or in order to obtain depths for charting purposes. <b>Echo</b> <b>sounding</b> can also refer to hydroacoustic [...] "echo sounders" [...] defined as active sound in water (sonar) used to study fish. Hydroacoustic assessments have traditionally employed mobile surveys from boats to evaluate fish biomass and spatial distributions. Conversely, fixed-location techniques use stationary transducers to monitor passing fish.|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} three decades, gravity surveys around Syowa Station have been {{conducted}} by the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE). Especially, {{in the vicinity of}} Mizuho Plateau, gravity data made it possible to analyze three-dimensional subsurface structures. The data have revealed several contradictions between gravity anomaly and ice thickness measured by radio <b>echo</b> <b>sounding.</b> To explain ice thickness data and gravity anomaly-bedrock height relations without any contradiction, about 5 g/cm^ 3 of bedrock density is required. This high density is quite unnatural. In this study, the authors tried to construct the three-dimensional bedrock topography and shape of the Moho discontinuity by using gravity anomaly data. Through the analysis, we clarified the characteristics of the contradictions and found that ice thickness determined by radio <b>echo</b> <b>soundings</b> is always smaller than the actual thickness by a constant factor. Possible explanations are : 1) radio <b>echo</b> <b>sounding</b> detects an intra-ice discontinuity due to moraine and/or climatic change origin; 2) error of radio wave velocity due to variation of the estimated dielectric constant. This conclusion could explain theoretically the greatest part of the unnatural relationship between gravity anomaly and bedrock topography...|$|R
