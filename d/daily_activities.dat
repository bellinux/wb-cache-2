40|$|Background: <b>Daily</b> <b>activity</b> is a {{potentially}} important measure for assessing prognosis in individuals with chronic heart failure (CHF), and {{few studies have}} investigated the prognostic value of <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> measurement. The present study sought {{to determine whether there}} is an association between <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> and mortality/mean life expectancy as predicted by the Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM), and to provide an estimate of the anchor-based minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> measured by single-axis accelerometers in implanted cardiac defibrillators. Methods: This study utilized a retrospective chart review of 102 medical records of patients with CHF and Medtronic® implanted cardiac defibrillators (ICDs). Mean <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> was calculated for a two week period prior to both a base- line and follow-up routine clinical visit. Clinical characteristics from the baseline clinic visit were used for calculating SHFM estimates of mean life expectancy, 1 -year mortality, and 5 -year mortality. A five-point global rating scale was scored based on documented clinician impression, patient self-report, and laboratory and cardiographic tests for determining the MCID. Results: There was a moderate correlation be- tween baseline <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> and each of the SHFM prognostic indicators: 1 -year mortality (r = 0. 36, p 3 ̆c 0. 001, 5 -year mortality (r = 0. 40, p 3 ̆c 0. 001), and life expectancy (r = 0. 43, p 3 ̆c 0. 001). The MCID for a decline in <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> was approximately 0. 5 hours and was approximately 1. 0 hours for improvement in <b>daily</b> <b>activity.</b> Conclusions: Although previous re- search has established the short-term predictive value of ICD-measured <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> for CHF-related clinical events, no prior study has examined the longer-term prognostic value of ICD-based <b>daily</b> <b>activity.</b> The {{results of the present study}} suggest that low <b>daily</b> <b>activity,</b> as recorded by ICDs in patients with CHF, should prompt a more formal evaluation of prognosis using the SHFM. Furthermore, changes of 0. 5 to 1. 0 hours of activity per day appear to be clinically meaningful...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose was}} to {{systematically}} review the literature regarding interventions to improve <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> in individuals with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF). Methods: Articles found by searching CINAHL Plus Full-Text, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases were included in the review if the study examined the effect of exercise- and/or psychosocial-based interventions on <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> in individuals with COPD or CHF. Article selection, data extraction, and evaluation of methodological rigor and quality were performed by two independent reviewers. Nine articles for COPD and seven articles for CHF met the inclusion criteria and were used in this review. Results: Only four of nine studies in COPD and two of seven studies in CHF resulted in improvement in <b>daily</b> <b>activity,</b> and of those, all but one study included a psychosocial-based intervention. Improvements in <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> did not occur concurrently with changes in other outcomes such as exercise performance, quality of life, functional status, or anxiety/depression in COPD or CHF. Conclusions: Exercise-based interventions serve a limited, if any, role in improving <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> in individuals with COPD and CHF. Disrupting the cycle of inactivity and deconditioning requires more than just addressing the deconditioning aspect of this cycle. Psychosocial-based interventions are a promising, but under-investigated, intervention. </p...|$|R
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} {{observed}} in captivity {{and in the}} wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' <b>daily</b> <b>activities</b> are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, they spread their forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain motionless with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captives sleep {{in the same position}} with their eyes tightly shut, and are slow to react. Loggerheads spend up to 85% of their day submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15–30 min, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours. Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. A juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to the side of its carapace, and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs. As the juvenile matures, its swimming method is progressively replaced with the adult's alternating-limb method. They depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April, {{the marchers}} reached Tiruthuraipoondi and {{had planned to}} stay at a choultry which was managed by Ramachandra Naidu, a close {{associate}} of Pillai.

The arrest of Iyer and Naidu created fear among the people. Pillai, however, convinced {{the people that they}} could provide food without getting caught by the police. As a result, food packets were found tied to the branches of roadside trees, and when the group rested on the banks of Kaveri there were indicators where huge food containers were buried. The British policemen, who were deployed to suppress the marchers, suffered from starvation when local residents refused them food and water.

5|$|Toothache is {{the most}} common type of {{orofacial}} pain and, when severe, it is considered a dental emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other <b>daily</b> <b>activities.</b> It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of dental caries in permanent teeth and 53 million cases occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of dental surgery as the first specialty of medicine.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of anthropogenic disturbance (agriculture, forestry, hunting and feral domestic dogs) on the population density and <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> pattern of deer. We quantified the effects of land use (broad-leaved forest, mixed coniferous/broad-leaved forest, natural grassland, subalpine vegetation, forestry area, and agricultural land), along with hunting pressure, and densities of feral domestic dogs and wild macaques on deer. The effects of land use were analyzed at various spatial scales and a model selection procedure (generalized mixed model) {{was used to examine}} the effects of factors on density and <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> pattern of deer at each spatial scale. The combinations of influential factors differed between density and <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> pattern and changed with spatial scale. The spatial scale with the smallest Akaike's Information Criterion value was defined as the effective spatial scale for each of density and <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> pattern. Deer density was affected positively by the percentage of area covered by broad-leaved forest, natural grassland and macaque density, and negatively by percentage of area covered by agricultural land and mixed forest at the effective spatial scales. For the <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> pattern of deer, agricultural land, forestry area, natural grassland, subalpine vegetation and dog density reduced diurnal and increased nocturnal activity. Crepuscular activity increased with hunting pressure and subalpine vegetation, and decreased with agricultural land. Thus, <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> pattern was sensitive to more types of anthropogenic disturbance than density. Detecting the appropriate spatial scales at which significant anthropogenic disturbance should be managed is essential for effective wildlife conservation...|$|R

40|$|A new {{ambulatory}} {{technique for}} {{qualitative and quantitative}} movement analysis of the humerus is presented. 3 D gyroscopes attached on the humerus were used to recognize {{the movement of the}} arm and to classify it as flexion, abduction and internal/external rotations. The method was first validated in a laboratory setting and then tested on 31 healthy volunteer subjects while carrying the ambulatory system during 8 h of their daily life. For each recording, the periods of sitting, standing and walking during <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> were detected using an inertial sensor attached on the chest. During each period of <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> the type of arm movement (flexion, abduction, internal/external rotation) its velocity and frequency (number of movement/hour) were estimated. The results showed that during the whole <b>daily</b> <b>activity</b> and for each activity (i. e. walking, sitting and walking) the frequency of internal/external rotation was significantly higher while the frequency of abduction was the lowest (P < 0. 009). In spite of higher number of flexion, abduction and internal/external rotation in the dominant arm, we have not observed in our population a significant difference with the non-dominant arm, implying that in healthy subjects the arm dominance does not lie considerably on the number of movements. As expected, the frequency of the movement increased from sitting to standing and from standing to walking, while we provide a quantitative value of this change during <b>daily</b> <b>activity.</b> This study provides preliminary evidence that this system is a useful tool for objectively assessing upper-limb <b>activity</b> during <b>daily</b> <b>activity.</b> The results obtained with the healthy population could be used as control data to evaluate arm movement of patients with shoulder diseases during <b>daily</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R
