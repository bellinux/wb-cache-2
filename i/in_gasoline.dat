5|$|In Birkenau, Vrba had {{encountered}} an acquaintance from Trnava, Alfréd Wetzler (prisoner no.29162), {{who was working}} in the mortuary. The two men hatched an escape plan, and on 7 April 1944, with the help of two other prisoners, they hid inside a pile of wood stacked between the camp's inner and outer perimeter fences, sprinkling the area with tobacco soaked <b>in</b> <b>gasoline</b> to fool the dogs.|$|E
5|$|The E85 blend is used <b>in</b> <b>gasoline</b> engines {{modified}} to accept such higher concentrations of ethanol, and the fuel injection is regulated through a dedicated sensor, which automatically detects {{the amount of}} ethanol in the fuel, allowing to adjust both fuel injection and spark timing accordingly to the actual blend available in the vehicle's tank. Because ethanol contains close to 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs have a lower mileage per gallon than gasoline. Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline.|$|E
5000|$|As {{debate has}} ensued over ethanol {{blending}} <b>in</b> <b>gasolines,</b> ethanol-free has {{popped up in}} a number of states marketed as Rec-90 Recreational Gasoline.

50|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT or MCMT) is an organomanganese compound {{with the}} formula (CH3C5H4)Mn(CO)3. Initially marketed {{as a supplement}} for use <b>in</b> leaded <b>gasoline,</b> MMT was later used <b>in</b> unleaded <b>gasoline</b> to increase the octane rating. Following {{the implementation of the}} Clean Air Act (United States) (CAA) in 1970, MMT continued to be used alongside tetraethyl lead (TEL) in the US as leaded gasoline was phased out (prior to TEL finally being banned from US <b>gasoline</b> <b>in</b> 1995), and was also used <b>in</b> unleaded <b>gasoline</b> until 1977. Ethyl Corporation obtained a waiver from the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) in 1995, which allows the use of MMT <b>in</b> US unleaded <b>gasoline</b> (not including reformulated gasoline) at a treat rate equivalent to 8.3 mg Mn/L (manganese per liter).|$|R

5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire was burning, transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt <b>in</b> <b>gasoline</b> sales for the general public.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively <b>in</b> <b>gasoline</b> during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned fuels. Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for ethanol as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted <b>in</b> <b>gasoline</b> shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol and other alternative fuels, such as methanol, gaseous fuels such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative fuels that received more attention for research and development, and government support.|$|E

5|$|Ethylene bromide was an {{additive}} <b>in</b> <b>gasolines</b> {{containing lead}} anti-engine knocking agents. It scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide, which is exhausted from the engine. This application accounted for 77% of the bromine use in 1966 in the US. This application has declined since the 1970s due to environmental regulations (see below).|$|R
5|$|Antioxidants are {{frequently}} added to industrial products. A common use is as stabilizers in fuels and lubricants to prevent oxidation, and <b>in</b> <b>gasolines</b> {{to prevent the}} polymerization {{that leads to the}} formation of engine-fouling residues. In 2014, the worldwide market for natural and synthetic antioxidants was US $2.25 billion with a forecast of growth to $3.25 billion by 2020.|$|R
5|$|BART {{ridership}} {{has grown}} rapidly since 2010, mirroring strong {{economic growth in}} the Bay Area. In 2015, the system was carrying approximately 100,000 more passengers each day than it had five years earlier. High gasoline prices also contributed to growth, pushing ridership to record levels during 2012, with the system recording five record ridership days in September and October 2012. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, BART recorded an average weekday ridership of 423,395, the second-highest in its history, but a 2.3% drop from 2016. Ridership growth began to slow in late 2016, and dropped by 1.7% in October 2016 from the prior year. The line to the San Francisco International Airport lost riders, while ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft grew by a factor of almost six or nearly 500% at the airport during 2014–2016. BART planners believe that competition from Uber and Lyft is reducing overall ridership growth and BART's share of SFO airport transit. Some see the decline in transit use in large U.S. cities as part of a national trend, linked to changes in commute patterns, the fall <b>in</b> <b>gasoline</b> prices since 2014, and competition from the private sector in the form of ride-sharing services.|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} {{outlined above}} under polarity, that like dissolves like, {{is the usual}} guide to solubility with organic systems. For example, petroleum jelly will dissolve <b>in</b> <b>gasoline</b> because both petroleum jelly and gasoline are non-polar hydrocarbons. It will not, on the other hand, dissolve in ethyl alcohol or water, since the polarity of these solvents is too high. Sugar will not dissolve <b>in</b> <b>gasoline,</b> since sugar is too polar in comparison with gasoline. A mixture of gasoline and sugar can therefore be separated by filtration, or extraction with water.|$|E

25|$|In March 2009, a {{lobbying}} {{group from the}} ethanol industry, Growth Energy, formally requested the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow the ethanol content <b>in</b> <b>gasoline</b> to be increased to 15% from 10%. Organizations doing such studies included the Energy Department, the State of Minnesota, the Renewable Fuels Association, the Rochester Institute of Technology, the Minnesota Center for Automotive Research, and Stockholm University in Sweden.|$|E
30|$|<b>In</b> the <b>gasoline</b> {{market the}} {{equilibrium}} price {{is set at}} the intersection point of market aggregated demand and supply. Gasoline demand modelling, following Ramsey et al. (1975), Dahl (1979, 1995), and Yang and Hu (1984), considers supply and demand to emphasize supply along with demand <b>in</b> the <b>gasoline</b> market, and also the level of supply-side intervention and policy <b>in</b> the <b>gasoline</b> market. Relatedly, Dahl and Dugga (1996) studied price elasticity of demand and supply in US oil market and indicated that US oil reserves to be elastic. Furthermore, Hunter and Tabaghdehi (2013 a) examined gasoline price behaviour across different regions in the long-run and the short-run, specifying that the market structures and price dynamics may differ across regions.|$|R

30|$|Fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (FCC) gasoline {{is an important}} component of commercial gasoline, which contribute the most sulfur emission, up to 80 – 90  % [2]. On the other hand, a large percentage of olefins <b>in</b> FCC <b>gasoline,</b> which contribute a considerably high octane number, are restricted strictly. So people have to decrease the content of sulfur and olefins <b>in</b> FCC <b>gasoline,</b> while the octane number must be preserved.|$|R
