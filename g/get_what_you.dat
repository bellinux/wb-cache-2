500|$|A second album, We Are the Way Forward, was {{recorded}} over an eight-day period and released by Out On a Limb in 2005. It received three from five {{stars in a}} review by RTÉ's Harry Guerin who said: [...] "you'll <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> paid for from their stomp and swing".

500|$|The album spawned two singles.

The album, titled Hands All Over, was released on September 21, 2010. On the Billboard 200, the album debuted at number two behind Zac Brown Band's album You <b>Get</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Give.

500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by many reviewers, though some {{were not as}} happy with it. The enthusiastic ones cited the combination of humor and tears, past events and present revelation, while those who were more critical felt {{there was not enough}} time to wrap up all the storylines or that it strayed into sappiness. Particular praise was given to the scene with Burt and Kurt Hummel that featured the former's [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)" [...] number, which was the favorite performance of the reviewers, and the scene when Finn tells Rachel he's sending her to New York instead of marrying her, which was described as Monteith's and Michele's best acting on the show. Monteith was also praised for his solo in the song [...] "You <b>Get</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Give", and Michele's rendition of [...] "Roots Before Branches" [...] received even higher marks. Other songs were given a less enthusiastic reception.|$|E

500|$|Musical {{performances}} in the episode attracted praise. Aly Semigran of MTV called Riley's rendition of [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" [...] "goose bump-inducing", while Goldman commended: [...] "Riley absolutely killed it as Mercedes belted out that song". In contrast, Poniewozik wrote {{that it was the}} one song choice he didn't like, feeling that it is overused, thus diminishing its impact. Abrams deemed Rachel's solo performance at sectionals [...] "amazing", and Flandez recommended: [...] "Watch it again if you ever want to take back three minutes of your life that you’ve wasted on something else." [...] Pardue called the group performance of [...] "You Can't Always <b>Get</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want" [...] "energetic [...] casual [...] and very Glee", but felt it [...] "would have been nice" [...] to feature different singers. Dan Snierson for Entertainment Weekly similarly noted that he would have preferred [...] "more vocal interplay between all group members".

Chaney also complimented Finn for having gotten [...] "the hang of this whole singing-and-dancing thing in the last three episodes of this season" [...] and gave a grade of [...] "B". She gave an [...] "A" [...] to [...] "In My Life", sung by the underclassmen, and said [...] "the harmonies sounded lovely"; Bell called it [...] "a perfect song to signify graduation". Others were less enthusiastic: Futterman {{described it as}} [...] "a blended-past-recognition, laden-with-harmonies Beatles tune" [...] and the point where the show [...] "entered sappy hour", and Slezak said it was [...] "not the most ringing endorsement for the National Champions' 2013 chances" [...] and graded it a [...] "C+".|$|E
500|$|The {{restaurant}} did {{not receive}} universal acclaim, however. In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; You might think that the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night {{is an indication of}} exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's dècor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula—and yet, you're starved for a good meal.|$|E
