40|$|Two {{classes of}} {{approaches}} that {{have received the}} most at-tention to describe the important space charge dynamics in a magnetron are Brillouin flow and the double-stream ki-netic model. It is supposed {{that in the first}} case electrons move parallel to the electrode surfaces and in the second case they move in cycloidal orbits performing a single turn. Precise analysis of electron dynamics in fully selfconsis-tent kinetic equilibria in a smooth-bore magnetron shows that for a given external magnetic field and a voltage there exists a multiplicity of natural equilibrium states, differing as to structure of electron trajectories and emission current density. The value of emission current density differs from one to another type of equilibrium and can aspire to zero under the same condition of space charge limited flow due to a large number of revolutions of electrons around the cathode.

The effect of stochastic/random roughness can not be ignored when the roughness is of the same amplitude as that of fluid film thickness.

40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{feature of}} the self-renewing population of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is their phenotypic heterogeneity: Nanog and other marker proteins of ESCs show large cell-to-cell variation in their expression level, which should significantly influence the differentiation process of individual cells. The molecular mechanism and biological implication of this heterogeneity, however, still remain elusive. We address this problem by constructing {{a model of the}} core gene-network of mouse ESCs. The model takes account of processes of binding/unbinding of transcription factors, formation/dissolution of transcription apparatus, and modification of histone code at each locus of genes in the network. These processes are hierarchically interrelated to each other forming the dynamical feedback loops. By simulating stochastic dynamics of this model, we show that the phenotypic heterogeneity of ESCs can be explained when the chromatin at the Nanog locus undergoes the large scale reorganization in formation/dissolution of transcription apparatus, which should have the timescale similar to the cell cycle period. With this slow transcriptional switching of Nanog, the simulated ESCs fluctuate among multiple transient states, which can trigger the differentiation into the lineage-specific cell states. From the simulated transitions among cell states, the epigenetic landscape underlying transitions is calculated. The slow Nanog switching gives rise to the wide basin of ESC states in the landscape. The bimodal Nanog distribution arising from the <b>kinetic</b> <b>flow</b> running through this ESC basin prevents transdifferentiation and promotes the definite decision of the cell fate. These results show that the distribution of timescales of the regulatory processes is decisively important to characterize the fluctuation of cells and their differentiation process. The analyses through the epigenetic landscape and the <b>kinetic</b> <b>flow</b> on the landscape should provide a guideline to engineer cell differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The real {{effects in}} electrohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} (EHL,) are discussed {{and the role}} of stochastic roughness superimposed on the nominal solid boundaries is considered. The full film EHL regime where incipient asperity contact bears a negligible fraction of the load is analyzed. Flow, from which an averaged Reynolds equation can be formed, is nonetheless modified by the amplitude and texture of the roughness patterns. It is found that only two extra parameters are needed, the rms surface height and the ratio of the correlation lengths in the two principal roughness directions. In a lowest order perturbation expansion of these <b>flow</b> <b>factors</b> in powers of the ratio of rms roughness to nominal film thickness, no other properties of the roughness appear. The <b>factors</b> describing Poiseuille <b>flow</b> are separable into the sum of two single surface <b>flow</b> <b>factors</b> which means that a combination of a single equivalent rough surface versus an ideal smooth surface is found. For flow entrained by slip velocity the factors separate instead into a difference of single surface factors and it becomes significant which of the two surfaces carries the equivalent roughness. Applications of the averaged Reynolds equation based on the <b>flow</b> <b>factor</b> method to the EHL line contact problem are discussed. The partial EHL regime is considered where comparable load fractions are carried by the hydrodynamic film and by incipient mechanical contact.

A sensitivity a! nalysis, using the code COBRA III C shows the weak sensitivity of the exit conditions of the coolant on most input parameters and on the inlet flow distribution of the coolant selected for the calculation.

The differential equations describing the gas flow exterior to the discontinuity surface and the dynamic compatibility conditions at this discontinuity are used. The gas flow nonuniformity in the shock vicinity is described by the space derivatives of the gasdynamic parameters at a point on the shock surface. The parameters are the gas pressure, density, velocity vector. The derivatives with respect to the directions of the streamline and normal to it, and of the shock surface and normal to it are considered. Space derivatives of all gasdynamic parameters are expressed through the <b>flow</b> nonisobaric <b>factor</b> along the streamline, the streamline curvature, and the flow vorticity and non-isoenthalpy factors. An algorithm for these factors of the gas flow downstream a shock wave determination is developed. Examples of these factors calculation for imperfect oxygen and thermodynamically perfect gas are presented. The influence coefficients of the upstream <b>flow</b> <b>factors</b> on the downstream <b>flow</b> <b>factors</b> are calculated.
