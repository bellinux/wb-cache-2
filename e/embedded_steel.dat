25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s it {{was also}} {{relatively}} common for magnesite, a chloride rich carbonate mineral, {{to be used as}} a floor-topping material.

However it is now known that when these materials come into contact with moisture they produce a weak solution of hydrochloric acid due to the presence of chlorides in the magnesite. Over a period of time (typically decades) the solution causes corrosion of the <b>embedded</b> <b>steel</b> rebars. This was most commonly found in wet areas or areas repeatedly exposed to moisture.|$|E

The interior combines rough stone, opaque glass, and rich woods, to create a space that is both art museum and spiritual space. The suspended-glass [...] "walls" [...] are not replicas of the chapel that the frescoes were removed from, but created a new context for displaying the icons.

30|$|Metalizing, or thermal spraying, is {{a method}} where a molten metal is sprayed onto a {{prepared}} substrate. A connection is then made between the <b>embedded</b> reinforcing <b>steel</b> and the sprayed metal.

5000|$|Calcium Nitrite has a {{great variety}} of uses. It can be use as {{antifreeze}} due to its high solubility, either in solution or powder. It can promote the hydration of minerals in cement using this antifreeze at sub freezing temperature, the operative temperature can be reduced to −20 °C. It also work as metal corrosion inhibitor, so it can protect steel in concrete buildings and structures from rust, to extend life of specific buildings. Nitrite's success as a corrosion inhibitor for the protection of <b>embedded</b> <b>steel</b> in reinforced concrete comes from the [...] "smart" [...] behavior of the AFm phase (AFm is shorthand for a family of hydrated calcium aluminate hydrate phases: aluminate-ferrite-monosubstituent phases); normally it stores nitrite in preference to sulfate, carbonate, and hydroxyl ions so that the nitrite concentrations of pore fluid are low. However if chloride ingress occurs in service (from sea water or de-icing salt), the AFm undergoes ion exchange, gaining chloride and forming Friedel's salt (Cl-AFm), while releasing soluble nitrite ions to the pore fluid. As a result, the aqueous ratio of NO2−/Cl− increases which assures corrosion inhibition of <b>embedded</b> <b>steel.</b> [...] Also it is used as a heavy oil detergent and in pharmaceuticals, dyes and metallurgy industries.|$|E

Also, since steel {{does not have the}} same thermal expansion coefficient as concrete, as the wall heats and cools any steel that is not embedded in the concrete can create thermal stresses that cause cracking and spalling.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} to explore the effect of {{conditions}} of reinforced concrete on chloride ion penetration. The influence of the crack width and the thickness of protective layer were studied. In consideration of the randomness of concrete crack width and the fuzziness of its effect on durability, the fuzzy reliability index calculation method was adopted in this paper to calculate the reliability of crack control criterion. Different thicknesses of protective layer of reinforced concrete specimens were designed, and cracks of reinforced concrete specimens were formed by <b>embedding</b> <b>steel</b> sheet. Then specimens were soaked in chloride solution. Finally, the content of chloride ion in concrete was determined by sampling.
