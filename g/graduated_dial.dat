2500|$|High-resolution {{multiturn}} potentiometers {{are used}} in a few precision applications. [...] These have wirewound resistance elements typically wound on a helical mandrel, with the wiper moving on a helical track as the control is turned, making continuous contact with the wire. [...] Some include a conductive-plastic resistance coating over the wire to improve resolution. [...] These typically offer ten turns of their shafts to cover their full range. They are usually set with dials that include a simple turns counter and a <b>graduated</b> <b>dial,</b> and can typically achieve three digit resolution. [...] Electronic analog computers used them in quantity for setting coefficients, and delayed-sweep oscilloscopes of recent decades included one on their panels.|$|E
50|$|The carrier {{frequency}} {{can be set}} by interpolation using the <b>graduated</b> <b>dial.</b> Additionally, the URM-25's have a BNC connector for constant 200 mV output that can be connected to a frequency meter to display frequency accurately. A sufficient warm-up period is required to ensure the best stability at higher frequencies.|$|E
50|$|The ratio between worm {{and table}} is {{generally}} 40:1, 72:1 or 90:1 {{but may be}} any ratio {{that can be easily}} divided exactly into 360°. This is for ease of use when indexing plates are available. A <b>graduated</b> <b>dial</b> and, often, a vernier scale enable the operator to position the table, and thus the work affixed to it with great accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Adolph Lorenz Dial was an American historian, {{professor}} of history at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, and a nationally renowned figure in the field of American Indian Studies. Dial was a member of the Lumbee Tribe and a graduate of Pembroke State College, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in social studies. Soon after <b>graduating,</b> <b>Dial</b> enlisted with the United States Army, completing a tour of duty in the European theater of World War II. Post-military, Dial obtained his master's degree and an advanced certificate in social studies from Boston University. Hired by Pembroke State College in 1958, Dial would go on to create the college's American Indian Studies program, the first of its kind at any university in the Southeast. In addition to his role in academia, Dial was a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives for a single term. Over the course of his career, Dial devoted the majority of his academic work towards enriching and publicizing the history of the Lumbee Tribe and its importance within the history of North Carolina, and within the greater narrative of Native American peoples. Dial died on December 24, 1995, 12 days after his 73rd birthday.|$|R
50|$|Cornish goes on To conduct such {{fire the}} {{proposed}} target would be located... the relative {{position of the}} machine gun relative to it would be determined with ruler and protractor.. calculations would be made to determine the gun's potential cone of fire and the trajectory of its bullets (an important consideration if firing {{over the head of}} friendly troops). A clinometer, combined with a <b>graduated</b> elevation <b>dial</b> fitted to the tripod would be employed to set the gun to the correct elevation...|$|R
50|$|<b>Dial</b> <b>graduated</b> from Cass Technical High School. He {{played for}} Eastern Michigan University before being {{drafted in the}} second round as a 52nd overall pick by the NBA's San Antonio Spurs in 1998. Dial played for the Spurs until 2001 when he moved to the Toronto Raptors for the 2001-02 season and then the Orlando Magic for the 2003-04 season. As of February 2008, he plays in the NBA Development League for Anaheim Arsenal. On November 7, 2008, Dial was {{selected}} as the 18th pick in the ninth round of the 2008 NBA D-League Draft by the Tulsa 66ers.|$|R
50|$|Probe {{indicators}} typically {{consist of}} a <b>graduated</b> <b>dial</b> and needle driven by a clockwork (thus the clock terminology) to record the minor increments, with a smaller embedded clock face and needle to record the number of needle rotations on the main dial. The dial has fine gradations for precise measurement. The spring-loaded probe (or plunger) moves perpendicularly to the object being tested by either retracting or extending from the indicator's body.|$|E
50|$|The bevel {{protractor}} {{is used to}} establish and test angles to very close tolerances. It reads to 5 minutes or 1/12° and can measure any angle from 0° to 360°. The {{bevel protractor}} consists of a beam, a <b>graduated</b> <b>dial</b> and a blade which is connected to a swivel plate (with Vernier scale) by thumb nut and clamp. When {{the edges of the}} beam and blade are parallel, a small mark on the swivel plate coincides with the zero line on the <b>graduated</b> <b>dial.</b> To measure an angle between the beam and the blade of 90° or less, the reading may be obtained direct from the graduation number on the dial indicated by the mark on the swivel plate. To measure an angle of over 90°, subtract the number of degrees as indicated on the dial from 180°, as the dial is graduated from opposite zero marks to 90° each way. Since the spaces, both on the main scale and the Vernier scale, are numbered both to the right and to the left from zero, any angle can be measured. The readings can be taken either to the right or to the left, according to the direction in which the zero on the main scale is moved.|$|E
