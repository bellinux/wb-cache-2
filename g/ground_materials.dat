There is a Cave [...] Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne, [...] Where light and darkness in perpetual round [...] Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav'n [...] Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night; [...] Light issues forth, and at the other dore [...] Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre [...] 10 [...] To veile the Heav'n, though darkness there might well [...] Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn [...] Such as in highest Heav'n, arrayd in Gold [...] Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night, [...] Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain [...] Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright, [...] Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds [...] Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: [...] Warr he perceav'd, warr in procinct, and found [...] Already known what he for news had thought [...] 20 [...] To have reported: gladly then he mixt [...] Among those friendly Powers who him receav'd [...] With joy and acclamations loud, that one [...] That of so many Myriads fall'n, yet one [...] Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill [...] They led him high applauded, and present [...] Before the seat supream; from whence a voice [...] From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard.

On they move [...] Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill, [...] Nor streit'ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides [...] 70 [...] Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground [...] Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore [...] Thir nimble tread; as when the total kind [...] Of Birds in orderly array on wing [...] Came summond over Eden to receive [...] Thir names of thee; so over many a tract [...] Of Heav'n they march'd, and many a Province wide [...] Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last [...] Farr in th' Horizon to the North appeer'd [...] From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht [...] 80 [...] In battailous aspect, and neerer view [...] Bristl'd with upright beams innumerable [...] Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng'd, and Shields [...] Various, with boastful Argument portraid, [...] The banded Powers of Satan hasting on [...] With furious expedition; for they weend [...] That self same day by fight, or by surprize [...] To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne [...] To set the envier of his State, the proud [...] Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov'd fond and vain [...] 90 [...] In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd [...] At first, that Angel should with Angel warr, [...] And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet [...] So oft in Festivals of joy and love [...] Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire [...] Hymning th' Eternal Father: but the shout [...] Of Battel now began, and rushing sound [...] Of onset ended soon each milder thought. [...] High in the midst exalted as a God [...] Th' Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate [...] 100 [...] Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos'd [...] With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields; [...] Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now [...] 'Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left, [...] A dreadful interval, and Front to Front [...] Presented stood in terrible array [...] Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van, [...] On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn'd, [...] Satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc't, [...] Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold; [...] 110 [...] Abdiel that sight endur'd not, where he stood [...] Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, [...] And thus his own undaunted heart explores. [...] O Heav'n! that such resemblance of the Highest [...] Should yet remain, where faith and realtie [...] Remain not; wherfore should not strength & might [...] There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove [...] Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable?

[...] So pondering, and from his armed Peers [...] Forth stepping opposite, half way he met [...] His daring foe, at this prevention more [...] Incens't, and thus securely him defi'd. [...] 130 [...] Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht [...] The highth of thy aspiring unoppos'd, [...] The Throne of God unguarded, and his side [...] Abandond at the terror of thy Power [...] Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain [...] Against th' Omnipotent to rise in Arms; [...] Who out of smallest things could without end [...] Have rais'd incessant Armies to defeat [...] Thy folly; or with solitarie hand [...] Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow [...] 140 [...] Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd [...] Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest [...] All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith [...] Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then [...] To thee not visible, when I alone [...] Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent [...] From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late [...] How few somtimes may know, when thousands err.

Ill for thee, but in wisht houre [...] 150 [...] Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst [...] From flight, seditious Angel, to receave [...] Thy merited reward, the first assay [...] Of this right hand provok't, since first that tongue [...] Inspir'd with contradiction durst oppose [...] A third part of the Gods, in Synod met [...] Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel [...] Vigour Divine within them, can allow [...] Omnipotence to none. But well thou comst [...] Before thy fellows, ambitious to win [...] 160 [...] From me som Plume, that thy success may show [...] Destruction to the rest: this pause between [...] (Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know; [...] At first I thought that Libertie and Heav'n [...] To heav'nly Soules had bin all one; but now [...] I see that most through sloth had rather serve, [...] Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song; [...] Such hast thou arm'd, the Minstrelsie of Heav'n, [...] Servilitie with freedom to contend, [...] As both thir deeds compar'd this day shall prove. [...] 170 [...] To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern repli'd. [...] Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find [...] Of erring, from the path of truth remote: [...] Unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name [...] Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains, [...] Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same, [...] When he who rules is worthiest, and excells [...] Them whom he governs. This is servitude, [...] To serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebelld [...] Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, [...] 180 [...] Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall'd; [...] Yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid. [...] Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve [...] In Heav'n God ever blessed, and his Divine [...] Behests obey, worthiest to be obey'd, [...] Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while [...] From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight, [...] This greeting on thy impious Crest receive. [...] So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, [...] Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell [...] 190 [...] On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight, [...] Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield [...] Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge [...] He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee [...] His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth [...] Winds under ground or waters forcing way [...] Sidelong, had push't a Mountain from his seat [...] Half sunk with all his Pines. Amazement seis'd [...] The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see [...] Thus foil'd thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout, [...] 200 [...] Presage of Victorie and fierce desire [...] Of Battel: whereat Michael bid sound [...] Th' Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heav'n [...] It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung [...] Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze [...] The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn'd [...] The horrid shock: now storming furie rose, [...] And clamour such as heard in Heav'n till now [...] Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray'd [...] Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles [...] 210 [...] Of brazen Chariots rag'd; dire was the noise [...] Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss [...] Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew, [...] And flying vaulted either Host with fire. [...] Sounder fierie Cope together rush'd [...] Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault [...] And inextinguishable rage; all Heav'n [...] Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth [...] Had to her Center shook. What wonder? when [...] Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought [...] 220 [...] On either side, the least of whom could weild [...] These Elements, and arm him with the force [...] Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power [...] Armie against Armie numberless to raise [...] Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, [...] Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat; [...] Had not th' Eternal King Omnipotent [...] From his strong hold of Heav'n high over-rul'd [...] And limited thir might; though numberd such [...] As each divided Legion might have seemd [...] 230 [...] A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand [...] A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd [...] Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert [...] When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway [...] Of Battel, open when, and when to close [...] The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight, [...] None of retreat, no unbecoming deed [...] That argu'd fear; each on himself reli'd, [...] As onely in his arm the moment lay [...] Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame [...] 240 [...] Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred [...] That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground [...] A standing fight, then soaring on main wing [...] Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then [...] Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale [...] The Battel hung; till Satan, who that day [...] Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes [...] No equal, raunging through the dire attack [...] Of fighting Seraphim confus'd, at length [...] Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and fell'd [...] 250 [...] Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway [...] Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down [...] Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand [...] He hasted, and oppos'd the rockie Orb [...] Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield [...] A vast circumference: At his approach [...] The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile [...] Surceas'd, and glad as hoping here to end [...] Intestine War in Heav'n, the arch foe subdu'd [...] Or Captive drag'd in Chains, with hostile frown [...] 260 [...] And visage all enflam'd first thus began. [...] Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, [...] Unnam'd in Heav'n, now plenteous, as thou seest [...] These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, [...] Though heaviest by just measure on thy self [...] And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb'd [...] Heav'ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought [...] Miserie, uncreated till the crime [...] Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill'd [...] Thy malice into thousands, once upright [...] 270 [...] And faithful, now prov'd false. But think not here [...] To trouble Holy Rest; Heav'n casts thee out [...] From all her Confines. Heav'n the seat of bliss [...] Brooks not the works of violence and Warr. [...] Hence then, and evil go with thee along [...] Thy ofspring, {{to the place of}} evil, Hell, [...] Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles, [...] Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome, [...] Or som more sudden vengeance wing'd from God [...] Precipitate thee with augmented paine. [...] 280 [...] So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus [...] The Adversarie. Nor think thou with wind [...] Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds [...] Thou canst not. Hast thou turnd the least of these [...] To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise [...] Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee [...] That thou shouldst hope, imperious, & with threats [...] To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end [...] The strife which thou call'st evil, but wee style [...] The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win, [...] 290 [...] Or turn this Heav'n it self into the Hell [...] Thou fablest, here however to dwell free, [...] If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force, [...] And join him nam'd Almightie to thy aid, [...] I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh. [...] They ended parle, and both addrest for fight [...] Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue [...] Of Angels, can relate, or to what things [...] Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift [...] Human imagination to such highth [...] 300 [...] Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd, [...] Stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms [...] Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav'n. [...] Now wav'd thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire [...] Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields [...] Blaz'd opposite, while expectation stood [...] In horror; from each hand with speed retir'd [...] Where erst was thickest fight, th' Angelic throng, [...] And left large field, unsafe within the wind [...] Of such commotion, such as to set forth [...] 310 [...] Great things by small, If Natures concord broke, [...] Among the Constellations warr were sprung, [...] Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne [...] Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie, [...] Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound. [...] Together both with next to Almightie Arme, [...] Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim'd [...] That might determine, and not need repeate, [...] As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd [...] In might or swift prevention; but the sword [...] 320 [...] Of Michael from the Armorie of God [...] Was giv'n him temperd so, that neither keen [...] Nor solid might resist that edge: it met [...] The sword of Satan with steep force to smite [...] Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid, [...] But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar'd [...] All his right side; then Satan first knew pain, [...] And writh'd him to and fro convolv'd; so sore [...] The griding sword with discontinuous wound [...] Pass'd through him, but th' Ethereal substance clos'd [...] 330 [...] Not long divisible, and from the gash [...] A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow'd [...] Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed, [...] And all his Armour staind ere while so bright. [...] Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run [...] By Angels many and strong, who interpos'd [...] Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields [...] Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir'd [...] From off the files of warr; there they him laid [...] Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame [...] 340 [...] To find himself not matchless, and his pride [...] Humbl'd by such rebuke, so farr beneath [...] His confidence to equal God in power. [...] Yet soon he heal'd; for Spirits that live throughout [...] Vital in every part, not as frail man [...] In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines, [...] Cannot but by annihilating die; [...] Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound [...] Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire: [...] All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare, [...] 350 [...] All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please, [...] They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size [...] Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare. [...] Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd [...] Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought, [...] And with fierce Ensignes pierc'd the deep array [...] Of Moloc furious King, who him defi'd, [...] And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound [...] Threatn'd, nor from the Holie One of Heav'n [...] Refrein'd his tongue blasphemous; but anon [...] 360 [...] Down clov'n to the waste, with shatterd Armes [...] And uncouth paine fled bellowing. On each wing [...] Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe, [...] Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd, [...] Vanquish'd Adramelec, and Asmadai, [...] Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods [...] Disdain'd, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight, [...] Mangl'd with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile. [...] Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy [...] The Atheist crew, but with redoubl'd blow [...] 370 [...] Ariel and Arioc, and the violence [...] Of Ramiel scorcht and blasted overthrew. [...] I might relate of thousands, and thir names [...] Eternize here on Earth; but those elect [...] Angels contented with thir fame in Heav'n [...] Seek not the praise of men: the other sort [...] In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr, [...] Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome [...] Canceld from Heav'n and sacred memorie, [...] Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. [...] 380 [...] For strength from Truth divided and from Just, [...] Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise [...] And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires [...] Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame: [...] Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome. [...] And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv'd, [...] With many an inrode gor'd; deformed rout [...] Enter'd, and foul disorder; all the ground [...] With shiverd armour strow'n, and on a heap [...] Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd [...] 390 [...] And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld [...] Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host [...] Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris'd, [...] Then first with fear surpris'd and sense of paine [...] Fled ignominious, to such evil brought [...] By sinne of disobedience, till that hour [...] Not liable to fear or flight or paine. [...] Far otherwise th' inviolable Saints [...] In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc't entire, [...] Invulnerable, impenitrably arm'd: [...] 400 [...] Such high advantages thir innocence [...] Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd, [...] Not to have disobei'd; in fight they stood [...] Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain'd [...] By wound, though from thir place by violence mov'd. [...] Now Night her course began, and over Heav'n [...] Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd, [...] And silence on the odious dinn of Warr: [...] Under her Cloudie covert both retir'd, [...] Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field [...] 410 [...] Michael and his Angels prevalent [...] Encamping, plac'd in Guard thir Watches round, [...] Cherubic waving fires: on th' other part [...] Satan with his rebellious disappeerd, [...] Far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest, [...] His Potentates to Councel call'd by night; [...] And in the midst thus undismai'd began. [...] O now in danger tri'd, now known in Armes [...] Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare, [...] Found worthy not of Libertie alone, [...] 420 [...] Too mean pretense, but what we more affect, [...] Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne, [...] Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight, [...] (And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?) [...] What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send [...] Against us from about his Throne, and judg'd [...] Sufficient to subdue us to his will, [...] But proves not so: then fallible, it seems, [...] Of future we may deem him, though till now [...] Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly arm'd, [...] 430 [...] Some disadvantage we endur'd and paine, [...] Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd, [...] Since now we find this our Empyreal forme [...] Incapable of mortal injurie [...] Imperishable, and though peirc'd with wound, [...] Soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd. [...] Of evil then so small as easie think [...] The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes, [...] Weapons more violent, when next we meet, [...] May serve to better us, and worse our foes, [...] 440 [...] Or equal what between us made the odds, [...] In Nature none: if other hidden cause [...] Left them Superiour, while we can preserve [...] Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound, [...] Due search and consultation will disclose. [...] He sat; and in th' assembly next upstood [...] Nisroc, of Principalities the prime; [...] As one he stood escap't from cruel fight, [...] Sore toild, his riv'n Armes to havoc hewn, [...] And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake. [...] 450 [...] Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free [...] Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard [...] For Gods, and too unequal work we find [...] Against unequal armes to fight in paine, [...] Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil [...] Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes [...] Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain [...] Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands [...] Of Mightiest. Sense of pleasure we may well [...] Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, [...] 460 [...] But live content, which is the calmest life: [...] But pain is perfet miserie, the worst [...] Of evils, and excessive, overturnes [...] All patience. He who therefore can invent [...] With what more forcible we may offend [...] Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme [...] Our selves with like defence, to mee deserves [...] No less then for deliverance what we owe.

[...] 520 [...] So all ere day spring, under conscious Night [...] Secret they finish'd, and in order set, [...] With silent circumspection unespi'd.

[...] Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, [...] Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit [...] This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud [...] He comes, and settl'd in his face I see [...] 540 [...] Sad resolution and secure: let each [...] His Adamantine coat gird well, and each [...] Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield, [...] Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, [...] If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr, [...] But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire. [...] So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon [...] In order, quit of all impediment; [...] Instant without disturb they took Allarm, [...] And onward move Embattelld; when behold [...] 550 [...] Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe [...] Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube [...] Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd [...] On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, [...] To hide the fraud. At interview both stood [...] A while, but suddenly at head appeerd [...] Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud. [...] Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould; [...] That all may see who hate us, how we seek [...] Peace and composure, and with open brest [...] 560 [...] Stand readie to receive them, if they like [...] Our overture, and turn not back perverse; [...] But that I doubt, however witness Heaven, [...] Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge [...] Freely our part: yee who appointed stand [...] Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch [...] What we propound, and loud that all may hear. [...] So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce [...] Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front [...] Divided, and to either Flank retir'd.

Egg production, feed consumption, feed efficiency, egg weight and egg shell strength were not significantly affected by the source of calcium.

Egg production, feed efficiency and egg shell strength were significantly lower for birds fed diets containing 1. 75 % calcium as compared to higher levels. Egg weight and feed efficiency were significantly poorer for the birds fed the 2. 50 % calcium vs. 3. 25 % calcium diets. Numerically higher egg breaking strengths were found when hens were fed diets containing 3. 25 % calcium when compared to 2. 50 % but these values were not statistically different.

Further, both modifications were found to produce a potential building cooling load reduction of up to 29 %. In fact, the optimum improvement of both outdoor and indoor environment was influenced by three major physical factors, namely, larger tree quantity, higher canopy density and cool materials.

Previous work using the multi-angle data acquisition technique demonstrated its utility to determine source thermal emission. Here we find the multi-angle technique can be used to determine the source specular reflectivity to {approximately} 0. 05 if there is very good system performance (NETD {approx} 0. 01 K) ...|$|E
40|$|Daylight {{availability}} is {{a crucial}} environmental indicator of sustainable urban areas, {{especially in terms of}} human well being, health and energy savings. This study analysed the impact of building orientations and ground surface reflectances on the potential of indoor daylight utilization in the Swedish urban context. Two fundamental building layouts in Swedish cities were investigated: linear model and square model. For the ground between buildings, six various surface reflectances have also been studied: 0. 2 (a common ground reflectance); 0. 07 (soil), 0. 3 (grass), 0. 4 (concrete), 0. 55 (old snow) and 0. 8 (fresh snow). They could represent the typical photometric properties of the <b>ground</b> <b>materials</b> found in the Swedish cities. The linear model has north and south building facades to be studied, while the façades with four different cardinal orientations were assessed in buildings of the square model. DAYSIM, a CBDM package, was adopted to simulate the annual profile of vertical illuminance at the façade position with a height of 2 metres above the ground. It has been found that under Swedish climate conditions, orientations take little effect on the daylight availability of the bottom facades, especially during the heating seasons (Nov 1 – March 31). The increasing ground surface reflectances significantly increase the vertical daylight levels at the studied façade position. Taking the basic reflectance (0. 2) as a reference, the percentage differences of average illuminace of various <b>ground</b> <b>materials</b> are: - 10 % (soil), 16 % (concrete), 28 % (old snow) and 50 % (fresh snow) ...|$|E
40|$|Mild pyrolysis, or torrefaction, is a {{thermochemical}} pretreatment for biomass used {{to address}} these issues. In this process, biomass is heated in an oxygen-free environment at temperatures of 200 - 300 °C. Torrefaction of biomass increases the brittleness of the material, thus reducing the energy requirements for grinding it. Grinding of biomass is important for applications such as pyrolysis and gasification, where particle size is critical for efficiency. In this study, torrefied corn stover and untreated corn stover were ground using a ball mill reactor. The <b>ground</b> <b>material</b> was then sieved to determine the particle size distribution of the respective materials. The particle size distribution was used to quantify the effect of torrefaction on grinding biomass. The torrefaction process increased the brittleness of the corn stover, yielding a more finely <b>ground</b> <b>material</b> than the untreated biomass. The final objective was to combine the torrefaction and particle size reduction stages into a single process. A limiting factor in the torrefaction process is heat transfer through large particles. By combining the torrefaction and particle size reduction stages, a more uniform final product can be created...|$|R
