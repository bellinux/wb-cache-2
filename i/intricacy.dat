5|$|The initial {{plan had}} been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush {{deliberately}} aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and {{which would have been}} too difficult to re-create on stage. The result alienated some of her fan base, who had enjoyed the <b>intricacy</b> of her earlier compositions, but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.|$|E
5|$|Josef von Sternberg was {{directing}} in Hollywood at {{the same}} time. Films of his such as Shanghai Express (1932) and The Devil Is a Woman (1935), with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style, anticipated central elements of classic noir. The commercial and critical success of Sternberg's silent Underworld (1927) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films. Successful films in that genre such as Little Caesar (1931), The Public Enemy (1931) and Scarface (1932) demonstrated {{that there was an}} audience for crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists. An important, possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism, with its romantic, fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes. The movement's sensibility is mirrored in the Warner Bros. drama I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), a forerunner of noir. Among films not considered films noir, perhaps none had a greater effect {{on the development of the}} genre than Citizen Kane (1941), directed by Orson Welles. Its visual <b>intricacy</b> and complex, voiceover narrative structure are echoed in dozens of classic films noir.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{said that}} the {{statutory}} language incorporates all the refinements associated with the language, is a shorthand description of the worker's legal rights. The Court explained that if the petitioner's logic was used, {{there would be no}} stopping point because all contracts would have to spell out every <b>intricacy</b> of every term in the contract. Contracts would thus become massive, and yet there would be no real benefit from the increase in mass. The Court decided that it was perfectly reasonable for the union to use terms of art in a contract.|$|E

Although Sikh architecture was initially developed within Sikhism its style {{has been used in}} many non-religious buildings due to its beauty. 300 years ago, Sikh architecture was distinguished for its many curves and straight lines; Shri Keshgarh Sahib and the Sri Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) are prime examples.|$|E

25|$|In 1802, William Paley {{published}} Natural Theology {{in response}} to naturalists such as Hume, refining the ancient teleological argument (or argument from design) to argue {{for the existence of}} God. He argued that life was so intricately designed and interconnected as to be analogous to a watch. Just as when one finds a watch, one reasonable infers that it was designed and constructed by an intelligent being, although one has never seen the designer, when one observes the complexity and <b>intricacy</b> of life, one may reasonably infer that it was designed and constructed by God, although one has never seen God.|$|E
25|$|Vincenzo Panormo {{was also}} one of the many luthiers who based many of his violins on Strads. He learned about them in Paris around 1779 and 1789 when he worked closely with Léopold Renaudin, another one of Strad's followers. Stradivari's {{influence}} could also be seen in Spain with the outstanding work of José Contreras of Granada and Madrid. Having the privilege to be exposed to Stradivari's instruments through the Spanish court, he was experienced enough to replace the scroll of a 1717 Stradivari cello and possibly even make its back and ribs. He had a great ability to imitate the original varnish and <b>intricacy</b> of the instrument.|$|E
25|$|As {{commonly}} argued by Dewey’s greatest critics, he was {{not able}} to come up with strategies in order to fulfill his ideas that would lead to a successful democracy, educational system, and a successful women’s suffrage movement. While knowing that traditional beliefs, customs, and practices needed to be examined in order to find out what worked and what needed improved upon, it was never done in a systematic way. “Dewey became increasingly aware of the obstacles presented by entrenched power and alert to the <b>intricacy</b> of the problems facing modern cultures”. With the complex of society at the time, Dewey was criticized for his lack of effort in fixing the problems.|$|E

Some sophisticated firing techniques were used from Period VI and VII and an area reserved for the pottery industry has been found at mound MR1. However, by Period VIII, the quality and <b>intricacy</b> of designs seem to have suffered due to mass production, and due to a growing interest in bronze and copper vessels.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} in dinosaurs is incredibly difficult. The varying size and <b>intricacy</b> of margins in Marginocephalia have shown many signs of sexual dimorphism. Although the intricate frills of marginocephalians sometimes seem to present with dimorphic features, many doubt {{the validity of}} these claims. Stegoceras validum, a pachycephalosaur, can be segregated into two groups based on {{the size and shape}} of their skulls. These two group classifications separated the species population in half, which is highly indicative of sexual dimorphism. However, some report that the two groups may actually represent two separate species. Protoceratops, a type of ceratopsian, also shows signs of sexual dimorphism. However, their frills don't seem to develop until later in life, and may be coordinated with sexual maturity.|$|E
25|$|Mozart's music, like Haydn's, {{stands as}} an {{archetype}} of the Classical style. At {{the time he}} began composing, European music was dominated by the style galant, a reaction against the highly evolved <b>intricacy</b> of the Baroque. Progressively, and in large part {{at the hands of}} Mozart himself, the contrapuntal complexities of the late Baroque emerged once more, moderated and disciplined by new forms, and adapted to a new aesthetic and social milieu. Mozart was a versatile composer, and wrote in every major genre, including symphony, opera, the solo concerto, chamber music including string quartet and string quintet, and the piano sonata. These forms were not new, but Mozart advanced their technical sophistication and emotional reach. He almost single-handedly developed and popularized the Classical piano concerto. He wrote a great deal of religious music, including large-scale masses, as well as dances, divertimenti, serenades, and other forms of light entertainment.|$|E
