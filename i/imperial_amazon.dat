5|$|In 2001, the American ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman {{supported}} {{the idea that}} the early accounts were a solid basis for the Guadeloupe amazon's existence.

Since Maria-Galante shares many modern bird species with Guadeloupe, they suggested that the bone belonged to the Guadeloupe amazon, and assigned it to A. cf. violacea (which implies the classification is uncertain). In 2004, Patricia Ottens-Wainright and colleagues pointed out that the early descriptions of the Guadeloupe amazon did not clearly determine whether it was a unique species or the same species as the <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon.</b> Ornithologists Storrs Olson and Edgar Maíz, writing in 2008, felt that the Guadeloupe amazon was probably the same as the <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon.</b> In contrast the English ornithologist Julian P.

5|$|A small parrot ulna {{found on}} the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie-Galante, {{an island in the}} Guadeloupe region, was {{assigned}} to the Lesser Antillean macaw by the ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman in 2001. In 2008, the ornithologists Storrs Olson and Edgar Maíz López cast doubt upon this identification, and proposed that the bone instead belonged to the extant <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona imperialis). The size and robustness of the bone was similar to ulnae of the <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon,</b> and though it was worn, the authors identified {{what appeared to be a}} notch, which is also present on ulnae of the genus Amazona, but not in the genus Ara. Subfossil remains from the island of Montserrat have also been suggested to belong to the Lesser Antillean macaw. The species was recognized by Birdlife International and the IUCN Red List until 2013, but was not considered valid thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Greenway {{suggested}} {{that both the}} French settlers and their slaves ate the Guadeloupe amazon, as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas Guadeloupe is less mountainous and more suitable for farming, and has a larger population of humans. Because of this, {{there would have been}} a greater pressure on the Guadeloupe amazon, and it appears to have become extinct by the end of the 18th century. The amazons still surviving on the West Indian islands are all endangered since they are trapped for the pet-trade, overhunted for food, and because of destruction of their habitat.|$|E

5|$|The Guadeloupe amazon or Guadeloupe parrot (Amazona violacea) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of parrot that {{is thought to}} have been endemic to the Lesser Antillean island region of Guadeloupe. Mentioned and described by 17th and 18th century writers, it received a scientific name in 1789. It was moved to the genus Amazona in 1905, and {{is thought to have}} been related to, or possibly the same as, the extant <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon.</b> A tibiotarsus and an ulna bone from the island of Marie-Galante may belong to the Guadeloupe amazon. In 1905, a species of extinct violet macaw was also claimed to have lived on Guadeloupe, but in 2015 it was suggested to have been based on a description of the Guadeloupe amazon.|$|E
500|$|Clark {{noted that}} the {{iridescent}} feathers described are not unique to the Guadeloupe amazon, as other freshly killed amazons also show this {{to a greater or}} lesser degree, especially the Saint Vincent amazon (Amazona guildingii). He suggested that the black of the head and underparts of the Guadeloupe bird could have been the borders of the feathers, as seen in the <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon,</b> whereas the green may have been a sign of immaturity, like in the Saint Vincent amazon. He also likened the brownish green upperparts to those of a young Saint Vincent amazon, and suggested that the red [...] "rosettes" [...] mentioned by Du Tertre may have been scattered feathers in the wing covert feathers. Clark listed features of the <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> which contrasted with those of the Guadeloupe amazon, such as its deep purple head and underparts, green upperparts, wings with dark brown, purple, green, blue and red feathers.|$|E
500|$|In 1891, the Italian {{zoologist}} Tommaso Salvadori included Psittacus violaceus in {{a list of}} synonyms of the {{red-fan parrot}} (Deroptyus accipitrinus), a South American species. In 1905, the American zoologist Austin Hobart Clark {{pointed out that the}} colouration of the two species was dissimilar (their main similarity being a frill on the neck), and that Buffon stated that the parrot of Guadeloupe was not found in Cayenne where the red-fan parrot lives. Clark instead suggested that the Guadeloupe species was most closely related to the extant, similarly coloured <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> (Amazona imperialis) of Dominica. He therefore placed the Guadeloupe bird in the same genus, with the new combination Amazona violacea, and referred to it by the common name [...] "Guadeloupe parrot". The name Amazona comes from the French word [...] "Amazone", which Buffon had used to refer to parrots from the Amazonian rainforest. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that the amazon of Guadeloupe may have formed a superspecies with the <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> and the extinct Martinique amazon (Amazona martinicana), and was perhaps a subspecies of the former. He considered it a hypothetical extinct species since it was only known from old accounts.|$|E
50|$|The {{hypothetical}} or extinct Guadeloupe amazon (A. violacea) may be {{the same}} bird as the <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon,</b> if not a close relative.

50|$|The <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> is an {{endangered}} species. The number of birds {{have increased in}} the past few years; however, there are still fewer than 250 individuals. There have been many efforts to help the habitat for these parrots. With the help of Dominica’s Forestry, and the Wildlife and Parks Division and the Rare Species Conservatory Foundation (RSCF), areas such as the Northern Forest Reserve and the Central Forest Reserve are protected. However areas adjacent to the Northern Forest Reserve and the Central Forest Reserve remain unprotected. Efforts are being made to help make other areas of Dominica protected. Many of the organizations have helped create groups of people to raise awareness, provide education, and conduct research. The educational programs held in Dominica have reduced the bird trade.The first successful breeding of this species by humans was conducted in 2011. The captive-bred parrot developed fully in 12 weeks and resembled the wild <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> parrots. No one really knew what the reproductive potential of these parrots was. The <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> has the lowest reproductive potential of any of the Amazona species. The <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> lucked out when it came to extinction because of their reproductive potential and the bird trade that was going on in Dominica. The captive breeding efforts proved to be extremely helpful in the conservation of the species.|$|E

50|$|The <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> is at {{a current}} world {{population}} of 250-350 birds. A {{major cause of}} population decline has been hurricanes. Hurricane David of August 1979 {{was one of the}} strongest that hit Dominica and impacted the population.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Imperial</b> <b>Amazon</b> (Amazona imperialis), {{also known}} as the sisserou, is a parrot found only on the Caribbean island of Dominica, {{specifically}} within the 90 km2 of mountainous rainforest near the Morne Diablotins and the Morne Trois Pitons National Park.|$|E

5000|$|Its name is {{pronounced}} {{with emphasis on}} the third syllable, related to its French name of Dominique. Dominica has been nicknamed the [...] "Nature Isle of the Caribbean" [...] for its natural environment.

The island has lush mountainous rainforests, and is the home of many rare plants, animals, and bird species. There are xeric areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy rainfall occurs inland. The Sisserou parrot, also known as the <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> and found only on Dominica, is the island's national bird and featured on the national flag. Dominica's economy depends on tourism and agriculture.|$|E
5000|$|Du Tertre {{described}} the Guadeloupe amazon as follows in 1654: The Parrot of Guadeloupe {{is almost as}} large as a fowl. The beak and the eye are bordered with carnation. All the feathers of the head, neck, and underparts are of a violet color, mixed with a little green and black, and changeable like the throat of a pigeon. All {{the upper part of the}} back is brownish green. The long quills are black, the others yellow, green, and red, and it has on the wing-coverts two rosettes of rose color. Labat {{described the}} bird as follows in 1742: The Parrots of these islands are distinguishable from those of the mainland of Guinea (? Guiana) by their different plumage; those of Guadeloupe are a little smaller than the Macaws. The head, neck, and underparts are slaty, with a few green and black feathers; the back is wholly green, the wings green, yellow, and red. Clark noted that the iridescent feathers described are not unique to the Guadeloupe amazon, as other freshly killed amazons also show this to a greater or lesser degree, especially the Saint Vincent amazon (Amazona guildingii). He suggested that the black of the head and underparts of the Guadeloupe bird could have been the borders of the feathers, as seen in the <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon,</b> whereas the green may have been a sign of immaturity, like in the Saint Vincent amazon.

50|$|The <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> is {{endemic to}} the Caribbean island nation of Dominica in the Lesser Antilles where it inhabits {{mountain}} forest areas above 2,100 ft (625 m). Only a small population {{of less than}} 100 birds of this species have survived natural disasters, habitat loss and the pet trade. It is the island's national bird. The species frequently occurs in the Morne Diablotins in northern Dominica, especially the upper Picard River Valley on the northwest side of the mountain. A small population has been reintroduced in the Morne Trois Pitons National Park. Imperial amazons are found primarily in mountain rainforest, sometimes in elfin forest. They occur mostly at elevations of 600-1300 m above sea level. However, {{there have been reports}} of them at 150 to 300 meters in elevation because of food storage or foraging preferences.|$|E
50|$|A small parrot ulna {{found on}} the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie-Galante, {{an island in the}} Guadeloupe region, was {{assigned}} to the Lesser Antillean macaw by the ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman in 2001.

Subfossil remains from the island of Montserrat have also been suggested to belong to the Lesser Antillean macaw. The species was recognized by Birdlife International and the IUCN Red List until 2013, but was not considered valid thereafter.In 2015, a terminal phalanx bone (ungual claw bone) attributable to the genus Ara from south-western Marie-Galante was described by ecologists Monica Gala and Arnaud Lenoble. It was discovered in the Blanchard Cave during excavations in 2013-2014, in a fossil-bearing deposit dating to the late Pleistocene epoch. The deposit was radiocarbon dated to about 10,690 years ago; the earliest evidence of human settlement in the area has been dated to 5,300 years ago. This confirmed that the Guadeloupe region once had an endemic macaw which could not have been brought there by humans. All other macaw bones from the Lesser Antillean islands have been recovered from archaeological sites, and could therefore have been the remains of birds brought there by Amerindians. The size of the phalanx bone matched what was described for the Lesser Antillean macaw by contemporary writers, and the authors therefore correlated the two. They conceded that this connection could only be tentative, as there were no remains of the Lesser Antillean macaw to compare with.|$|E
50|$|The <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> {{measures}} {{an average}} of 48 cm in length. With males weighing {{an average of}} 900 g and females 650 g, the species is large for its genus. Being of the family Psittacidae, the sisserou has zygodactyl feet and a thick, hooked bill with a muscular tongue. This bill is fashioned {{in such a way}} that using its hinged mandibles and tongue, the sisserou can easily move food around in its mouth. Males and females have identical plumage. Adult plumage is very colorful and mostly darkly colored: the chest is a dark shade of purple, and the upper-parts and feathers are a dark shade of green, with black-edged feather tips. The eye-ring is dark brown, with the eye being a mix of orange and red. Juvenile appearance does not differ much, with a higher occurrence of green plumage and strictly brown eyes.|$|E
50|$|In 1779, Buffon {{stated that}} the Guadeloupe amazon had become very rare, and why it may have become extinct: We have never seen this parrot, {{and it is not}} found in Cayenne. It is even very rare in Guadeloupe today, for none of the {{inhabitants}} of that island have given us any information concerning it; but that is not extraordinary, for since the islands have been inhabited, the number of parrots has greatly diminished, and Dutertre remarks in particular of this one that the French colonists wage a terrible war on it in the season when it is especially fat and succulent. Greenway suggested that both the French settlers and their slaves ate the Guadeloupe amazon, as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related <b>imperial</b> <b>amazon</b> survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas Guadeloupe is less mountainous and more suitable for farming, and has a larger population of humans.
