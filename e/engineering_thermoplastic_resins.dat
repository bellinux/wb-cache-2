40|$|As {{petroleum}} prices experience record volatility, automotive OEMs {{are seeking}} advanced materials that permit {{the development of}} more light weight, fuel efficient vehicles. Thermoplastics are a natural solution since they provide the combination of structural properties with lower material density, along with ease of forming geometrically complicated parts with rapid cycles and with minimal finishing operations.

A panel of 14 experts having broad experience with clinical application of RPDs using <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> was selected {{from members of}} the Japan Prosthodontic Society. At a meeting of the panel, “non-metal clasp denture” was referred as the generic name of RPDs with retentive elements (resin clasps) made of <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin.</b> The panel classified non-metal clasp dentures into two types: one with a flexible structure that lacks a metal framework and the other having a rigid structure that includes a metal framework. According to current prosthetic principles, flexible non-metal clasp dentures are not recommended as definitive dentures, except for limited cases such as patients with a metal allergy. Rigid non-metal clasp dentures are recommended in cases where patients will not accept metal clasps for esthetic reasons.

Carbon Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastics (CFRTP), which are superior in specific strength and specific modulus, {{is expected to be}} used for car body.

30|$|Generally, the EP {{toughening}} methods mainly include <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> toughening, rubber toughening, organic silicon resin toughening, rigid particle toughening and nano-particles toughening, etc. Rubber toughening {{mechanism is}} the “silver streaks—nail anchor” mechanism and “silver lines—shear zone” mechanism (Yahyaie and Ebrahimi 2013). After having toughened with rubber, {{the resistance to}} impact and bending performances have been significantly improved (Rahman et al. 2013), however, the strength, modulus and heat resistance performance is weakened due to the lower strength and modulus of rubber. <b>Thermoplastic</b> <b>resin</b> modified by rubber can improve the toughness (Giannotti et al. 2003), but the stiffness and heat resistance are reduced. Nano-particles have large surface activity, which is easy to produce physical or chemical combination with the polymer (Al-Turaif 2010), which can resist micro-crack initiation. Compared with EP composite material toughened by rubber, the strength and rigidity are decreased (Créac’hcadec et al. 2014).|$|R
