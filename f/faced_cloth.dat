5000|$|The main {{sources of}} {{infection}} in the home are people (who are carriers or are infected), foods (particularly raw foods) and water, and domestic animals (in the U.S. more than 50% of homes have one or more pets). Additionally, sites that accumulate stagnant water - such as sinks, toilets, waste pipes, cleaning tools, <b>face</b> <b>cloths</b> - readily support microbial growth, and can become secondary reservoirs of infection, though species are mostly those that threaten [...] "at risk" [...] groups. Germs (potentially infectious bacteria, viruses etc.) are constantly shed from these sources via mucous membranes, faeces, vomit, skin scales, etc. Thus, when circumstances combine, people become exposed, either directly or via food or water, and can develop an infection.|$|R
40|$|The study {{evaluates the}} {{simultaneous}} use of aerogel and phase change material (PCM) on the <b>face</b> <b>cloth</b> of thermal liner in firefighter&# 039;s protective garment. Aerogel {{is commonly used}} to resist incoming heat flux {{in the field of}} high heat protection and to prevent the loss of body heat in the cold environment clothing. In high heat protection clothing, aerogel not only resists the incoming heat fluxes but also blocks the outbound body heat. As a result the wearer suffers from internal increase of body temperature. Previous studies identified the potential use of aerogel in firefighter&# 039;s protective clothing. However there was no clear approach to resolve the problem associated with body heat release. Current study focuses on the problem by applying PCM along with aerogel on fabric. The ambient-side of a thermal liner <b>face</b> <b>cloth</b> was coated with silica aerogel particles; meanwhile, the next to skin side was coated with PCM/aerogel composite powder. The new thermal liner revealed superior thermal protection and comfort. It extended the time to reach pain threshold and increased the pain alarm time. The Fourier transform infrared analysis of the aerogel/PCM composite powder showed the presence of PCM in nanoporous aerogel particles while the differential scanning calorimeter quantified the heat absorbing capacity of the new composite powder. Scanning electron microscope, air permeability tester, and jPOR macro of ImageJ software were used for the surface characteristics and porosity analysis of coated liner. The thermal stability of the composite powder was investigated through an infrared thermal camera. No dripping or form deterioration was observed when the composite powder was heated over a temperature three times above the melting temperature of the pure PCM...|$|R

5000|$|Broadcloth is a dense, plain woven cloth, {{historically}} made of wool. The defining {{characteristic of}} Broadcloth is not its finished width, {{but the fact that}} it was woven much wider (typically 50 - 75% wider than its finished width) and then heavily milled (traditionally the cloth was worked by heavy wooden trip hammers in hot soapy water in order to shrink it) in order to reduce it to the required width. The effect of the milling process is to draw the yarns much closer together than could be achieved in the loom and allow the individual fibres of the wool to bind together in a felting process. This results in a dense, blind <b>face</b> <b>cloth</b> with a stiff drape which is highly weather-resistant, hard wearing and capable of taking a cut edge without the need for being hemmed.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} geometric integration and rep-resentation of multiple views of non-rigidly deforming 3 D surface geometry captured at video rate. Instead of treating each frame as a separate mesh we present a representation which takes into consideration temporal and spatial coher-ence in the data where possible. We first segment gross base transformations using correspondence based on a closest point metric and represent these motions as piecewise rigid transformations. The remaining residual is encoded as dis-placement maps at each frame giving a displacement video. At both these stages occlusions and missing data are in-terpolated to give a representation which is continuous in space and time. We demonstrate the integration of multiple views for four different non-rigidly deforming scenes: hand, <b>face,</b> <b>cloth</b> and a composite scene. The approach achieves the integra-tion of multiple-view data at different times into one repre-sentation which can processed and edited. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} optimal alignment of non-rigid surfaces from multi-view video observations to obtain a tempo-rally consistent representation. Conventional non-rigid surface tracking performs frame-to-frame alignment which {{is subject to the}} accumulation of errors resulting in drift over time. Recently, non-sequential tracking approaches have been introduced which re-order the input data based on a dissimilarity measure. One or more input sequences are represented in a tree with reducing alignment path length. This limits drift and increases robustness to large non-rigid deformations. However, jumps may occur in the aligned mesh sequence where tree branches meet due to independent error accumulation. Optimisation of the tree for non-sequential tracking is proposed to minimise the errors in temporal consistency due to both the drift and jumps. A novel cluster tree enforces sequential tracking in local segments of the sequence while allowing global non-sequential traversal among these segments. This provides a mechanism to create a tree structure which reduces the number of jumps between branches and limits the length of branches. Comprehensive evaluation is performed on a variety of challenging non-rigid surfaces including <b>faces,</b> <b>cloth</b> and people. This demonstrates that the proposed cluster tree achieves better temporal consistency than the previous sequential and non-sequential tracking approaches. Quantitative ground-truth comparison on a syn-thetic facial performance shows reduced error with the cluster tree...|$|R
5000|$|Lazar houses, {{separate}} {{facilities for}} people with leprosy or other disfiguring diseases sprung up as the disease incidence increased in medieval England soon after the Norman Conquest. The house at Shrewsbury {{was one of the}} earlier ones built; although one source credits King Henry II as its founder, after the time of this story (using admittedly sketchy sources for the list of lazar houses). The church in England made the separation a formal rule in 1175, and the Lateran Council in Rome made it a rule in 1179. Wealth from the land and the many religious houses contributed to the support of the ill. At a lazar house, the inmates are bound by many rules: they must not approach any large town; they must use a clapper or their voice to warn the healthy of their [...] "unclean" [...] presence; and most wear heavy cloaks, even <b>face</b> <b>cloths,</b> to hide their disfigurements. Even when living at a house like St. Giles, where food and medicine are provided, most have a begging bowl, for the chance charity of passersby. Leprosy was frightening, as was any other disfiguring disease, and treatments were few. There are not many precise records, but {{at the height of the}} disease, there were not enough houses for all who were ill. They walked along the roads, seeking alms, seeking rest in a lazar house when they could.|$|R

60|$|We {{all stood}} awed at {{the beauty of}} the figure which, save for the <b>face</b> <b>cloth,</b> now lay {{completely}} nude before us. Mr. Trelawny bent over, and with hands that trembled slightly, raised this linen cloth which was of the same fineness as the robe. As he stood back and the whole glorious beauty of the Queen was revealed, I felt a rush of shame sweep over me. It was not right that we should be there, gazing with irreverent eyes on such unclad beauty: it was indecent; it was almost sacrilegious! And yet the white wonder of that beautiful form was something to dream of. It was not like death at all; it was like a statue carven in ivory by the hand of a Praxiteles. There was nothing of that horrible shrinkage which death seems to effect in a moment. There was none of the wrinkled toughness which seems to be a leading characteristic of most mummies. There was not the shrunken attenuation of a body dried in the sand, as I had seen before in museums. All the pores of the body seemed to have been preserved in some wonderful way. The flesh was full and round, as in a living person; and the skin was as smooth as satin. The colour seemed extraordinary. It was like ivory, new ivory; except where the right arm, with shattered, bloodstained wrist and missing hand had lain bare to exposure in the sarcophagus for so many tens of centuries.|$|R

L'Uomo Della Sindone é Gesú, 2 a Edición, 1969., furthermore, he was a scholar of the Gospel of Saint John, the reading of chapter 20, Bible verses 4 - 8 : “ 4  They were running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and was the first to arrive at the tomb. 5  Bending down to take a look, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he didn't go in. 6  Following him, Simon Peter entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there. 7  He also saw the <b>face</b> <b>cloth</b> that had been on Jesus' head.

The similarity of the shape of the stains and its size with the Shroud of Turin made him think that he had really found the relic which Saint Joan mentions.
