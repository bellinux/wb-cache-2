40|$|Abstract TheTranslational ResearchWorkingGroup (TRWG) {{was created}} as a {{national}} initiative to evaluate {{the current status of}} the investment of National Cancer Institute in translational research and en-vision its future. TheTranslational ResearchWorking Group conceptualized translational research as a set of six developmental processes or pathways focused on various clinical goals. One of those pathways describes the development of <b>immune</b> response <b>modifiers</b> such as vaccines and cytokines. A hallmark of the <b>Immune</b> Response <b>Modifier</b> Developmental Pathway is the coordi-nated development of multiple components.

40|$|L-Ergothioneine (EGT) is a naturally-occurring {{amino acid}} which is {{characterized}} by its antioxidant property; yet, the physiological role of EGT {{has yet to be}} established. We investigated the immune-enhancing properties of EGT, and found that it acts as a potentiator of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. When mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were pretreated with EGT, TLR signal-mediated cytokine production was augmented in BMDMs. The results were reproducible with TLR 2, 3, 4 and 7 agonists. In particular, IL- 6 and IL- 12 p 40 were elevated further by pretreatment with EGT in BMDMs, suggesting the induction of M 1 polarization. In co-culture assay with OT-II CD 4 + T cells and splenic F 4 / 80 + macrophages, EGT significantly induced Th 17 skewing in CD 4 + T cells. Thus, EGT is an <b>immune</b> <b>modifier</b> as well as a redox controller under TLR stimulation that induces M 1 macrophages and a Th 17 shift in inflammation...|$|E

We previously documented Nα-terminal acetylation of recombinant prothymosin α (ProTα) in E. coli. Here we present a method for production of Nα-acetylated Tα 1 from recombinant ProTα. The recombinant ProTα was cleaved by human legumain expressed in Pichia pastoris to release Tα 1 in vitro. The Nα-acetylated Tα 1 peptide was subsequently purified by reverse phase and cation exchange chromatography. Mass spectrometry indicated that the molecular mass of recombinant Nα-acetylated Tα 1 was 3108. 79 in, which is identical to the mass of Nα-acetylated Tα 1 produced by total chemical synthesis. This mass corresponded to the nonacetylated Tα 1 mass with a 42 [*]Da increment. The retention time of recombinant Nα-acetylated Tα 1 and chemosynthetic Nα-acetylated Tα 1 were both 15. 4 [*]min in RP-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

A preliminary clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety and therapeutic effects of ISPI for latestage melanoma patients using imiquimod as the <b>immune</b> <b>modifier.</b> Eleven patients received ISPI in one or multiple 6 -week treatment cycles applied to a 200 -cm 2 treatment site, which usually contained multiple cutaneous metastases. ISPI consisted of three main components applied directly to the cutaneous metastases: 1) local application of topical imiquimod; 2) injection of indocyanine green (ICG); and 3) an 805 nm laser for local irradiation. All patients completed at least one cycle of treatment. The most common adverse effects were rash and pruritus at the treatment sites. No grade 4 toxicity was observed. Complete response was observed in six patients. All lesions in the treatment area of the patients responded to ISPI, eight of which achieved complete local response (CLR). CLR was observed in the nontreatment site (regional) lesions in four patients. Five patients were still alive at the time of last follow-up. The probability of 12 -month overall survival was 70 %. This study demonstrates that ISPI with imiquimod is safe and well tolerated. The patient response rate is promising.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze, in patients treated with AZA for various immune system disorders, whether the variation in red blood cell mean corpuscular volume (Delta MCV) could be used as an indirect estimation of the level of the active <b>immune</b> <b>modifier</b> metabolite 6 -thioguanine nucleotides (6 -TGN), In 43 consecutive patients treated with a stable dose of AZA for at least 6 months who were not initially anemic, the erythrocyte 6 -TGN levels with routine hematologic parameters were determined two to four times at 1 -month intervals. In most patients MCV significantly increased after 3 months of therapy and stabilized after 6 months. The correlation between the daily dose of AZA and the 6 -TGN level was mild (r = 0. 51; P <. 001). A weak correlation was also found between the dose of AZA and the Delta MCV after at least 6 months of therapy (r = 0. 36; P <. 05), The correlation between Delta MCV and 6 -TGN level, however, was much better (r = 0. 74; P <. 001), The lack of a significant increase in MCV after 3 to 4 months of AZA therapy reflects low 6 -TGN levels, sometimes a result of undertreatment. A determination of the 6 -TGN level during the first months after AZA therapy is begun will allow more accurate adaptation of the effective dose. We observed that Delta MCV could be used as an indicator of 6 -TGN levels after 6 months of AZA treatment. An increase in MCV of at least 6 fL is expected to reflect a 6 -TGN level of about 175 pmol/ 8 x 10 (8) red blood cells (probably being within a therapeutic value) ...|$|E

To test this hypothesis, we treated rhesus monkeys intravaginally with either the TLR 9 agonist, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN), or the TLR 7 agonist, imiquimod. Both <b>immune</b> <b>modifiers</b> rapidly induced IFN-α and other antiviral effector molecules in the cervicovaginal mucosa of treated animals. However, both CpG ODN and imiquimod also induced proinflammatory cytokine expression in the cervicovaginal mucosa. In the vaginal mucosa of imiquimod-treated monkeys, we documented a massive mononuclear cell infiltrate consisting of activated CD 4 + T cells, DC, and beta-chemokine-secreting cells.

40|$|Malignant {{melanoma}} has {{the highest}} increase of incidence of malignancies in the western world. In early stages, front line therapy is surgical excision of the primary tumor. Metastatic disease has very limited possibilities for cure. Recently, several protein kinase inhibitors and <b>immune</b> <b>modifiers</b> have shown promising clinical results but drug resistance in metastasized melanoma remains a major problem. The need for routine clinical biomarkers to follow disease progression and treatment efficacy is high. The aim {{of the present study}} was to build a protein sequence database in metastatic melanoma, searching for novel, relevant biomarkers. Ten lymph node metastases (South-Swedish Malignant Melanoma Biobank) were subjected to global protein expression analysis using two proteomics approaches (with/without orthogonal fractionation). Fractionation produced higher numbers of protein identifications (4284). Combining both methods, 5326 unique proteins were identified (2641 proteins overlapping). Deep mining proteomics may contribute to the discovery of novel biomarkers for metastatic melanoma, for example dividing the samples into two metastatic melanoma "genomic subtypes", ("pigmentation" and "high immune") revealed several proteins showing differential levels of expression. In conclusion, the present study provides an initial version of a metastatic melanoma protein sequence database producing a total of more than 5000 unique protein identifications.

In spite of the great progress in both vaccine development and the methods of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in recent years, several key problems related to limited efficacy, side-effects, low patient adherence and the relatively high costs due to the long duration (3 - 5 years) remain to be solved. The current approaches aiming at optimization of AIT are reviewed, including both conceptual studies in experimental models and proof-of-concept - as well as large, multicenter clinical studies. RECENT FINDINGS: The most promising approaches to improve efficacy and safety of vaccine-based AIT include bypassing IgE binding and targeting allergen-specific T cells using hypoallergenic recombinant allergen derivatives and immunogenic peptides, the use of new adjuvants and stimulators of the innate immune response, the fusion of allergens to <b>immune</b> <b>modifiers</b> and peptide carrier proteins and new routes of vaccine administration.

40|$|During {{the last}} twenty years a {{scientific}} basis for the anecdotal reports of an interaction between the brain and the immune system has established neuroimmunemodulation as a new field of study in the biomedical sciences. A means for the brain to exert a regulatory influence upon various lymphoid reactions has been well established by many investigators world wide. This dissertation was geared to test the central hypothesis that the immune system, in turn, produces signals which affect CNS functions. Specifically, it is shown through several different experiments, behavioral and electrophysiologic, that the <b>immune</b> <b>modifiers</b> interferon-alpha, gamma irradiation, cyclosporine-A and muramyl-dipeptide modify brain opioid related activities. Each agent attenuates naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal following either systemic or intracranial injection. Each agent also has effects upon either the acute antinociceptive or hypothermic activities of morphine. Finally, each agent modifies baseline evoked electrical activity of several brain areas of awake freely-behaving rats. Later studies demonstrate that muramyl-dipeptide modifies the unit firing rate of single neurons in the brain following either systemic or localized administration within the brain. These results suggest that the immune system produces signals which affect brain activity; and thus, support the contention of a bi-directional interaction between the brain and the immune system. ...|$|R

In this study we have characterized the innate and adaptive immune response to the ISCOMATRIX adjuvant, {{and the ability of}} vaccine antigens formulated with this adjuvant to promote antitumor immunity. ISCOMATRIX adjuvant led to a rapid innate immune cell response at the injection site, followed by the activation of natural killer and dendritic cells (DC) in regional draining lymph nodes. Strikingly, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I cross-presentation by CD 8 α+ and CD 8 α− DCs was enhanced by up to 100 -fold when antigen was formulated with ISCOMATRIX adjuvant. These coordinated features enabled efficient CD 8 + T-cell cross-priming, which exhibited prophylactic and therapeutic tumoricidal activity. The therapeutic efficacy of an ISCOMATRIX vaccine was further improved when co-administered with an anti-CD 40 agonist antibody, suggesting that ISCOMATRIX-based vaccines may combine favorably with other <b>immune</b> <b>modifiers</b> in clinical development to treat cancer. Finally, we identified a requirement for the myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD 88) adapter protein for both innate and adaptive immune responses to ISCOMATRIX vaccines in vivo.

40|$|Identification of <b>immune</b> <b>modifiers</b> of {{inherited}} cancer syndromes {{may provide a}} rationale for preventive therapy. Cowden disease (CD) is a genetically heterogeneous {{inherited cancer}} syndrome that arises predominantly from germline phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) mutation and increased phosphoinositide 3 -kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI 3 K/mTOR) signalling. However, many patients with classic CD diagnostic features are mutation-negative for PTEN (PTEN M-Neg). Interferon (IFN) -γ can modulate the PI 3 K/mTOR pathway, but its association with PTEN M-Neg CD remains unclear. This study assessed IFN-γ secretion by multi-colour flow cytometry in a CD kindred that was mutation-negative for PTEN and other known susceptibility genes. Because IFN-γ responses may be regulated by killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and respective human leucocyte antigen (HLA) ligands, KIR/HLA genotypes were also assessed. Activating treatments induced greater IFN-γ secretion in PTEN M-Neg CD peripheral blood lymphocytes versus healthy controls. Increased frequency of activating KIR genes, potentially activating KIR/HLA compound genotypes and reduced frequency of inhibitory genotypes, {{were found in the}} PTEN M-Neg CD kindred. Differences of IFN-γ secretion were observed among PTEN M-Neg CD patients with distinct KIR/HLA compound genotypes.
