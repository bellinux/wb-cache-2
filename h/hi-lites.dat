40|$|Formal {{methods and}} testing are often {{considered}} as disjoint technologies. The <b>Hi-Lite</b> project {{wants to show}} that both are actually complementary. The central concept are subprogram contracts, part of the upcoming Ada 2012 standard. A contract, which consists of pre- and postcondition, describes the specification of a subprogram, in the same syntax as Ada expressions. These contracts can be seen either as additional assertions {{in the case of}} testing, or they can be used to prove the correctness of the subprogram, using modern proof technology such as SMT solvers. This mechanism allows an easy adoption of modern formal methods, on a per-function basis. <b>Hi-Lite</b> fits in well with the upcoming DO- 178 C avionics safety standard, a revision to DO- 178 B, which, among other things, accounts for technologies such as formal methods. A contract is additional information a programmer has to write, and errors are possible. Another focus of the <b>Hi-Lite</b> project is to help the programmer write meaningful and complete contracts. Current proposals include the detection of runtime errors contained in contracts, meaningless or too strong contracts, incomplete contracts that do not mention modified variables and code that does not contribute to the contract. The goal of project <b>Hi-Lite</b> is to produce a verification toolchain combining formal methods and testing, integrated with the usual project structure in the two IDEs developed by AdaCore. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This {{in vitro}} study {{examines}} the whitening efficacy of a light-emitting diode (LED), a diode laser, and a KTP laser irradiation in dental bleaching {{by analyzing the}} change in color achieved from the treatment, the temperature increase induced in the pulpal cavity, as well as enamel microhardness measurement after treatment. Background Data: Bleaching techniques achieved significant advances {{with the use of}} coherent or incoherent radiation sources to activate the bleaching agents. Methods: A hydrogen peroxide bleaching agent, <b>Hi-Lite,</b> was stimulated with an LED, a 980 -nm diode laser at 0. 8 W, or a 532 -nm KTP laser at 1. 0 W for 30 sec on 64 extracted human incisors. During irradiation, the temperature in the pulpal cavity was monitored. The color change was evaluated using the CIE L*a*b* color space measurement system, and Vikers enamel microhardness was tested after treatment. Results: A mean total color difference value (ΔE*) greater than 5. 0 was obtained in each group. KTP-laser-induced bleaching gave a significantly higher ΔL* (8. 35) after treatment (p 0. 01). Mean maximal pulpal temperature rise was 2. 95 °C for LED, 3. 76 °C for KTP laser, and 7. 72 °C for diode laser, respectively. Conclusion: The {{results of this study suggest}} that KTP laser is effective at providing brighter teeth. According to the conditions used in this study, the LED and KTP laser induced a safer pulpal temperature increase when assisted with <b>Hi-Lite</b> bleaching gel. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Formal program {{verification}} tools {{check that}} a program correctly implements its specification. Existing specification languages for well-known programming languages (Ada, C, Java, C#) {{have been developed}} independently from the programming language to which they apply. As a result, specifications are expressed separately from the code, typically as stylized comments, and the verification tools often bear no direct relation to the production compiler. We argue that this approach is problematic, and that the compiler and the verification tools should be integrated seamlessly. Based on our current work on the <b>Hi-Lite</b> project to develop a formal verification tool for Ada 2012, we show that in an integrated setting, the compiler becomes {{the centerpiece of the}} verification architecture, and supports both static proofs and run-time assertion checking. Such an environment does much to simplify software certification...|$|R

40|$|Verification {{activities}} mandated {{for critical}} software {{are essential to}} achieve the required level of confidence expected in life-critical or business-critical software. They are becoming increasingly costly as, over time, they require the development and maintenance of {{a large body of}} functional and robustness tests on larger and more complex applications. Formal program verification offers a way to reduce these costs while providing stronger guarantees than testing. Addressing verification activities with formal verification is supported by upcoming standards such as do- 178 c for software development in avionics. In the <b>Hi-Lite</b> project, we pursue the integration of formal verification with testing for projects developed in C or Ada. In this paper, we discuss the conditions under which this integration is at least as strong as testing alone.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a combined experimental and numerical investigation aimed at identifying the physical mechanisms and modeling errors {{that are the}} culprits {{for the lack of}} correlation between experimental measurements and analytical predictions of the modal parameters of helicopter airframes. The identification of the major contributors to this lack of correlation is an indispensable first step to actual modification and improvement of modeling processes and tools. The study focuses on simple configurations: panels with lap and butt joints fastened with <b>HI-LITE</b> fasteners or rivets. Impact hammer tests were used to measure their natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios. The results were compared with numerical predictions based on current industry modeling practices. Next, shaker tests were used to investigate the nonlinear behavior of the fastened connections. The most significant discrepancy between measurements and predictions were due to modeling idealizations of the joints. Nonlinearities were also important, though to a lesser extent...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Use {{of formal}} methods in {{verification}} activities for critical software {{development is a}} promising solution to increase the level of confidence compared to the current practice based on testing, for increasingly complex programs, {{at a lower cost}} than the current approach. Concretely, the upcoming standard DO- 178 C for software development in avionics gives credit to formal verification for supporting verification activities. In project <b>Hi-Lite,</b> we pursue the integration of formal proofs with unit testing, for selected parts of a larger C or Ada software development. This integration relies crucially on a common language of specification between testing and formal proofs, where both share the same assertion semantics. For Ada, this language of specification based on subprogram contracts is part of the upcoming standardized version Ada 2012 of the language. In this paper, we describe the specifics of our translation from Ada to the intermediate verification language Why, noting which features of Why we used in our translation, and from which extensions of Why we could benefit in the future. ...|$|R

A companion paper reviews the receiver portion of the prototype electronics. Minor modifications to the transmitter were made since the initial report on the entire system, and this paper addresses them. The digital electronics are implemented in gallium arsenide integrated circuits mounted on prototype boards. The fabrication and implementation issues related to these high-speed devices are discussed. The transmitter's test results are documented, and its functionality is verified by exercising all modes of operation. Various testing issues pertaining to high-speed circuits are addressed.

50|$|Chinon used a {{different}} system to provide aperture priority mode with standard Auto-M42 lenses with the CE Memotron (1974), CE-II Memotron and CE-3 Memotron bodies. A similar system {{was used in}} the Cosina <b>Hi-Lite</b> EC. These cameras retained the facitlty of closing the aperture with finger pressure on the release button so that the image could be framed and focussed normally with the lens wide open. As the shutter button was depressed the lens would firstly be stopped down to the selected aperture, then the meter would be switched on and a reading taken. Chinon used a then-modern Silicon (Si) metering cell with fast reaction time compared to the then-standard CdS cells, which made it possible to close the aperture, meter the light and set the shutter speed automatically in one full press of the button. While this method did not offer the same sensitivity advantage of true open-aperture metering, it was much more versatile as it did not require specially-equipped proprietary lenses. Both Cosina and Chinon sold their cameras to various other companies for rebranding, which increased the number of almost identical cameras considerably.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Tokeneer is a small-sized (10 kloc) {{security}} system which was formally developed and verified by Praxis {{at the request}} of NSA, using SPARK technology. Since its open-source release in 2008, only two problems were found, one by static analysis, one by code review. In this paper, we report on experiments where we systematically applied various static analysis tools (compiler, bug-finder, proof tools) and focused code reviews to all of the SPARK code (formally verified) and supporting Ada code (not formally verified) of the Tokeneer Project. We found 20 new problems overall, half of which are defects {{that could lead to a}} system failure should the system be used in its current state. Only two defects were found in SPARK code, which confirms the benefits of applying formal verification to reach higher levels of assurance. In order to leverage these benefits to code that is was not formally verified from the start, we propose to associate static analyses and dynamic analyses around a common expression of properties and constraints. This is the goal of starting project <b>Hi-Lite,</b> which involves AdaCore and Altran Praxis together with several industrial users and research labs...|$|R
