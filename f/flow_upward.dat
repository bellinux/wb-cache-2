5|$|More {{recent studies}} by volcanologists {{associated}} with the Geological Survey of Canada have indicated that the subducted extension of the Nookta Fault may be {{the primary cause of}} the alkalic structure of the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. The volcanism might have been mostly generated by asthenospheric upwelling possibly by displacement along the transform fault. If the transform fault had a section of vertical tearing to contain potentially different dip angles between the Explorer and Juan de Fuca Plates, the subducted plate asthenosphere may possibly <b>flow</b> <b>upward</b> into the mantle wedge. Similarly, if the displacement had a section of extension, a horizontal slab window-like gap would have developed, again allowing a pathway for upwelling magma. In either case, the unsettled asthenosphere might have experienced low degrees of decompressional melting and interacted with North American lithosphere to yield within plate compositions.|$|E
25|$|Baffle Design: baffles {{are used}} in shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the fluid to <b>flow</b> <b>upward</b> and downwards between the tube bundle. Baffle spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. Baffles must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having baffles spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two concentric baffles. An outer, wider baffle looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|E

2500|$|A sea-breeze {{front is}} a weather front {{created by a}} sea breeze, {{also known as a}} {{convergence}} zone.

30|$|The {{spatial pattern}} of gravity changes {{mentioned}} in Section 2.5 suggests the ascension of mass anomalies along the plate interface.

Downward flow along the plate boundary is also conceivable, but the gravity data indicate the dominance of <b>upward</b> <b>flow.</b> Fluid flow into the shallower part of the plate interface may have been easier because the permeability generally decreases with depth due to the increasing stress and pressure.|$|R
5000|$|When {{drilling}} in oil- and gas-bearing formations submerged in deep water, the reservoir gas may {{flow into the}} well bore and form gas hydrates owing to the low temperatures and high pressures found during deep water drilling. The gas hydrates may then <b>flow</b> <b>upward</b> with drilling mud or other discharged fluids. When the hydrates rise, the pressure in the annulus decreases and the hydrates dissociate into gas and water. The rapid gas expansion ejects fluid from the well, reducing the pressure further, which leads to more hydrate dissociation and further fluid ejection. The resulting violent expulsion of fluid from the annulus is one potential cause or contributor to the [...] "kick". (Kicks, which can cause blowouts, typically do not involve hydrates: see Blowout: formation kick).|$|E

5000|$|A {{multiple}} {{hearth furnace}} {{also known as a}} vertical calciner, is used for continuous preparation and calcining of materials. The {{multiple hearth furnace}} consists of several circular hearths or kilns superimposed on each other. Material is fed from the top and is moved by action of rotating [...] "rabble arms", and the revolving mechanical rabbles attached to the arms move over the surface of each hearth to continuously shift the ore. The arms are attached to a rotating central shaft that passes {{through the center of the}} roaster. As the material is moved, the ore that is charged at the top hearth gradually moves downward as it passes through windows in the floor of each hearth or through alternate passages around the shaft and the periphery until it finally emerges at the bottom. The oxidizing gases <b>flow</b> <b>upward,</b> i.e. , counter current to the descending charge. In a well - insulated roaster, external heating is unnecessary except when the charge is highly moist. The hearth at the top of the roaster dries and heats the charge. [...] and oxidation of the charge occur lower down.|$|E
50|$|Gravisensing is {{the ability}} to sense the {{gravitational}} force and react to it. Many plants use gravisensing to direct growth. For example, depending on root orientation, amyloplasts will settle within a plant cell differently. These different settling patterns cause the protein auxin to be distributed differently within the plant. This differences in the distribution pattern direct roots to grow downward or outward. In most plants, gravisensing requires a coordinated multi-cellular effort, but in Chara corallina, once cell detects gravity and responds to it. The barber pole chloroplast motion resulting from cytoplasmic streaming has one <b>flow</b> <b>upward</b> and another downward. The downward motion of the chloroplasts moves a bit faster than the upward flow producing a ratio of speeds of 1.1. This ratio is known as the polar ratio and depends on the force of gravity. This increase in speed is not {{a direct result of the}} force of gravity, but an indirect result. Gravity causes the plant protoplast to settle within the cell wall. Thus, the cell membrane is put into tension at the top, and into compression at the bottom. The resulting pressures on the membrane allow for gravisensing which result in the differing speeds of cytoplasmic flow observed in Chara coralina. This gravitational theory of gravisensing is directly opposed to the statolith theory exhibited by the settling of amyloplasts.|$|E
