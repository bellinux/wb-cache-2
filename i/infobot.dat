50|$|A notable fork was blootbot by Tim Riker. In 2008 it was merged {{back with}} the {{original}} <b>infobot.</b> The resulting code is now maintained under the original <b>infobot</b> name by Riker. It uses an SQL back-end such as MySQL, PGSQL, or SQLite to store factoids.|$|E
50|$|Infobots {{running the}} {{original}} <b>Infobot</b> code have become less popular on IRC now, {{mostly because of}} the inactivity of the original project. Newer Infobots have additional features. Most of them involve connecting to websites. For example, some bots have a 'weather' module. So someone can ask the <b>Infobot</b> the weather at a certain address, and the <b>Infobot</b> will connect to a weather site and report the up-to-date weather on the chat. Infobots are also useful as calculators, and in currency conversions, word definitions, and many other things which one would otherwise have to open a site for.|$|E
50|$|The {{technological}} {{aspects of}} the play rely mainly on bot technology which could be categorised in two main groups i.e. <b>Infobots</b> {{that are based on}} archived data and Avabots characterised by some AI which real-time live input by actors.The Avabots are synched with the actors' gestures and animations according to their lines.|$|R
40|$|Belief change, non-monotonic {{reasoning}} {{and conflict resolution}} are well established research areas in Artificial Intelligence. In recent years these topics have become important for designing robots and <b>infobots</b> with convincing reasoning and adaptation capabilities. Numerous recent papers use techniques from belief change to define conflict resolution methods. In particular, several negotiation and judgment aggregation methods {{are closely related to}} work in belief revision or belief merging. The main aim of BNC@ECAI 2012 is to bring together active researchers on work including belief revision, belief merging, reasoning about action, logic programming, inconsistency management, judgment aggregation, negotiation, and other related topics, and to combine ideas from these research topics. A further important trend is the study of the applicability of well known belief change operators and techniques for particular languages that are largely used in applications, such as Horn logics, description logics, or argumentation frameworks. Submissions to this workshop were reviewed by at least two PC members and were evaluated on relevance and quality. Eighty percent of the submissions have been selected for presentation at the workshop and for inclusion in these Workshop Notes. We wish to thank the authors, members of the Program Committee, and the Additional Reviewer...|$|R
50|$|<b>Infobot</b> is a Perl IRC bot, first {{written in}} 1995 by Kevin Lenzo. The bot's main {{goal was to}} {{remember}} URLs and associate them with a descriptive name, so whenever someone needed a specific URL they could ask the bot. For that reason, the first <b>Infobot,</b> running in #macintosh on the EFnet IRC network, had the nickname 'url'.|$|E

50|$|Kevin Lenzo (born 1967) is an American {{computer}} scientist. He {{wrote the}} initial <b>infobot,</b> founded The Perl Foundation (and was its chairman until 2007) and the Yet Another Perl Conferences (YAPC)., released CMU Sphinx into Open source, founded Cepstral LLC, {{and has been}} a major contributor to the Festival Speech Synthesis System, FestVox, and Flite. His voice is the basis for a number of synthetic voices, including FreeTTS, Flite, and the cmu_us_kal_diphone Festival voice. He has also contributed Perl modules to CPAN.|$|E
40|$|Infobots ” are {{small-scale}} {{natural language}} question answering systems drawing inspiration from ELIZA-type systems. Their key distinguishing {{feature is the}} extraction of meaning from users’ queries {{without the use of}} syntactic or semantic representations. Two approaches to identifying the users ’ intended meanings were investigated: keyword-based systems and Jaro-based string similarity algorithms. These were measured against a corpus of queries contributed by users of a WWW-hosted <b>infobot</b> for responding to questions about applications to MSc courses. The most effective system was Jaro with stemmed input (78. 57 %). It also was able to process ungrammatical input and offer scalability...|$|E
40|$|Translating {{evidence}} into {{clinical practice}} {{is a complex}} process {{that depends on the}} availability of evidence, the environment into which the research evidence is translated, and the system that facilitates the translation. This paper presents <b>InfoBot,</b> a system designed for automatic delivery of patient-specific information from evidence-based resources. A prototype system has been implemented to support development of individualized patient care plans. The prototype explores possibilities to automatically extract patients’ problems from the interdisciplinary team notes and query evidence-based resources using the extracted terms. Using 4, 335 de-identified interdisciplinary team notes for 525 patients, the system automatically extracted biomedical terminology from 4, 219 notes and linked resources to 260 patient records. Sixty of those records (15 each for Pediatrics, Oncology & Hematology, Medical & Surgical, and Behavioral Health units) have been selected for an ongoing evaluation of the quality of automatically proactively delivered evidence and its usefulness in development of care plans...|$|E
