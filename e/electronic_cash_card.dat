40|$|Introduction: As of January 01, 2007, {{electronic}} {{locking devices}} based on {{proof of age}} (<b>electronic</b> <b>cash</b> <b>cards</b> or European driving licenses) were installed on 500, 000 cigarette vending machines across Germany to restrict the purchase of cigarettes to those {{over the age of}} 16 years. In 2009, the age limit was raised to 18 years. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the number of cigarette vending machines and other commercial sources before and after the enactment of the new law and to examine the association between commercial cigarette sources and area socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: We recorded and mapped using Geographical Information System software the total number of commercial cigarette sources in 4 selected districts in the major German city of Cologne. The city was the ideal setting for this study as we were able to use existing sociogeographical data from this area. We compiled a complete inventory of commercial cigarette sources in autumn 2005 and 2009. An interim inventory was also completed in 2007. Results: Between 2005 and 2009, the total number of cigarette sources decreased from 369 to 325 within the study area.

Electronic payments systems have this advantage because it is cheaper to move electrons than it is to move paper.

But with each of these {{traditional}} payments methods, the problem of fraud has been kept at a manageable level. To {{be successful in the}} marketplace, newer forms of payment such as <b>electronic</b> <b>cash</b> and stored-value <b>cards</b> will need to hold fraud risk to similarly low levels.; Will fraud hinder development of the new payments media? The natural advantages of electronic systems for storing, copying, and manipulating data can be a drawback {{when it comes to the}} risk of fraud. This article considers how certain features of new forms of payment differ from more traditional forms and whether these features will detract from marketplace acceptance of the new media. The author concludes that successful payments systems will have to confront various trade-offs posed by the risk of fraud. They will need to balance the costs and benefits of fraud abatement, balance security of payments systems with consumers' desire for privacy, and encourage development of new, more efficient payments systems while ensuring equitable treatment of participants.
