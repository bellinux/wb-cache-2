40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} and operating characteristics of 5 kW-class solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine (SOFC/GT) hybrid systems for two different configura-tions, namely single- and dual- spool gas turbines. Both single and dual spool turbo-chargers are widely used in the gas turbine industry. Even though their operation {{is based on the}} same physical principles, their performance characteristics and operation parameters vary considerably due to different designs. The implications of the differences on the performance of the hybrid SOFC/GT have not been discussed in literature, and will be the topic of this paper. Operating envelops of single and <b>dual</b> <b>shaft</b> systems are identified and compared. Performance in terms of system efficiency and load following is analyzed. Sensitivities of key variables such as power, SOFC temperature, and GT shaft speed to the control inputs (namely, fuel flow, SOFC current, generator load) are charac-terized, all in an attempt to gain insights on the design implication for the single and <b>dual</b> <b>shaft</b> SOFC/GT systems. Dynamic analysis are also performed for part load operation and load transitions, which shed lights for the development of safe and optimal control strategies. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4004471]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of aeroengines with increasing thrust capabilities requires the {{development of}} shaft technology {{to deal with this}} greater power transmission, whilst still restricting their dimensions and weight. Modern aerospace drive shafts are predominantly of a single-alloy design and significant benefits could be obtained from using a <b>dual</b> alloy <b>shaft,</b> where a high temperature alloy is used at the turbine, i. e. hot, end of the shaft and a high strength alloy is used for the spline end of the shaft, where high strength is required, rather than high temperature performance. Whilst the processes of joining dissimilar materials are widely used the evolution of the joint and its strength characteristics are not fully understood. A program of research has been instigated to lead to an improved understanding of friction welds and their behaviour under monotonic and cyclic loadings with the overall objective to establish confidence in the welding parameters for these material combinations and the associated post-weld heat treatments. This paper presents an overview of the mechanical testing program and the aims of this work, illustrated with some examples from the monotonic and cyclic test work carried out on inertia friction welded <b>dual</b> alloy <b>shaft</b> components...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the results of a joint academic and industrial study on the development of a detailed nonlinear dynamic model of a turbofan jet engine to be used for research into advanced control strategies for civil turbofan aircraft engines. The model is representative of a <b>dual</b> <b>shaft</b> engine with variable bleed, variable stator vanes, turbine cooling, heat transfer, and a duct and exhaust nozzle. A switched, gain-scheduled, feedback control system incorporating bumpless transfer and antiwindup functionality has been designed and implemented according to current industrial practice. This baseline implementation permits realistic transient operation of the simulation and may act as a reference design for further control work. The simulation computes a non-iterative solution, by progressing calculations {{in the direction of the}} gas stream flow. Where possible the underlying physics are used and empirical approximations are avoided so that the model requires minimum data. This approach also makes a future inclusion of component failure easier to implement. The simulation is modular in nature so that engine or control modules can be easily replaced or modified if an improved design becomes available. The Simulink implementation of the control architecture has been redesigned to permit the addition or removal of control loops, also during the simulationâ€™s operation, to allow testing of advanced control strategies. The entire controller can also be easily replaced. A detailed description of the modeling process, the various simulation issues that arise with a model of this complexity, and the results of the overall aero-engine system are presented. The design of the switched, gain-scheduled aero-engine controller with bumpless transfer and antiwindup which achieves dynamic performance that closely matches that of a real aero-engine is also discussed.

40|$|A Master Thesis Research {{has been}} {{undertaken}} {{with the goal}} of investigating the potential of micro gas turbines as propulsion system of choice for small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) used in civil applications. The UAV market is likely to develop great economic and technological importance on a near future because of the wide variety of applications and the added value related to the unmanned vehicles. In this regard, research focused on improving UAV capabilities is strictly related to UAV propulsion systems; as a matter of fact, aircraft performance is dependent on the mass of the power-plant and its specific fuel consumption since these can have a very significant effect on the reduction in size or increase in range of the UAV. An Exploration Study is performed both in the fields of UAV technology and of Micro Gas Turbine technology. These two areas are covered {{in order to understand the}} possible advantages and limitations of micro gas turbine engines compared to alternative propulsion concepts (e. g. electric and reciprocating engines) when used for a specific application. After the identification of a significant Case Study, a conceptual design of a high-potential UAV micro gas turbine based propulsion system is performed. Prediction of scale effects is important within the framework of turbine conceptual design where the power output is varied in order to optimize the mission performance in which the turbine is integrated. To this end, engine cycle optimization using Gas turbine Simulation Program (GSP) is carried out. Furthermore, an "Aircraft Study" is performed in a correlated Master Thesis Project in which the aerodynamic and flight performance model of a baseline UAV is developed. After the model validation, results from the micro gas turbine model are integrated and the performance of the new UAV configuration is investigated. The final engine configuration is a 77 kW <b>dual</b> <b>shaft</b> turboprop which is further implemented into the UAV platform redesigned accordingly to the reduced weight and improved performance. The mission model estimates for this configuration an endurance of 28. 7 hours, with a range of 4419 km and a payload weight of 250 kg, with a significant fuel reduction of 12. 5 % compared to the original UAV configuration. The effect of power setting at cruise and the engine weight reduction allows the turboprop to arguably showcase overall better mission performance. As a result of the work carried out in this Master Thesis Project, a valuable tool for understanding the contribution of micro gas turbine integration into civil UAV has been developed.

5000|$|The LD2 was the {{standard}} {{version of the}} Quad 4, and the first incarnation was introduced in 1987 for the 1988 model year. In base form, the Quad 4 put out [...] from 1988 to 1989 and [...] from 1990 to 1992. GM was able to produce the [...] with neither a turbo, nor an EGR system to pass emission standards; it required a 9.5:1 compression ratio. The base Quad 4 saw several slight changes during its production run including different crankshafts, cams, and manifolds, all meant to increase torque and lessen the NVH. There was also a transitional version of the LD2 in 1995, which displaced the same 2.3 liters as the early Quad 4 but featured the <b>dual</b> balance <b>shafts</b> of the later 2.4 L LD9 Twin Cam.|$|R

5000|$|The final {{incarnation}} of the 128 SOHC engine was modified to utilise 16 valves and <b>dual</b> cam <b>shafts.</b> The engine (using the designation [...] "Torque") featured the bore-spacing, bore and stroke of the 1580 cc 159/160 series engine with a new 16 valve DOHC cylinder-head. To incorporate the extra oil-return-paths and symmetrical head (as opposed to the asymmetrical SOHC head) the cylinder-block was slightly revised making the DOHC head non-interchangeable with the previous incarnations of the 128 engine. The [...] "Torque" [...] engine (178.B3 - 182.A4) powered the Brava/Bravo, Marea and Multipla Fiat automobiles {{as well as the}} second-generation Lancia Delta (never sold in the UK), finally ending production in 1999 for the European market.

5000|$|The first {{generation}} RDX {{is powered by}} turbocharged gasoline engines; at the time, this was uncommon among Honda vehicles although it has since become common. The 2.3-litre straight-4 K23A1 engine has all-aluminum construction, an i-VTEC head, and <b>dual</b> balance <b>shafts.</b> It {{is also one of}} the only four-cylinder powered luxury SUVs. Honda's variable flow turbocharger reduces turbo lag by using a valve to narrow the exhaust passage at low rpm, increasing the velocity of the exhaust flow and keeping the turbine spinning rapidly. At higher rpm, the valve opens to allow more exhaust flow for increased boost. The engine also features a top-mounted intercooler which receives air from the grille, channeled by ducting under the hood. The Acura RDX engine is rated at [...] at 6000 rpm with a torque peak of 260 ftlbf Nm at 4500 rpm. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated fuel mileage is 19 mpg city and 23 mpg highway miles per gallon. Driving style and the terrain plays an important part in this Vehicle's fuel economy. Uphill driving, frequent lane changes and sudden accelerations can increase turbo usage to increase torque output to the SH-AWD system and thus cause much higher fuel consumption. New more recent EPA mileage estimates as of February 2007 are 17 mpg city and 22 mpg highway. The required fuel is premium 91 octane unleaded.|$|R
