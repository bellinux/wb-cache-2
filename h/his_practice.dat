5|$|Hastings first rose to {{prominence}} {{as a result}} of the Case of the Hooded Man in 1912, and became noted for his skill at cross-examinations. After his success in Gruban v Booth in 1917, <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> steadily grew, and in 1919 he became a King's Counsel (KC). Following various successes as a KC in cases such as Sievier v Wootton and Russell v Russell, <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> was put on hold in 1922 when he was returned as the Labour Member of Parliament for Wallsend. Hastings was appointed Attorney General for England and Wales in 1924, by the first Labour government, and knighted. His authorisation of the prosecution of J. R. Campbell in what became known as the Campbell Case, however, led to the fall of the government after less than a year in power.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson {{recorded}} slave births in his Farm Book. Unlike <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> in recording births {{of other}} slaves, {{he did not}} note the father of Hemings' children.|$|E
5|$|Because {{his brother}} Orlando {{had become a}} medical doctor, Hugo decided at first to follow in his footsteps. At age seventeen, he left school and {{enrolled}} at Birmingham Medical School. However, it was Orlando who suggested that Hugo should enroll at the University of Alabama School of Law. After graduating in June 1906, he moved back to Ashland and established a legal practice. <b>His</b> <b>practice</b> was not successful there, so Black moved to Birmingham in 1907 where he specialized in labor law and personal injury cases.|$|E

5|$|Breathitt {{was educated}} {{at home and}} in the public schools of his native state. His family moved to Logan County, Kentucky in 1800, and he {{continued}} his education there. In early adulthood, he was appointed as a deputy surveyor in Illinois Territory. He then returned to Kentucky to teach in a country school. He invested his income in land purchases, and shortly amassed enough wealth to sustain him for a few years. Financially stable, he resolved to read law under Judge Caleb Wallace. He was admitted to the bar of Russellville, Kentucky in 1810 and opened <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> there.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{received}} his early {{education in the}} schools of Elizabethtown, and in 1851, {{at the age of}} sixteen, matriculated at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. In 1855, he graduated from Centre and returned to Hardin County to read law. He was admitted to the bar in 1857 and opened <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> in Elizabethtown. His reputation as an orator put him in high demand, but his zealous criticism of the Know Nothing Party drew threats against his life.|$|E
5|$|Bryce Hendrie, whose {{office was}} {{next door to}} Louis Champion's, had been {{appointed}} commanding officer of the Rhodesian contingent to attend the coronation of King George V on 22 June 1911. Before his departure to England, he offered Guest the management of <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> during his absence. Hendrie's brother was an estate agent and put all his property transfers through the firm, so Guest gained much valuable experience, especially in conveyancing, {{through a number of}} cases in the High Court, in the Magistrate's Court and in the Court of the Mining Commissioner.|$|E

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1906, Mahler had been {{director}} of the Vienna Hofoper for nine years. Throughout this time <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> was to leave Vienna {{at the close of}} the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this haven had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No.4, No.5, No.6 and No.7 symphonies, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder ("Songs on the Death of Children").|$|E
5|$|Crittenden began {{a college}} preparatory {{curriculum}} at Pisgah Academy in Woodford County. He was {{then sent to}} a boarding school in Jessamine County. Among his classmates were Thomas Alexander Marshall and Francis P. Blair. Crittenden became especially close friends with Blair, and later political differences did little to diminish their friendship. After a year at boarding school, Crittenden moved to the Lexington, Kentucky, home of Judge George M. Bibb to study law. He began his tertiary studies at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in Lexington, Virginia. During his brief tenure there, he studied mathematics and belles-lettres and became friends with Hugh Lawson White. Crittenden was dissatisfied with the curriculum at Washington College and matriculated to the College of William and Mary. He studied under St. George Tucker and became acquainted with John Tyler. Crittenden completed his studies in 1806, and {{was admitted to the}} bar the following year. He began <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> in Woodford County, but as central Kentucky was well already supplied with able lawyers, he moved to Logan County, Kentucky, on the then western frontier and opened <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> in Russellville. At age twenty-two, he was appointed by Governor Ninian Edwards of Illinois Territory as its attorney general. The following year, Edwards also made Crittenden his aide-de-camp.|$|E
5|$|For a {{year after}} graduation, Stanley served as chair of belles-lettres at Christian College in Hustonville, Kentucky. The {{following}} year, he was principal of Marion Academy in Bradfordsville, then {{spent two years in}} the same position at Mackville Academy in Mackville. While he held these positions, he studied law under Gilbert Cassiday. He was admitted to the bar in 1894, and opened <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> in Flemingsburg, Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Guest became {{acquainted with}} Fred Hopley, who had {{recently}} been practising in Bulawayo. He informed Guest that a solicitor in Bulawayo, Louis Champion, wanted someone to take over <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> for six months while he was away on a shooting trip. Guest's application was accepted by return of post and {{he was asked to}} report early in July 1910. Champion's practice, as Deputy Sheriff, consisted mainly of debt-collecting and lending money to doubtful borrowers at a high rate of interest.|$|E
5|$|He {{established}} <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> in Lower Manhattan {{in general}} surgery and medicine, treating {{both black and}} white patients. He started a school in the evenings, teaching children. He established what has been called the first black-owned and operated pharmacy in the United States, located at 93 West Broadway (near present-day Foley Square). His friends and activists gathered in the back room of the pharmacy to discuss issues related to their work in abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>practice</b> of {{dividing}} {{his time}} between Britain and America caused Wodehouse difficulties with the tax authorities of both countries. Both the UK Inland Revenue and the US Internal Revenue Service sought to tax him as a resident. After lengthy negotiations the matter was settled, but the Wodehouses decided to change their residential status beyond doubt by moving to France, where they bought a house near Le Touquet in northern France.|$|E

5|$|His {{success in}} Gruban v Booth allowed Hastings to switch <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> {{from the county}} courts to the High Court, and at the {{beginning}} of Hilary term 1919 he applied to become a King's Counsel (KC). Becoming a KC was a risk; he would go from competing with other junior barristers to coming up against the finest minds in the profession. Despite this he decided to take the risk, and he was accepted later that year.|$|E
5|$|In August 1834, George Mackenzie died of cholera. With his supervising lawyer dead, Macdonald {{remained}} at the cousin's law office in Hallowell (today Picton, Ontario). In 1835, Macdonald returned to Kingston, and even though not yet of age nor qualified, began <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> as a lawyer, hoping to gain his former employer's clients. Macdonald's parents and sisters also returned to Kingston, and Hugh Macdonald became a bank clerk.|$|E
5|$|In {{qualifying}} Hamilton {{took his}} first pole position {{as part of a}} McLaren one-two. Heidfeld improved on <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> performance to take third position, in front of the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Massa. Massa shared the third row with Mark Webber, who {{did not seem to be}} suffering the same braking problem that almost put teammate David Coulthard out in the first session of qualifying, he had only one attempt at a lap in the second session as a result. Nico Rosberg, Robert Kubica, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli completed the top ten.|$|E
50|$|Reeves {{was struck}} from the {{register}} of doctors (forbidden to practice medicine) in 1999, {{on the grounds}} that he had breached the Medical Board's 1997 ban on <b>his</b> <b>practicing</b> obstetrics, and had thus been guilty of gross misconduct.|$|R

5|$|Named {{board members}} were Paul, his wife, and his father-in-law. The NBO was never itself {{accepted}} as an accrediting entity by {{organizations such as}} the American Board of Medical Specialties, and its certification was considered invalid by many hospitals and insurance companies. Paul let his own ABO certification lapse in 2005, which did not affect <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> in Kentucky, since the state does not require board certification.|$|E
5|$|Once out of politics, Rutherford {{returned}} to his law practice. His partnership with Jamieson saw partners come and go. Rutherford divided his time between the original Strathcona office and the Edmonton office he opened in 1910; <b>his</b> <b>practice</b> focussed on contracts, real estate, wills and estates, and incorporations. In 1923, Rutherford's son Cecil joined the firm along with Stanley Harwood McCuaig, who in 1919 would marry Rutherford's daughter Hazel. In 1925, Jamieson left the partnership to establish his own firm. In 1939, McCuaig did the same. Cecil's partnership with his father continued until the latter's death.|$|E
5|$|Schouler {{leaves the}} city to become a cattle rancher. Before he goes, he secretly, in order to ruin his former friend, reports McTeague for {{practicing}} dentistry without a license.

Even though she has saved over $200 {{in addition to the}} original $5,000 from the lottery ticket, Trina is unwilling to spend her money. Money becomes increasingly scarce, with the couple forced to sell their possessions. McTeague finally snaps and bites Trina's fingers in a fit of rage. Later, he goes fishing to earn money, taking Trina's savings (now totaling $450).|$|E
