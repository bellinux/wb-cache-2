5000|$|Although {{it never}} uses the term, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is episcopal, rather than presbyterian or congregational, {{in the sense}} that it has a strict {{hierarchy}} of leadership from the local bishop/branch president up to a single prophet/president, believed to be personally authorized and guided by Jesus Christ. Local congregations (branches, wards, and stakes) have <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> <b>boundaries</b> by which members are allocated, and membership records are centralized. This system developed gradually from a more presbyterian polity (Joseph Smith's original title in 1830 was [...] "First Elder") for pragmatic and doctrinal reasons, reaching a full episcopacy during the Nauvoo period (1839-1846).|$|R
5000|$|For a {{young and}} loosely defined nation, the {{building}} of a national railway was an active attempt at state-making, as well as an aggressive capitalist venture. Canada, a nascent country with a population of 3.5 million in 1871, lacked the means to exercise meaningful de facto control within the <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> political <b>boundaries</b> of the recently acquired Rupert's Land; building a transcontinental railway was national policy of high order to change this situation. [...] Moreover, after the American Civil War the American frontier rapidly expanded west with land-hungry settlers, exacerbating talk of annexation. Indeed, sentiments of Manifest Destiny were abuzz in this time: in 1867, year of Confederation, US Secretary of State W.H. Seward surmised that the whole North American continent [...] "shall be, sooner or later, within the magic circle of the American Union." [...] Therefore, preventing American investment into the project was considered as being in Canada's national interest. Thus the federal government favoured an [...] "all Canadian route" [...] through the rugged Canadian Shield of northern Ontario, refusing to consider a less costly route passing south through Wisconsin and Minnesota.|$|R

Following Plantinga, we can call this a “proper” <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> objection—a <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> objection that {{does not depend on}} any de facto objection. In his Warranted Christian Belief, Plantinga has produced a general argument against all proper <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> objections.

40|$|Most {{discussions of}} Kripke's Naming and Necessity focus either on Kripke's {{so-called}} "historical theory of reference" or his thesis that names are rigid designators. But {{in response to}} problems of the rigidity thesis Kripke later points out that his thesis about proper names is a stronger one: proper names are <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rigid. This sets the agenda for my paper. Certain problems raised for Kripke's view show {{that the notion of}} <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rigidity is in need of clarification. I will try to clarify the notion of <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rigidity by analyzing characterizations of it given in the literature. I will argue in particular that Kripke can count descriptive names as <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rigid and that the concept of <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rigidity should not be explained with recourse to the concept of a semantical rule. The second part of the paper is a critical discussion of arguments intended to show that proper names are not <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rigid. I will show that these arguments are unconvincing by using Dummett's distinction between assertoric content and ingredient sense...|$|R
5000|$|De facto {{recognition}} of states, rather than <b>de</b> <b>jure,</b> is rare. <b>De</b> <b>jure</b> recognition is stronger, while {{de facto recognition}} is more tentative and recognizes only that a government exercises control over a territory. An example of the difference is when the United Kingdom recognized the Soviet state de facto in 1921, but <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> only in 1924. Another example {{is the state of}} Israel in 1948, whose government was immediately recognized de facto by the United States and three days later by Soviet <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> recognition. Also, the Republic of China, commonly known as [...] "Taiwan", is generally recognized as de facto independent and sovereign, but is not universally recognized as <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> independent due to the complex political status of Taiwan related to the United Nation's de-recognization of it in favor of the People's Republic of China in 1971.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to have multiple simultaneous conflicting (<b>de</b> <b>jure)</b> legalities, possibly none of which is in force (de facto). After seizing power in 1526, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi made his brother, Umar Din, the lawful (<b>de</b> <b>jure)</b> Sultan of Adal. Ahmad, however, was in practice (de facto) the actual Sultan, and his brother was a figurehead. [...] Between 1805 and 1914, the ruling dynasty of Egypt ruled as <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> viceroys of the Ottoman Empire, but acted as de facto independent rulers who maintained a polite fiction of Ottoman suzerainty. However, from about 1882, the rulers had only <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> rule over Egypt, as it had by then become a British puppet state. Thus, Egypt was by Ottoman law <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> a province of the Ottoman Empire, but de facto {{was part of the}} British Empire.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAmong other virtues, Mental Files Theory {{provides}} a straightforward explanation of <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> coreference, i. e. identity of referent guaranteed by meaning alone: <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> coreference holds between terms when these {{are associated with}} the same mental file from which they inherit their reference. In this paper, I discuss an objection that Angel Pinillos raises against Mental Files Theory and other similar theories: the theory predicts that <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> coreference should be transitive, just like identity. Yet there are cases, involving ‘slash-terms’, in which transitivity fails, or so it seems. In his book Mental Files, Recanati replies that the mental files theorist can accommodate Pinillos’ exceptions by offering a refined model of merging files, the ‘partial merging’ model. While agreeing with Recanati on the need for such a model, I contend that, pace Recanati and Pinillos, <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> coreference is transitive even in the presence of slash-terms. I will first show that paradoxical consequences ensue if slash-terms are said to <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> corefer with several basic terms at once. Then, building on two different accounts Recanati gives of referential confusion, I will show that on both views, <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> coreference cannot hold because of the behaviour of confused slash-terms. I will conclude that, in Mental Files Theory, a slash-term can, at most, <b>de</b> <b>jure</b> corefer with only one basic term per context...|$|R
