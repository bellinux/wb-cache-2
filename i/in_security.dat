In {{the early days}} of the conflict the trail was used strictly for the infiltration of manpower. This was due to the fact that Hanoi could supply its southern allies much more efficiently by sea.|$|E
5|$|In October 2017, it was {{reported}} that a flaw in a code library developed by Infineon, which had been in widespread use <b>in</b> <b>security</b> products such as smartcards and TPMs, enabled private keys to be inferred from public keys. This could allow an attacker to bypass BitLocker encryption when an affected TPM chip is used. Microsoft released an updated version of the firmware for Infineon TPM chips that fixes the flaw via Windows Update.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century it was clear that Gibraltar could be bombarded with {{relative}} impunity from the Spanish mainland. Proposals were put forward to build a new harbour {{on the east side of}} the Rock, where ships would be less vulnerable to direct artillery fire from the mainland, but were abandoned due to the vast expense and only marginal gains <b>in</b> <b>security.</b> A new round of tunnelling was carried out to provide more bombproof accommodation for the garrison, along with deep shelters and casemates capable of accommodating 2,000 men. Ultimately it was decided in 1906 that Gibraltar faced no credible threat from land and that the defences would be organised to deal with a threat from the sea.|$|E
50|$|Interests <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> {{are always}} intangible. The only {{evidence}} of them comprises electronic records. Interests <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> confer property rights {{in relation to}} the underlying <b>securities,</b> and <b>in</b> some cases these underlying securities comprise tangible bearer instruments. However, {{this does not mean that}} interests <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> are themselves tangible. They are unallocated, and therefore do not attach to any tangible asset.|$|R
50|$|Interests <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> {{cannot be}} the subject of {{bailment}}, since the essence of bailment is the delivery of possession without the delivery of title.

5|$|Camp {{guards were}} members of the SS-Totenkopfverbände (Death's Head Units). Around 7,000 SS {{personnel}} in total were posted to Auschwitz during the war. Of these, 4 percent of SS personnel were officers and 26 percent were non-commissioned officers, while the remainder were rank-and-file members. Approximately three in four SS personnel worked <b>in</b> <b>security.</b> Others worked in the medical or political departments, in the camp headquarters, or in the economic administration, which was responsible for the property of dead prisoners. SS personnel at the camp included 200 women, who worked as guards, nurses, or messengers. The overall command authority for the entire camp was Department D (the Concentration Camps Inspectorate) of the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt (SS Economics Main Office; SS-WVHA).|$|E
5|$|Following the battalion's {{return from}} East Timor {{it was again}} {{restructured}} to resume {{its role as a}} two-company commando battalion. However, in 2001 the Australian Government directed the permanent establishment of a second TAG {{to be based on the}} east coast of Australia. The TAG is supplemented by clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch who form the Water troop. A Company was subsequently raised as a commando company in 2002. Following the creation of SOCOMD in 2002 and the Bali bombings in October that year, further resources became available. The battalion was subsequently involved <b>in</b> <b>security</b> operations for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Queensland in 2002. Elements of the battalion were also involved in the boarding of a North Korean freighter, the MV Pong Su—which was suspected of drug smuggling—off Newcastle on 20 April 2003. In 2005, a fourth commando company was subsequently raised, with D Company being formed. Later, the battalion was tasked with supporting the security arrangements for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. In 2014, elements of the regiment were deployed to Brisbane to protect the G20 Leaders Summit held in the city on 15 and 16 November.|$|E
5|$|In September 1942, Groves {{took charge}} of the Manhattan Project. He was {{involved}} in most aspects of the atomic bomb's development. He participated in the selection of sites for research and production at Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Los Alamos, New Mexico; and Hanford, Washington. He directed the enormous construction effort, made critical decisions on the various methods of isotope separation, acquired raw materials, directed the collection of military intelligence on the German nuclear energy project and helped select the cities in Japan that were chosen as targets. Groves wrapped the Manhattan Project <b>in</b> <b>security</b> but failed to prevent the Soviet Union from conducting a successful espionage program that stole some of its most important secrets.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{campaign}} contributions to lead plaintiffs — “pay to play’’ — {{on the level of}} attorneys’ fees <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> class actions. We find that state pension funds generally pay lower attorneys’ fees when they serve as lead plaintiffs <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> class actions than do individual investors serving in that capacity. This differential disappears, however, when we control for campaign contributions made to officials with influence over state pension funds. Thus, pay to play appears to increase agency costs borne by shareholders <b>in</b> <b>securities</b> class actions...|$|R

5|$|In September 2008, Garry McGuire {{announced}} that 24 of 80 employees were {{being laid off}} and the days of operation would be reduced from 7 to 3 per week. Attendance figures had never reached either original or updated projections, causing the facility to operate annually in the red since its opening. In November, he {{announced that}} the property would be sold due to unsustainable debt. The museum closed on Friday, November 21, 2008. The closure was without warning; visitors who had arrived for scheduled events found a paper notice at the entrance that the center was temporarily closed. The next days' events involving chef Andrew Carmellini and singer Joni Morris were also abruptly cancelled; the museum later stated that it would reopen on December 1. On that day, the organization (with $80 million ($ today) in debt) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The federal bankruptcy court blocked a $2 million ($ today) emergency loan with priority <b>in</b> <b>security,</b> leaving Copia with no funds to resume operations.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, the five hijackers arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport. At 07:15, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Majed Moqed checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, {{arriving}} at the passenger security checkpoint {{a few minutes later}} at 07:18. Both men set off the metal detector and were put through secondary screening. Moqed continued to set off the alarm, so he was searched with a hand wand. The Hazmi brothers checked in together at the ticket counter at 07:29. Hani Hanjour checked in separately and arrived at the passenger security checkpoint at 07:35. Hanjour was followed minutes later at the checkpoint by Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who also set off the metal detector's alarm. The screener at the checkpoint never resolved what set off the alarm. As seen <b>in</b> <b>security</b> footage later released, Nawaf Hazmi appeared to have an unidentified item in his back pocket. Utility knives up to four inches were permitted at the time by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as carry-on items. The passenger security checkpoint at Dulles International Airport was operated by Argenbright Security, under contract with United Airlines.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Obsidian have {{temporarily}} {{abandoned the}} vessel {{in order to allow}} it to pass through a black hole. The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded, intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed through the black hole. A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its flight path, leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it will be destroyed. Only one member of the crew has the skills necessary to return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass through the black hole, this is the game's player character. The astronaut is forced to contend with the Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted <b>in</b> <b>security</b> robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active. Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and reset the station's flight path, there is a limited time to teleport back to the smaller shielded craft before the Obsidian's engines carry the astronaut through the black hole without being shielded.|$|E

5|$|Tung {{was born}} in 1923 in central Vietnam, which was then the {{protectorate}} of Annam in French Indochina. The former servant of the Ngô family was devoutly Roman Catholic, short and bespectacled. Tung had a military background almost entirely <b>in</b> <b>security</b> and counterespionage, which was an unusual basis for leading the special forces. Tung had first served the French as a security officer in Central Vietnam. He then worked for Diệm as a lieutenant in the military security service in Central Vietnam. As a high-ranking official in Nhu's Cần Lao, the secret Catholic political apparatus which maintained the Ngô family's grip on power, Tung raised party funds by extorting money from wealthy businessmen. Tung was primarily known among colleagues for his unwavering loyalty to Diệm. In 1960, he was promoted straight {{to the rank of}} colonel and placed in charge of the special forces. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) regarded Tung as the third most powerful man in South Vietnam behind Diệm and Nhu, thereby ranking him as South Vietnam's most powerful military officer.|$|E
5|$|With his war service loan, Whitlam built a {{house in}} seaside Cronulla. He also bought the block of land next door, using the prize money (£1,000 <b>in</b> <b>security</b> bonds) he {{received}} for winning the Australian National Quiz Championship in 1948 and 1949 (he was runner-up in 1950). He sought {{to make a career}} in the ALP there, but local Labor supporters were sceptical of Whitlam's loyalties, given his privileged background. In the postwar years, he practised law, concentrating on landlord/tenant matters, and sought to build his bona fides in the party. He ran twice—unsuccessfully—for the local council, once (also unsuccessfully) for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and campaigned for other candidates. In 1951, Bert Lazzarini, the Labor member for the Federal electorate of Werriwa, announced that he would stand down at the next election. Whitlam won the preselection as ALP candidate. Lazzarini died in 1952 before completing his term and Whitlam was elected to the House of Representatives in the ensuing by-election on 29 November 1952. Whitlam trebled Lazzarini's majority in a 12per cent swing to Labor.|$|E
