5|$|A return {{match against}} Surrey began on Thursday, 29 August, at Clifton College Close Ground and Gloucestershire were {{fortunate}} {{to get a}} draw after being forced to follow on. For once this season, Grace struggled to take wickets and could manage only 1–86 in Surrey's total of 232 which was made over two days because of rain. Gloucestershire struggled to 84–9 at the close on Friday, Grace out for 3, and were immediately dismissed for 84 on Saturday. Grace was out for 25 in the second innings but Fred again {{came to the rescue}} with 63 as Gloucestershire held on for the draw, scoring 161–4. An oft-recounted incident involving Grace occurred in this match. While he was batting, he had run three when a fielder's throw caused the ball to lodge in <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> and he seized the opportunity to complete several runs before the fielders forced him to stop. He disingenuously claimed that he would have been out handled the ball if he had removed it and, following a discussion, the umpires agreed that only the initial three runs should be awarded as the ball was dead (out of play) when it went into <b>his</b> <b>shirt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Barton {{would have}} made his debut for the City first team in November 2002 against Middlesbrough, had he not lost <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> after leaving it on the {{substitutes}} bench at half-time. He eventually made his first-team debut for the club against Bolton Wanderers on 5 April 2003. His first senior goal came two weeks later in a 2–0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on Good Friday. He ended the 2002–03 season with a run of seven consecutive starts.|$|E
5|$|He {{was also}} noted as a joker on the pitch. After the {{replay of the}} Scottish Cup Final against Celtic in 1963 he stuffed the match ball up <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> and later gave it to a new member of the team. The SFA insisted that the ball should be returned, and Rangers sent them a ball, but {{possibly}} not the match ball.|$|E
50|$|He {{finished}} his football {{career as a}} scout for Cardiff City. He died in Barry in 1982, {{at the age of}} 83. In 2008, his descendants loaned <b>his</b> <b>shirts</b> from the 1927, 1930 and 1932 FA Cup Finals to the Arsenal FC Museum.|$|R
25|$|Because of his humour, {{but also}} because of his {{athletic}} achievements and his combative playing style, Klinsmann quickly became extremely popular in England; over 150,000 of <b>his</b> <b>shirts</b> were sold.

At {{the end of the}} season, he was bought by Chelsea as the club's then record signing for £24million. <b>His</b> <b>shirt</b> from his only season at Marseille is also framed in the basilica of Marseille, Notre-Dame de la Garde, which he presented to the church before the 2004 UEFA Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|As {{a tribute}} to his then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a {{childbirth}} scene by stuffing the ball under <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> and {{lying on his back}} while his teammates extracted the ball. His current ritual of sucking his thumb after a goal began after his son was born and continued after the birth of his daughter. Blasi has revealed that Totti also sucks his thumb in dedication to her and not just for their children. On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the Derby della Capitale as Roma came back from 2–0 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.|$|E

50|$|On 1 January 2017, Nike {{announced}} that Day was joining Nike Golf {{ahead of the}} SBS Tournament of Champions at Kapalua the following week. It was {{announced that}} he will wear Nike clothes, shoes and gloves, following the brand's decision to stop making clubs and balls. Nike Golf unveiled a commercial to announce the multi-year sponsorship deal worth a reported $10m a year. Day was known to have the RBC logo on the collar of <b>his</b> <b>shirts,</b> but because Nike does not allow other sponsorships to be seen on their apparel, his sponsorship contract with RBC was not renewed. He continues to wear the Lexus logo on the left sleeve of <b>his</b> <b>shirts,</b> as he previously did before using Nike apparel.|$|R

5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, {{and that there was no}} blood on <b>his</b> <b>shirt.</b> Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Brown enters another room {{surrounded}} by people in animal heads, and performs the third dance sequence in the video with his backup dancers. Towards {{the end of the}} chorus, Brown and his dancers appear back inside the main room and continue dancing. At one point, the video is slowed down as Brown and his dancers do flips. In other scenes, he is seen dancing alone with a cane in a rain-filled room, wearing white dress pants, a black tank top and a fedora. Brown then splits into three people, comes back together, takes off <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> and throws it at the camera, causing its lens to crack.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, German {{manufacturer}} Adidas and Murray {{signed a}} five-year-deal worth £30 million. This included wearing their range of tennis shoes. The contract with Adidas allowed Murray to keep <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> sleeve sponsors Shiatzy Chen, Royal Bank of Scotland and Highland Spring. Before he {{was signed by}} Adidas in late 2009, he wore Fred Perry apparel. At {{the end of their}} contract together Adidas decided not to re-sign with Murray, and he began a 4-year partnership with athletic apparel company Under Armour in December 2014, reportedly worth $25 million. Murray uses Head rackets, and regularly appears in advertisements for the brand.|$|E

5|$|The {{match is}} mostly remembered for Billy Bremner and Kevin Keegan being jointly {{dismissed}} {{from the field}} by referee Bob Matthewson in the 60th minute after they had a fight. Keegan, who claimed provocation, was furious about being sent off and threw <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> away. Bremner copied him and the two players were afterwards charged with bringing football into disrepute. The FA Disciplinary Committee imposed tough punishments but were themselves heavily criticised by people in football who doubted their competence.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E
5|$|After three {{consecutive}} three-day matches, which involved playing in nine {{days out of}} ten, Miller sat out the next match against Surrey at The Oval, which Australia won by an innings. He returned to take seven wickets in the next fixture against Cambridge University. In the first innings, he resumed his battle with John Dewes, whom he had troubled during the Victory Tests in 1945. This time, Dewes put a thick towel under <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> for protection against an anticipated short-pitched barrage; instead, Miller followed a short ball with a yorker to dismiss him. He then took the last three wickets to end with 5/46 as the hosts were bowled out for 167 in the first innings. Miller was not required to bat as Australia amassed 4/414 declared then took 2/29 as his team completed an innings victory.|$|E
50|$|On December 5, 2013, {{the jury}} {{returned}} a verdict of not guilty.

5|$|Brazil defender and captain Thiago Silva was {{suspended}} for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards, despite an appeal against the suspension by the Brazilian Football Confederation. Forward Neymar was also unavailable for the match, having been sidelined {{for the rest of}} the tournament after suffering a fractured vertebra in the quarter-final match against Colombia. Dante and Bernard, making their first starts of the tournament, replaced Thiago Silva and Neymar respectively with Luiz Gustavo replacing Paulinho in defensive midfield. Germany were unchanged from their quarter-final. Goalkeeper Júlio César and stand-in captain David Luiz paid tribute to Neymar by holding <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> during the national anthem ceremony. Even with the absences, analysts expected a close match, feeling the home crowd could provide an advantage.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Bankhead was {{replaced}} by Lieutenant Colonel William S. Harney in 1839. Colonel Harney had two earlier encounters with Seminoles, the first a battle in which Chief Arpeika eluded capture, and a second in which Harney escaped in only <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> and drawers from an early morning attack (the Harney Massacre) on his camp led by Chief Chakaika. In light of these experiences, Harney instituted an intensive training program in swamp and jungle warfare for his men. After Chakaika led the raid on Indian Key in August 1840, Harney set out into the Everglades after Chakaika, and killed him in his own camp. The war quieted down after that, with active pursuit of the Seminoles ending in 1842, {{although some of the}} Seminoles remained hidden in the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{government}} put Ba Cụt on trial. During the proceedings, Ba Cụt theatrically removed <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> so {{that the}} public gallery could see how many scars he had suffered while fighting the communists. This, according to him, demonstrated his devotion to Vietnamese nationalism. He challenged any other man to show as many scars. The Diệmist judge was unimpressed. Ba Cụt {{was found guilty of}} multiple murders and sentenced to death. Diệm's adviser, Colonel Edward Lansdale from the CIA, was one of many who protested against the decision. Lansdale felt that the execution would tarnish Diệm—who had proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam) and declared himself President—and antagonise Ba Cụt's followers. Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm's younger brother and chief adviser, denied a reprieve as the army, particularly Minh, opposed any clemency. Some sections of the southern public, however, were sympathetic to Ba Cụt.|$|E
25|$|The {{first time}} Pooh {{and his friends}} {{appeared}} in colour was 1932, when he was drawn by Slesinger in <b>his</b> now-familiar red <b>shirt</b> and featured on an RCA Victor picture record.
