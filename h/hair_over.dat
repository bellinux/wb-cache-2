25|$|The {{identity}} of the artist is unknown. At some point the portrait was altered to cater to public demand for more pictures of the bard and to conform to 19th century ideas of Shakespeare. The <b>hair</b> <b>over</b> the forehead was scraped out and painted over to create a bald patch. It was also lengthened at the sides, an appearance associated with Shakespeare. The date was also altered to fit Shakespeare's age. The coat of arms was painted over. In this form the painting bore the date 1611 and purported to show Shakespeare {{at the age of}} 47.|$|E
25|$|After {{six months}} {{residency}} at Pinocchios, Spry started booking The Flies into Sydney {{where they were}} arrested for vagrancy for having <b>hair</b> <b>over</b> their shoulders, but it was great publicity making all the papers. Back in Melbourne, Spry employed Carole West to organise a publicity shoot for TV and press to display his band having their long hair done at a women's hair salon in South Yarra. During the shoot, Burns sang with his guitar and was joined by apprentice hairdresser Lynne Randell â€“ who was promptly signed by Spry and managed by West. In January 1965, they supported The Rolling Stones and Roy Orbison on their first Australian tour.|$|E
500|$|Universal {{makeup artist}} Jack Pierce paid special {{attention}} to the Monster's appearance in this film. He altered his 1931 design to display the after-effects of the mill fire, adding scars and shortening the Monster's <b>hair.</b> <b>Over</b> the course of filming, Pierce modified the Monster's makeup to indicate that the Monster's injuries were healing as the film progressed. Pierce co-created the Bride's makeup with strong input from Whale, especially regarding the Bride's iconic hair style, based on Nefertiti. Lanchester's hair was given a Marcel wave over a wire frame to achieve the style. Lanchester disliked working with Pierce, who she said [...] "really did feel that he made these people, like he was a god... in the morning he'd be dressed in white as if he were in hospital to perform an operation." [...] To play Mary Shelley, Lanchester wore a white net dress embroidered with sequins of butterflies, stars, and moons, which the actress had heard required 17 women 12 weeks to make.|$|E

2500|$|The spiritual {{leaders of}} the {{confederation}} were called Babaylanes. Most of the Babaylanes were women who, for some reasons, the colonizers described as [...] "lascivious" [...] and astute. On certain ceremonial occasions, they put on elaborate apparel, which appear bizarre to Spaniards. They would wear yellow false <b>hair,</b> <b>over</b> which some kind of diadem adorn and, in their hands, they wielded straw fans. They were assisted by young apprentices who would carry some thin cane as for a wand.|$|E
2500|$|The {{documentary}} film, Festival (Murray Lerner, 1967), recorded how the [...] "clean-cut college kids" [...] {{who attended}} the Newport (Rhode Island) Folk Festival in 1963-4 had, by 1965 (when Bob Dylan caused a sensation at that year's festival by playing an electric guitar), become [...] "considerably scruffier": [...] "the hippies were waiting to be born". Among other things, the wearing of male neckties, which, in the mid-1960s, had often drawn on 19th century paisley patterns, declined as muttonchop whiskers and teashades (sunglasses) came in: {{by the time of}} the Chicago 7 trial (late 1969), <b>hair</b> <b>over</b> the collars had become so commonplace that it was beginning to transcend Bohemian style, taking on mass popularity in the 1970s.

2500|$|Soon after 2:35a.m., {{a man who}} {{was later}} given the {{pseudonym}} Alan Masters was driving through an intersection {{a few blocks from the}} park. Masters was nearly struck by what he described as a yellow Volkswagen Beetle that sped through the intersection without its headlights activated as the driver ignored a red light. Angered and alarmed, Masters followed the Volkswagen at high speed for several minutes before losing sight of the vehicle. Masters described the driver as a white male in his late 20s or early 30s, with a narrow face, dark, long, stringy hair, several days' growth of dark whiskers on his face, and wearing a blue jacket. Masters was upset and he neglected to note the Volkswagen's license plate number, but he thought that it might have been a New Jersey rather than a New York plate. Violante encountered a very similar man, because he and Moskowitz were in the park shortly before they were shot. Violante described him as a [...] "grubby-looking hippy" [...] with whiskers, wiry <b>hair</b> <b>over</b> his forehead, dark eyes, and wearing a denim jacket.|$|E

50|$|Slevin's mouse is a large-bodied mouse, {{measuring}} about 21 cm {{in total}} length, of which 10 cm are the tail.

50|$|Livingstone's fruit bats {{are mostly}} black in colour, with a {{scattering}} of golden or tawny <b>hairs</b> <b>over</b> the rump, belly, and flanks.
