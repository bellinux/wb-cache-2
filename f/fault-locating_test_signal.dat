40|$|Abstract – ADC testing {{frequently}} {{confronts the}} problem of spectral purity of harmonic <b>test</b> <b>signal.</b> The majority of dynamic ADC test methods require <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> distortion at least 10 dB {{less than that of}} the tested ADC – the condition that cannot be practically fulfilled for testing up-to-date ADCs.

40|$|A {{time-varying}} {{acoustic channel}} may be estimated by an appropriate inference using the output from a periodic <b>test</b> <b>signal.</b> In this paper it is shown {{how to do}} this in a way that takes full account of the past history of the background noise and the past history of the channel. An explicit formula is obtained for the optimal linear estimator that may be used for rapid channel estimation for a given <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> when we know the autocovariance or power spectrum of the interfering noise and the autocovariance of the echo channel variation. Given this closed formula for the optimal estimator of the channel impulse response, an efficient method for determining the optimal <b>test</b> <b>signal,</b> subject to a constraint on the <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> power, given the history of the channel and the noise, is developed. We show that if the second order statistics of the channel or the noise are known, then the optimal <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> is not white. The method includes an explicit formula for the optimal <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> given a fixed estimator. A model of channel variation which is realistic while having less complexity than a full second-order statistical model, and therefore is more amenable to robust estimation, is used in the experiments which illustrate the performance of the optimal <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> and the channel estimation method. Matrix calculus identities required for the derivation of this expression for the optimal estimator are stated and proved in the Appendixes 1 and 2. ...|$|R

40|$|The rotor {{position}} of a salient-pole permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) at standstill or rotating at low speed is often estimated by measuring the responses on high-frequency <b>test</b> <b>signals.</b> In some drives, the rotor position is computed by measuring important current ripples that are generated by supplying the PMSM periodically with high-frequency voltage test pulses. Besides these ripples, undesired distortions in the average-current samples have been measured. Simulation results have revealed that these distortions are caused by a <b>test</b> <b>signal,</b> as it produces a nonzero voltage deviation from the steady-state stator voltage. In this paper, a low-speed sensorless strategy is discussed where a strong reduction of the aforementioned distortions is obtained by adapting the <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> to the steady-state stator voltage. The main assumption is that an accurate estimation of the steady-state voltage is made by using the controller output.
