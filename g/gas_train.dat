40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityIt hae been {{proposed}} in the literature (18) that complexes between aromatic nitro compounds and aromatic bfdrocarbons are the reeult of an electron transfer from the hydrocarbon to the nitro compound with the resultant formation of ions. The conductivity of such a complex, that between anthracene and trinitrobenzene, was measured in liquid sulfur dioxide to teat this hypothesis. The conductivity of the complex {{was found to be}} the sum of the two components, which indicated no ions present in solution and pointed to the non-existence of the complex in solution. Spectral work done by R. W. Weston (20) supports the contention that the complex does not exist in solution. Ultraviolet absorption spectrum of the complex in liquid sulfur dioxide was the sum of the spectra of the two components. 	The conductivity of triphenylcarbinol was measured in liquid sulfur dioxide in a concentration range of 200 - 195, 000 liters per mole. With magnesium perchlorate as the drying agent in the <b>gas</b> <b>train</b> a drift at the initial concentration, as well as lower conductivities at the higher concentrations was noted, in contrast to the work of Glazer (3).

40|$|LecturePg. 67 - 76 This paper {{describes}} the design modifications and active balancing on a 19, 000 hp integrally forged steam turbine rotor {{to improve its}} dynamic characteristics and reliability. The turbine was purchased {{as a replacement for}} an identical turbine used in a syn <b>gas</b> <b>train.</b> Ever since original installation, the turbine had been plagued with high vibration problems on the coupling end, excessive bearing temperatures, and reduced coupling life. A rotordynamic analysis proved that there was sufficient separation margin between the turbine's operating speed and any critical speed. However, at operating speed, the rotor had a high vibration response at the coupling, even with a very small unbalance. A design modification was thus incorporated on the rotor to make it less sensitive to unbalance. At operating speed, this modification lowered the predicted coupling end shaft deflection to approximately a third of its original value. An active balancer was then assembled on the rotor to provide the flexibility of online trim balancing. The replacement turbine has been installed and is operating with the lowest vibration and bearing temperatures in the compressor train's history. Presented in this paper is an overview of the rotordynamic analysis, the shaft welding technique used to accomplish the rotor design changes, and the balancing with the active balancer. The techniques presented in this paper can be used to improve the mechanical reliability of other machines with similar problems...|$|E

The materials were selected based on their low pH, high C: N ratios or high cation exchange capacity. They included; filter mud (FM), sawdust (SD), a common by-product of the timber industry, maize stover (MS), wood ash (WA), Ondiri peat (OP), and coffee pulp (CP), a waste product from coffee factories. Manure samples equivalent to 40 g (dry weight basis) were combined with 20 % of each of the amendments and placed in 500 ml elernmeyer flasks. Volatilization of ammonia was determined using a laboratory <b>gas</b> <b>train</b> simulator and volatilized NH 3 was collected in 100 ml of 2 % boric acid and determined by titration with 0. 01 M H 2 SO 4.

40|$|Escherichia coli {{has been}} {{cultivated}} in a peptone water medium saturated continuously with nitrogen {{by use of}} a <b>gas</b> <b>train</b> so as to produce anaerobic conditions. Under these circumstances growth was greatly inhibited. Cultures which originally contained 11 million bacteria per cc. showed on the average only 32 million after 5 hours (as compared with 655 million in similar cultures saturated with air). The metabolic activity of the cells in such a culture was greatly reduced by the anaerobic conditions. It actually fell off from 42 mg. x 10 â€“ 11 per cell per hour during the 1 st hour to 27 mg. during the 2 nd hour and rose only {{to a maximum of}} 68 during the 3 rd hour. Similar cultures saturated with air showed a rise from 37 mg. x 10 â€“ 11 during the 1 st hour to 123 during the 2 nd hour. The addition of glucose to the medium, under aerobic conditions, has been shown in previous studies to cause only a slight increase in bacterial numbers (861 instead of 655 million after the 5 th hour). In the cultures aerated with nitrogen, the addition of glucose has no effect during the first hours. There is again a long lag period and a reduced metabolic rate. After the 2 nd hour, however, a wholly different phenomenon manifests itself. The bacterial population increases more rapidly than in the anaerobic peptone medium (reaching a maximum of 142 million after 5 hours). This growth is accompanied by an enormous increase in the rate of CO 2 yield, which reaches 211 mg. x 10 â€“ 11 per cell per hour during the 4 th hour (nearly double the maximum values recorded under aerobic conditions). The same phenomenon is, of course, illustrated by the enormous yield of CO 2 produced by the action of fermenting organisms in carbohydrate media recorded by Anderson (1924) and other students of the obligate anaerobes. We have here, however, a somewhat striking illustration of the distinct type of metabolic activity manifested by a facultative organism under anaerobic conditions in the presence of sugar measured on a cell-per-hour basis.

40|$|Karlshamnsverket is an {{oil fired}} reserve power plant, {{situated}} in the southeast part of Sweden. The power plant consists of three units with a total capacity of 996 MWel and it operates at least 4000 hours in standby annually. The most common standby mode is the 2 hour standby. At 2 hour standby mode the power plant is required to produce electricity to the grid within 2 hours. The order for a start-up is either given by the owners or Svenska KraftnÃ¤t. During standby the power plant needs steam to maintain readiness. Steam is supplied to the support steam system, either by an electric heater or by an oil boiler. The support steam system {{is divided into two}} circuits, a non-oil circuit and an oil circuit. Within these two circuits there are a total of ten heat consumers that are active during 2 hour standby. A heat consumer in this thesis is connected to the support steam system and is supplied with steam during 2 hour standby. Such heat consumer may be the deaerator or the heating of the oil tanks. At this time the amount of steam supplied to the heat consumers during 2 hour standby is unknown. The oil boiler of the support steam system has during a normal year 3000 operating hours. This means fuel is consumed when the power plant is not running, thus not generating any profit, only increased costs, for Karlshamnsverket. Therefore there is a strong economic incentive to reduce the running cost of the support steam system. In this thesis the support steam system and its heat consumers are mapped and measured at 2 hour standby to determine their respective heat requirement. The results from the measurements show that a total of 18. 1 MW of steam is required to operate the support steam system at maximum load. The oil boiler of the support steam system has a maximum capacity of 13 MWsteam. The efficiency of the oil boiler is determined to be 85 % via a created model. At this load the oil boiler has approximately 2 MW of flue gas losses. This flue gas loss can be minimized, thus increasing the energy efficiency of the oil boiler. The suggested energy efficiency measure is to install an economiser into the present oil boilerâ€™s flue <b>gas</b> <b>train.</b> To avoid flue gas condensation the economiser is placed after the current Electro Static Precipitator (ESP). The proposed capacity of the economiser is 1. 4 MW and delivers feed water at 80 ÂºC to the oil boiler. This lowers the fuel consumption with approximately 46 tons of LS HFO per year. The investment cost is approximated to 1. 5 MSEK, resulting in a payback period approximately to 4 â€“ 5 years. The annual savings are determined to be between 300 000 â€“ 340 000 SEK...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{electric}} power generation systems use a coal gasifier to convert coal to a gas rich in fuels such as H{sub 2 } and CO. The gas stream contains impurities such as H{sub 2 }S and HCl, which attack metal components of the coal <b>gas</b> <b>train,</b> causing plant downtime and increasing the cost of power generation. Corrosion-resistant coatings would improve plant availability and decrease maintenance costs, thus allowing the environmentally superior integrated-gasification-combined-cycle (IGCC) plants to be more competitive with standard power-generation technologies. Heat-exchangers, particle filters, turbines, and other components in the IGCC system must withstand the highly sulfiding conditions of the high-temperature coal gas {{over an extended period}} of time. The performance of components degrades significantly with time unless expensive high alloy materials are used. Deposition of a suitable coating on a low cost alloy will improve is resistance to such sulfidation attack and decrease capital and operating costs. The alloys used in the gasifier service include austenitic and ferritic stainless steels, nickel-chromium-iron alloys, and expensive nickel-cobalt alloys. The Fe- and Ni-based high-temperature alloys are susceptible to sulfidation attack unless they are fortified with high levels of Cr, Al, and Si. To impart corrosion resistance, these elements need not be in the bulk of the alloy and need only be present at the surface layers. In this study, the use of corrosion-resistant coatings on low alloy steels was investigated for use as high-temperature components in IGCC systems. The coatings were deposited using SRI's fluidized-bed reactor chemical vapor deposition technique. Diffusion coatings of Cr and Al were deposited by this method on to dense and porous, low alloy stainless steel substrates. Bench-scale exposure tests at 900 C with a simulated coal gas stream containing 1. 7 % H{sub 2 }S showed that the low alloy steels such SS 405 and SS 409 coated with {approx} 20 %Cr and Al each can be resistant to sulfidation attack for 500 h. However, exposure to an actual coal gasifier gas stream at the Wabash River gasifier facility for 1000 h in the temperature range 900 to 950 C indicated that Cr and Al present in the coating diffused further into the substrate decreasing the protective ability of these elements against attack by H{sub 2 }S. Similarly, adherent multilayer coatings containing Si, Ti, Al, and Nb were also deposited with subsequent nitridation of these elements to increase the corrosion resistance. Both dense and porous SS 409 or SS 410 alloy substrates were coated by using this method. Multilayer coatings containing Ti-Al-Si nitrides along with a diffusion barrier of Nb were deposited on SS 410 and they were found also to be resistant to sulfidation attack in the bench scale tests at 900 C. However, they were corroded during exposure to the actual coal gasifier stream at the Wabash River gasifier facility for 1000 h. The Cr/Al coatings deposited inside a porous substrate was found to be resistant to sulfidation attack in the bench-scale simulated tests at 370 C. The long-term exposure test at the Wabash River gasifier facility at 370 C for 2100 h showed that only a minor sulfidation attack occurred inside the porous SS 409 alloy coupons that contained Cr and Al diffusion coatings. This attack can be prevented by improving the coating process to deposit uniform coatings at the interior of the porous structure. It is recommended that additional studies be initiated to optimize the FBR-CVD process to deposit diffusion coatings of the corrosion resistant elements such as Cr, Al, and Ti inside porous metal filters to increase their corrosion resistance. Long-term exposure tests using an actual gas stream from an operating gasifier need to be conducted to determine the suitability of the coatings for use in the gasifier environment...|$|E
