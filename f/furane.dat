5000|$|A {{multi-part}} {{molding box}} (known as a casting flask, {{the top and}} bottom halves of which are known respectively as the cope and drag) is prepared to receive the pattern. Molding boxes are made in segments that may be latched {{to each other and to}} end closures. For a simple object - flat on one side - the lower portion of the box, closed at the bottom, will be filled with a molding sand. The sand is packed in through a vibratory process called ramming, and in this case, periodically screeded level. The surface of the sand may then be stabilized with a sizing compound. The pattern is placed on the sand and another molding box segment is added. Additional sand is rammed over and around the pattern. Finally a cover is placed on the box and it is turned and unlatched, so that the halves of the mold may be parted and the pattern with its sprue and vent patterns removed. Additional sizing may be added and any defects introduced by the removal of the pattern are corrected. The box is closed again. This forms a [...] "green" [...] mold which must be dried to receive the hot metal. If the mold is not sufficiently dried a steam explosion can occur that can throw molten metal about. In some cases, the sand may be oiled instead of moistened, which makes casting possible without waiting for the sand to dry. Sand may also be bonded by chemical binders, such as <b>furane</b> resins or amine-hardened resins.|$|E

Continuous measurements concerned the concentrations of the components CO, C_nH_m, NO, CO_ 2, and O_ 2, whereas polychlorinated dioxines and <b>furanes</b> as well as particles and single hydrocarbons in various operational conditions were measured discontinuously. The mean concentrations out of several burnouts ranged from 1500 to 11800 mg/m" 3 as for CO emissions and from 30 to 2500 mg/m" 3 as for C_nH_m emissions in manually charged firings, whereas in automatically charged ones the CO emissions reached between 130 and 6450 mg/m" 3 and the C_nH_m emissions, between 2 and 360 mg/m" 3. Here, the concentration levels {{are determined by the}} combustion conditions for CO and C_nH_m, for NO by the used fuel. The dioxine sampling registered dioxines and <b>furanes</b> both gaseous and dust-adsorbed thus representing the real operational conditions well.

40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{state of}} the art in the field of transformer ageing and diagnostics, with emphasis on advising end-users on transformer asset management and on transformer specification. The basis is results from two projects on laboratory studies on ageing of mineral oil impregnated cellulose insulation, and also some studies on service aged transformers. Ageing is governed by thermally activated processes and accelerated from presence of contaminants like water, lighter carboxylic acids and oxygen. It is found that commercially available thermally upgraded papers used for limiting ageing rates may vary a lot in quality, mainly due to varying nitrogen content. Two schemes for assessing the present and future ageing condition are possible: -	Monitoring by-products formed during ageing, using these as ageing indicators. The recommended indicators are <b>furanes,</b> methanol, water soluble acids, water and CO and CO 2 -	Calculation based on ageing kinetic algorithms using thermal conditions, contamination and materials used as input parameters. Schemes are given for calculation of ageing condition and expected remaining life estimation. Qualified thermal analysis of service history is necessary for carrying out qualified estimations. Three different rigs for studying the condition of transformers in service have been tested. An experimental rig has been built to study temperature dependent partitioning of water and other contaminants in order to facilitate condition of cellulose in the windings from oil samples. Partitioning curves for water, acids and <b>furanes</b> in aged transformer insulation is studied...|$|R
30|$|Lipid {{concentrations}} in different organs, namely, filet and liver, can vary leading {{to differences in}} residue distribution. For instance, Wu et al. [46] reported that polychlorinated dibenzodioxines and <b>furanes</b> accumulate mainly in the liver and that muscle concentrations correlate with liver concentrations. Variability in muscle concentrations between fish species decreased when concentrations were normalized to lipid content. Several studies describe the residue distribution over different organs (e.g., [31, 45, 47 – 53]). However, bioconcentration studies according to OECD 305 [1] are performed to obtain BCF values which - per definitionem - refer to the whole fish, and differences in residue distribution over different organs are thus not essential.|$|R

Sweco Environment {{was commissioned}} by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency to do a screening study of metals and brominated and chlorinated dioxins and furans in ashes from incineration of waste and biofuels. The study has two primary objectives: a. to assess whether the composition of incineration ashes can serve as indicator for the monitoring of the change of use of environmentally harmful substances in society. b. to {{provide a basis for}} evaluation of risks in connection to the use of ashes Eleven metals (arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, mercury, manganese, nickel, lead, vanadium, and zinc) as well as chlorinated and brominated dioxins and furans were analysed in the ashes. The study included 25 samples from the following matrices: · 8 samples of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) bottom ash · 5 samples of MSWI fly ash · 6 samples of biofuel incineration bottom ash · 6 samples of biofuel incineration fly ash Samples from biofuel incineration ashes included two samples of each fly and bottom ashes from plants that include recycled wood in their fuel mix. Sampling was undertaken in accordance with a simplified method based on NT Envir 004. A minimum of three samples were collected over a period of one to two weeks. Samples collected within this project were complemented with saved samples from a previous project on critical metals in waste incineration ashes (Johansson et al 2013). All sampling was undertaken by participating incineration plants. Metal concentrations detected in this study were broadly similar to concentrations shown in previous studies (WSP 2012, Johansson et al 2013), though the variation was large (which is in agreement with results in other studies). Metal concentrations in ashes from incineration of biofuels containing recycled wood are generally higher than in ashes from plants using pure biofuels. However, the mean mercury concentration is slightly higher in fly ash from incineration of pure biofuels. Chlorinated dioxins and furans were detected in all samples. The total concentrations varied between 12. 9 and 340, 000 ng/kg dw corresponding to between 0. 88 and 4, 300 ng WHO-TEQ/kg dw (upper bound). Concentrations of chlorinated dioxins and furans were generally higher in fly ashes than in bottom ashes. Results are presented in Table A. The results from analyses of municipal waste incineration ashes showed similar results as in the study performed in 2006 by Avfall Sverige (Avfall Sverige 2009). However, the analyses of biofuel ashes showed higher concentrations in this study than in previously reported studies (WSP 2012, Bjurström 2006). There was no difference in the concentrations of dioxins and furans in the ashes from ecycled wood and pure biofuels. Brominated dioxins and furans were detected in all samples. The total concentrations varied between 12 and 29, 600 ng/kg dw. There are no toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) for brominated dioxins and furans. To calculate WHO-TEQ sums for the brominated species in the samples, the TEFs for the corresponding chlorinated species were used. WHO-TEQ sums for the brominated species varied between 0. 3 and 140 ng/kg dw (upper bound). Results are presented in Table B. Table B. Results from analyses of brominated dioxins and furans in incineration ashes. Results from the analyses of brominated dioxins and furans indicated similar levels in MSWI bottom ash as in a Taiwanese study (Wang et al 2010), however the distribution was larger in this study. Concentrations in MSWI fly ash was slightly higher in this study compared to the Taiwanese study. Similar to the Taiwanese study, results from this study indicated higher concentrations in MSWI bottom ash than in MSWI fly ash. No previous studies of brominated dioxins and furans in biofuel ashes were found. The results from this study indicate lower concentrations in biofuel ashes than in MSWI ashes. As opposed to MSWI ashes, concentrations are higher in fly ash from incineration of biofuels than in bottom ash. No effects could be seen from the use of recycled wood in the fuel mix in biofuel incineration plants on the concentrations of brominated dioxins and furans. For the purpose of describing risks in connection with use of ashes, a simplified assessment has been made by comparing the concentrations in this study with concentrations deemed to be of negligible risk to {{human health and the environment}} (Swedish: mindre än ringa risk) for aggregates from recycled materials, as described in a guidance document from Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Naturvårdsverket 2010). The comparison shows that these concentrations were exceeded in all samples. This does not mean that the ashes are not suitable for use in aggregates, but that the use is subject to an individual assessment in each case. Only total concentrations has been analysed within the scope of this study, and no speciated analyses were undertaken. Risks associated with unwanted compounds in the ashes are not only connected to the total concentrations in the ashes, but to a large extent also to the leachability of those compounds. In order to decide whether an ash is suitable for recycling for a certain purpose, additional characterisation is required. Furthermore, the risk associated with potential exposure or contamination in relation to that specific usage should be highlighted. Also, positive environmental effects from the use of ashes should be taken into account when evaluating the suitability of its use. Recycling of ashes as aggregate may substitute virgin materials, thereby saving natural resources. Overall, the results obtained in this study, correlate well with results from previous studies. Brominated dioxins and furans, which are not as extensively studied previously, were detected in all samples in this study. The contribution to WHO-TEQ is small in most samples, compared to the contribution from chlorinated dioxins and furans. In MSWI bottom ash, the contribution to WHO-TEQ is larger from brominated than from chlorinated dioxins and furans. However, the sum of WHO-TEQ in MSWI bottom ash is low compared to the concentrations in fly ash. In conclusion, the study showed that incinerator ashes are not suitable as indicator for the monitoring of the change of use of environmentally harmful substances in society. Municipal and industrial wastes are often incinerated together and since municipal waste is imported for incineration in Sweden, the ashes will not reflect changes in consumption patterns in Sweden...|$|R

Investigations concerned producing of granules of the determineddimensions and strength parameters. Granules were formed from the dusts mixture consisting in 50 mass% of dusts obtained after the reclamation of the <b>furane</b> sands and in 50 mass % of dusts from sands with bentonite. Dusts from the bentonite sands with water were used as a binder allowing the granulation of after reclamation dusts from the <b>furane</b> sands. The following parameters of the ready final product were determined: moisture content (W), shatter test of granules (Wz) performeddirectly after the granulation process and after 1, 3, 5, 10 days and nights of seasoning, water-resistance of granules after 24 hours of being immersed in water, surface porosity ep and volumetric porosity ev. In addition the shatter test and water-resistance of granulate dried at a temperature of 105 oC were determined. Investigations were performed at the bowl angle of inclination 45 o, for three rotational speeds of the bowl being: 10, 15, 20 rpm. For the speed of 10 rpm the granulation tests of dusts mixture after the preliminary mixing in the roller mixer and with the addition ofwater-glass {{in the amount of}} 2 % in relation to the amount of dust were carried out.

FT-IR and DSC analyses proved the reversible interaction between PK-Fu and EPM-Fu with b-Ma via DA and r-DA sequence. Likewise, thermo-mechanical experiments (DMTA) indicated the re-workability of the material with no evident differences in elastic and loss modulus after several heating cycles and recycling procedures. Moreover, a considerable increase in the softening point (tangent 6) was also found for the higher toughened system containing 12 wt% of EPM-Fu (neat thermoset T = 137 degrees C whereas toughened thermoset T = 155 degrees C). A two-fold increase in IZOD impact strength compared to the neat thermoset (up to 27 J/m) was also recorded by the toughened system. Overall, this approach clearly indicates that fully thermally reversible and toughened thermosets can be realized starting from mixtures of furan functionalized polyketone and EPM rubber, cross-linked via reversible Diels-Alder chemistry.

40|$|Currently many {{technologies}} {{for the removal}} of organic compounds from waste gases exist. In most cases, classical techniques like absorption or catalysis purify the gases. However, in recent years, oxidation cleaning techniques based on the application of strong oxidizers like hydrogen peroxide and ozone have been developed.

In the gas phase the decaying process proceeds very slowly. An acceleration of the decaying process can occur when a suitable catalyst is used. Absolyt which is commercially available, relatively inexpensive, easy to handle and primarily contains calcium silica hydrate is a suitable substitute which speeds up the decaying process.

In the paper production there was in general no formation of PCDD/F, this statement is also valid for the floatation deinking process of waste papers. There was no evaporation of PCDD/F in the dryer section of the paper machine. The main input of PCDD/F in the production of wastepaper-free papers is imported chlorine bleached kraft (sulphate) pulp.

Two {{series of}} black-colored {{macromolecular}} substances were respectively prepared by a) acid-catalyzed dehydration of pure glucose and b) dry-state heating of crystalline cellulose. For molecular characterization, these substances {{were analyzed by}} standard chemical and spectroscopic techniques, revealing {{a more or less}} smoothed carbohydrate signature. The pyrolysis results showed striking differences between the two series of carbohydrate-derived substances. The carbohydrate origin of the charred celluloses (even after 48 % wt loss) were evident by the characteristic cyclic ketones, alkylfuranes and the major peak of levoglucosan. The alkylbenzenes and aikylphenols were in comparatively low amounts. On the contrary, the acid-catalyzed dehydration substances, showed pyrolysis patterns where aromatic compounds (phenols, benzofurans, indenes, naphthalenes) dominate vs the infrequent furan peaks. The residual, acid-soluble, polyvinylpyrrolidone-retained fraction yielded <b>furanes</b> in addition to acetic and levulinic acids. The results obtained suggest that carbohydrate dehydration in media of intense ionic strength may lead to macromolecular material showing pyrolysis patterns compatible with the "carbohydrate-free" sedimentary macromolecules.

40|$|Up till now, {{systematic}} analysis and periodic recording of air pollutant emissions {{has only been}} carried out for S 02, NOx, CO, dust and the totality of volatile organic compounds (VOC). The aim of this work was to show, particulary for the other important pollutants, {{the extent to which}} emissions could be cut down using the currently available technologies, and to identify those polluant substances and emission sources which presently still have deficits in combating air pollution by technology means. For this purpose estimates were made for the selected pollutants of the emission residues which would remain if the best technology were applied wherever this was technically feasible and reasonable. These residual emission estimates were used as indicators to evaluate the efficiency of technologies developed in the past. In the present survey {{it was not possible to}} gather original primary data; an analysis was made of the available literature. An attempt was made, by means of interviews and assessments, to minimize uncertainties and bridge the gap between frequently widely diverging data. The results show that in future the main substances to concentrate on when combating air pollution with new environmental protection technologies are the volatile organic compounds, including CFCs and solvents, the highly toxic trace pollutants such as dioxines, <b>furanes</b> and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and those heavy metals which are also emitted in considerable quantity in the form of vapours. The latter category includes mercury and arsenic. The development of new environmental protection technologies should increasingly involve medium sized and small plants, which for various pollutants are responsible for a substantial proportion of total emissions...|$|R
40|$|It was {{the problem}} of partner in project to develop {{catalysts}} with perowskite-type structure for catalytic combustion and catalytic supported combustion of exhaust gases. Exhaust gases: hydrocarbon and chlorinated hydrocarbon. The catalysts should be produced as pellts and as honeycomb. By Leuna the catalyst material was to synthesize, to characterize, to test the activity, to test the resistance against poisons. It have been to show that no dioxine and <b>furane</b> are produced. Results: by the Leuna procedure {{it is possible to}} produce catalysts, which are more active than these produced by other procedures. Catalysts containing lanthanum and cobalt and/or manganese, strontium, iron, copper are able to use both as pellets and for production of honeycomb containing cordierite. Their catalytic activity is comparable with this of noble metal catalysts or is better than this. At combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbon no anything dioxine or <b>furane</b> are formed. Perowskite-type catalysts are not resistant against sulfur compounds. They can be used in processes for removal of harmful gases in exhaust gases, e. g. in varnish plants. (orig.)

40|$|Highly {{efficient}} and modular approach {{was developed for}} the synthesis of various types of new (het) aryl C-nucleosides. This protocol consists of the synthesis of haloaryl-C-nucleoside intermediates, followed by a functional group transformation to introduce various substituents. Using this approach protected 2 ′-deoxy-C-nucleosides bearing halogenated benzene, pyridine, thiophene, <b>furane</b> and pyrimidine were prepared. These intermediates were then submitted {{to a wide range}} of palladium-catalyzed reactions. The same approach was also used for preparation of C-nucleosides bearing ribofuranose moiety. Functional ribofuranosides bearing diverse substituted pyridine and benzene nucleobases were prepared in this way...|$|E
40|$|The Morgan-Elson reaction, {{a method}} for the detn. of {{hyaluronidase}} activity, was optimized for the quantitation of the enzyme in biol. material. Based on HPLC and spectrometric (UV-Vis, LC-MS) studies, {{the structure of the}} red-colored product (mesomeric forms of N 3 -protonated 3 -acetylimino- 2 -(4 -dimethylaminophenyl) methylidene- 5 -(1, 2 -dihydroxyethyl) <b>furane)</b> formed by condensation of chromogen III with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde is proposed. Activities corresponding to ³ 0. 1 IU of endogenous and therapeutically administered hyaluronidase can be detected in 50 ml samples.

In the present study, a {{multiple}} approach was used to characterize Malpighia punicifolia extract and to evaluate its inhibitory activity against several meat spoilage bacteria. First, volatile fraction, vitamins and phenolic compounds of the extract obtained by supercritical fluid extraction were determined by GC-MS and HPLC. Then, the antimicrobial action of the extract was in vitro evaluated against Pseudomonas putida DSMZ 291, Pseudomonas fluorescens DSMZ 50009, Pseudomonas fragi DSMZ 3456, and Brochothrix thermosphacta DSMZ 20171 by the agar well diffusion assay and by the agar dilution test. Based on the results of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the assayed bacteria, 4 different concentrations of the extract were used in a challenge test on water buffalo steaks stored for 21 d at 4 °C. Results of chemical analyses showed that M. punicifolia extract is characterized by the presence of several compounds, already described for their antimicrobial (phenolic acids, flavonones, and <b>furanes)</b> and antioxidant (ascorbic acid) properties. The in vitro detection of antimicrobial activities highlighted that the extract, used at 8 % concentration, was able to inhibit all the target bacteria. Moreover, very low MIC values (up to 0. 025 %) were detected. In situ tests, performed on water buffalo steaks treated with the extract in the concentration range 0. 025 % to 0. 05 %, showed a strong inhibition of both intentionally inoculated bacteria and naturally occurring microorganisms. Positive results, in terms of color and odor, were also observed during the entire storage of steaks preserved with the extract. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Bottom and fly ashes streams {{collected}} along a year {{in several}} biomass thermal plants were studied. The bulk composition of ashes and other chemical characteristics that may impact soil application showed a high variability depending on the ash stream, combustion technology and ash management practice at the power plants. The acid neutralization capacity (ANC) and metal’s availability for leaching at fixed pH 7 and 4 was performed according with EA NEN 7371, as a quick evaluation method to provide information on the long-term behavior of ashes, regarding heavy metals and also plant nutrients release. Also the pH dependence leachability study was performed according to CEN/TS 14429 for predicting the leaching behavior under different scenarios. Leachability profiles were established between pH 3 and 12, allowing to distinguish different solubility control phenomena of toxic heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn, Pb) {{as well as other}} salts (Ca, K, Mg, Na, Cl). The ANC of fly ashes at pH 4 (3. 6 – 9. 6 molH+/kg) were higher than that observed for the bottom ashes (1. 2 – 2. 1 molH+/kg). Ashes were also characterized for persistent organic pollutants (POP), such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and paradibenzodioxines and <b>furanes</b> (PCDD/F). Contents were found to be much higher in fly ash than in bottom ash streams. None of the PAH levels did reach the current national limit value of sewage sludge application in soils or the guide value for ash in north European countries. However, PCDD/F contents, which are not regulated, varied from non-detectable levels to high amounts, regardless the level of loss on ignition (LOI) or unburned carbon content in fly ashes. Given the current ash management practices and possible use of blends of bottom and fly ash streams as soil conditioners resembles clear the urgent need to regulate ash utilization in soils, incorporating limit values both for heavy metals, PAH and PCDD/F...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the reactions and reaction mechanisms of fly ash from municipal waste incineration plants leading {{to the formation of}} organic compounds, is of great importance for minimization of the emission of these substances. Studying the reaction of toluene with fly ash is a contribution to this. At this reaction in liquid phase (T#<=# 111 C) it could be shown that o-and p-methyldiphenylmethane have been formed. This dimerisation of toluene describes the first step of an oxidation or condensation reaction. For these reaction the rate constant and activation energy have been determined. Formally the reaction corresponds to zero order as often found at photochemical and catalytic reactions of metallic salts. Further following reactions forming oxidation or condensation products of the MDPMs could not be found in liquid phase. Parallel reactions as the chlorination of toluene at temperatures to the boiling point for example have not been observed too. Comprehensive thermodynamic evaluations in the suitable temperature range have shown that the formation of following products is thermodynamically favoured. The different mineral phases of the transitional metals iron and copper are of special interest for chlorination reactions of fly ash. Usually their chlorides are used as chlorinating agents at reactions with fly ash. It could be shown that these metallic salts are not available as water-soluble compounts. After dimerisation further following reactions have been observed in the vapour phase. In the presence of oxygen oxidation products have been formed and condensation products under inert gas atmosphere. At the decomposition of residual carbon of fly ash from 250 C on, the addition of toluene to the vapour phase (synthetic air: 80 % NH_ 2, 20 % O_ 2) increased the formation of chlorinated aromatic compounds. Especially the lower chlorine stages have been preferred at the formation of dioxines and <b>furanes.</b> Thus fly ash is showing a potential of chlorination favouring the formation of organohalogen compounds in a gas-solid-phase reaction in presence of toluene in the vapour phase. For an explanation some theoretical formulations have been discussed. (orig.)
