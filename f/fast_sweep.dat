40|$|At {{all but a}} few of the <b>fastest</b> <b>sweep</b> speeds, the {{acquisition}} memory depth and not the maximum sample rate determines the oscilloscope’s actual sample rate. Peak detection capability, when used correctly, can make up for acquisition memory shortfalls. by Steven B. Warntjes One of the most basic specifications in digital oscilloscopes is the maximum sample rate. Oscilloscope users often understand the theory of signal sampling and signal reproduction, but often mistakenly assume that the oscilloscope always samples at its maximum sample rate. In reality, two specifications need to be considered: the maximum sample rate and {{the acquisition}} memory behind the signal sampler. At {{all but a few}} of the <b>fastest</b> <b>sweep</b> speeds, the acquisition memory depth and not the maximum sample rate determines the oscilloscope’s actual sample rate and consequently how accurately the input signal is represented on the oscilloscope display. The deeper the acquisition memory, the longer the oscilloscope can sustain a high sampling frequency on slow time-per-division settings, thus increasing the actual sample rate of the oscilloscope and improving how the input signal looks on the oscilloscope screen. The digital oscilloscope’s peak detection specification is another often overlooked specification. This important feature, when used correctly, can make up for acquisition memory shortfalls. In addition, peak detection can be combined with dee...|$|R

50|$|In {{vacuum-tube}} oscilloscopes made by Tektronix, {{the vertical}} amplifier's delay line {{was a long}} frame, L-shaped for space reasons, that carried several dozen discrete inductors and a corresponding number of low-capacitance adjustable ("trimmer") cylindrical capacitors.

For adjusting the delay line capacitors, a high-pressure gas-filled mercury-wetted reed switch created extremely fast-rise pulses which {{went directly to the}} later stages of the vertical amplifier.

Later developments by Tektronix included the development of multiple-trace oscilloscopes for comparing signals either by time-multiplexing (via chopping or trace alternation) or by the presence of multiple electron guns in the tube. In 1963, Tektronix introduced the Direct View Bistable Storage Tube (DVBST), which allowed observing single pulse waveforms rather than (as previously) only repeating wave forms. Using micro-channel plates, a variety of secondary-emission electron multiplier inside the CRT and behind the faceplate, the most advanced analog oscilloscopes (for example, the Tek 7104 mainframe) could display a visible trace (or allow the photography) of a single-shot event even when running at extremely <b>fast</b> <b>sweep</b> speeds.

Previous work on these heterostructures revealed a large change in coercive field and anisotropy when the ferroelectric polarization was switched from up to down.

40|$|We study {{nonlinear}} mean-field {{dynamics of}} ultracold molecule {{formation in the}} case when the external field configuration {{is defined by the}} level-crossing Demkov-Kunike model, characterized by a bell-shaped coupling and finite variation of the detuning. Analyzing the <b>fast</b> <b>sweep</b> rate regime of the strong interaction limit, which models a situation when the peak value of the coupling is large enough and the resonance crossing is sufficiently fast, we construct a highly accurate ansatz to describe the temporal dynamics of the molecule formation in the mentioned interaction regime. The absolute error of the constructed approximation is less than 3 * 10 ^- 6 for the final transition probability while at certain time points it might increase up to 10 ^- 3. Examining the role of the different terms in the constructed approximation, we prove that in the <b>fast</b> <b>sweep</b> rate regime of the strong interaction limit the temporal dynamics of the atom-molecule conversion effectively consists of the process of resonance crossing, which is governed by a nonlinear equation, followed by atom-molecular coherent oscillations which are basically described by a solution of the linear problem, associated with the considered nonlinear one.

50|$|The timebase is an {{electronic}} circuit that generates a ramp voltage. This is a voltage that changes continuously and linearly with time. When it reaches a predefined value the ramp is reset and settles to its starting value. When a trigger event is recognized, provided the reset process (holdoff) is complete, the ramp starts again. The timebase voltage usually drives the horizontal amplifier. Its {{effect is to}} sweep the screen end of the electron beam at a constant speed {{from left to right}} across the screen, then blank the beam and return its deflection voltages to the left, so to speak, in time to begin the next sweep. Typical sweep circuits can take significant time to reset; in some CROs, <b>fast</b> <b>sweeps</b> required more time to retrace than to sweep.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{patterns}} generated in finite-time sweeps across symmetry-breaking bifurcations in individual-based models. Similar to the well-known Kibble-Zurek scenario of defect formation, large-scale patterns are generated when model parameters are varied slowly, whereas <b>fast</b> <b>sweeps</b> produce {{a large number}} of small domains. The symmetry breaking is triggered by intrinsic noise, originating from the discrete dynamics at the micro-level. Based on a linear-noise approximation, we calculate the characteristic length scale of these patterns. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in a simple model of opinion dynamics, a model in evolutionary game theory with a time-dependent fitness structure, and a model of cell differentiation. Our theoretical estimates are confirmed in simulations. In further numerical work, we observe a similar phenomenon when the symmetry-breaking bifurcation is triggered by population growth.

The model allows us to relate the observed molecule momentum distribution, including its dependence on the sweep rate, to equilibrium properties of the initial state. For initial state near resonance, we find that phase fluctuations sharply reduce the observed condensate fraction. Moreover, for very <b>fast</b> <b>sweeps</b> and low temperatures, we predict a surprising nonmonotonic dependence of the molecule condensate fraction on detuning, that is a direct signature of quantum phase fluctuations. The dependence of the total molecule number on sweep rate {{is found to be}} a sensitive probe of pairing in the initial state, whether condensed or not.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{describes}} {{the comparison of}} three different types of continuous wave (CW) radars to interrogate surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors. The CW types are as follows: a frequency modulated (FMCW), a frequency stepped (FSCW) and a switched frequency stepped (S-FSCW) radar. All types operate in the 2. 4  GHz ISM band with a bandwidth of approximately 80  MHz. Whereas the sweep time of FSCW type radars typically is around 100  ms the FMCW radar sweep lasts only 100  μs. Measurements of all three types have been taken in equal standard settings to evaluate their phase stability, important for high precision sensing. The S-FSCW shows overall the best phase stability.

40|$|A facile {{method for}} {{selective}} detection {{based on the}} concept of electrochemical depletion of interfering species in diffusion layer was established. The feasibility of the method was verified by detecting dopamine in the presence of ascorbic acid. By applying a proper step potential to working electrode, at which interfering species, ascorbic acid, is oxidized while dopamine is kept unconsumed, an interferent-depleted region is thus created in the diffusion layer of the working electrode. Then the target analyte is detected by applying a follow-up linear <b>sweep</b> voltammetry with <b>faster</b> <b>sweep</b> rate to ensure the amount of the interfering species that diffuses to the electrode surface is negligible. The influence of step potential, step duration and sweep rate oil dopamine detection has been systematically investigated.
