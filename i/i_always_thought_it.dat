Dan and Maddy have always been {{incredibly}} close without becoming lovers, but it is obvious that they are great together, so when it happens it is effortless and joyous and has wonderful potential. But Dan's private demons prevent it from being allowed to live and grow. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might be great for him, if only he could have let it be." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon's first son, Julian, {{was born}} during his {{marriage}} to Cynthia as his commitments with the Beatles intensified {{at the height of}} Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, [...] "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'" [...] Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, [...] "It's not an acid song." [...] McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, [...] "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song [...] "Hey Jude". Lennon later said, [...] "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|Costume {{designer}} Deborah Nadoolman Landis {{noted that}} {{the inspiration for the}} series as well as Indiana Jones' outfit was Charlton Heston's Harry Steele in Secret of the Incas (1954) and called Raiders of the Lost Ark [...] "almost a shot for shot" [...] remake of the Heston film, citing that Indiana Jones was [...] "a kinder, gentler Harry Steele": [...] "We did watch this film together as a crew several times, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> strange that the filmmakers did not credit it later as the inspiration for the series." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "As to my love, {{there can}} be no change in that. If it suits your mother to be disdainful to me, I can bear <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> would come to be so some day." ...|$|R

2500|$|The Byrds' version, {{released}} {{as a single}} on April 2, 1968, reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. They transformed it into a classic of the then burgeoning genre of country rock, whereas on the basement version the country music flavor {{is more of an}} undercurrent, suggested by [...] "the lilting chorus melody". Roger McGuinn felt that the song was perfect for the Byrds: [...] "It was country-ish and had that Dylan mystique where you couldn't really figure what he was talking about, yet the lyrics nevertheless drew you in. ... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was about when Bob was laid up in Woodstock after the bike accident and sure wasn't going anywhere." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Bless me, {{you don't}} say so! Well, well, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> {{was the most}} foolish {{business}} that I ever heard of. However, you shall {{tell me all about}} it when you come up. I shall miss my coach unless I start." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They are my pleasure. Besides <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{a blessing}} that my {{business}} in life, though so humble, should be what may do direct good. If only I do not set them a bad example, or teach them any harm.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said she, [...] "that <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> a lazy custom, {{and not a}} bit nice, and I {{think so}} yet. But still, when {{we are in a}} strange country, I expect to live as other people do." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, papa. I like Königsgraaf very much. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{the prettiest}} place I know. But I {{do not like}} looking forward to staying here without knowing when I am to go away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do indeed. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{matter of}} great regret that Augustus {{should have been}} sent there, after the scandalous {{treatment}} that Bob received." [...] Bob was the little boy who had drank the champagne and required the carriage exercise.|$|E
6000|$|... "So!" [...] {{he said at}} length, and {{it came as a}} {{complete}} surprise to me that fellows ever really do say [...] "So!" [...] <b>I</b> had <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was just a thing you read in books. Like [...] "Quotha!" [...] I mean to say, or [...] "Odds bodikins!" [...] or even [...] "Eh, ba goom!" ...|$|R

5000|$|In Patric van Blerk's words, Into the Night We Slide is [...] "a lovely adventure, {{which never}} caught fire mainstream, but has enjoyed {{the sort of}} passionate niche-loyalty that made a {{treasure}} out of African band Freedom’s Children’s Astra. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> as the Jo’Burg Records equivalent to the other gems which took decades to go gold and platinum, such as Van Morrison’s Astral Weeks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then why {{not leave}} it, {{and do what}} suits you better? <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> a foolish thing, you know,' said Nan, with a trace of anxiety in the keen eyes that searched for signs of illness in a face as ruddy as a Baldwin apple.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure you}} are very kind, Mr. Rollstone. I had no notion--Ida can tell you I was quite overcome--though when I came to think of it, my poor, dear Morton always did say he had high connections, but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{was one of his}} jokes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've seen it done," [...] said Dan, [...] "but I {{never knew}} how it was managed. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was going to blow up; {{but it seemed to}} me that if you were good and true and very meek, and had a {{conscience}} void of offence, it wouldn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{could be}} more to my taste," [...] the monk said joyfully. [...] "I did not feel quite sure, before, whether I was glad or sorry that my {{expulsion}} was put off, for <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> would come to that some day; but now that I learn for what service Hotspur intends me, I feel as if I could shout for joy.|$|R
6000|$|BARBARA. <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> {{as a sort}} of pit where lost {{creatures with}} {{blackened}} faces stirred up smoky fires and were driven and tormented by my father? Is it like that, dad? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I am {{very glad}} indeed: but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> {{you would have}} it; <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> you sure. <b>It</b> {{did not appear to}} me that--in short, you know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise. Is he coming, Louisa?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{wondering}} {{when he was}} going to appear on the scene. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was customary on these occasions for the young man to present himself in person, and not let the lady fight his battles for him. Is this Mr. Winfield a little deficient in nerve?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{never see}} such times as these Mr Trotman, nor the like of such. But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{would come to}} this; {{everything}} turned topsy-turvy as it were, the children getting all the wages, and decent folk turned adrift {{to pick up a}} living as they could. It's something of a judgment in my mind, Mr Trotman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I really don't {{think it}} was {{altogether}} what you call malice, {{so much as the}} Lester idea of fun,' said Ellen, recovering herself after her outpouring. 'A very odd notion <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was; and Mary and Louisa are not really ill-natured, and cannot wish to do the harm they might have done, if I did not know Griff too well.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} understood," [...] {{continued}} Abraham, [...] "and <b>I</b> had <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> {{was to take}} place at once, so that Eva might get used to her new life before her papa was deposited." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> oughtn't to be. It can't be right, Vivie, {{that there}} shouldn't be better {{opportunities}} for women. I stick to that: it's wrong. But it's so, right or wrong; {{and a girl}} must {{make the best of}} it. But of course it's not worth while for a lady. If you took to it youd be a fool; but I should have been a fool if I'd taken to anything else.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle {{gave me a}} paper, {{and told}} me to keep till Roswell Gardiner came back; and, if he himself should not then be living, to give it to him"--The colour now mounted to the very temples of the pretty girl, and she seemed to speak with greater {{deliberation}} and care. [...] "As I was to give the paper to Roswell, <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> related to him. My uncle spoke of it to me as lately as the day of his death." ...|$|R

"Yes, Jemimar," [...] said Maryann, {{with her}} mouth full of buttered toast, [...] "I always said it, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it,</b> and I always knowed it, that Master Will would come 'ome, and marry a sweet {{beautiful}} young lady, which 'as come true, if ever a profit spoke, since the day of Jackariah--let me fill your cup, my dear, p'raps you'll 'and me the kettle, Richards." ...|$|E

Only think, Mama, {{how it is}} improved since I was here last! <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning to Mrs. Dashwood) but you have made it so charming! Only look, sister, how delightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself! Should not you, Mr. Palmer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither did I. An' {{until now}} <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a lark." [...] He changed his {{position}} on the maddening sand and sighed heavily. [...] "But we'll get used to it in time, I guess. What other folks can do, we can, an' a mighty lot of 'em has camped out. It's all right. Here we are, free an' independent, no rent to pay, our own bosses--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, looking back, I can {{see that}} I {{must have been a}} very {{unpleasant}} child. <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> greatly to the credit of my parents that they let me grow up. It would have been so easy to have dropped something heavy on me out of a window. They must have been tempted a hundred times, but they refrained. Yes, I was a great pest around the home. My only redeeming point was the way I worshipped you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; not Patience Underwood. Though, {{let me tell}} you, a {{man might}} do worse than marry Patience Underwood. <b>I</b> have <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> a pity that Patience and Gregory would not make a match of it. He, however, would {{fall in love with}} Clary, and she has too much of the rake in her to give herself to a parson.

2500|$|Walter Hill thought [...] "the {{audience}} {{will go with}} you when you set up an abstract world with teenage values and play out a drama within this. It was kind of real but it wasn't really. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> said whenever someone says fantasy they immediately think of more Disney--esque. The idea of a hard hitting drama in a fantasy world, that was kind of different at the time... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> as a musical. They kind of saw it worked in the world of an MTV video.|$|R
