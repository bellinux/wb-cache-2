2500|$|Of all {{the wines}} most closely {{associated}} with Portugal, and most reflective of the immense influence that the British have had on the Portuguese wine industry, it is Port. So close is the relationship that wine writer Karen MacNeil notes [...] "If Portugal {{is the mother of}} Port, Britain is certainly its father". While there are many theories as to the origin of the fortified wine known as Port, one of the most prevalent is that of the 1678 visit by English wine merchants to a monastery in the Portuguese town of Lamego located along the Douro river. In search of new wines to ship back to England, the merchants came across an abbot in Lamego who was producing a style of wine that the merchants had never encountered before. While fortification of wine had been known for centuries, the <b>fortifying</b> grape <b>spirit</b> was usually added after fermentation, when the wine was already fermented dry. The abbot of Lamego was fortifying his wine during fermentation, which had the effect of killing off the active yeast cells and leaving the wine with high levels of residual sugar. This method produced a very strong, alcoholic wine with noticeable levels of sweetness that was very successful in the English wine market.|$|R
25|$|The styles, colour, {{sweetness}} {{and quality of}} Vin Santo can vary widely depending on the grape varieties and production methods {{used to make the}} wine. While white grapes, such as Trebbiano and Malvasia in Tuscany, are most widely used, red grape varieties (such as Sangiovese) can be used to produce a rosé style wine. When red grape varieties are used, the wine is often labelled as Occhio di Pernice, which has its own DOC classification in several regions of Italy. The wines can be made to fit any style of sweetness levels from bone dry, almost Fino Sherry-like, to extremely sweet and on par with the botrytised wines of France and Germany. The wines can even be <b>fortified</b> with grape <b>spirit</b> added during fermentation, like Port. These fortified examples are usually labelled as Vin Santo Liquoroso.|$|R
50|$|After {{fermentation}} is complete, {{the base}} wines are <b>fortified</b> with grape <b>spirit</b> {{in order to}} increase their final alcohol content. Wines classified as suitable for aging as Fino and Manzanilla are fortified until they reach a total alcohol content of 15.5 per cent by volume. As they age in barrel, they develop a layer of flor—a yeast-like growth that helps protect the wine from excessive oxidation. Those wines that are classified to undergo aging as Oloroso are fortified to reach an alcohol content of at least 17 per cent. They do not develop flor and so oxidise slightly as they age, giving them a darker colour. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.|$|R

40|$|Ethyl {{carbamate}} (EC) is a known {{genotoxic carcinogen}} that is frequently present in alcoholic beverages {{and is therefore}} a public health concern. As a consequence, maximum concentration levels for EC in these commodities are legislated in several countries. Quantitative analytical methods are therefore essential to monitor EC levels in beverages. Most published analytical methods for the determination of EC in alcoholic beverages utilise elaborate sample pre-treatment procedures to obtain injectable samples, or yield low sensitivity, for example where direct injection is used. In addition, these procedures often require large volumes of toxic solvents and are not generally applicable to diverse alcoholic beverages. This paper describes a novel procedure for the determination of EC in wines, <b>fortified</b> wines and <b>spirits.</b> The procedure is based on reversed-phase solid-phase extraction (SPE) sample clean-up combined with normal-phase liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation tandem mass spectrometric (NP-LC-APCI-MS/MS) analysis. This method provides a rapid, robust and simple analytical procedure suitable {{for the analysis of}} a diverse range of alcoholic beverages. The accuracy of the method (expressed as average recovery from diverse matrices) is 94. 5 %, with limits of detection (LODs) ranging between 0. 25 and 0. 63 μg l- 1 for different matrices. Benefits such as simplified sample preparation, low detection limits, low solvent consumption and good selectivity render the methodology ideally suited to study the occurrence of EC in diverse commodities. The method was applied to study the occurrence of EC in South African wines, <b>fortified</b> wines and <b>spirits.</b> South African wines, aged 1 - 9 years, contained 1. 8 - 31 μg l- 1 EC (RSD= 69 %, n= 106), fortified wines aged 2 - 34 years contained 2. 8 - 79 μg l- 1 EC (RSD= 89 %, n= 21), and brandies aged 3 - 20 years contained 4. 4 - 95 μg l- 1 EC (RSD= 105 %, n= 26). Factors affecting the formation of EC in these commodities were investigated and storage temperature, alcohol content and pH were found to affect the rate of EC formation. Of these variables storage temperature has by far the greatest effect. © 2011 Taylor & Francis. Articl...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{influence}} of an important project of our time, the creation of thinking machines or cyborgs, on the essence of human spirituality. The popular work of Kurzweil was used as a starting point. Kurzweil believes that the cyborgs or man-machine hybrids will not only be a simulation of human cognition but also of consciousness and spirituality. In fact, they will be more than a simulation; they will enhance and alter consciousness and spirituality in a radical, unfathomable way. The basis of Kurzweil's argument is his law of accelerating returns, which predicts such a progress in technology that, if an algorithm for the working of the brain can be formulated, {{it will be possible to}} develop software emulating the conscious brain. In this way, current limitations experienced by human beings, including mortality, will be overcome. This assumption was investigated from an anthropological view using Janicaud's concepts. The cyborg is seen as an illustration of people's innate desire to overcome the human condition. Humanity is characterised by a constant struggle to find a balance between the superhuman and the inhuman as the extreme states of human spirituality. This also characterises human liberty - humans are free to choose. Given this characterisation of humanity, the nature of the cyborg as superhuman is then considered. Different possibilities are sketched: the superhuman who will exercise the pure will to power (awakening the inhuman) or a person with a complete naïve freedom. The future is not easy to predict. Janicaud considers the view of the cyborg as superhuman to be a myth. The real danger facing humanity is the inhuman. The growth and progress of technology do not guarantee moral progress. Currently, technology seems to create a sharp divide between a privileged few and the rest. The two world wars in the previous century illustrated ways in which technology could be used to commit cold-blooded barbaric acts on a mass scale. In addition, biotechnology and other technological innovations could give rise to new forms of violence which can effectively be spread by new media. The inhuman is a place from where it is difficult to return. The challenge of our time is to carry the responsibility of our freedom in such a way that we can defend ourselves against our inhumanity; but in a manner that would enable us also to open up to the radical creativity and strangeness of superhumans lying dormant in us. It is clear that now, more than ever before, human spirituality needs to be as alive and rich as possible to rise to the challenge. However, the belief in technology as utopia enslaves the human spirit. We forget that we are the creators of technology and fabricate excuses for moral and intellectual abdications. Furthermore, the assumption that cognition can be mechanised or formalised leads to the disembodiment of intelligence and thought. Humans are placed outside of the world to which they belong. We become estranged from ourselves and each other. The human spirit seems to be wounded by the prevailing metaphors of disembodiment and mechanisation accompanying technological dominance. This article contributes to the call for the struggle for the re-enchantment of the human spirit. It is imperative that thinkers and innovators - leaders - create new metaphors to provide richer descriptions of humanity. Social sciences, having studied the human condition for centuries, might contribute valuable ideas. Technology can be used in this struggle, but only if human beings understand their own paradoxical nature as well as that of technology. The <b>fortified</b> <b>spirit</b> is one that accepts its mortality and fragility but takes responsibility for its freedom. In this way, meaning is re-introduced in the lives of human beings. In hierdie artikel word die invloed van die projek van die bou van denkende masjiene of kuborge op die grondslag van menslike geestelikheid bespreek. Die idee van die kuborge word gebruik om die toekoms te bedink. Die kuborg as supermens word as mite uitgewys, terwyl die ontaarding van die mens as 'n realistiese moontlikheid geskets word. Mense, as geestelike wesens, kom noodgedwonge te staan voor die uitdaging om verantwoordelikheid te aanvaar en die toenemend moeilike balans te bewaar tussen die onmenslike en die supermens wat in ons sluimer. Die onmenslike moet in toom gehou word te midde van 'n openheid vir die radikale kreatiwiteit van die supermens. Dit blyk egter dat die gees verwond en aan bande gelê word deur die onderliggende metafore van meganisering en ontliggaming van die tegnologieë van ons tyd. Die gesprek sluit aan by die stryd om die heropluistering van die gees. Tegnologie kan gebruik word in hierdie stryd maar slegs as mense hulle eindigheid verstaan en aanvaar asook dié van tegnologie. Sodoende sal 'n ryker begrip van menslikheid vorendag kom wat betekenis in mense se lewens bring deur die ontwikkeling en gebruik van tegnologie sinvol te rig. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The wine {{industry}} {{is an important}} sector of agriculture and wine analysis forms the basis of assessing compliance of its commodities with regulatory standards and research in this field. Liquid chromatography (LC) is extensively used for the determination {{of a wide range}} of nonvolatile wine components, but conventional detectors impose performance limitations on the technique that prevents its application to sophisticated analytical problems. In particular, conventional detectors for LC often lack the sensitivity and specificity for the determination of many wine compounds, especially trace level analytes, and furthermore, do not possess spectral capabilities for compound identification or structure elucidation. The hyphenation of mass spectrometry (MS) to LC has led to the introduction of a range of detectors that confers high levels of sensitivity and selectivity to the technique. In addition, a wide variety of MS architectures are available that are inherently suited for targeted analysis or structure elucidation studies. In this dissertation, the potential benefits of liquid chromatography – tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to solve analytical problems relevant to the {{wine industry}} are explored. LC-MS/MS is a particularly versatile analytical technique because both mass analysers can be operated in full-spectrum mode or selected-ion monitoring, which, together with optional fragmentation, gives rise to four modes of operation that may be used for highly specific and sensitive targeted analysis or spectral investigations. In multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, both analysers are set at single ion frequencies specific for the compound under investigation and one or more of its product fragments, respectively. MRM mode is ideally suited for trace level analysis in complex mixtures, even in cases where the target components are not resolved from interferences. In this study, MRM detection was used to solve challenges relevant to the wine industry for the selective quantitation of target analytes that could not be analysed by conventional LC methods. The application of this approach for the analysis of natamycin, ethyl carbamate (EC) and 3 -alkyl- 2 - methoxypyrazines (MPs) in wine is demonstrated. Natamycin is an antimicrobial preservative that is not permitted in wine in the European Union. A rapid and sensitive method for the determination of natamycin was developed, and has been used since 2009 to regulate this vitally important sector of the South African wine export industry. EC is a natural carcinogen that occurs at trace level amounts in alcoholic products. It also has the potential to accumulate in wines and can occur in very high concentrations in some fruit brandies. The determination of EC is complicated by its physicochemical properties, and available analytical methods suffer from drawbacks such as the requirement for elaborate extraction procedures and high solvent consumption. A novel method for the determination of EC in wines, <b>fortified</b> wines and <b>spirits</b> is described and it was applied to perform an audit of the South African industry as well as to investigate factors responsible for its accumulation in alcoholic beverages. This work forms an integral part of the food safety mandate of the State and it ensures that export products comply with international norms for trade. MPs are ultra-trace-level aroma compounds that contribute to the varietal character of Sauvignon blanc wines. Their analytical determination is challenging due to their low levels of occurrence. The loading capacity of LC combined with the sensitivity and resolving power of MS was exploited to analyse concentrated extracts, in order to achieve very low limits of detection. The performance of the LC-MS/MS method enabled the quantitation of these compounds at their natural levels of occurrence, including the first quantitation and spectral confirmation of 3 - ethyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine in wine. Extensive data pertaining to South African Sauvignon blanc wines are reported and statistical analysis is performed, reporting the correlation of variables such as vintage and origin as well as wine parameters such as malic acid with wine MPs. Furthermore, the application of LC-MS/MS for structural elucidation and screening of target classes of analytes was demonstrated for the analysis of red wine anthocyanins. The anthocyanidin-glycosides are responsible for the colour of red grapes and wine, contribute to the sensory properties of wine, and are also of interest due to their beneficial biological properties. Their determination is complicated by their large numbers and structural diversity, further exacerbated by diverse reactions during wine ageing as well as the lack of reference standards for most members of this class of compounds. Tandem MS in scan mode was used for the highly selective detection of glycosylated anthocyanins and derivatives, exploiting the predictable elimination of the sugar moiety in neutral loss mode. Concurrent survey scan experiments were used to unambiguously identify neutral loss detected compounds. The method therefore follows a simplified and structured approach for unambiguous peak identification based on elution order and mass spectral information to impart a high level of certainty in compound identification. In summary, the work presented in this dissertation demonstrates that LC-MS/MS is a versatile and powerful analytical approach for the analysis of diverse compounds of relevance to the wine industry. The sensitivity and specificity of MRM mode, and the selectivity and spectral capabilities of neutral loss and survey scan modes of MS/MS detection, is amply demonstrated by the applications presented in the dissertation. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die wynbedryf is ‘n belangrike komponent van landbou en wyn-analise vorm ‘n integrale deel van gehalteversekering ten opsigte van toepaslike wetlike standaarde. Wyn-analise is ook belangrik in navorsing oor die samestelling van wyn. Vloeistofchromatografie word dikwels aangewend vir die bepaling van ‘n wye verskeidenheid nie-vlugtige wynkomponente, maar konvensionele detektors plaas beperkinge op die aanwending van die tegniek tot gesofistikeerde analitiese toepassings. Meer spesifiek, konvensionele detektors vir vloeistofchromatografie beskik nie oor die sensitiwiteit en selektiwiteit vir die bepaling van baie wynkomponente nie, veral in die geval van spoorvlakanalise, en beskik boonop ook nie oor spektrale vermoëns vir identifikasie van komponente en struktuurbepaling nie. Die koppeling van vloeistofchromatografie met massaspektrometrie het ‘n reeks detektors tot die tegniek toegevoeg wat hoë vlakke van sensitiwiteit en selektiwiteit bied. Verder bied die verskeidenheid van massaspektrometrie-konfigurasies ook instrumente wat inherent geskik is vir geteikende analise of struktuurbepaling, afhangende van die doel van die ondersoek. In hierdie dissertasie word die voordele ondersoek wat verbonde is aan die aanwending van vloeistofchromatografie – tandem kwadrupool massaspektrometrie om relevante analitiese vraagstukke in die wynbedryf op te los. Hiedie tegniek is besonder toepaslik aangesien beide massa-analiseerders in geselekteerde-ioon modus of in volle skandering gebruik kan word. Tesame met opsionele fragmentasie, gee hierdie uitleg aanleiding tot vier funksionaliteite wat vir hoogs sensitiewe geteikende analise of spektrale onledings gebruik kan word. Eerstens word beide massa analiseerders vir enkel-ioon frekwensies opgestel, spesifiek tot die teikenkomponent en een of meer van sy produkfragmente, wat verkry word deur komponentspesifieke fragmentasie. Hierdie modus is by uitstek geskik vir spoorvlakontleding van komplekse monsters, selfs wanneer die teikenkomponente nie chromatografies van die matriks geskei is nie. In hierdie studie is die tegniek aangewend vir die hoogs sensitiewe bepaling van spoorvlak komponente wat nie met konvensionele detektors gemeet kon word nie. Die aanwending van hierdie tegniek word gedemonstreer vir die spoorvlakbepaling van natamycin, etielkarbamaat en 3 -alkiel- 2 -metoksiepierasiene in wyn. Natamycin is ‘n antimikrobiese preserveermiddel wat ontoelaatbaar is in wyn in die Europese Unie. ‘n Vinnige en sensitiewe metode vir die bepaling van natamycin is ontwikkel, en word reeds sedert 2009 aangewend om hierdie uiters belangrike sektor van die Suid-Afrikaanse wyn uitvoerbedryf te reguleer. Etielkarbamaat is ‘n karsinogeen wat natuurlik voorkom in spoorhoeveelhede in alkoholiese produkte. Dit kan ook onder sekere omstandighede akkumuleer in wyn en in hoë konsentrasies voorkom in vrugtebrandewyne. Die bepaling van etielkarbamaat word bemoeilik deur sy chemiese eienskappe, en gevolglik word analitiese metodes gekenmerk deur uitgebreide, arbeidsintensiewe monstervoorbereiding en die gebruik van groot hoeveelhede, meestal giftige, oplosmiddels. ‘n Nuwe metode vir die bepaling van etielkarbamaat in wyn, gefortifiseerde wyn en spiritualië word beskryf en word aangewend om die faktore vir vorming daarvan te ondersoek. Die metode word aangewend om die Suid-Afrikaanse bedryf te ouditeer in terme van die voedselveiligheid mandaat van die Staat, en om te verseker dat uitvoere voldoen aan standaarde vir internasionale handel. Metoksiepierasiene is vlugtige, ultraspoorvlak wynaromakomponente wat verantwoordelik is vir die kenmerkede kultivarkarakter van Sauvignon blanc wyne. Hul analitiese bepaling word bemoeilik deur hulle lae konsentrasies in wyn. Die ladingskapasiteit van vloeistofchromatografie tesame met die sensitiwiteit en selektiwiteit van massaspektrometrie was benut om hoogs gekonsentreerde ekstrakte te ontleed. Baie hoë vlakke van sensitiwiteit word sodoende verkry. Die verrigting van die metode was voldoende om hierdie komponente teen hulle natuurlike konsentrasies te kwantifiseer, insluitende die eerste kwantifisering en spektrale bevestiging van 3 -etiel- 2 -metoksiepierasien. Omvattende data van die vlakke van hierdie komponente in Suid- Afrikaanse Sauvignon blanc wyne word getoon en statistiese ontleding is gedoen om korrelasies tussen veranderlikes soos oorsprong en oesjaar sowel as basiese wyn veranderlikes soos byvoorbeeld appelsuur, met metoksiepierasienvlakke te ondersoek. Verder was die toepassing van vloeistofchromatografie – tandem massaspektrometrie tot struktuurbepaling en skandering vir groepe van komponente gedemonstreer vir die ontleding van rooiwyn antosianiene. Die antosianien-glukosiede is verantwoordelik vir die kleur van rooi druiwe en wyn, dra by tot die sensoriese eienskappe daarvan, en is ook relevant as gevolg van die voordelige biologiese eienskappe daarvan. Die bepaling van hierdie komponente word gekompliseer deur hulle groot getalle en strukturele diversiteit, verder bemoeilik deur die wye verskeidenheid van reaksies wat hulle ondergaan tydens veroudering. Daar is ook ‘n gebrek aan beskikbaarheid van standaarde vir die meeste van die lede van hierdie klas van komponente. Tandem massaspektrometrie was in skanderingsmodus gebruik vir hoogs selektiewe deteksie van die antosianien-glukosiede deur die voorspelbare eliminasie van die suiker komponent in neutrale verliesskandering te benut. Gelyktydige skanderings van die komponente wat met neutraleverliesskandering waargeneem word, is gebruik vir ondubbelsinnige komponent identifikasie. Die metode volg daarom ‘n eenvoudige en gestruktureerde benadering vir piek identifikasie wat gebaseer is op chromatografiese orde, sowel as massaspektrale inligting, om ‘n hoë vlak van sekerheid aan die identifikasie van komponente te verleen. Samevattend, word daar getoon deur die werk wat in hierdie dissertasie uiteengesit is dat vloeistofchromatografie – tandem massaspektrometrie ‘n veelsydige en kragtige tegniek bied vir chemiese analise relevant tot die wynbedryf. Die sensitiwiteit, selektiwiteit en spektrale vermoëns van die tegniek word duidelik deur toepassings in die dissertasie getoon...|$|R
