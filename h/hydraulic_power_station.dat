40|$|The region {{concerned}} by the plan, and called Region of Brittany, imports energy for 70 % of its consumption which remains rather weak. The importation of coal is now reduced. The production of gas, which {{for a long time}} was dependant upon the importations of coal by sea, remains localized, as a consequence of that former situation; but the gas from Lacq now reaches Lorient and Rennes. Steam-generating stations no longer exist, except in Finistère, in Brest in particular. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> are of small, or even very small size. However, the tidal power-station of the Rance, which was put into service in 1967, constitutes a realization of unprecedented importance in this region, representing alone 90 % of the yield of Brittany's power-stations. And, added to this, a thermo-nuclear station has been established in the Arrée Mountains. Electric consumption has known an increase of 50 % since 1957, particularly in the Eastern half of the region, where industrialization has made greater progress than in the Western peninsula, since 1960. An oil-plant, supplying heavy products chiefly, was put into service near Rennes in 1965. Uranium is won from the granite massif of Pontivy. Increasing production, and larger consumption of energy in Brittany are encouraging signs. Gautier Marcel. L'énergie dans la région de programme dite de Bretagne.

40|$|Due to its location, Portugal {{has several}} {{valuable}} renewable resources for electricity production. It {{has a high}} level of solar radiation, moderate wind resource, and considerable vegetable and animal biomass potential. Ocean and hydro resources are also present, mainly the latter—although its major development took place in 2006 with the construction of large <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> Wave energy systems are now under development; the PELAMIS project, the first of its kind, is installed and has been functioning since the beginning of 2008. Nevertheless, Portugal still depends greatly on foreign countries for oil, gas, and coal resources, but it is taking large steps toward sustainable renewables-based electricity generation. Government and competent authorities established several measures in recent years that created incentives to install renewable energy systems and created the conditions for economic development in the energy sector. Regarding renewable energy systems, at the end of 2008 Portugal had about 8, 151 MW capacity (1), corresponding to an estimated energy production of about 23, 179 GWh. This production constitutes 43. 3 % of national electricity demand. However, this represents a 9 % decrease in production compared with 2007, largely due to the decrease hydropower production. The goals defined for 2010 and 2013 —that 39 % and 45 %, respectively, of the national electricity demand be generated from RES—are within reach. Wind generation at the end of 2008 was about 11 % of the total national electrical demand— 50. 6 TWh (2). Also, use of renewable sources for micro generation of electricity is growing {{and as a result of}} legislation published at the end of 2007 (Dec. Law 363 - 2007, 2 November).

40|$|A three-magnet array {{unilateral}} NMR sensor with {{a homogeneous}} sensitive spot was employed for assessing {{aging of the}} turbine oils used in two different <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> The Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence and Inversion Recovery-prepared CPMG were employed for measuring the 1 H-NMR transverse and longitudinal relaxation times of turbine oils with different service status. Two signal components with different lifetimes were obtained by processing the transverse relaxation curves with a numeric program based on the Inverse Laplace Transformation. The long lifetime components of the transverse relaxation time T 2 eff and longitudinal relaxation time T 1 were chosen to monitor the hydraulic fluid aging. The results demonstrate that an increase of the service time of the turbine oils clearly results in a decrease of T 2 eff,long and T 1,long. This indicates that the T 2 eff,long and T 1,long relaxation times, obtained from the unilateral magnetic resonance measurements, can be applied as indices for degradation of the <b>hydraulic</b> fluid in <b>power</b> <b>station</b> turbines...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} of re-routing a high-head, low-flow, run-of-the-river, under- 100 kW hydro {{electric power plant}} penstock and comparison with the original route for purposes of head loss estimation and available power prediction. The infrastructure of a destroyed saw mill is being re-engineered. One project involves installing a micro hydroelectric <b>power</b> <b>station</b> {{at the end of}} an existing pipeline. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> available to the generator was estimated. Much construction and engineering work has gone into the design and partial build of this <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> including the repair of a pipeline, re-routing the lower pipeline section, and building a bridge. This project focuses on the pipeline that brings water to the <b>power</b> <b>station.</b> When supplying water to a <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> a pipeline is sometimes called a penstock. In this case, the penstock travels 4 miles underground to bring water from a creek to the <b>power</b> <b>station.</b> There are two possible penstock routes: the old route which comes straight from the creek to the burned mill complex where it zigzags below the ruins through many fittings before reaching the turbine house; and the new route which splices into the old pipeline just before the mill complex and takes a direct path over a bridge to the turbine house. At this point, both pipeline routes are nearly operational and their respective paths were accurately mapped. To assist with turbine and generator selection, an estimate for available <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> was made. Estimating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> involves calculating the theoretical maximum power available from the water flowing through a perfect penstock, then subtracting the power lost due to friction, pipeline geometry, and fittings. This was done for several different flow rates. The annual flow variations in the head source creek were also accounted for to ascertain whether sufficient power would be available during the dry fall months. Local protected fish species and their susceptibility to injury by the <b>power</b> <b>station</b> were also noted. The 2001 flow measurements were used as a rough reference. Pipeline mapping was done using archival maps, GPS, Google, a skydiving altimeter, and static penstock pressure readings. Fittings were counted – with assistance from the map archive – by re-tracing the penstock route above ground and counting the protruding structures. Several old timers, who worked on the pipeline back in the day and still live in the area, were solicited for help during this stage. Pipe material and dimensions was accounted for in much the same way. Head loss and available power predictions at several flow rates were calculated via two methods: Darcy-Weisbach and Hazen-Williams. Discrepancies between the two methods were noted and discussed. The final results were compared to the 2001 flow measurements and a preliminary turbine selection was made. Future testing was planned...|$|R
40|$|Thick-walled pipes made {{of steel}} are {{the basis of a}} large number of {{components}} in mechanical and installation engineering, e. g. for <b>hydraulic</b> components, in <b>power</b> <b>station</b> technology or in the petroleum industry. Particularly when strict positional and shape tolerances are demanded, the classical manufacturing process is chip-producing machining from the solid material. However, this is time-intensive and material-intensive. The laser/GMA hybrid processes with modern high-power lasers are a suitable alternative. With these processes, it is currently possible to weld components with a wall thickness up to approx. 15 mm with little distortion in one pass. However, in initial experiments, solidification cracks with longitudinal and vertical orientations in relation to the welding direction, so-called central line cracks, were established in welds on pipes. Within the framework of a research project, it was possible to determine the cause of the cracking and to find measures in order to avoid it. The technical boundary conditions could be complied with in this respect. The article gives an overview of the research project and the essential results...|$|R
