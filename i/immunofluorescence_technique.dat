50|$|CMV pp65 {{antigenemia}} test is an immunofluorescence based assay which utilizes {{an indirect}} <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>technique</b> for identifying the pp65 protein of cytomegalovirus in peripheral blood leukocytes. The CMV pp65 assay {{is widely used}} for monitoring CMV infections and its response to antiviral treatment in patients who are under immunosuppressive therapy and have had renal transplantation surgery as the antigenemia results are obtained about 5 days {{before the onset of}} symptomatic CMV disease. The advantage of this assay is the rapidity in providing results in a few hours and that the pp65 antigen determination represents a useful parameter for the physician to initiate antiviral therapy. The major disadvantage of the pp65 assay is that only limited number of samples can be processed per test batch.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at searching for the {{presence}} of circulating antibodies against frozen sections of human testis, ovary and trophoblast in patients that had spermatic cord torsion. Sixty-eight sera samples were studied. Nine patients (13. 2 %) were positive for organ specific anti-testis autoantibodies. Six patients were positive for antibodies against Leydig cells: five were positive only with the indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>technique</b> of complement fixing (ITT/CF), the sixth patient was positive only with the indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>technique</b> (ITT).

40|$|Three methods {{employed}} in the diagnosis of trichinosis (trichinoscopy, digestion method, and <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>technique)</b> were compared by laboratories in 5 countries of the European economic community. For this purpose, material from 32 pigs infected with 50, 150, 500, and 1 500 T. spiralis larvae was examined. With {{none of the three}} methods was it possible to detect with sufficient reliability a T. spiralis infection in pigs infected with 50 larvae. The digestion method and the <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>technique</b> yielded more reliable results when the infection dose was 150 larvae or more. With trichinoscopy, reliable results were obtained in pigs infected with 500 and 1 500 larvae. With the digestion method and trichinoscopy, the onset of infections was detectable from 3 weeks post infection, the digestion method being more reliable; the <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>technique</b> yielded positive results from approximately 4 - 6 weeks post infection.

Differentiation of IBDV strains {{is crucial for}} effective vaccination programs and epidemiological investigations. In this study, a combination of clinical, histopathological examinations, immunohistochemistry and indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>techniques</b> were used to differentiate different IBDV strains. Sixty three weeks old chickens were divided randomly into five equal groups. Chickens of four groups were inoculated orally with different strains of IBDV. Chickens of the fifth group were kept as a control. Three chickens per group were euthanized at 3, 7, 14, 21 days post-inoculation (dpi). Euthanized chickens subjected to autopsy and tissue samples were collected in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin for histopathology, immunohistochimestry and immunoflrourescence.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:To {{examine the}} {{presence}} of serum antinuclear autoantibodies in a healthy population. METHODS: Serum of 500 normal blood donors between 18 and 60 years of age were tested for {{the presence of}} autoantibodies. Antinuclear antibodies were detected by indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>technique</b> using HEp- 2 epithelial cells as the substrate. The presence of dnaN was detected by indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>technique</b> using Critidia lucillae as the substrate. Anti-SSA (RO), anti-SSB (LA), anti-Sm, and anti-RNP were determined by double radial immunodiffusion. RESULTS: In the evaluation of the presence of serum antibodies, antinuclear antibodies were detected in 22. 6 % of the sera. The presence of other antibodies was not significant. The majority of the titers were 1 : 40.

40|$|Peripheral blood T and B {{cells were}} {{enumerated}} in 26 normal adults by conventional immunological markers (erythrocyte rosette and surface membrane immunoglobulin) and by monoclonal markers (T 11 and B 1) using both membrane immunofluorescence of cells in suspension and immunoperoxidase staining of dried, fixed, cytocentrifuged cells after separation from blood by buoyant density centrifugation. The results of immunochemistry were determined independently {{from the results}} of erythrocyte rosetting and membrane <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>techniques.</b> A high correlation was found between all three methods for enumerating T cells (erythrocyte rosetting, T 11 /immunoperoxidase, and T 11 /indirect immunofluorescence). Correlation was less good between the results of the three methods for enumerating B cells; surface membrane immunoglobulin and B 1 /indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>techniques</b> showed the highest correlation. The results suggested that B cells may be preferentially lost during the extensive cell washings entailed in the indirect immunofluorescence procedures.

40|$|The {{localization}} {{patterns of}} human plasma lipoproteins {{and their respective}} apo-proteins and of neutral lipid were determined in normal and atherosclerotic arteries. Specific antisera were prepared against plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and their apoproteins (apoB), high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and one of their major apoproteins (apoA-I), and apoC-III, which is a major apoprotein of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Using <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>techniques,</b> the various antigens were localized in arterial samples obtained at surgery or autopsy. The three apoproteins and neutral lipid were localized to the same tissue areas, namely, lipid core regions and certain connective tissue of atherosclerotic lesions, in 61 % of the fibrous plaques and 48 % of the fatty streaks examined. In marked contrast, none of the uninvolved arterial regions showed the presence of all four factors together. As controls, the localization of other serum proteins was also determined in these arteries using <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>techniques.</b> Fibrinogen was associated with regions of maximum complementary localization of factors in 37 % of the fibrous plaques and 64 % of the fatty streaks.

40|$|The {{sensitive}} {{detection of}} bone marrow involvement {{is crucial for}} tumor staging at diagnosis and for monitoring of the therapeutic response in the patient’s follow-up. In neuroblastoma, only conventional cytomorphological techniques are presently accepted {{for the detection of}} bone marrow involvement, yet since the therapeutic consequences of the bone marrow findings may be far-reaching, the need for highly reliable detection methods has become evident. For this purpose, we developed an automatic immunofluorescence plus FISH (AIPF) device which allows the exact quantification of disseminated tumor cells and the genetic verification in critical cases. In this study, the power of the <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>technique</b> is compared with conventional cytomorphology. 198 samples from 23 neuroblastoma patients (stages 4 and 4 s) at diagnosis and during follow-up were investigated. At diagnosis, 45. 6 % of the samples (26 of 57) which were positive by AIPF investigation were negative by cytomorphology. During follow-up, 74. 2 % (49 of 66) of AIPF-positive samples showed no cytological signs of tumor cell involvement. False negative morphological results were found in up to 10 % of tumor cell content. A tumor cell infiltrate below 0. 1 % was virtually not detectable by conventional cytomorphology. Using the sensitive <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>technique,</b> the analysis of only two instead of four puncture sites did not lead to false negative results. Thus, the <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>technique</b> offers an excellent tool for reliable detection and quantification of disseminated tumor cells at diagnosis and {{during the course of the}} disease...|$|E
