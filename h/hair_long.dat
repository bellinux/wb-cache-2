5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics that focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their <b>hair</b> <b>long,</b> wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E

5|$|This trek was {{the first}} {{recorded}} crossing of the mountainous island, completed without tents, sleeping bags, or map—their only mountaineering equipment was a carpenter's adze, a length of alpine rope, and screws from the James Caird hammered through their boots to serve as crampons.

5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their <b>hair</b> <b>long.</b> After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.|$|E
5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes {{are a sign}} of a patriarchal {{organization}} because men are only forbidden from growing their <b>hair</b> <b>long</b> or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than their mothers to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E
5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> {{as it is}} also {{important}} in Islam to have clear differences (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage women to have <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> and men to have short hair. The Taliban in Afghanistan viewed <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their <b>long</b> <b>hair.</b> The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his <b>long</b> <b>hair.</b> Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> and whirl it around during rituals.|$|R

25|$|Women {{invariably}} grew their <b>hair</b> <b>long</b> and, as {{in other}} European cultures, this custom was also common among the men. It is said that the Gaelic Irish took great pride in their long hair—for example, a person {{could be forced to}} pay the heavy fine of two cows for shaving a man's head against his will. For women, very long hair was seen as a mark of beauty. Sometimes, wealthy men and women would braid their hair and fasten hollow golden balls to the braids. Another style that was popular among some medieval Gaelic men was the glib (short all over except for a long, thick lock of hair towards the front of the head). A band or ribbon around the forehead was the typical way of holding one's hair in place. For the wealthy, this band was often a thin and flexible band of burnished gold, silver or findruine. When the Anglo-Normans and the English colonized Ireland, hair length came to signify one's allegiance. Irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their Irish heritage. Likewise, English colonists who grew their <b>hair</b> <b>long</b> at the back were deemed to be giving in to the Irish life.|$|E
25|$|The Hadendoa Beja of Northeast Africa {{were called}} Fuzzy-Wuzzies by British colonial troops during the Mahdist War {{of the late}} 19th century due to their often large and mop-like hairstyles, which they shaped by {{applying}} butter or mutton fat.

This elaborate hairstyle was quite distinct from another coiffure found among other Somalis, who would instead grow long and fluff out their fine, straight hair and place a chewing stick and comb in the center.|$|E

Plummer later grew a full beard and his <b>hair</b> <b>long</b> in honor of Tillman, who had such a style in the NFL before cutting his hair and shaving his beard off to fit military uniform guidelines.|$|E
25|$|During his youth, Stalin usually wore a red satin shirt, grey coat, and red fedora, or {{alternatively}} a traditional Georgian chokha and white hood.

After the summer of 1918 until his death he took to wearing military-style clothing, in particular long black boots and a light-coloured collarless tunics, and also carried a gun. He had few material demands and lived plainly, with simple and inexpensive clothing and furniture; his interest was in power rather than wealth. He was a lifelong smoker, who smoked both a pipe and cigarettes.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the period, men wore their <b>hair</b> <b>long</b> with curls {{well past}} the shoulders. The bangs (fringe) were usually combed forward and allowed to flow over the {{forehead}} a bit. Although men had worn wigs for years to cover up thinning hair or baldness, {{the popularity of the}} wig or periwig as standard wardrobe is usually credited to King Louis XIV of France. Louis started to go bald at a relatively young age and had to cover up his baldness with wigs. His early wigs very much imitated what were the hairstyles of the day, but they gave a thicker and fuller appearance than natural hair. Due {{to the success of the}} wigs, other men started to wear wigs as well. By 1680, a part in the middle of the wig became the norm. The hair on either side of the part continued to grow in the 1680s until by the 1690s two very high pronounced points developed on the forehead. As well, during the 1680s, the wig was divided into three parts: the front including the center part and the long curls which fell {{well past the}} shoulders, the back of the head which was combed rather close to the head, and a mass of curls which flowed down the shoulders and back. The curls of the wig throughout the 1660s until 1700 were rather loose. Tighter curls would not make their appearance until after 1700. Every natural color of wig was possible. Louis XIV tended to favor a brown wig. His son, Monseigneur was well known for wearing blond wigs.|$|E

5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men.

Bedouins are now {{less likely to have}} <b>long</b> <b>hair.</b> Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view <b>long</b> <b>hair</b> in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic and a sign of an infidel.
