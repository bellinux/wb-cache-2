40|$|Background: Policy, systems, and {{environmental}} approaches are being implemented in San Diego to promote healthy choices by improving access to healthy food among low-income populations. Also, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency {{has developed a}} registry-based BMI surveillance system. Objectives: Study one examined the demographic representativeness of the County of San Diego BMI Surveillance System. Study two determined independent predictors of ongoing use of <b>Fresh</b> <b>Fund,</b> a farmers market monetary incentive program for government nutrition assistance recipients. Study three examined monthly patterns of food insecurity among families and children attending Summer Meals, a Summer Food Service Program for low-income children. Methods: Study one compared demographics of the BMI surveillance sample {{to the general population}} of San Diego in 2011 by sub-regional area (SRA). Study two used Poisson regression to examine the relationship of characteristics with the number of <b>Fresh</b> <b>Fund</b> visits from 2010 to 2012, and mixed effects modeling to explore the within-individual changes over time in self-reported fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption and perception of diet quality. Study three examined the association of month of Summer Meals attendance with food security in 2011. Results: Study one: Younger (2 - 11 and 12 - 17 years old) and older (≥ 65 years old) aged groups in the surveillance sample (n= 302, 691) were representative of the general population among males and females in 90 %, 75 %, and 85 % of SRAs, respectively; and 71 % were representative for at least one racial/ethnic group. Study two: Among 7, 298 participants, those who reported more servings of FV/day at baseline came to <b>Fresh</b> <b>Fund</b> a greater number of times, but only among those who came ≤ 6 months. The odds of an increasing number of servings of FV consumed and improved perception of diet quality increased by 2 % and 10 % per month of <b>Fresh</b> <b>Fund</b> use, respectively. Study three: 65 % of households, 54 % of adults, and 47 % of children had low/very-low food security (n= 325). Conclusion: The value of San Diego BMI Surveillance System is its ability to estimate and monitor neighborhood-level BMI. In addition, this dissertation provides evidence that reassures the need for community-level programs to improve access to nutritious food among government assistance recipients and children from low-income families...|$|R

5000|$|Michael Schuman of Time {{stated that}} while Daewoo's demise had {{significant}} consequences, {{it would have}} nonetheless been better than propping it up with <b>fresh</b> <b>funds.</b> There was a persistence of the belief that Daewoo and other Korean conglomerates were [...] "too big to fail". Such belief led many bankers and investors to continually waste money on bailouts, despite the sign that Daewoo was unable to engineer a turnaround and repay these bad loans. Once the too-big-to-fail perception was dispelled, with large conglomerates no longer considered the safest investments, bankers and investors began financing new opportunities in areas which had been starved of capital, such as small firms, entrepreneurs and consumers. Korea's GDP actually rose after Daewoo's unwinding.|$|E

5000|$|In 1953, the Eisenhower {{administration}} took office. The President's party, {{which had}} been out of the White House since 1933, took a critical view of the previous administrations’ policies, including both the globalizing policies of the 1940s and the New Deal initiatives of the 1930s. An overall goal of the new administration was to administer the government efficiently and cut spending. While TCA’s technical assistance to developing countries was a small budget item and considered a long-term program (although <b>fresh</b> <b>funds</b> were appropriated annually), economic assistance (or “defense support”) was considered an inherently short-term measure that required specific authorization on a case-by-case and year-by-year basis. The Eisenhower administration proposed that, in place of U.S. financial assistance, U.S. allies should increasingly finance themselves through their own exports, or in other words through [...] "trade not aid." [...] With respect to financial assistance for development projects, the policy was maintained that it should be provided primarily by the U.S. Export-Import Bank and by the World Bank and furthermore that it was to be available only on commercial terms and primarily to finance private investment.|$|E

Austerity is defined as the shortfall of consumption from the level desired by a country and supported by its repayment capacity.

These findings imply that the amount of <b>fresh</b> <b>funds</b> obtained by a sovereign is not a reliable measure of austerity suffered; and that austerity may actually be associated with higher growth.
