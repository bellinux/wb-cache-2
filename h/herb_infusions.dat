With regard to the metabolites, those from commercial products showed antimutagenic properties, except those from BHA and especially Biochanin A that showed high mutagenic activity. All metabolites from food supplements showed antimutagenic properties, except those from Fluxarola that showed antimutagenic properties. Metabolites from most herb extracts showed antimtagenic properties and those from thyme showed very strong antimutagenic activities, while those from camomile, rosemary and tarragon showed mutagenic activities, and those from celeriac and sage showed very strong mutagenic activities...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} possible toxic {{effects of}} Ruta graveolens hydroalcoholic extract in gastrointestinal parasitic infection. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 g plant leaves and seeds were powdered and extracted with 1500 mL alcohol/water and administered by gavage to Swiss albino mice infected with Vampirolepis nana. Anti-parasitic evaluation and toxicity assays {{were carried out}} in six groups of ten animals each. Treatments were scheduled with both the leaves and the seeds&#x 2032; extracts at doses of 2. 5, 5, and 10 mg per gram body weight. Toxicity was comparatively analyzed to a vehicle control group (n = 10) and to a Praziquantel &# 174; treated. On the fifth day, all the individuals were killed by euthanasia and parasite scores were correlated, giving rise to a relative percentage of elimination to each treatment. Toxicity was achieved by hematology and by clinical chemistry determinations. Results: The use of the R. graveolens hydroalcoholic extract to treat V. nana infected mice resulted in a mild-to-moderate hepatoxicity associated to a poor anti-parasitic effect. The major proglottids elimination (E&#x 0025;) was achieved at the lowest crude extract concentration with a mild anti-parasitic efficacy from the highest dose; that did not cause a significant elimination of parasites. A decrease of circulating polymorphonuclear-neutrophils associated with a normochromic-normocytic anemia was detected as the extract dose was augmented. The blood aspartate-aminotransferase and alanine-aminotransferase tended be slightly augmented with 100 mg R. graveolens extract. Conclusion: R. graveolens is an unsafe natural anti-parasitic medicine as its active constituents may be poorly extracted by the popular crude <b>herb</b> <b>infusion.</b> Although it presented a mild anti-parasitic effect in mice, symptoms of natural-products-induced-liver-disease confirmed that its self-medication should be avoided...|$|R
40|$|En Uruguay el consumo anual de yerba mate genera unas 125 toneladas de residuos orgánicos. La lombricultura es una de las formas de obtener materia orgánica a partir del reciclado de residuos domiciliarios orgánicos. Los desechos de yerba mate tienen un gran potencial de reciclado si son utilizados como sustrato en la lombricultura. Utilizando distintos sustratos, tiempos de compostaje y volúmenes de yerba, se determinaron algunas de las condiciones necesarias para la utilización de dichos residuos como sustrato para la lombriz Eisenia fetida. Se estudiaron las condiciones de pH que el desecho debería alcanzar para ser tolerado y mejor aprovechado por las lombrices, y el período de tiempo que la yerba demora en alcanzar estas condiciones. Se observó que el período de tiempo mínimo de precompostado para el mejor aprovechamiento de la yerba por parte de las lombrices es de cuatro semanas. Se analizaron también las características del vermicompost obtenido, en cuanto a parámetros de materia orgánica, nitrógeno, fósforo y metales. El valor de nitrógeno (1 %) y de materia orgánica, que ronda el 30 %, son similares a los encontrados en otros humus que se obtienen por métodos semejantes. Sin embargo, para el Fósforo los valores resultaron por debajo de lo encontrado en los análisis realizados por el CUI (Laboratorio Ambiental Echotech, octubre 2006). Abstract The annual {{consumption}} of “yerba mate” (mate <b>herb</b> <b>infusion)</b> in Uruguay generates about 125 {{metric tons of}} organic waste. Vermicomposting {{is one way to}} obtain organic matter by recycling organic household waste. The waste of “yerba mate” has a great potential for recycling if it is used as a substrate in vermicomposting. Using different substrates, composting times and volumes of “yerba mate” we determined some of the necessary conditions for the use of yerba mate waste as a substrate for the Eisenia fetida earthworm. We studied the optimal pH conditions that the waste should have in order to be tolerated and best exploited by the worms and the period of time that the “yerba mate” takes to achieve these conditions. We observed that four weeks is the minimum amount of precomposting time of “yerba mate”, recquired by the worms for an improved processing of it. The vermicompost obtained was analyzed. The following analysis were performed: organic matter, Nitrogen, Phosphorous and metals. The values found for Nitrogen (1 %) and organic matter (which was around 30 %) are parallel to the values found for other composts which are obtained by similar composting methods. However, the value of Phosphorus was found to be lower than that found in the analysis performed by CUI (Ambiental Laboratory Echotech, October 2006). </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of the replacement of drinking water by <b>herb</b> <b>infusions</b> on the performance, relative weight of internal organs, hematocrit and immune response to Newcastle disease virus of broiler chickens. A total of 540 male broiler chicks (Ross 308) were divided into five groups, corresponding to four different treatments and one control group. Treatments were replicated eight times, and the control group four times. Experimental treatments included infusions (5 grams per liter) of cinnamon, thyme and turmeric in equal ratios in replacement of drinking water. Experimental period lasted 21 days and all chicks were fed with a corn-soybean based diet. Results showed that all herbs infusions caused significant (p< 0. 05) decrease in live body weight compared with the control group at 21 days of age. Mix treatment significantly decreased relative carcass weight relative to the control group (p< 0. 05). Herbs infusions increased the relative weight of some organs. None of herb additives affected hematocrit in comparison to control group. Cinnamon and herb mix infusion significantly improved bird immune response to the NDV vaccine in comparison to the control group and those that received only turmeric infusion. When all in-water additives were compare to each other, the birds supplemented with turmeric infusion showed the worst performance and immunity. The results of this experiment suggest that these herbs infusions did not favor the performance of broiler chickens...|$|E

The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of some medicinal plants collected in the region of Malesevo Mountain was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry and FRAP method. 	Infusions samples in the present research were prepared from: Mountain tea (Origanum vulgare L.), Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.), St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), Wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum L.) and Mint tea (Mentha piperita L.). 	In this study we present rapid and simple electrochemical voltammetric method for estimation the total antioxidant capacity of medicinal plants in an ethanol/water phase by measuring the rate of homogeneous redox reaction with ABTS•+ radical (2, 2 ’- azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid)) by means of cyclic voltammetry. ABTS•+ radical was electrochemically in situ generated at the surface of glassy carbon electrode by electrochemical oxidation of ABTS in ethanol electrolyte solution.

Results: The results from the FRAP method showed that mountain tea has the highest total antioxidant capacity 27. 45.

The measurement results were highly variable. The results show that washing the herbs reduce the concentration of Hg in herbs prepared by freeze-drying. With drying in the sun, washing of the herbs does not have any effects since the concentrations of Hg in washed and uwashed plant material were very similar. In the prepared tea infusion Hg values were below the detection limit. The maximal Hg concentration was measured in Melissa officinalis while the minimal was measured in Hypericum perforatum where the Hg concentrations was below the upper allowed value of Hg 0, 5 mg kg- 1.
