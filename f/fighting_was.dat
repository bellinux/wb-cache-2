5|$|Napoleon's Imperial Guard, {{the only}} unit on the {{battlefield}} that saw no <b>fighting,</b> <b>was</b> available to swing into action at a moment's notice. In refusing to commit the Guard, some historians believe, he lost his one chance to destroy the Russian army and to win the campaign.|$|E
5|$|On 3 July, an Iraqi Army {{spokesman}} {{claimed the}} military had regained control {{of the town of}} Al-Awja, Saddam Hussein's birthplace, near Tikrit. However, later in the day, two battlefield commanders contradicted him and stated <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> still continuing on the town's perimeter and in Al-Awja itself.|$|E
5|$|The Punch-up in Piestany was {{a notable}} {{instance}} of fighting in international play. A 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships game between Canada and the Soviet Union {{was the scene}} of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials to turn off the arena lights in an attempt to stop it, forcing the IIHF to declare the game null and void. The <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> particularly dangerous as <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> a surprise and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the fighting beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, and the Soviet team was barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.|$|E

5|$|The corps was {{assigned}} to Lieutenant General George S. Patton's Third Army on 10 October 1944, and moved to Etain, near Verdun, and into combat. The corps' first <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> for the Metz region, as it was moved to attack Fort Jeanne d'Arc, {{one of the last}} forts holding out in the region. That fort fell on 13 December 1944.|$|E
5|$|A more {{indirect}} consequence {{arose from}} the disagreements that occurred between Madero and his generals Villa and Orozco. The tensions began during the battle and continued afterward. In addition to the insubordination that the two leaders showed Madero while the <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> still ongoing, they also clashed with him afterwards over payments to their soldiers and over the appointment of Venustiano Carranza as Madero's defence minister. Carranza was a civilian who had joined the revolution at the last minute, and for these reasons was despised by Orozco.|$|E
5|$|Although {{both sides}} claimed victory, neither {{achieved}} all their objectives; the JNA garrison evacuated the Logorište barracks, but Croatian defences elsewhere held. Particularly heavy <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> {{reported in the}} Karlovac suburb of Turanj, identified as the primary axis of the JNA effort. While the JNA removed some weapons and equipment stored in the Logorište barracks, the remaining supplies were removed by the ZNG over a one-week period after the battle.|$|E

5|$|As the <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> {{seemingly}} {{coming to}} an end, Carmelo Anthony confronted Collins and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. Jared Jeffries immediately tried to attack Anthony but tripped over Marcus Camby, before being restrained by coaches and teammates, while Anthony backed up towards the Nuggets' bench. Collins also ran down the court to get at Anthony but was blocked by Nenê and Smith. All ten players on the court {{at the time of}} the incident were ejected by the officiating crew that consisted of Dick Bavetta, Violet Palmer, and Robbie Robinson.|$|E
5|$|By 16 December, the British 5th Division had {{completed}} its {{move into the}} line between the New Zealand and the Indian divisions. There followed a period of hostile patrolling and skirmishing on the XIII Corps front. The main burden of the <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> therefore assumed by V Corps as the Canadians pushed for Ortona with the Indian Division on their left flank attacking toward Villa Grande and Tollo.|$|E
5|$|By {{the close}} of the first day, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant that nearly all the <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted}} by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava, with the 128th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Ptuj, the 45th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion were at Slovenj Gradec and marching east towards Dravograd. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services.|$|E

5|$|Despite the battalion's {{success in}} holding the {{trenches}} at Lone Pine, the August Offensive failed {{to break the}} deadlock as setbacks elsewhere resulted in continued stalemate {{and for the rest}} of the campaign the <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> relatively static. Finally, in December the decision was made to evacuate the Allied force from the peninsula. During the evacuation, two of the battalion's soldiers, William Scurry and Alfred 'Buntie' Lawrence played a significant part through their invention of a self-firing rifle, which assisted in making the Turks believe that there were still men manning the trenches even as they were being evacuated.|$|E
5|$|El-Qantarah {{also saw}} heavy {{fighting}} as {{troops from the}} 18th Division engaged Israeli forces within and around the town. By early morning the division commander, Brigadier General Fuad 'Aziz Ghali, was able to set up his command post there. Close quarter combat and even hand-to-hand fighting took place as the Egyptians cleared the ghost town building by building. <b>Fighting</b> <b>was</b> intense, {{and by the end}} of October 7, the town and its outskirts as well as two nearby fortifications of the Bar Lev Line were under Egyptian control.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fighting</b> <b>was</b> {{heavy and}} the two sides fought to capture and {{recapture}} P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni, with the North Koreans seeking {{to break through the}} Kyongju corridor as a way to attack the UN base at Pusan. However, with large amounts of UN air and naval support, the US and South Korean ground forces were able to rout and force back the North Korean troops after two weeks of fighting.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fighting</b> <b>was</b> renewed at the {{beginning}} of 1993, as the Croatian army launched Operation Maslenica, an offensive operation in the Zadar area on January 22. The objective of the attack was to improve the strategic situation in that area, as it targeted the city airport and the Maslenica Bridge, the last entirely overland link between Zagreb and the city of Zadar until the bridge area was captured in September 1991. The attack proved successful as it met its declared objectives, but at a high cost, as 114 Croat and 490 Serb soldiers were killed in a relatively limited theater of operations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fighting</b> <b>was</b> {{still going}} on in the area around Dongo. Fearing that Mussolini and Petacci might be rescued by fascist supporters, the partisans drove them, {{in the middle of the}} night, to a nearby farm of a peasant family named De Maria; they {{believed}} this would be a safe place to hold them. Mussolini and Petacci spent the rest of the night and most of the following day there.|$|E
5|$|In January 1952, the 24th Infantry Division, which {{suffered}} over 10,000 {{casualties in}} 18 months of <b>fighting,</b> <b>was</b> redesignated as the Far East Theater reserve {{and pulled out}} of Korea. It returned to Japan to rebuild. The 34th Infantry Regiment was reconstituted, and the division returned to full strength during the next year, having been replaced in Korea by the 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard. In July 1953, the division returned to Korea to restore order in prisoner of war camps. It arrived {{two weeks before the}} end of the war.|$|E

5|$|Indiana troops {{participated in}} 308 {{military}} engagements, {{the majority of}} them between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains. Soldiers from Indiana were present on most of the Civil War battlefields, beginning with the first engagement involving Hoosier troops at the Battle of Philippi (West Virginia) on June 3, 1861, to the Battle of Palmetto Ranch (Texas) on May 13, 1865. Nearly all the <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> outside of the state's boundaries. Only one significant conflict, known as Morgan's Raid, occurred on Indiana soil during the war. The raid, which caused a brief panic in Indianapolis and southern Indiana, was preceded by two minor incursions into Indiana.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} battle in the War in Afghanistan in which Afghan army units were the {{principal}} fighting force. Statements from the British Ministry of Defence (MOD) emphasised that the operation was Afghan-led, although the ability of Afghan units to function without NATO control was questioned during the battle. Military engagement over Musa Qala {{is part of a}} wider conflict between coalition forces and the Taliban in Helmand. Both before and after the battle, related <b>fighting</b> <b>was</b> reported across a larger area, particularly in Sangin district to the south of Musa Qala.|$|E
5|$|Many navvies {{had been}} farm labourers from the Yorkshire Dales, North East England and the Fens, or {{had come for}} work from Scotland and Ireland.
