The community is recreational in nature and like nearby Nimpo Lake it is a base for sightseeing to Hunlen Falls, Klinaklini Falls and Chilko Lake, and for <b>fly-outs</b> to fishing on the area's many small plateau and alpine lakes.|$|R
50|$|Waslewski {{was very}} workmanlike, but started to tire {{in the sixth}} inning when, after walks to Roger Maris and Tim McCarver, was {{replaced}} by John Wyatt who {{would get out of}} the jam retiring Mike Shannon on a popup to short and Petrocelli on a fly to short right. The Cards would come back and hit Wyatt hard in the seventh. After pinch-hitter Bobby Tolan walked, Lou Brock hit a homer into the right-center field bleachers. Flood and Maris hit long <b>fly-outs</b> to center but their hits stayed in the park to end the inning, St. Louis had tied the score at four apiece.|$|R

25|$|Following the German reunification in 1990, {{a reform}} of the German Army {{resulted}} in the disbanding of all German Army Aviation Corps units based on Neuhausen ob Eck Air Base and the subsequent closure of the airbase itself. The <b>fly-out</b> took place on 28 September 1993 and Army Aviation Regiment 20 and Army Aviation Squadron 10 were disbanded with Army Aviation Squadron 10 partially relocating to Laupheim Air Base to form the new Army Aviation Support Squadron 10. Subsequently, the compound was briefly used by the military police, Training Company of Military Police Battalion 750, before being acquired by the town of Neuhausen ob Eck in 1997. In 2000, it was renamed take-off Gewerbe-Park (take-off Business Park).|$|E
40|$|Recent {{changes in}} the {{structure}} of families and households suggest a need for family economists to broaden their focus beyond the traditional nuclear family. This dissertation examines the trade-offs between work and family among two groups of non-traditional families: same-sex couples and committed couples who live apart. The first essay shows that marriage-market incentives can motivate observed differences in work and family arrangements between sexual minorities and heterosexual men and women. I develop the first formal model of a same-sex marriage market and observe that, while marriage-market competitors are distinct from prospective partners in different-sex marriage markets, they are identical in same-sex marriage markets. In light of this structural difference, I show that same-sex marriage markets engender stronger incentives than different-sex marriage markets for people of each sex to prepare for work in both the home and the market, and may engender stronger incentives for couples to adopt egalitarian divisions of labor. The second essay, which is collaborative work with Uniko Chen, Brooke Helppie McFall, and Robert J. Willis, uses data from an original survey project to present a current, comprehensive summary of the job-market outcomes of new entrants to the junior PhD job market in economics. We provide the first representative description of experiences with applications, interviews, <b>fly-outs,</b> and job offers among new entrants to the job market, and we demonstrate a correspondence between job-market outcomes and pre-market preferences and expectations using unique prospective measures. On the whole, our results suggest that experiences of most job candidates are positive. The third essay, which is collaborative work with Brooke Helppie McFall, uses data from the same survey project {{to assess the impact of}} dual-career location constraints on the initial job placements and relationship outcomes of new economists. We provide the first estimates of the prevalence and predictors of tied migration and non-cohabitation based on representative data from a known sub-population of dual-career couples. We find that non-cohabitation is an important margin of adjustment for couples facing dual-career location constraints, especially when they face large career costs of living together or are not deeply engaged in family life...|$|R
500|$|The brief {{attempt to}} resettle Bikini from 1974 until 1978 was aborted when health {{problems}} from radioactivity {{in the food}} supply caused the atoll to be evacuated again. Sport divers who visit Bikini to dive on the shipwrecks must eat imported food. The local government elected to close the fly-in <b>fly-out</b> sports diving operation in Bikini lagoon in 2008, and the 2009 diving season was canceled due to fuel costs, unreliable airline service to the island, {{and a decline in}} the Bikini Islanders' trust fund which subsidized the operation. After a successful trial in October 2010, the local government licensed a sole provider of dive expeditions on the nuclear ghost fleet at Bikini Atoll starting in 2011. The aircraft carrier [...] is the primary attraction of a struggling, high-end sport diving industry.|$|E
