40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} rule incompatibility phenomena (i. e., ungrammaticality {{resulting from}} {{two or more}} applications of movement rules in particular ways) and their related theoretical problems. The discussion concludes that the transformational component is exempted from many tasks which have been assigned to it, and the component should {{be reduced to a}} great extent. Rule incompatibility phenomena cannot be accounted for well by devices in the transformational component, such as the SD and SC of transformational rules, rule ordering, or constraints on rule application. The task of explaining the phenomena must be transferred to S-structure or the LF-component. A proposal is made that the phenomena are to be handled by constraints on binding theory, which operates at S-structure. Under the assumption of the <b>free</b> <b>indexing</b> theory, instances of rule incompatibility involve ambiguity in binding, or phrases not eligible to be binders. Thus, they are ruled out by the Unique Ā-Binding Constraint (UĀBC), which states that Ā-bound expressions must be uniquely bound to binders, and the Constraint on Incomplete Ā-Binders, which states that incomplete phrases cannot Ā-bind expressions. These constraints release the transformational component from the task of explaining the grammaticality judgments. Some cases of rule incompatibility can be accounted for either by the wh-island constraint or by the UĀBC. But, Chomsky's bounding theory must be revised, and given a revised bounding theory, the wh-island constraint does not hold. Nonexistence of the wh-island constraint indicates that rule incompatibility phenomena must be accounted for by the other alternative (i. e., the UĀBC), and that the transformational component is exempt from the wh-island constraint. Of the two possible indexing theories, the <b>free</b> <b>indexing</b> theory can handle rule incompatibility phenomena, but the other theory (the simultaneous indexing theory in our terminology) cannot. The choice of the <b>free</b> <b>indexing</b> theory releases transformational rules from the task of assigning indices to traces. It is furthermore suggested that the transformational component may be exempt from even the Subjacency Condition and the rule Move-α, and therefore, may be abandoned completely...|$|E

Text Extraction from image is concerned with extracting the relevant text data from a collection of images. Recent studies {{in the field of}} image processing show a great amount of interest in content retrieval from images and videos. This content can be in the form of objects, color, texture, shape as well as the relationships between them. As the commercial usage of digital contents are on rise, the requirement of an efficient and error <b>free</b> <b>indexing</b> text along with text localization and extraction is of high importance. The proposed system has broader scale of consideration of input image with much complicated backgrounds along with consideration of sliding windows.

40|$|The Aquarelle 1 {{architecture}} is {{designed and built}} in a user oriented perspective. Folder archiving, indexing and retrieval must thus be designed for data access through «user friendly», yet expeditious, methods. This is a major challenge to the Information Systems in the Aquarelle organisation. This document addresses the role of advanced full text indexing in delivering data access and archiving applications. Our aim is to investigate the effective use of structured folders using automatic or assisted indexing in a multimedia and multilingual environment. 1. 0 General Presentation One of the main objectives of the Aquarelle Project {{is to provide a}} user with the technical facilities supporting information retrieval by querying. And our specific task at the CRIN-CNRS & INRIA Lorraine (within Work Package 6 [6]) is to design a Full Text Retrieval System, including mechanisms for automatic indexing of documents using the information available within texts dealing with these documents. The prototype we are developing, based upon a new method we called Contrastive Full Text Indexing, has been integrated within the Grif SGML Editor and tested on two different protocols: • Blind (or <b>free</b> <b>indexing),</b> that is with no reference to a given thesaurus. This has the advantage of providing non technical words which a user could employ within his request. • Oriented (or controlled) indexing, with an existing thesaurus containing words close to the artwork being indexed. This collocation word method is a ˝contrastive ˝ indexing method [2]. This task is a collaboration between INRIA, GRIF and FORTH/ICS In addition, since Aquarelle is to support Multilingual or Crosslingual Information Retrieval, it is important, and crucial for perpetuating the Aquarelle Project, to supply the users with multilingual thesauri if they exist or to contribute to the translation of the thesaurus. We achieve a tool which automatically aligns a text and its translation [5, 1]. This tool will assist the translation of thesauri resources across language.

Ela amplia o modelo dominante que organiza a informação imagética apenas em função da descrição dos ícones figurados nas imagens. A leitura de imagens implica em perceber a presença e o funcionamento característico dos três principais signos semióticos: o ícone, o índice e o símbolo. Nossa proposta de leitura conclui que a indexação deve ter quatro diferentes entradas para palavras-chave. As três primeiras de acordo com as características de cada um dos tipos de signos. Juntas, representam os predicados de um conceito. A última entrada apresenta o resultado da semiose, o(s) conceito(s) ou assunto(s) da imagem. Além de evidenciar os predicados do(s) conceito(s) de cada imagem, a abordagem evita que, em função da entrada única de termos, característica da indexação livre do tipo folksonômica, predomine a presença dos ícones, signos que representam objetos materiais figurados nas imagens e que são os primeiros a serem identificados em qualquer processo de leitura. Organizadas e tabuladas em diferentes entradas, as palavras-chave decorrentes da presença e funcionamento dos três tipos de signos e sintetizadas no(s) conceito(s) ampliam a disponibilidade de informação existente nas imagens de um sistema de organização da informação.

40|$|The Internet {{constitutes}} a vast universe {{of knowledge and}} human culture, allowing the dissemination of ideas and information without borders. The Web also became an important media for the diffusion of multilingual resources. However, linguistic differences still form a major obstacle to scientific, cultural, and educational exchange. With the ever increasing size of the Web {{and the availability of}} more and more documents in various languages, this problem becomes all the more pervasive. Besides this linguistic diversity, a multitude of databases and collections now contain documents in various formats, which may also adversely affect the retrieval process. This paper presents the context, the problem statement, and the experiment carried out of a research project aiming to verify the existing relations between two different indexing approaches: (1) traditional image indexing recommending the use of controlled vocabularies or (2) free image indexing using uncontrolled vocabulary, and their respective performance for image retrieval, in a multilingual context. The use of controlled vocabularies or uncontrolled vocabularies raises a certain number of difficulties for the indexing process. These difficulties will necessarily entail consequences at the time of image retrieval. Indexing with controlled or uncontrolled vocabularies is a question extensively discussed in the literature. However, it is clear that many searchers recognize the advantages of either form of vocabulary according to circumstances (Arsenault, 2006). It appears that the many difficulties associated with <b>free</b> <b>indexing</b> using uncontrolled vocabularies can only be understood via a comparative analysis with controlled vocabulary indexing (Macgregor & McCulloch, 2006). This research compares image retrieval within two contexts: a monolingual context where the language of the query {{is the same as the}} indexing language; and a multilingual context where the language of the query is different from the indexing language. This research will indicate if one of these indexing approaches surpasses the other, in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the image searchers. For this research, three data collection methods are used: (1) the analysis of the vocabularies used for image indexing in order to examine the multiplicity of term types applied to images (generic description, identification, and interpretation) and the degree of indexing difficulty due to the subject and the nature of the image; (2) the simulation of the retrieval process with a subset of images indexed according to each indexing approach studied, and finally, (3) the administration of a questionnaire to gather information on searcher satisfaction during and after the retrieval process. The quantification of the retrieval performance of each indexing approach is based on the usability measures recommended by the standard ISO 9241 - 11, i. e. effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the user (AFNOR, 1998). The need to retrieve a particular image from a collection is shared by several user communities including teachers, artists, journalists, scientists, historians, filmmakers and librarians, all over the world. Image collections also have many areas of application: commercial, scientific, educational, and cultural. Until recently, image collections were difficult to access due to limitations in dissemination and duplication procedures. This research underlines the pressing necessity to optimize the methods used for image processing, in order to facilitate the imagesâ retrieval and their dissemination in multilingual environments. The results of this study will offer preliminary information to deepen our understanding of the influence of the vocabulary used in image indexing. In turn, these results can be used to enhance access to digital collections of visual material in multilingual environments...|$|E
