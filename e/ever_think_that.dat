500|$|It surpassed {{anything}} that I ever thought. [...] I didn't <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I {{should be in}} the cathedral with the Queen and all the dignitaries that were there. [...] And the singing, the organ, the Queen, just everything and everybody. [...] It's really been out of this world. [...] Just to hear Zadok the Priest, I think, has lifted me to Cloud Nine, because it's something that I love. [...] And to hear that and to have the Queen pass so close to me. [...] And yes, she smiled. [...] She smiled at me.|$|E
500|$|... "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is an electropunk song, which {{consists}} of three songs welded together, according to journalist Peter Robinson: one with a samba rhythm, one with a sped-up sample and a breakbeat, and an intro from elsewhere. The track opens with Cole singing over a [...] "spooky" [...] instrumentation. Her vocals have been vocodered and she sings [...] "Cause I've been sitting back, no chance of falling / Hoping that nothing ever blows, no no / Boy, did you <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> loving would be / Nothing more than walking me home, no no". As the chorus begins, the song incorporates a sample from Scottish rock band Nazareth's 1975 track [...] "Hair of the Dog", and the group starts singing, [...] "Did you tell him? No no no / Give him kisses? No no no / Whisper honey? No no no / You're delicious? Hell no". John Murphy of musicOMH noted that [...] "Sexy! No No No.." [...] is not [...] "structured like a proper pop song - there's no verse-chorus-verse". The instrumentation of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is composed of multi-layered guitar riffs and [...] "euphoric woo woo-oo harmonies", while the song's structure follows as introduction, chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, middle eight, verse. A Newsround reviewer described the lyrical content, saying that Girls Aloud are [...] "trying {{a different approach to}} getting the guy", in that [...] "instead of being 'sexy', they've backed off." ...|$|E
500|$|Although both singers {{worked with}} {{producer}} Benny Blanco in studio on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful", Spears recorded her vocals {{for the song}} before Sabi, who actually raps on the track. The latter also revealed she felt lucky and honored because Spears does not do features often, while commenting that [...] "it's just pretty crazy, I mean, I grew up watching Britney Spears. All my friends watched Britney Spears and we even had a routine to [...] that we were gonna perform, like, for a middle-school talent show. So it's a dream come true. Never did I <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I'd be in the mix with Britney. I'm just lucky." [...] When asked about how she learned about Sabi {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Spears revealed, [...] "friends and people around me are always showing me new artists that they love and that's how I learned about Sabi and ended up working with her on '(Drop Dead) Beautiful'. I have always wanted to feature a new artist on one of my albums and she is really cool." [...] A small teaser of the song was unveiled by the singer on March 7, 2011. Four days later, it leaked in full online, along with another Femme Fatale track, [...] "Inside Out". On August 5, 2011, Spears posted a poll on her Facebook page asking fans whether her next single should be [...] "Criminal", [...] "Inside Out" [...] or [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful." [...] After the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, she revealed to MTV News that [...] "Criminal" [...] was chosen as the fourth single.|$|E

I know it is very sad being here night after night by myself." [...] Mr. Wharton forgot, no doubt, at the moment, that he passed {{the majority of his}} evenings at the Eldon,--though, had he been reminded of it, he might have declared with perfect truth that the delights of his club were not satisfactory.|$|R
5000|$|A woman {{faces the}} camera and states her disbelief that Earth's polar ice caps are melting. She gives her {{rationale}} for what is occurring: [...] "I believe the polar bears are just getting fatter and weighing them down. <b>Ever</b> <b>think</b> of <b>that,</b> hippies?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, no, no," [...] cried Felicity quickly, {{before the}} Story Girl could speak, [...] "none {{of us would}} <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>THAT.</b> Sara only meant she didn't {{want you to go}} to any bother on our account." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You think, you men," [...] replied Mrs. Sewell, [...] "that a {{thing like}} that can be mended up and {{smoothed}} over, and made just the same as <b>ever.</b> You <b>think</b> <b>that</b> because Miss Vane is sorry she sent Barker away and wants him back, she can take him back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} {{have told me}} this," [...] she said. [...] "Since nothing else would {{convince}} you, it will enable me to talk plainly; I don't consider it an honour--not in the least. Can't you {{see that it is}} wholly and altogether out of the question <b>that</b> I should <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> in <b>that</b> way of you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Look even at Pussy Sobersides, {{with her}} dull, sleepy glance, her grave, slow walk, and dignified, prudish airs; who could <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{once she was}} the blue-eyed, whirling, scampering, head-over-heels, mad little {{firework}} that we call a kitten? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I got {{my wrists}} like this last night, wrestling with him. He swore he'd go and leave me, but I held him, I did. And don't you <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I'll {{let him go}} to that young girl--not if he kills me first!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The very question, my dear sister," [...] she said, [...] "tells me that I have succeeded. Dear me, what a {{difference}} it has made! No one would <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we were sisters. Don't {{you think that the}} shade of my hair is lovely?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of <b>that.</b> Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, {{and that}} makes all the {{difference}} in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown and her ruffled nightcap. Here are the costumes for the parts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So you won't?" [...] As {{the girl}} at first said nothing her {{companion}} caught at it. [...] "You won't, of course? I see you won't. But I don't see why, nevertheless, I shouldn't insist to you once for {{all on the}} plain truth of the whole matter. The truth, my dear, of your duty.

60|$|To {{correct the}} false is more {{difficult}} than to imbibe the true. Did you <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of <b>that</b> before? All my life have I been under the false impression that the Cape of Good Hope was the most southerly point of Africa. It is nothing of the sort. Cape Agulhas, not far distant, is the real extremity of South Africa. We doubled it on the 3rd of April.|$|R

Whether, not to go so far, this young woman ever has any dim revelation of that young woman--that young woman who is not here and never will come here; who is courted, and caressed, and loved, and has a husband, and bears children, and lives in a home, and who never knows what it is to have this lashing and tearing coming upon her? And whether this young woman, God help her, gives herself up then and drops like a coach-horse from the moon? ...|$|R
60|$|Beale Farange {{stood and}} smiled at his young lady, {{his back to the}} fanciful fireplace, his light overcoat--the very lightest in London--wide open, and his {{wonderful}} lustrous beard completely concealing the expanse of his shirt-front.

6000|$|... "May {{the white}} apes take us all," [...] cried Astok ruefully, [...] "if {{we are not}} in as ugly a snarl as you have <b>ever</b> seen! Nutus <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> we have her in hiding far away from Dusar. He has bidden me bring her here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless me, bless me!" [...] exclaimed the worthy mother, [...] "that I {{should live}} ever to see {{paintings}} of such people! Kitty, my dear, this bald-headed {{old man is}} St. Peter.

6000|$|... "It {{was only}} this," [...] said Jenny, seating herself with her elbow {{on the desk}} and her chin in a cup-like hollow of her hand, [...] "did you <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in the {{interests}} of these poor Indians, you know, purely for the sake of your belief in them, and just to show that you were above vulgar prejudices,--did you ever think you could marry one of them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there are}} {{occasionally}} {{women who are}} exceptions to the common law, gifted with peculiar genius and adaptations. With regard to such women, there has never seemed to be any doubt in the verdict of mankind {{that they ought to}} follow their nature, and that their particular sphere was the one to which they are called.

6000|$|... "Only once," [...] she answered. [...] "He came to St. Argueil {{about a year}} ago. I {{hated him}} then. I have hated him <b>ever</b> since. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if all men were like that I would be content {{to stay in the}} convent all my life." ...|$|R
60|$|I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, {{about fifteen}} minutes, I reckon. I was {{floating}} along, of course, {{four or five}} miles an hour; but you don't <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of <b>that.</b> No, you FEEL like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don't think to yourself how fast YOU'RE going, but you catch your breath and <b>think,</b> my! how <b>that</b> snag's tearing along. If you think it ain't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once--you'll see.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can’t {{describe}} her very well," [...] said Mr. Hurst. [...] "I {{can only say}} she’s the most beautiful girl I have <b>ever</b> seen.

60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Vagabonds--that is it. I {{want to be}} a vagabond, a wanderer. As I can't {{leap from}} cloud to cloud I want to wander from road to road.

Did you <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the roads are the only things that are endless; that one can walk on and on and on, and never be stopped by a gate or a wall? They are the serpent of eternity. I wonder they have never been worshipped. What are the stars beside them? They never meet one another. The roads are the only things that are infinite. They are all endless.|$|E

Well, it seems she's very free with her money and gives a good deal away to poor people." [...] (She's not the only one, thought the boy.)

5000|$|Jensen predicts, {{regarding}} the movement, that acts of personal {{violence in the}} future will be almost completely offensive by those countering the resistance movement (i.e. those currently in power) and self-defensive by those enacting the resistance movement. When asked, [...] "If we dismantle civilization, won't that kill millions of people in cities? What about them?," [...] Jensen has responded that [...] "No matter what you do, your hands will be blood red... because the global economy is already murdering humans and non-humans the planet over...." [...] and [...] "As this culture continues to collapse, those who are doing the exploiting will continue.... Don’t blame those who want to stop that exploitation. Instead, help to stop the exploitation that is killing people in the first place." [...] Jensen has also clarified such ideas on Democracy Now!: [...] "I get accused of being the 'violence guy'... but I don’t <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> really fair, because I really consider myself the 'everything guy', that I want to put everything on the table and talk about all forms of resistance....
