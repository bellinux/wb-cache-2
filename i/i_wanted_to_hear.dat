500|$|In {{the same}} interview, {{when asked whether}} the series had finished, both co-creators {{answered}} with a simultaneous [...] "Yes!". Morris expressed that [...] "I think the time is right. After the first film, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more from Jay, Will, Neil and Simon. But this time I feel there is enough. There {{is more than enough}} Jay in this world", and Beesley added [...] "The end of the story has always felt like the time where they go off and start living their adult life. And I think this film takes us up to that point".|$|E
500|$|Meyer-Landrut {{decided to}} take part in the talent show Unser Star für Oslo (Our Star for Oslo), a newly created {{national}} television programme to select the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo. The show was organised by public broadcaster ARD and private television station ProSieben, as well as entertainer, music producer and former Eurovision entrant Stefan Raab. Among 4,500 entrants, Meyer-Landrut was picked as one of the 20 contestants for the show. Asked about her motivation to apply, she stated, [...] "I like to test myself. I wanted to see how I am perceived, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> what people with knowledge have to say about it. I personally can't judge myself at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|CNN President Walter Isaacson {{met with}} Republican Party leaders in Washington, DC in 2001 saying {{afterwards}} [...] "I {{was trying to}} reach out to a lot of Republicans who feel that CNN has not been as open covering Republicans, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> their concerns," [...] As CNN founder Ted Turner stated, [...] "There really isn't much of a point getting some Tom, Dick or Harry off the streets to report on when we can snag a big name whom everyone identifies with. After all, it's all part of the business." [...] However, in April 2008, Turner criticized the direction that CNN has taken.|$|E

2500|$|I couldn't {{understand}} the words. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the words. It {{was a great}} song, [...] "Maggie's Farm," [...] and the sound was distorted. I ran over to {{the guy at the}} controls and shouted, [...] "Fix the sound so you can hear the words." [...] He hollered back, [...] "This is the way they want it." [...] I said [...] "Damn it, if I had an axe, I'd cut the cable right now." [...] But I was at fault. I was the MC, and I could have said to the part of the crowd that booed Bob, [...] "you didn't boo Howlin' Wolf yesterday. He was electric!" [...] Though I still prefer to hear Dylan acoustic, some of his electric songs are absolutely great. Electric music is the vernacular of {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, to use my father's old term.|$|E
2500|$|Kemp {{expressed}} that the a main {{motivation for the}} series was {{to hear from the}} soldiers who generally don't have a voice compared to other public workers. Kemp stated: [...] "I've got many friends who are in the services, but you never really hear a squaddie giving his point of view. I'd never heard one talk publicly and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that voice." [...] This would be the view of the young men being sent to the foreign climes of Afghanistan from a situation such as being 18 years old and still living at home with mum and dad, as opposed to hearing from officers trained in media relations. The series would examine the experiences of soldiers at home, injured soldiers and the families of serving soldiers. Kemp wanted to ascertain the motivation of the troops, their level of political knowledge about the situation, their views on Muslims. Kemp stated his opinion that the public gaining an understanding of what it's like for the soldiers is a good thing whatever anyone's political views on the war., informing the public what was happening out there and what the soldiers are doing for the people back home who are [...] "fortunate to live in a [...] country".|$|E
