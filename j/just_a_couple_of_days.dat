He soon met with his fellow college alumnus Mountbatten and travelled to Lahore and Calcutta to meet with commission members, chiefly Nehru from the Congress and Jinnah, president of the Muslim League. He objected to the short time frame, but all parties were insistent that the line be finished by the 15 August British withdrawal from India. Mountbatten had accepted the post as Viceroy {{on the condition of}} an early deadline. The decision was completed <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> before the withdrawal, but due to political manoeuvring, not published until 17 August 1947, two days after the grant of independence to India and Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Powell {{was next}} slated {{to run the}} Aviva London Grand Prix, however he pulled out, citing a groin strain. Later in late August, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> {{before the start of}} the World Championships in Daegu, Powell shocked the world by pulling out of the highly {{anticipated}} 100m as his groin strain aggravated and did not allow him to compete. Powell expressed great disappoinment but vowed to come back strong for the London Olympics in 2012, but still hoped to run the 4x100m relay in Daegu. However, he was unfit to run the relay and had to watch his compatriots win gold in a world record time of 37.04s. Powell competed in the 100m at the Diamond League Final in Zurich on 9 September. He looked very impressive in the first 60m, but faded to second place as newly crowned world champion, Yohan Blake, took victory in 9.82s. Powell registered a 9.95s run, which was impressive given the fact that his injury was still present. By completing the race, the sprinter took the Samsung Diamond Trophy with $40,000 in cash. Powell ended his season with another injury, almost a repeat of year 2010, where he showed excellent form in the first half of the year, but unfortunately suffered injuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{victory of}} Nagysalló, brought with itself serious results.

In {{the same time it}} brought the imperials in the situation of being incapable to stretch their troops on a very large front which this Hungarian victory created, so instead of uniting their troops around Pest and Buda, as they planned, Feldzeugmeister Welden had to order the retreat from Pest being in danger to fall in the pincers of the Hungarian troops. When he learned about the defeat in the morning of 20 April, he wrote to Lieutenant General Balthasar Simunich, the commander of the besieging forces of Komárom, and to Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, the Minister-President of the Austrian Empire, that in order to secure Vienna and Pozsony, from a Hungarian attack, he is forced to retreat the imperial troops from Pest, and even from Komárom. He also wrote that the spirit of the imperial troops is very low, and because of this they cannot fight another battle for a while, without suffering another defeat. So the next day he ordered the evacuation of Pest, leaving an important garrison in the fortress of Buda, to defend it against the Hungarian attacks. He ordered to Jelačić to remain for a while in Pest, and than to retreat towards Eszék in Bácska where the Serbian insurgents, allied with the Austrians were in a grave situation after the victories of the Hungarian armies led by Mór Perczel and Józef Bem.|$|E

Their place in Vác {{was taken by the}} VII. corps under András Gáspár, than after they too departed on the same way, their place in Vác was taken by the division of György Kmety. At 15–17 April the Hungarian army consisting of the I. corps led by General György Klapka, III. corps led by General János Damjanich, and two divisions of the VII. corps led by General András Gáspár arrived to the Garam river, under the overall leadership of General Artúr Görgei. Here, on 19 April, at Nagysalló, they met with the troops of Lieutenant General Ludwig von Wohlgemuth with the new imperial troops gathered in the following Habsburg Hereditary Lands: Styria, Bohemia, Moravia and the capital Vienna, and strengthened with the Jablonowski division (which participated 10 days before in the Battle of Vác). The imperials suffered defeat and retreated towards Érsekújvár. The Hungarian victory of Nagysalló, brought with itself serious results.

2500|$|Mirabeau's {{love affairs}} are well-known, {{owing to the}} celebrity of the letters to Marie Thérèse de Monnier, his [...] "Sophie". In spite of his {{disfigurement}} (or perhaps because of it), he won {{the heart of the}} lady to whom his colonel was attached; this led to such scandal that his father obtained a lettre de cachet, and Mirabeau was imprisoned in the Île de Ré. On being released, the young nobleman obtained leave to accompany the French expedition to Corsica as a volunteer. During the Corsican expedition, Mirabeau contracted several more gambling debts and engaged in another scandalous love affair. However, he proved his military genius in the Corsican expedition, and also conducted a thorough study of the island during his stay. The study was most likely factually incorrect, but his desire to learn of a country that had been previously unstudied emphasizes Mirabeau's endless curiosity and inquisitiveness, particularly into the traditions and customs of society. [...] Mirabeau learned the value of hard work in the French army. This aspect of Mirabeau's personality contributed to his popular success in later years, during the Revolution. After his return, he tried to keep on good terms with his father, and in 1772 he married a rich heiress, Marie–Marquerite–Emilie de Covet, daughter of the marquis de Marignane. Emilie, who was 18 years old, was apparently engaged to a much older nobleman, the Comte de Valbelle. Nonetheless, Mirabeau pursued her for several months, expecting that their marriage would benefit from the money that the couple would receive from their parents. After several months of failed attempts at being introduced to the heiress, Mirabeau bribed one of the young lady's maids to let him into her residence, where he pretended to have had a sexual encounter with Emilie. To avoid losing face, her father saw that they got married <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> afterwards. Mirabeau received a small allowance of 6,000 livres from his father, but never received the expected dowry from the marquis.|$|E
