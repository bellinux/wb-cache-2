5|$|Louis XVIII's {{underestimation}} of Bonaparte proved disastrous. On 19 March, {{the army}} stationed outside Paris defected to Bonaparte, leaving the city vulnerable to attack. That same day, Louis XVIII quit the capital {{with a small}} escort at midnight. Louis decided to <b>go</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> Lille, and then crossed the border into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, staying in Ghent. Other leaders, most prominently Alexander I of Russia, debated whether {{in the case of}} a second victory over the French Empire, the Duke of Orléans should be proclaimed king instead of Louis XVIII.|$|E

And if the matters are so great, or so much of grace, that the Chancellor and the others cannot do what is asked without the King, then they shall take them to the King to know his will, and that no petition come before the King and his Council except by the hands of the said Chancellor and the other chief ministers; so that the King and his Council may be able, without the embarrassment of other business, to attend to the important business of his kingdom and his foreign lands.|$|E

[...] He said that wanted to <b>go</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> Rome, and then to the United Kingdom to seek asylum. “I'm neither a rebel nor in the opposition, but the Sudanese government is exterminating the population by creating conflicts among different communities and saying that it's just an internal, communal problem,” he said.|$|E

2500|$|At that time, Pinzón {{suggested}} to Columbus {{the change of}} course on 6 October 1492He navigated {{his way to the}} west. Then went forty leagues between day and night; he told the people thirty-three leagues. That night Martín Alonso said it would be set course southwest by west; and to the Admiral it seemed that this Martín Alonso said this because of the island of Cipango (Japan), and the Admiral saw that if they missed it they could not soon find land quickly {{and that it would be}} better off to <b>go</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> the mainland and later to the islands.}} This change brought the expedition to landfall on Guanahani on 12 October 1492.|$|E
2500|$|The second role of MS-DOS (as the 16-bit legacy {{device driver}} layer) {{was as a}} {{backward}} compatibility tool for running DOS programs in Windows. Many MS-DOS programs and device drivers interacted with DOS in a low-level way; for example, by patching low-level BIOS interrupts such as int 13h, the low-level disk I/O interrupt. When a program issued an int 21h call to access MS-DOS, the call would <b>go</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> the 32-bit file system manager, which would attempt to detect this sort of patching. If it detects that the program has tried to hook into DOS, it will jump back into the 16-bit code to let the hook run. A 16-bit driver called IFSMGR.SYS would previously have been loaded by CONFIG.SYS, the job of which was to hook MS-DOS first before the other drivers and programs got a chance, then jump from 16-bit code back into 32-bit code, when the DOS program had finished, to let the 32-bit file system manager continue its work. According to Windows developer Raymond Chen, [...] "MS-DOS was just an extremely elaborate decoy. Any 16-bit drivers and programs would patch or hook {{what they thought was}} the real MS-DOS, but which was in reality just a decoy. If the 32-bit file system manager detected that somebody bought the decoy, it told the decoy to quack.|$|E
2500|$|A {{survey of}} admissions {{officers}} revealed that 28% agreed that their school had accepted athletes despite having lower grades and test scores than others. A {{survey by the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that schools with strong athletics departments tended to have athletes with lower SAT scores than non-athletic students. Athletes get better treatment even at elite colleges, according to one academic study. A report suggested that some applications by athletes <b>go</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> a special committee for review by coaches, who may then, in turn, advocate for particular players. Recruited athletes who play in-demand or [...] "revenue" [...] sports (i.e. generate ticket sales) such as football or basketball can have a [...] "significantly greater advantage in admissions" [...] than others. Some Ivy League coaches, seeking to improve the average academic performance of their teams, would admit mediocre athletes with top academic skills {{as a means to}} balance out the stellar athletes with below-average academic ability. To fix this [...] "average score" [...] arrangement in which there had been a temptation to admit an extremely poor student with great athletic ability, many schools went to a banding arrangement. For example, coaches would consider all wrestling applicants within a specified range or band of academic performance, and coaches could admit more wrestler-applicants who showed greater scholastic promise. Howard and Matthew Greene report that coaches do not make admissions decisions, but they can advocate for a particular applicant. And they report that committed athletes should explain in their applications how much time they have used towards perfecting their athletic ability: ...|$|E
