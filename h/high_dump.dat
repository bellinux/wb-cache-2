Several simulations of 40  m <b>high</b> <b>dump</b> slopes with different ranges of cohesion and {{angle of internal friction}} were numerically solved and analyzed to ascertain the role of material strength on factor of safety of slope and its stability. On each modeled scenario, different combination of cohesion ranging from 5 to 40  kPa and frictional angle ranging from 5 ° to 40 ° were alternated. To determine the effects of change in one of the strength parameters, the other as well as the slope profile is kept constant. The factors of safety generated for change in cohesion and internal friction angle are shown in Tables  12 and 13 respectively.|$|E
40|$|The {{thermal history}} and in {{particular}} the mixing dump temperature is a parameter of paramount importance in mixing rubber and silica with a silane coupling agent in order to achieve proper silanization of silica and to avoid premature scorch reactions. In this work, the influence of mixing dump temperature on the performance of silica reinforced Natural Rubber (NR) is investigated. The investigation also includes the effect of non-rubber constituents, primarily proteins in NR, by using deproteinized Natural Rubber (DPNR) and synthetic polyisoprene (IR). The vulcanization properties and rubber-to-filler interactions of silica reinforced NR in presence and absence of a silane coupling agent are highlighted. With increasing mixing dump temperature, the silanization reaction between silica and silane coupling agent proceeds further. At sufficiently <b>high</b> <b>dump</b> temperature, filler-filler interactions in the NR-silica compounds are reduced and silica-rubber interaction improved as evidenced by a drop in the Payne effect and increment in chemically bound rubber. It is demonstrated that NR and IR compounds mixed till above the optimum dump temperature exhibit cure reversion and reduction in tensile properties. On the other hand, DPNR-silica vulcanizates show slightly more constant physical properties...|$|E

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of 2 ′-deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) {{has been}} studied in a cytidine- and uracil-requiring mutant of Salmonella typhimurium (DP- 55). The dUMP pool and the thymidine monophosphate (dTMP) pool of DP- 55, grown {{in the presence of}} 3 H-uracil and unlabeled cytidine, are found to have the same specific activities. However, only 30 % of the dUMP and the dTMP is synthesized from a uridine nucleotide. Seventy per cent is derived directly from a cytosine compound. The identification and partial purification of a Mg 2 +-dependent 2 ′-deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) deaminase from S. typhimurium suggests that the combined action of dCTP deaminase and 2 ′-deoxyuridine triphosphate pyrophosphatase accounts for 70 % of the dUMP, and therefore the dTMP, synthesized in vivo. The introduction of a thymine requirement (i. e., a block in thymidylate synthetase) into DP- 55 results in a 100 -fold increase {{in the size of the}} dUMP pool. However, the relative contribution of the uridine and cytidine pathways to dUMP synthesis is unaltered. The <b>high</b> <b>dUMP</b> pool is accompanied by extensive catabolism of dUMP to uracil. Partial thymine starvation of the cells results in a significant increase in the dUMP and dCTP pools. Moreover, an increase in the contribution of the dCTP pathway to dUMP synthesis is observed. As a result of these changes the catabolism of dUMP to uracil is augmented...|$|E
40|$|As spoil <b>dumps</b> get <b>higher,</b> {{particularly}} in strip mining where most overburden is placed in-pit, consequences of slope failure become disproportionately greater. Current {{understanding of the}} shearing behaviour of spoil for stability design has involved a combination of laboratory-scale diagnostic testing and engineering judgment. This is a relatively empirical approach that provides a linear shear strength envelope for materials known to exhibit non-linear behaviour, particularly under high confining stresses. A shortcoming to the diagnostic testing is that oversize particles are usually scalped to accommodate the device capacity. The influence of prototype-size particles on the geomechanical behaviour of mine spoil is not truly captured. In response to concerns about overestimating the shear strength and stability of <b>high</b> spoil <b>dumps,</b> and current plans for coal mine dumps to exceed 400 m in height, {{there is a need}} to rationally define the stress-strain behaviour of more characteristic spoil masses under representative compressive and shearing loads.

40|$|Large scale, {{open pit}} copper mining in Chile {{involves}} {{the mobilization of}} large amounts of waste material from the pit to areas specifically prepared to store this material. The challenge faced by some mines in the Andean mountain range {{is the lack of}} available space for waste dumps given the steepness of the typical mountainous topography. Because of this there is an ever more urgent need to design very <b>high</b> <b>dumps</b> that are unprecedented in the world. Usually verification of the stability of waste dumps does not pose a significant difficulty. However, in the case of deposits that can be hundreds of metres high at the face, such as those planned by Codelco´s Andina Division, it becomes necessary to have detailed knowledge of the geomechanical behaviour of the material. In general, the studies in characterisation of coarse granular material have been done in relation to the construction of rockfill dams. Waste dumps, as opposed to dams, are generally built simply by overturning truckloads, which produce a low initial density. Additionally, the particles of material can reach sizes in the order of metres, which is not common in dam construction. The investigation and results of the characterization of the geomechanical properties of the waste material from Codelco´s Andina Division is presented in this paper. In particular, characterisation of the particles and large scale shear resistance tests were carried out in an attempt to simulate the field conditions in terms of grain size distribution of the material and level of the expected loads. ...|$|R
