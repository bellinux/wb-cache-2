For {{the most}} part, Sherman refused to revise his {{original}} {{text on the}} ground that [...] "I disclaim the character of historian, but assume to be a witness on the stand before the great tribunal of history" [...] and [...] "any witness who may <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> should publish his own version of [...] facts in the truthful narration of which he is interested."

2500|$|Both [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice" [...] {{and second}} single [...] "Everybody Knows" [...] were largely ignored by U.S. country radio {{and failed to}} {{penetrate}} the top 35 of the Hot Country Songs chart. [...] In June 2006, Emily Robison noted {{the lack of support}} from other country music performers: [...] "A lot of artists cashed in on being against what we said or what we stood for because that was promoting their career, which was a horrible thing to do. ... A lot of pandering started going on, and you'd see soldiers and the American flag in every video. It became a sickening display of ultra-patriotism." [...] Maines commented, [...] "The entire country may <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> but I don't understand the necessity for patriotism. Why {{do you have to be}} a patriot? About what? This land is our land? Why? You can like where you live and like your life, but as for loving the whole country ... I don't see why people care about patriotism." [...] In Europe, however, the two singles were well received by country radio, peaking at Nos. 13 and 11 respectively and remaining on the European Country Charts for more than 20 weeks each.|$|E
2500|$|Searle defines {{intentionality}} as {{the power}} of minds to be about, to represent (see Correspondence theory of truth), or to stand for, things, properties and states of affairs in the world. The nature of intentionality {{is an important part}} of discussions of Searle's [...] "Philosophy of Mind". Searle emphasizes that the word ‘intentionality, (the part of the mind directed to/from/about objects and relations in the world independent of mind) should not be confused with the word ‘intensionality’ (the logical property of some sentences that do not pass the test of 'extensionality'). In Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind (1983), Searle applies certain elements of his account(s) of [...] "illocutionary acts" [...] to the investigation of intentionality. Searle also introduces a technical term the Background, which, according to him, has been the source of much philosophical discussion ("though I have been arguing for this thesis for almost twenty years," [...] Searle writes, [...] "many people whose opinions I respect still <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> about it.") Background he calls the set of abilities, capacities, tendencies, and dispositions that humans have and that are not themselves intentional states. Thus, when someone asks us to [...] "cut the cake" [...] we know to use a knife and when someone asks us to [...] "cut the grass" [...] we know to use a lawnmower (and not vice versa), even though the actual request did not include this detail. Searle sometimes supplements his reference to the Background with the concept of the Network, one's network of other beliefs, desires, and other intentional states necessary for any particular intentional state to make sense. Searle argues that the concept of a Background is similar to the concepts provided by several other thinkers, including Wittgenstein's private language argument ("the work of the later Wittgenstein is in large part about the Background") and Pierre Bourdieu's habitus.|$|E

What! with my high character and connections, with my stake in society, was it to be expected that I, the Marquess of Carabas, was going to make any move which compromised the predominancy of my interests?

6000|$|Dear Sir,--When we met lately at the hospitable {{board of}} our common friend, Benjamin Allen, Esq., lately elected Professor of Chemistry in the University of London, our {{conversation}} turned (if you can pass me the intoxicating favour of remembering it) on the glorious science of chemistry. For me this knowledge has ever possessed irresistible attractions, from the enormous power which it confers of heaping benefits on the suffering race of mankind. Others may rejoice in the advantages which a knowledge of it bestows--the power which can reduce a Hannibal {{to the level of}} a drummer boy, or an all-pervading Shakspeare to the intellectual estate of a vestryman, though it cannot at present reverse those processes. The consideration of the destructive as compared with the constructive forces of chemistry was present, as I recollect, to your powerful intellect on the festive occasion to which I refer. [...] "Yes!" [...] you said (permit me to repeat your very words)--"Yes, Count Fosco, Alexander's morning draught shall make Alexander run for his life at the first sound of the enemy's trumpet. So much chemistry can achieve; but can she help as well as harm? Nay, can she answer for it that the lemon which Professor Allen, from the best and purest of motives, has blended with this milk-punch, shall not <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to-morrow morning? Can chemistry, Count Fosco, thus thwart malign constitutional tendency?" ...|$|E

At the time when I had bills (go on with your drawing; you can listen, and draw too), I used, of course, to think it necessary to check the tradespeople, and see that their Total was right. You will hardly believe me, but I don't remember ever making the sum what the shop made it, on more than about three occasions. And, what was worse, if I tried a second time, I could not even get it to agree with what I had made it myself the first time. Thank Heaven, I've no difficulties of that sort to grapple with now! Everything's paid for the moment it comes in.

6000|$|Pray what is {{the meaning}} of this eagerness, this hesitation, this pshaing and shilly-shallying, these doubts, this tremor as he knocks at the door of Mr. Lambert's lodgings in Dean Street, and survey the footman who comes to his summons? Does any young man read? does any old one remember? does any wearied, worn, {{disappointed}} pulseless heart recall the time of its full beat and early throbbing? It is ever so many hundred years since some of us were young; and we forget, but do not all forget. No, madam, we remember with advantages, as Shakspeare's Harry promised his soldiers they should do if they survived Agincourt and that day of St. Crispin. Worn old chargers turned out to grass, if the trumpet sounds over the hedge, may we not kick up our old heels, and gallop a minute or so about the paddock, till we are brought up roaring? I do not care for clown and pantaloon now, and think the fairy ugly, and her verses insufferable: but I like to see children at a pantomime. I do not dance, or eat supper any more; but I like to watch Eugenio and Flirtilla twirling round in a pretty waltz, or Lucinda and Ardentio pulling a cracker. Burn your little fingers, children! Blaze out little kindly flames from each other's eyes! And then draw close together and read the motto (that old namby-pamby motto, so stale and so new!)--I say, let her lips read it, and his construe it; and so divide the sweetmeat, young people, and crunch it between you.
