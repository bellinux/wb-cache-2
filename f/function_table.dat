25|$|The Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (Fall 1945) was a Turing complete, {{general-purpose}} computer that used 17,468 vacuum tubes {{to create the}} circuits. At its core, it {{was a series of}} Pascalines wired together. Its 40 units weighed 30 tons, occupied , and consumed $650 per hour (in 1940s currency) in electricity when idle. It had 20 base-10 accumulators. Programming the ENIAC took up to two months. Three function tables were on wheels and needed to be rolled to fixed function panels. Function tables were connected to function panels using heavy black cables. Each <b>function</b> <b>table</b> had 728 rotating knobs. Programming the ENIAC also involved setting some of the 3,000 switches. Debugging a program took a week. The ENIAC featured parallel operations. Different sets of accumulators could simultaneously work on different algorithms. It used punched card machines for input and output, and it was controlled with a clock signal. It ran for eight years, calculating hydrogen bomb parameters, predicting weather patterns, and producing firing tables to aim artillery guns.|$|E

40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that the issue of {{software}} documentation cannot be ignored if safe reliable software is the goal. To be useful, software documentation should be easy to manipulate. <b>Function</b> <b>tables</b> are a natural way of documenting software through the use of mathematical tabular notation. The need has been expressed for a tool to automatically generate the mathematical composition of two <b>function</b> <b>tables,</b> which would document the sequential execution of two programs. The Function Composition Tool is a prototype toward this end. The tool is based on existing algorithms using normal <b>function</b> <b>tables,</b> and their extensions to vector <b>function</b> <b>tables.</b> This work involves the design and implementation of the software. Supporting software enables the execution of test suites on the tool. iii Acknowledgements I would like to express my appreciation for the efforts and advice of my supervisors, Dr. David L.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{improvements}} {{were made to}} ENIAC after 1948, including a primitive read-only stored programming mechanism using the <b>Function</b> <b>Tables</b> as program ROM, an idea included in the ENIAC patent and proposed independently by Richard Clippinger of BRL. Clippinger consulted with von Neumann on what instruction set to implement. Clippinger had thought of a 3-address architecture while von Neumann proposed a 1-address architecture because it was simpler to implement. Three digits of one accumulator (6) were used as the program counter, another accumulator (15) {{was used as the}} main accumulator, a third accumulator (8) was used as the address pointer for reading data from the <b>function</b> <b>tables,</b> and most of the other accumulators (1â€“5, 7, 9â€“14, 17â€“19) were used for data memory.|$|R

This allows for efficient implementation in two-level logic arrays such as a PLA (Programmable Logic Array) or a PAL (Programmable Array Logic).|$|E
40|$|Classical {{strategies}} for resource management in operating systems are often complex and innapropriate for embedded systems. Implementations for these strategies may use either virtual <b>function</b> <b>tables</b> or long conditional structures to provide transparent access to different resources. This overhead is unacceptable for embedded systems. The EPOS operating system provides flexible and transparent {{access to resources}} for applications without incurring in unnecessary overhead. Metaprogrammed structures are used to predict, according to application usage and in compile time, whether a resource must use a polymorphic representation or may be accessed through direct calls. This way, virtual <b>function</b> <b>tables</b> are only used in the system when strictly necessary, and thus saving resources. In this article, we show that this strategy is a viable alternative for resource management in embedded systems...|$|R

Semantic obfuscation is achieved by transforming a <b>function</b> into a <b>table</b> <b>function.</b> The <b>table</b> <b>function</b> method only shows input data and output data.
