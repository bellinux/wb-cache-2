He blackmails her into remarrying him as he alludes that he has information on the music box that Katherine once told him. However, his information ends up being a dead end. After Colin's lies are exposed, Jill locks him in the attic and refuses to let him out until he owns up to his lies, which he eventually does and they patch things up.

Flair <b>finally</b> <b>let</b> Jarrett join the group in February 1997, but the others did not want him, and in July 1997 was ultimately kicked out of the group by Flair himself, who had enough of the instability Jarrett's presence caused the Horsemen. Flair also feuded with Roddy Piper, Syxx, and his old nemesis Curt Hennig in 1997, after Hennig was offered a spot in The Four Horsemen only to turn on Flair and The Four Horsemen at Fall Brawl in September 1997, in which Hennig punctuated the act by slamming the cage door onto Flair's head.|$|E

At the {{beginning}} of the series, she is consumed by the Phoenix Force and nearly destroys the world with her tremendous strength and power. The X-Men engage in a brief battle with her, until she ultimately sacrifices herself to save the world. Although she apparently dies, she assists the X-Men with conflicts through a strong telepathic link in later episodes, such as saving Professor X from hallucinations, and appears as the White Phoenix of the Crown, encouraging the X-Men to keep on fighting to save the world. She was in a strong and close romantic relationship with Cyclops, and had a necklace with a ruby stone with gold {{in the shape of a}} phoenix, which was a gift from Cyclops. The necklace was then given to Hisako as a sign that Cyclops can <b>finally</b> <b>let</b> Jean go, as he recognizes her sacrifice as a symbol of love for her friends and the world.

2500|$|Chekhov wrote The Cherry Orchard {{over the}} course of several years, {{alternating}} between periods of lighthearted giddiness and despondent frustration which he considered as bordering upon sloth (in a letter, he wrote, [...] "Every sentence I write strikes me as good for nothing.") Throughout this time he was also further inhibited by his chronic tuberculosis. Guarded by nature, Chekhov seemed overly secretive about all facets of the work, including even the title. As late as the Summer of 1902 he still had not shared anything about the play with anyone in his immediate family or the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT). It was only to comfort his wife, Olga Knipper (who was recovering from a miscarriage at the time), that he <b>finally</b> <b>let</b> her in on the play's title, whispering it to her despite the fact that the two were alone. Chekhov was apparently delighted with the very sound of the title, and enjoyed the same sense of triumph months later when he finally revealed it to Konstantin Stanislavski. By October 1903 the play was finished and sent to the MAT company. Three weeks later, Chekhov arrived at rehearsals in what would be a futile attempt to curb all the [...] "weepiness" [...] from the play which Stanislavski had developed. The author apparently also snickered when, during rehearsals, the word [...] "orchard" [...] was replaced with the more practical [...] "plantation", feeling that with that word he had perfectly and symbolically captured the impracticality of an entire way of life.|$|E

2500|$|The {{title track}} and opening song, [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", was {{compared}} to her debut single, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), featuring a slap-and-pop bassline, synthesizer chord stabs and a mechanized beat. Lyrically, the song sees Spears warning to an overeager prospective lover: [...] "Oops, you think I'm in love/That I'm sent from above — I'm not that innocent." [...] The song also breaks down for a spoken-word interlude, involving {{a line from the}} film Titanic (1997). The second track [...] "Stronger" [...] is a synthpop and R track, which is lyrically a declaration of independence, where Spears leaves a partner who treats her like property. The line [...] "my loneliness ain't killing me no more" [...] makes reference to the verse [...] "my loneliness is killing me" [...] from her song [...] "...Baby One More Time". Another R track, which also adds a bit more funk to the mix, [...] "Don't Go Knocking on My Door" [...] finds Spears confidently forging ahead after a breakup. The fourth track, a cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", begins with mushy guitar plucking and breathy coos, until a dry, crackling lockstep is thrown down, turning the song into an urban stomp. The dance-pop version also jettisons the song's final verse and adds some new lyrics ("how white my shirts could be" [...] becomes [...] "how tight my skirt should be"). [...] " [...] was my idea [...] ", Spears said. [...] "I was just like, 'I like this song,' and I {{think it will be a}} really cool combination working with [...] Rodney [...] and doing a really funky song like that." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", was co-written by country-pop singer-songwriter Shania Twain and her then-husband, producer Robert [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, who also produced the track. The ballad, which boasts a slinky keyboard riff and Lange's characteristically lavish production, finds Spears allowing a bit of country twang into her vocals as she begs a lover to reveal his feelings: [...] "My friends say you're into me ... but I need to hear it straight from you", she sings. The sixth track [...] "What U See (Is What U Get)" [...] demands respect by rebuking a jealous partner, while the seventh track, [...] "Lucky", is a heart-rending tale of a Hollywood starlet's loneliness, proving that fame can be empty. [...] "If there's nothing missing in my life/Then why do these tears come at night?", she asks. [...] "School crush" [...] is the theme of [...] "One Kiss from You", a track that has a reggae-style beat and lyrics about the feelings of falling in love, and the quickness of it, with Spears cooing that after only one kiss she sees her entire future with her lover. The ballad [...] "Where Are You Now" [...] talks about wanting to know where a previous love is, and what that person is up to, so that she can <b>finally</b> <b>let</b> them go and find closure. Lines on [...] "Can't Make You Love Me", an Europop song, state that fancy cars and money pale in comparison to true love, with Spears singing: [...] "I'm just a girl with a crush on you." [...] The mid-tempo, synth-backed [...] "When Your Eyes Say It", written by songwriter Diane Warren, combines a string section with a loping hip hop beat, while Spears makes her own songwriting debut on the modest, keyboard-driven ballad [...] "Dear Diary", which she said is autobiographical. On the track, she sings of wanting to become [...] "so much more than friends" [...] with a boy.|$|E
