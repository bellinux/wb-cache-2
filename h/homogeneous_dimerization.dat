40|$|The faradaic {{impedance}} for an electrode mechanism with a reversible <b>homogeneous</b> <b>dimerization</b> reaction {{following the}} electron transfer step is derived. The chemical reaction {{shows up in}} the frequency dependence of the faradaic impedance and admittance in a similar way as deduced by Sluyters-Rehbach and Sluyters (J. Electroanal. Chem. 23 (1989) 457; J. Electroanal. Chem. 26 (1990) 237) for a homogeneous first-order chemical reaction. Two limiting cases can be distinguished in which the general expression reduces to the simpler Randles or pseudo-Randles expression. Under those conditions, the presence of the dimerization reaction can be inferred from the potential dependence of the impedance parameters. The theory is applied to the reduction of the methyl viologen di-cation at mercury electrodes in aqueous solution. The rate and the equilibrium constants for the dimerization reaction and the standard potential for the electron transfer step are obtained from the Warburg coefficient, while the potential dependence of the irreversibility coefficient allows the calculation of the standard rate constant and the transfer coefficient for the electron transfer step. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of <b>homogeneous</b> propylene <b>dimerization</b> catalyzed by bis(acetylacetonato) nickel (II) -triethyldialuminium trichloride-triphenylphosphine in toluene {{was investigated}} at low tem-peratures, — 50 [...] 20 °C and high propylene concentrations, 0. 44 - 2. 25 mol 1 - 1 (propylene/nickel molar ratio of 240 - 2400). The rate of dimer formation {{can be represented}} by the form: d [C 6 Hla] = k[Ni] [Cal- 161 dt k = 1010. 1 exp(- 13000 /R T) mol- 1 1 s- 1 where [Ni] and [C 3 H 61 are the nickel and propylene concentrations, respectively.

40|$|At {{no time in}} my {{life did}} I dream of such a Prize. Indeed, as I {{explained}} in my biography, I had no training in research as such and as a consequence I am in a sense self-taught. What I owe to the Institut Français du Pétrole is some free-dom to choose my research area. I have always been an avid reader of chem-ical literature, eager for what is new. Like all sciences, chemistry is marked by magic moments. For someone fortunate enough to live such a moment, it is an instant of intense emotion: an immense field of investigation suddenly opens up before you. There were very many of these moments {{in the course of my}} career. For example, the discovery of ferrocene, the stereospecific poly-merization of olefins by G. Natta (I never failed to read any of his articles!), the homogeneous catalysis of hydrogenation by rhodium complexes (G. Wilkinson), the <b>homogeneous</b> catalysis of <b>dimerization</b> of olefins by nickel complexes (G. Wilke and B. Bogdanovic) and the catalysis of asymmetric hy-drogenation. I experienced the latter with an especially keen intensity be-cause we were in very close touch with Henri Kagan, who came every mont...|$|R
40|$|NO {{oxidation}} catalysts {{are used in}} conjunction with NOx adsorbents to remove toxic nitrogen oxides from combustion effluents that lack CO and residual hydrocarbons as reductants. Efficient NOx trapping strategies require detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanism and the structural requirements for NO oxidation and for NOx adsorption, which are investigated here by kinetic, isotopic, and spectroscopic methods. NO oxidation rates on Pt, PdO, RhO 2, and Co 3 O 4 catalysts increase linearly with O 2 and NO pressures and are inhibited by NO 2, consistent with a kinetically-relevant NO oxidation step that requires the reaction of O 2 with vacancies (*) on active sites nearly saturated with oxygen atoms (O*). Equilibrated reactions between catalyst surfaces and NO and NO 2 molecules establish the concentration of oxygen vacancies during NO oxidation. Measurements of 16 O 2 - 18 O 2 exchange rates are used to confirm and to further investigate the O¬ 2 activation steps proposed for NO oxidation. NO oxidation rates on all catalysts are markedly higher on large metal and oxide clusters that bind oxygen more weakly than small clusters; consequently, oxygen vacancies become more abundant as cluster size increases. Both RhO 2 and Co 3 O 4 undergo one-electron reductions to intermediate oxidation states (Rh 2 O 3 and CoO) when vacancies form during NO oxidation, which allows both Rh and Co oxides to effectively catalyze NO oxidation. The pervasive NO 2 inhibition of NO oxidation turnovers leads to synergistic effects between NOx adsorbents and NO {{oxidation catalysts}}. NO oxidation rates are much higher when NO 2 adsorption sites are present to bind NO 2 as it forms on catalyst sites, and NO oxidation rates depend critically on the rate of NO 2 adsorption on oxide substrates. NOx adsorption on BaO-containing solids leads to nitrites (NO 2 -) and nitrates (NO 3 -). The formation of nitrites on BaO/Al 2 O 3 requires vicinal co-adsorption of NO and NO 2 to displace carbonates that form during exposure to CO 2 in combustion effluent. NO and NO 2 bind rapidly as nitrite, but NOx uptakes as nitrite are limited in CO 2 -rich streams by thermodynamics that result in most binding sites being occupied with carbonate at high CO 2 /NOx ratios. Nitrates are more stable, and their formation is required to achieve large NOx uptakes from combustion effluent. The conversion of nitrites to nitrates, however, requires N 2 O 4 molecules as oxidants that form slowly by non-activated <b>homogeneous</b> NO 2 <b>dimerization</b> reactions, consistent with nitrate formation rates that increase with (NO 2) 2 and are independent of adsorbate coverage. Pt clusters present in close proximity to nitrite-saturated BaO domains provide a catalytic route for the formation of N 2 O 4 that reacts subsequently with nitrites. These elementary steps lead to nitrate formation rates on BaO/Pt/Al 2 O 3 that are inhibited by NO and are proportional to NO 2 pressure and the coverage of unreacted nitrites. The results herein identify the physical limitations of oxidation catalysts and NOx adsorbents that are used for NOx trapping and provide new opportunities for optimizing NOx storage materials by exploiting previously unrecognized synergies between the catalyst and adsorbent components...|$|R
