5|$|Sons of Soul was {{released}} by Wing Records and Mercury Records on June 22, 1993, to widespread critical acclaim. The record's commercial success included a 43-week chart run on the Billboard 200 and a double platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for sales {{of at least two}} million copies. With its success, Tony! Toni! Toné! {{became one of the most}} popular R acts during the genre's commercial resurgence in the early 1990s. However, after an ill-fated tour, the band went on hiatus and pursued <b>individual</b> <b>projects</b> before reuniting in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Architectural {{management}} can {{be defined}} as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term architectural management has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field of architectural management has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared {{to be concerned about the}} conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of architectural design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or practice management and project management. Office management provides an overall framework within which many <b>individual</b> <b>projects</b> are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the design process, construction, and project management, through to facilities management of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E
5|$|Destiny's Child {{went to a}} hiatus, {{following}} the release of their third studio album Survivor (2001), allowing {{each member of the}} group to release solo material. As each member had success with their <b>individual</b> <b>projects,</b> questions arose by the public whether they would record again as a group. However, group members Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams reunited again to work on their fourth studio album Destiny Fulfilled. The album was released in late 2004 and the group further embarked on a worldwide tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It the following year as part of its promotion. During a concert the group had at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Spain on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced to the audience that the tour would be Destiny's Child last together, revealing their formal disbandment. It was announced that after their final North American leg, the group would part ways, with each member continuing their music career as a solo act. During an interview, they explained that their disbandment was planned during the making of Destiny Fulfilled as they discussed their individual aspirations and realized that remaining as a group would prevent them in pursuing those interests. However, it was acknowledged that the album would not be their last album together.|$|E

5|$|MIGA's inaugural {{investment}} guarantees {{were issued}} in 1990 to cover $1.04billion ($1.83billion in 2012dollars) worth of foreign direct investment(FDI) comprising four <b>individual</b> <b>projects.</b> The agency also issued its first reinsurance contracts signed {{in collaboration with}} Export Development Canada and the United States' Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). That same year, MIGA held a conference in Ghana to promote investment. The agency joined the Berne Union, an international community of export credit and investment insurance providers in 1994. In 1997, MIGA issued the inaugural contract under its Cooperative Underwriting Program to support an energy project in Indonesia. In collaboration with the European Union Investment Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the agency set up a fund for investment guarantees amounting to $12million ($17million in 2012dollars). The agency also established the West Bank and Gaza Investment Guarantee Trust Fund with a capacity of $20million ($29million in 2012dollars). In 1998 the Council of Governors of MIGA adopted a resolution establishing a general capital increase of $850million ($1.2billion in 2012dollars), and transferring a grant of $150million ($212million in 2012dollars) from the IBRD. MIGA exceeded $1billion ($1.4billion in 2012 dollars) in investment guarantees within a single {{year for the first}} time in 1999. The agency also approved an Environmental Assessment and Disclosure Policy and began attempting to implement such standards for new projects.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings from}} research into student’s perception of the group versus the individual assignment in a second year marketing research unit. Students were given the choice {{as to whether they}} wanted to participate in a group or <b>individual</b> marketing research <b>project</b> approach. A total of 89 students participated in the study. Initially, 70 students chose the group project with the remaining 19 opting for the <b>individual</b> <b>project.</b> At the end of the semester, 41 students preferred the <b>individual</b> <b>project,</b> with 47 students preferring the group project, an increase of 147 % in students preferring the <b>individual</b> <b>project.</b> Results indicated the preference shift was due mainly to logistical problems with the group <b>project,</b> with the <b>individual</b> <b>project</b> offering an attractive alternative. The group project was described as having positive educational benefits, but the difficulties in working in a team outweighed these benefits. These difficulties seemed to be highlighted more {{by the nature of the}} marketing research project, in that members were required to work together more closely in preparing the questionnaire and collecting the data, than in previous group projects for other completed units. Results from this study suggest the need to be flexible in offering students a choice of learning option, either the group or <b>individual</b> <b>project,</b> carefully equating the workload and learning opportunities of each. This becomes more imperative as developing courses for the future requires academics to deliver courses across different campuses, through distant learning packages and offshore programs. Consequently, flexible learning options are necessary. In addition, student expectations need to be examined to match teaching methods to create a favourable learning environment...|$|R

25|$|Since 1995 the {{situation}} has improved. After the year 2000, annual ticket sales rose to 20 million and since 1995, the number of theatres has steadily increased to approximately 500 nationwide. Currently, Turkish films attract audiences of millions of viewers and routinely top the blockbuster lists, often surpassing foreign films at the box office. However, {{it is difficult to}} speak about the existence of an industry, since most films are rather <b>individual</b> <b>projects</b> of directors who otherwise earn their living in television, advertising or theatre.

Overall responsibility for the architectural planning and design of Moscow City belongs to the architectural studio No. 6, which {{is a part of the}} large Moscow practice Mosproject-2 named after Mikhail Vasilyevich Posokhin. This group, headed by Gennadiy Lvovich Sirota, who is officially the Chief Architect of Moscow City, is in charge of overseeing the design of the complex as a whole and agreeing the details of <b>individual</b> <b>projects.</b> Each building lot has its own investor and architect.
