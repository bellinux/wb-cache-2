25|$|At {{the loading}} area, guests board the troop transport. Through the radio, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) reminds the {{tourists}} to fasten their seat belts, {{and points out}} {{a problem with the}} transport. The transport takes off, past a cluster of mirrors concealing the maintenance dock entrance, and turns a corner into the Chamber of Destiny, where guests are presented with three doors. One of the three doors begins to glow more brightly than the other two, and Mara announces which gift the passengers have chosen to receive. The <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> the passengers enter the Hall of Promise.|$|E
25|$|Almost all stations, except {{most of the}} {{elevated}} sections and sections of Line 2 from Songhong Road to Longyang Road, have platform screen doors with sliding acrylic glass at the platform edge. The train stops with its doors lined-up with the sliding doors on the platform edge and open when the train <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> are closed at other times. These screens are also being retrofitted on existing lines, starting with Line 1 whose core stations had doors {{by the end of}} 2006. On part of Line 2 and most of {{the elevated}} sections, the platform has sliding safety doors that reach only halfway up from the ground called Automatic platform gates.|$|E
25|$|The player, {{who sits}} in an office, is {{given access to}} a network of {{security}} cameras throughout the facility to track {{the movement of the}} animatronics. Each character roams the restaurant and has distinct movement patterns, and most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The camera feeds are dimly lit and distorted, one of the rooms only contains an audio feed, and the cameras do not cover certain areas of the building, most notably the two hallways directly to the left and right of the player. The player cannot leave the guard room, but can close the doors to defend themselves, and briefly turn on lights in the hallways to check for animatronics. Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if the power runs out, the cameras become inoperable, the <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> the lights go out. Once these things happen, the Toreador March will play, the screen will go pitch black, and the player will be jumpscared by Freddy, provided they do not reach {{the end of the night}} in the meantime. If the player is jumpscared by any of the animatronics, the game ends, and the player must restart from the beginning of the night.|$|E
60|$|I call at {{the office}} of the Dublin {{organization}} in Westmoreland Street, and find the front <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> the office <b>door</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> though the office is empty the cupboard <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> eighteen pounds in gold upon the shelf.|$|R

500|$|The basic {{story was}} {{conceived}} by Sakaguchi and Matsumoto, while the script {{was written by}} Sakaguchi, Masaru Hatano and Takatoshi Aoki. The story was contributed to by multiple staff members, which sometimes annoyed Sakaguchi when they suggested {{something that would be}} out of character for one of the cast. According to Sakaguchi, the initial version featuring a science fiction storyline was [...] "shot down" [...] by Nintendo, forcing the team to begin all over again with a new setting and characters. Despite the story still using science fiction elements, the team worked to distance the setting from those elements by focusing on bright, natural colors for the environments. The biographies of the main cast were put together during the story's creation. Originally, according to Hatano, the game's theme was to have been the [...] "all-important drama that takes place {{between a man and a}} woman", but as development progressed it was changed to a theme of general companionship, although the original story remained the same. Hatano suggested incorporating dialogue into the gameplay rather than restricting it to cutscenes. This approach was inspired by both Uncharted and television series The West Wing. The concept was initially put forward as a joke about Zael's habit of kicking <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> how his companions would comment on how he always did this. After receiving positive feedback, they implemented it and kept in Zael's behavior. Sakaguchi used this in-game dialogue to help convey the characters' personalities: as part of this, adlibs from the actors were included, and continual adjustments were made to the script. The characters' artwork also prompted Sakaguchi to make changes so the characters better fitted their presentation. The game's voiced dialogue was estimated at 12,000 lines. The option for players to skip through dialogue was a feature that Sakaguchi did not like, but he knew that some players would not like necessary long cutscenes, so gave them the option of going through them while still following the story. This meant that all the cutscenes needed to be done using the in-game engine rather than pre-rendered graphics.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{visit to}} the rest of the Middle East in September 2007, Kucinich said he did not visit Iraq because [...] "I feel the United States is {{engaging}} in an illegal occupation." [...] Kucinich was criticized for his visit to Syria and praise of the President Bashar al-Assad on Syria's national TV. [...] He praised Syria for taking in Iraqi refugees. [...] "What most people are not aware of is that Syria has taken in more than 1.5 million Iraqi refugees," [...] Kucinich said. [...] "The Syrian government has actually shown a lot of compassion in keeping its <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> being a host for so many refugees." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> closed smartly and Mrs. Bunting was alone.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} the <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> the servant-woman came in.|$|R

2500|$|Within three minutes, the Greene Street {{stairway}} became unusable in both directions. Terrified employees crowded {{onto the}} single exterior fire escape, which city officials had allowed Asch to erect {{instead of the}} required third staircase. It was a flimsy and poorly anchored iron structure {{which may have been}} broken before the fire. It soon twisted and collapsed from the heat and overload, spilling about 20 victims nearly [...] to their deaths on the concrete pavement below. Elevator operators Joseph Zito and Gaspar Mortillalo saved many lives by traveling three times up to the ninth floor for passengers, but Mortillalo was eventually forced to give up when the rails of his elevator buckled under the heat. Some victims pried the elevator <b>doors</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> jumped into the empty shaft, trying to slide down the cables or to land on top of the car. The weight and impacts of these bodies warped the elevator car and made it impossible for Zito to make another attempt. William Gunn Shepard, a reporter at the tragedy, would say that [...] "I learned a new sound that day, a sound more horrible than description can picture -- the thud of a speeding living body on a stone sidewalk". Even once firefighters arrived, their ladders were only long enough to reach as high as the sixth to seventh floors.|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll like to {{hear your}} opinion of it," [...] Dan began; but his sister pulled the <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> ran out {{to see if he}} really meant that too.|$|E
6000|$|Rollo {{ran into}} the house with great haste and eagerness, leaving all the <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> calling out, [...] "Father, father," [...] {{as soon as he}} had begun to open the parlor door.|$|E
60|$|Then the <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> {{the head}} contractor's {{engineer}} came in.|$|R
60|$|There were footfalls outside, the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> Inspector Morton appeared.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> Annie entered. She {{looked at}} him questioningly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I only know," [...] said Elizabeth, half in self-defence, half in fright, [...] "that one of {{you must}} have been at the baby-house, for I found the <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> shut them up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{thrust the}} great <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> {{by the hand}} led me in. It was a sad company. Twenty-four, that lay on marble slabs, or sat, half erect and propped, while many young men, bright of eye, bright little knives in their hands, glanced curiously at me from their work." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was partly}} roused {{by the various}} sounds in the house, but not startled--the light nights of summer always diminished her alarms; and she heard the clocks strike, and the bell ring for prayers, the <b>doors</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> shut, all mixed in with her hazy fancies. At last came the silken rustlings up the stairs again, and the {{openings}} of bed-room doors close to her.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> in marched Mrs. Trebooze, tall, tawdry, and terrible.|$|R
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> {{the room}} became full of Bennetts and Mortimers.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{pushed the}} <b>door</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> stood {{just inside the}} room.|$|R
6000|$|... “At {{first it}} stunned me. When the shell burst in the boiler it threw both the furnace <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> the fuse {{from the shell}} struck my feet. It was a terrible crash, and the {{boiler-room}} was filled with dust and steam. For several seconds I was partially stunned, and my ears rang so I could hear nothing. I went up on the deck to report to Captain Bernadou.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is enough," [...] said Wallace, [...] "I have no doubt. So {{that one}} {{difficulty}} is disposed of. As {{to the second}} difficulty," [...] he continued, [...] "that is, troubling the family about making the cage, we can dispose of that very easily, too, for I can help you about that myself. What shall we do about the third, leaving the <b>doors</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> making a noise {{when you go back}} and forth to feed him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you must}} go to sleep. Don't cry nor think, nor do {{anything}} but rest. That will please Miss Mills best. I 'll leave the <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> play you a lullaby that you can't resist. Good night, dear." [...] And with another kiss, Polly went away {{to sit in the}} darkness of her own room, playing her softest airs till the tired eyes below were shut, and little Jane seemed to float away on a sea of pleasant sounds, into the happier life which had just dawned for her.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} Miss Lillycrop's <b>door</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> little Tottie issued forth.|$|R

60|$|At {{this moment}} the <b>door</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>and</b> Francois de Laville entered hurriedly.|$|R
60|$|The thought worked within me. I {{stood for}} a moment, trying to quiet my passion. As I turned away I heard the stable-yard <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> a carriage, laden with luggage, drove slowly out, and, without coming to the front at all, turned down the avenue. I ran out, heedless of my slippers, and called to it to stop. The man obeyed me, and I caught it up, breathless. The blinds were closely drawn, but I opened the door. As I expected, {{it was she who}} sat inside, closely veiled and weeping.|$|E
60|$|The {{design of}} the people was to force Master Graham to take refuge in his dwelling, and to defend it until the {{authorities}} could interfere, or they could gain time for parley. But either from ignorance or in the confusion of the moment they stopped at his old house, which was closely shut. Some time was lost in beating the <b>doors</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> passing him to the front. About a score of the boldest of the other party threw themselves into the torrent while this was being done, and reaching {{the door at the}} same moment with himself cut him off from his defenders.|$|E
60|$|It was {{but three}} days after this, that not at all made {{cautious}} by my former danger, as I used to be, and still pursuing the art which I had so long been employed in, I ventured into a house where I saw the <b>doors</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> furnished myself, as I though verily without being perceived, with two pieces of flowered silks, such as they call brocaded silk, very rich. It was not a mercer's shop, nor a warehouse of a mercer, but looked like a private dwelling-house, and was, it seems, inhabited by a man that sold goods for the weavers to the mercers, like a broker or factor.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} the <b>doors</b> <b>opened</b> <b>and</b> in swept the royal Userti.|$|R
