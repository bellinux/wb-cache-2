50|$|<b>Finger</b> <b>rafting</b> {{develops}} in an ice cover {{as a result}} of a compression regime established within the plane of the ice. As two expanses of sea ice converge toward another, one of them slides smoothly on top of the other (it is overthrusted) along a given distance, resulting in a local increase in ice thickness. The term <b>finger</b> <b>rafting</b> refers to the systematic alternation of interlocking overthrusts and underthrusts involved in this process. Such a pattern derives its name from its resemblance to the interlocking of fingers.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis is {{an investigation into the}} consolidation and strength of <b>rafted</b> sea <b>ice.</b> A model for the consolidation of <b>rafted</b> sea <b>ice</b> has been developed that predicts {{how long it will take}} for the layers in a rafted section of sea ice to bond effectively into a coherent <b>ice</b> sheet. The <b>rafted</b> <b>ice</b> is assumed to be composed of layers of sea ice of equal thickness, separated by thin layers of ocean water. Heat transport within the sea ice is described using the mushy layer equations and the rate of freezing is given by the Stefan condition. Concurrent laboratory experiments were conducted in the Rock and Ice Physics Laboratory at UCL. To simulate a section of <b>rafted</b> sea <b>ice,</b> layers of laboratory grown saline ice were stacked on top of one another with spacers between adjacent ice sheets allowing water from the tank below to flood in. The rate of consolidation was then monitored using a combination of temperature readings recorded in the ice and liquid layer, salinity measurements of the liquid layer, and cores taken using a manual core auger. Once consolidated, cores were taken and sheared using the four-point asymmetrical bending method to measure the strength of the bond between two-rafted ice sheets. These were then compared to the shear strength of level ice. Results showed that the <b>rafted</b> <b>ice</b> had consolidated in less than a day, however it took many more days (6 to 30 depending on the conditions) for the blocks to reach maximum strength. Increasing the thickness of the ice, the salinity of the solution and the gap size all increased the consolidation time.

50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>rafting</b> is the {{transport}} of various materials by ice. Various objects deposited on ice may eventually become embedded in the ice.

40|$|Rafting {{is one of}} the {{important}} deformation mechanisms of sea ice. This process is widespread in the north Caspian Sea, where multiple rafting produces thick sea ice features, which are a hazard to offshore operations. Here we present a one-dimensional, thermal consolidation model for <b>rafted</b> sea <b>ice.</b> We consider the consolidation between the layers of both a two-layer and a three-layer section of <b>rafted</b> sea <b>ice.</b> The <b>rafted</b> <b>ice</b> is assumed to be composed of layers of sea ice of equal thickness, separated by thin layers of ocean water. Results show that the thickness of the liquid layer reduced asymptotically with time, such that there always remained a thin saline liquid layer. We propose that when the liquid layer is equal to the surface roughness the adjacent layers can be considered consolidated. Using parameters representative of the north Caspian, the Arctic, and the Antarctic, our results show that for a choice of standard parameters it took under 15 h for two layers of <b>rafted</b> sea <b>ice</b> to consolidate. Sensitivity studies showed that the consolidation model is highly sensitive to the initial thickness of the liquid layer, the fraction of salt release during freezing, and the height of the surface asperities. We believe that further investigation of these parameters is needed before any concrete conclusions can be drawn about rate of consolidation of <b>rafted</b> sea <b>ice</b> features...|$|R

To simulate a section of <b>rafted</b> sea <b>ice,</b> blocks of laboratory grown saline ice were stacked in an insulated tank with spacers between adjacent blocks to allow saline water to flood in. The rate of consolidation was then monitored using a combination of temperature readings recorded in the ice and liquid layer, salinity measurements of the liquid layer, and cores taken at specific times of interest. Two states of consolidation were observed: thermodynamic consolidation where the ice blocks were physically bonded but the bond strength was weak, and mechanical consolidation where the bond had reached full strength. Results showed that the <b>rafted</b> <b>ice</b> had physically bonded in less than a day, however it took many more days (6 to 30 depending on the environmental conditions) for the bond to reach maximum strength.

Once consolidated, ice cores were taken and sheared using the asymmetric four-point bending method to measure the strength of the bond between the ice blocks.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{quantitative}} {{explanation of the}} patterns commonly observed during the collision of two floating ice sheets (ice floes) : simple raffing, <b>finger</b> <b>rafting,</b> or {{the formation of a}} pressure ridge. In particular, we analyze the equilibrium configurations of the ice in each of the two types of rafting and show that these are only possible if the ice thickness is below a threshold value that we determine in terms of the strength and elastic modulus of the ice. We construct a regime diagram to characterize the regions of thickness-strength parameter space for which each type of deformation can occur. Using typical values for the strength of sea ice, we find that <b>finger</b> <b>rafting</b> can only occur in ice with thickness ≲ 8 cm, and simple rafting can typically only occur in ice with thickness ≲ 21 cm. These estimates are quantitatively consistent with most field observations reported in the literature. Finally, by quantifying two common complications that occur in reality, we are also able to account for some of the discrepancies between theory and observation that remain. We show that the presence of rubble may allow ice with a thickness of up to 1 m to perform simple rafting, but multiple rafting of thin sheets does not increase the maximum rafting thickness.

50|$|Rafting, {{also called}} telescoped ice, is most {{noticeable}} when it involves new and young ice, but also occurs in ice of all thicknesses. The process of <b>finger</b> <b>rafting</b> as such is commonly observed inside a lead, once {{a thin layer}} of ice (at the nilas stage) has formed. Although this ice is typically very weak (it is unable to support its own weight outside the water), it contains a lot of brine and is also relatively warm, since being that thin, its temperature is near that of the water. Rafting is accompanied with rapid draining of the brine inside the overlying ice sheet. This brine acts as a lubricant, significantly reducing the friction between the two sheets during overthrusting. Such a mechanism, {{and the fact that the}} upper surface of nilas is already slippery, account for overthrust distances in excess of 100 m (a length-to-thickness ratio of 1000 to one).|$|R

The obtained results show good prediction power of the models. This means, on average 80 % for predicting the ship's speed within specified bins, and above 90 % for predicting cases where a ship may get stuck in ice.

50|$|Sea ice {{deformation}} {{results from}} the interaction between ice floes, as they are driven against each other. The end result may be of three types of features: 1) <b>Rafted</b> <b>ice,</b> when one piece is overriding another; 2) Pressure ridges, a line of broken ice forced downward (to make up the keel) and upward (to make the sail); and 3) Hummock, an hillock of broken ice that forms an uneven surface. A shear ridge is a pressure ridge that formed under shear - {{it tends to be}} more linear than a ridge induced only by compression. A new ridge is a recent feature — it is sharp-crested, with its side sloping at an angle exceeding 40 degrees. In contrast, a weathered ridge is one with a rounded crest and with sides sloping at less than 40 degrees. Stamukhi are yet another type of pile-up but these are grounded and are therefore relatively stationary. They result from the interaction between fast ice and the drifting pack ice.|$|R

We show that TV experienced a massive terminal <b>ice</b> <b>rafting</b> event in the North Atlantic that was more intense and longer lasting than Heinrich event 1 (H 1) of the last deglaciation. This massive <b>ice</b> <b>rafting</b> event was linked to cold stadial conditions and reduced deep water formation in the North Atlantic, in parallel with warming at high southern latitudes, similar to the bipolar seesaw pattern exhibited during H 1 over the last deglaciation. We propose that the particular intensity and duration of the TV <b>ice</b> <b>rafting</b> event resulted from the especially large volume of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets during MIS 12. In turn, the unusually long duration and large amplitude of TV likely resulted from the exceptionally prolonged collapse of the AMOC during the TV Heinrich stadia], and from a subsequent transient AMOC "overshoot" with respect to later MIS 11 interglacial circulation. Furthermore, we suggest that the intense Heinrich stadial of TV contributed to the deglaciation primarily via meridional heat transport anomalies that would have enhanced the incipient warming arising from relatively weak insolation forcing, and only secondarily via CO 2 releas...|$|R

40|$|Multi-proxy {{analyses}} of six sediment cores (including lithostratigraphy, physical properties, granulometric analyses, and XRF scanning), and {{analyses of}} swath bathymetry and chirp data were integrated to elucidate the Holocene sedimentary processes and palaeoenvironments in Smeerenburgfjorden, northwest Spitsbergen. Three basins separated by two sills define the present-day large-scale bathymetry. A transverse ridge in the innermost {{part of the}} fjord represents the Little Ice Age (LIA) maximum position of Smeerenburgbreen. Slide scars along the fjord sides and mass transport deposits in the basins indicate repeated mass wasting. Recessional moraines deposited during the last deglaciation suggest a mean annual retreat rate of 140 m/year. Another set of recessional moraines deposited between the maximum LIA position of Smeerenburgbreen and its present day terminus indicate a mean retreat rate of the ice front of ~ 87 m/year. Although {{only some of the}} recessional moraines deposited during the last deglaciation are expressed on the modern seafloor, chirp data reveal that they occur throughout the entire fjord. Suspension settling, <b>ice</b> <b>rafting</b> and mass wasting are the main sedimentary processes acting in Smeerenburgfjorden. Suspension settling is most important in the inner parts of the fjord, resulting in high sedimentation rates that rapidly decrease with increasing distance from the main sediment sources. Strong out-fjord decreasing trends in magnetic susceptibility and Fe-content indicate that these properties are related to material originating from the Hornemantoppen granite in the catchment of Smeerenburgbreen and are, thus, useful proxies for the reconstruction of the activity of the glacier. Relatively little <b>ice</b> <b>rafting,</b> most likely related to warmer surface water conditions, occurred between 8650 and 7350 cal. years BP. <b>Ice</b> <b>rafting</b> from both sea-ice and icebergs increased around 6200 cal. years BP and peaked at ~ 5200 cal. years BP, associated with a regional cooling. Smeerenburgbreen became more active around 2000 cal. years BP. It probably retreated during the Roman Warm Period (50 BC – AD 400) and advanced during the Dark Ages Cold Period (AD 400 – 800).

We find that maximum d 18 O in N. pachyderma occurred about 15 ka and preceded the maximum abundance of this species in these cores by ab. 1000 years. Between 13 and 14 ka we find a second peak in abundance of N. pachyderma, minimum d 18 O, and two pulses of <b>ice</b> <b>rafting.</b> The sediment lithology supports terrestrial studies which indicate that there was a general withdrawal of ice beyond the upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic red beds by 14 ka in southeastern Canada, so the <b>ice</b> <b>rafting</b> events between 13 and 14 ka probably reflect ice stream activity in the St. Lawrence valley. The Younger Dryas event is recognized as a peak in abundance of N. pachyderma and <b>ice</b> <b>rafting</b> (dated as ab. 11. 3 ka), but meltwater discharge to the Gulf of St. Lawrence was either too small or occurred over too long a time to leave a distinct d 18 O minimum off Nova Scotia.

50|$|Sea ice {{is often}} {{classified}} {{according to whether}} or not it is attached (or frozen) to the shoreline. If attached, it is called land fast ice. Otherwise, it is called drift ice and is free to move with currents and winds. This is why leads typically belong to the drift ice zone. They are seen as a stress relieving mechanism, in response to divergent current flows or the effects of wind. Leads are cracks or fissures that initiate inside an otherwise continuous sea ice cover, and open up progressively afterward. They are linear features, though generally not rigorously straight, as they may comprise any number of short offsets at an angle with the general trend of the initial crack. This crack may cut right across both thin and thick ice. Because leads are associated with the initial break up of an ice cover, they open the way to various dynamic processes that can take place afterward, involving the interaction between individual floes, such as the formation of pressure ridges. Depending on the state of stress within the drift zone, leads may also close up.

Common passive microwave (PM) snow water equivalent (SWE) algorithms that utilize the differences in brightness temperature (Tb) at 37 GHz – 19 GHz falter in lake-rich tundra environments because of the inclusion of lakes within PM pixels. The overarching goal {{of this research was}} to investigate the use of multiple platforms and methodologies to observe and quantify the effects of lake ice and sub-ice water on passive microwave emission for the purpose of improving snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval algorithms. Using in situ snow and ice measurements as input, the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) multi-layer snow emission model was modified to include an ice layer below the snow layer. Emission for 6. 9, 19, 37 and 89 GHz were simulated at horizontal and vertical polarizations, and were validated by high resolution airborne passive microwave measurements coincident with in situ sampling sites over two lakes near Inuvik, Northwest Territories (NWT). Overall, the general magnitude of brightness temperatures were estimated by the HUT model for 6. 9 and 19 GHz H/V, however the variability was not. Simulations produced at 37 GHz exhibited the best agreement relative to observed temperatures. However, emission at 37 GHz does not interact with the radiometrically cold water, indicating that ice properties controlling microwave emission are not fully captured by the HUT model. Alternatively, active microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements can be used to identify ice properties that affect passive microwave emission. Dual polarized X-band SAR backscatter was utilized to identify ice types by the segmentation program MAGIC (MAp Guided Ice Classification). Airborne passive microwave transects were grouped by ice type classes and compared to backscatter measurements. In freshwater, where there were few areas of high bubble concentration at the ice/water interface Tbs exhibited positive correlations with cross-polarized backscatter, corresponding to ice types (from low to high emission/backscatter: clear ice, transition zone between clear and grey ice, grey <b>ice</b> and <b>rafted</b> <b>ice).</b> SWE algorithms were applied to emission within each ice type producing negative or near zero values in areas of low 19 GHz Tbs (clear ice, transition zone), but also produced positive values that were closer to the range of in situ measurements in areas of high 19 GHz Tbs (grey and <b>rafted</b> <b>ice).</b> Therefore, cross-polarized X-band SAR measurements {{can be used as a}} priori ice type information for spaceborne PM algorithms, providing information on ice types and ice characteristics (floating, frozen to bed), integral to future tundra-specific SWE retrieval algorithms...|$|R
