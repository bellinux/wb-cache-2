500|$|Three {{months into}} his loan spell, in early October, Rehman {{said of his}} move to play for Blackpool: [...] "I'm quite glad {{to get away from}} all the hustle and bustle of London. I really like <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>here</b> in Blackpool; it's a good club with an ambitious young manager. Hopefully, {{over the next few months}} I can {{convince}} Simon Grayson I'm worthy of a long-term contract." [...] On 31 December he returned to QPR after having made three league appearances, all of which were as a substitute.|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics have}} commended the {{development}} of Cheryl, as well as Greer's portrayal of the character. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall declared that Cheryl was his favorite character on the show. In his review for [...] "El Secuestro", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club felt that Greer's vocals were {{the highlight of the}} episode, and affirmed that she effectively portrayed the unstable characteristics of Cheryl. [...] "Greer is mostly just asked to say crazy things as Cheryl, and that’s fun, but she steps <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> playing both Cheryl’s insanity and the part of her that’s a spoiled trust-fund kid who’s found a day job and has to ride the subway with a dwarf that freaks her out." [...] Likewise, Ian MacDonald of TV Overmind proclaimed that the writers [...] "found a great way to expand on ISIS' most emotionally unstable employees"; [...] "Cheryl, whose crazy has been escalated to an almost extreme," [...] MacDonald stated, [...] "seems almost justified in her maladjusted-ness. She's a billionaire heiress who owns an ocelot and drinks glue [...] Humor involving insane rich people just no getting it is usually pretty funny, and if anyone can pull it off, it's Adam Reed and [...] Greer." [...] Alongside fellow cast members Jessica Walter and H. Jon Benjamin, Greer was a candidate for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in a Television Production—the award was given to Jeff Bennett for his work in the Nickelodeon television series The Penguins of Madagascar.|$|E
