5|$|The data {{obtained}} by a Heartbleed attack may include unencrypted exchanges between TLS parties likely to be confidential, including any form post data in users' requests. Moreover, the confidential data exposed could include authentication secrets such as session cookies and passwords, which might allow attackers to <b>impersonate</b> a user of the service.|$|E
5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen Sarah Jane being captured by an alien, who uses her DNA to <b>impersonate</b> her, and frame her for stealing an important piece of alien merchandise. Sarah would have used her gadgets to fight her clone. This story however, was very similar to Sarah Jane in Prison, so it was scrapped.|$|E
5000|$|Cardinal Richelieu (Palin) is <b>impersonated</b> {{by someone}} or is <b>impersonating</b> someone else.

50|$|Yakky Doodle (voiced by Jimmy Weldon in {{the style}} of Donald Duck) is a duck who lives with his best friend Chopper the Bulldog (voiced by Vance Colvig <b>impersonating</b> Wallace Beery). Chopper would usually protect Yakky from being eaten by Fibber Fox (voiced by Daws Butler <b>impersonating</b> Shelley Berman) or Alfy Gator (voiced by Daws Butler <b>impersonating</b> Alfred Hitchcock).|$|R
5|$|An {{attacker}} having gained authentication material may <b>impersonate</b> the material's owner {{after the}} victim has patched Heartbleed, {{as long as}} the material is accepted (for example, until the password is changed or the private key revoked). Heartbleed therefore constitutes a critical threat to confidentiality. However, an attacker impersonating a victim may also alter data. Indirectly, Heartbleed's consequences may thus go far beyond a confidentiality breach for many systems.|$|E
5|$|Don is a 2006 Indian action-thriller film {{directed}} by Farhan Akhtar. The film {{was produced by}} Ritesh Sidhwani and Akhtar's production company Excel Entertainment. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra, with Arjun Rampal, Boman Irani, Isha Koppikar, and Om Puri appearing in supporting roles.

5|$|The {{player is}} {{required}} to build an environment that will attract patients with comical diseases and then treat them while tending to their needs. The game has a somewhat dark sense of humour, {{similar to that of}} its predecessor, Theme Park. Diseases include Bloaty Head (which swells the patient's head), King Complex (which forces the patient to <b>impersonate</b> Elvis Presley), and Alien DNA (which transforms the patient into an alien).|$|E

5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "The Last Recruit," [...] the Man in Black reveals to Jack {{that he had}} been <b>impersonating</b> as his father in a similar way to how he now <b>impersonates</b> Locke and how he <b>impersonated</b> Mr. Eko's brother, Yemi, {{revealing}} that at least some, if not all of Christian's appearances on the island post-death were the Man in Black.|$|R

5|$|Another {{cause of}} revulsion against Webster was her attempt to <b>impersonate</b> Thomas. She {{had managed to}} perpetrate the {{impersonation}} for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted {{to little more than}} cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, whether or not they had been earned. John Church, the publican whom Webster had attempted to implicate, was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{eleventh}} {{entry in the}} Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series and the successor to , a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative. However, Patriots was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, and the team decided to reboot the franchise. The team evaluated {{the core of the}} Rainbow Six franchise and believed that letting players <b>impersonate</b> the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual counter-terrorism units, and looked at real-life examples of sieges. Powered by AnvilNext 2.0, the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to create destructible environments.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholarly}} reception {{has considered}} The Shortest Way in negative terms, as a failed satire, or as using irony so slight {{as to be}} undetectable. Such a conclusion cites the contemporary reaction to the work, how it failed to deliver its objectives and also caused its author such problems. If critics have offered praise, it {{is the extent to}} which Defoe managed to <b>impersonate</b> the style of his subjects, so as to be indistinguishable from them. The Shortest Way is frequently contrasted with another work of irony in the eighteenth century, which is considered to have succeeded in its use of the device, Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal (1729).|$|E

5|$|The Romulans had {{attempted}} to travel {{back in time and}} destroy the Federation, but they instead created a Federation dominated by Vulcans. They shielded a ship from the changes and compare the differences, realising that it needs to be reversed. Meanwhile, Captain Spock begins to act protectively of Ensign Kirk, but the Captain is injured on an away mission. After Doctor McCoy conducts a series of mental scans, the crew of the ShiKahr realise that history has been altered. The Romulans plot to use Kirk to force Spock to <b>impersonate</b> their leader. Spock mindmelds with Kirk, each realising their personas from the main timeline.|$|E
5|$|The product {{received}} generally positive reviews praising its user interface, low {{resource usage}} and freeware license. It secured AV-TEST certification on October 2009, having demonstrated {{its ability to}} eliminate all widely encountered malware. However, it lost the certificate on October 2012, having shown a constant decline in protection and repair scores. In June 2013, MSE achieved the lowest possible protection score, zero. According to a March 2012 report by anti-malware specialist OPSWAT, MSE {{was the most popular}} AV product in North America and the second most popular in the world, which has resulted in the appearance of several rogue antivirus programs that try to <b>impersonate</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Verified status {{does not}} imply that Twitter {{continuously}} checks whether such accounts have been hacked. The account of Tesla Motors, for example, was impersonated briefly in 2015. Some users have tried to <b>impersonate</b> verified accounts without hacking them by placing the checkmark in their background images. Twitter referred to this as a breach of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult. In July 2016, Twitter began allowing anyone to apply for a verified account. The company announced that they will disable the verification progress in response to an outlash after white nationalist Jason Kessler got verified on Twitter.|$|E
5000|$|One evening {{during the}} 1950s at the legendary 500 Club in Atlantic City (where Georgeâ€™s brother Rudy worked) DeWitt entertained with the Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr.). While Davis was on stage {{doing a great}} job <b>impersonating</b> Jack Benny, DeWitt walked out from the wings, and ad-libbed an {{outstanding}} impersonation of Jack Benny's radio-TV valet Eddie [...] "Rochester" [...] Anderson. This might have been the first time that an African-American entertainer <b>impersonated</b> a white character, while a white entertainer <b>impersonated</b> an African-American character.|$|R

5|$|Peking opera was {{initially}} an exclusively male pursuit. The Qianlong Emperor had banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772. The appearance {{of women on}} the stage began unofficially during the 1870s. Female performers began to <b>impersonate</b> male roles and declared equality with men. They were given a venue for their talents when Li Maoer, himself a former Peking-opera performer, founded the first female Peking-opera troupe in Shanghai. By 1894, the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai. This encouraged other female troupes to form, which gradually increased in popularity. As a result, theatre artist Yu Zhenting petitioned for {{the lifting of the}} ban after the founding of the Republic of China in 1911. This was accepted, and the ban was lifted in 1912, although male Dan continued to be popular after this period.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF used Vengeance {{aircraft}} for {{a variety}} of tasks following their withdrawal from combat roles. The type was operated by Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 Communication Units, which were responsible for light transport and training tasks. No. 1 Air Performance Unit employed Vengeances as target tugs and for trials purposes. No. 7 Operational Training Unit, which was responsible for converting aircrew to Liberator bombers, was issued with Vengeance target tugs. Vengeances were also used in trials of poison gas conducted by the 1st Australian Field Experimental Station, Royal Australian Engineers, near Proserpine, Queensland, during 1944. In May 1944, Vengeances from No. 21 Squadron were used to <b>impersonate</b> German Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers during the production of the movie The Rats of Tobruk. For this task the aircraft were painted with Luftwaffe markings.|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} the masque within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the masque genre deals with the social {{acceptability}} of altering identities within the format. However, Fielding extends the image to discuss society and those who <b>impersonate</b> social and gender roles {{that they do not}} fill. Fielding also has a problem with those who act viciously with license even though he is willing to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts to use that to justify their beliefs over what is proper is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.|$|E
25|$|Loren Dean {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} <b>impersonated</b> by suspected con artist Loren Dean Breckenridge III. The Sheriff's Department in Orange County, California, has accused Breckenridge of <b>impersonating</b> Dean and defrauding drug rehabilitation centers across the United States, {{as well as}} committing the theft of $75,000 in Marin County, California.|$|R
50|$|Pokwang {{has also}} <b>impersonated</b> other people for {{as part of}} her job as a comedian.

5|$|When he returns, Moody {{takes him}} to his office, and reveals himself to be Voldemort's 'faithful servant'; {{he was the one}} who put Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire, and has been guiding him through the tournament from behind the scenes to ensure that he would grab the Portkey first. Before Moody can kill Harry, Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape intervene. They learn that Moody is in fact Barty Crouch Jr., Mr. Crouch's son, {{disguised}} by Polyjuice Potion. Crouch had sentenced Crouch Jr. to life imprisonment in Azkaban over alleged ties to the Death Eaters but smuggled him out as a last favour to his dying wife. Crouch Jr. was the one who set off the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup, doing it to scare the Death Eaters he felt had abandoned Voldemort. Eventually, Voldemort had gotten in contact with Crouch Jr. and had him <b>impersonate</b> Moody as part of his plan. Crouch Jr. also admits to killing Crouch Sr., to prevent him telling Dumbledore about Voldemort. The real Moody is found inside Crouch Jr.'s enchanted trunk and rescued. Harry is then declared the winner of the Triwizard Tournament and given his winnings.|$|E
