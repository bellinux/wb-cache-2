'Monsieur, {{there is}} surely some mistake,' said a clear voice in good French {{from the path}} on the other side, and looking across, the sisters were cheered by an unmistakable <b>English</b> <b>brown</b> hat. The peasants drew back a little, believing that the young ladies were not so {{unprotected}} as they had supposed, and the first speaker, with something like apology, declared that this was really the path, and descending where the sides were least steep, {{held out his hand}} to help Bertha. The lady, whose bank was more practicable, came down to meet them, saying in French, with much emphasis, that she would summon 'those gentlemen' to their assistance if desired; words that had considerable effect upon the enemy.|$|E
60|$|She {{approached}} the edge, {{looked into the}} water, and turned away shaking her head. Somerset could {{for the first time}} see her face. Though humanly imperfect, as is every face we see, it was one which made him think that the best in woman-kind no less than the best in psalm-tunes had gone over to the Dissenters. He had certainly seen nobody so interesting in his tour hitherto; she was about twenty or twenty-one--perhaps twenty-three, for years have a way of stealing marches even upon beauty's anointed. The total dissimilarity between the expression of her lineaments and that of the countenances around her was not a little surprising, and was productive of hypotheses without measure as to how she came there. She was, in fact, emphatically a modern type of maidenhood, and she looked ultra-modern by reason of her environment: a presumably sophisticated being among the simple ones--not wickedly so, but one who knew life fairly well for her age. Her hair, of good <b>English</b> <b>brown,</b> neither light nor dark, was abundant--too abundant for convenience in tying, as it seemed; and it threw off the lamp-light in a hazy lustre. And though it could not be said of her features that this or that was flawless, the nameless charm of them altogether was only another instance of how beautiful a woman can be as a whole without attaining in any one detail to the lines marked out as absolutely correct. The spirit and the life were there: and material shapes could be disregarded.|$|E

50|$|Brown ales {{tend to be}} lightly hopped, {{and fairly}} mildly flavoured, often with a nutty taste. In the south of England they are dark brown, around 3-3.5% alcohol and quite sweet; in the north they are red-brown, 4.5-5% and drier. <b>English</b> <b>brown</b> ales first {{appeared}} in the early 1900s, with Manns Brown Ale and Newcastle Brown Ale as the best-known examples.

This became the standard French translation for the next two centuries. De Condorcet's eight letters on sympathy were however ignored by historians of economic thought, and were just recently translated into <b>English</b> (<b>Brown,</b> 2008). In 1799, de Condorcet also arranged to publish her husband's Éloges des Academiciens, and was finally able to revive her salon at the former home of another salon hostess Madame Helvétius at Auteuil (Guillois 1897, pp. 94, 177).|$|E
50|$|Martin Pierce has {{borrowed}} {{much from}} the technique of japanning and the style of Chinoiserie but he brought them into a modern context, substituting easier mediums for the traditional varnish, size and gum Arabic. Since Martin Pierce creates his designs over a beautiful background of walnut or <b>English</b> <b>brown</b> oak wood, he does not blacken or hide the wood. Martin likes the raised textural nature of japanning, but he substitutes casein, which is a white paste made from milk by-products for its 17th-century cousin. Casein is easily applied either as a thick coat with a hand trowel or, for delicate thin leaf stems, with a fine brush. Casein {{has the advantage of}} drying quickly and affords a soft enough surface that can be sanded smooth with 220-grit sandpaper. Martin applies successive coats of casein until the design is sufficiently raised and then seals it with a water-based lacquer.|$|E
5000|$|Brown's Elementa Medicinae was {{published}} in 1780 and followed several years later by Brown's own version in <b>English.</b> <b>Brown</b> did not live to see his work achieve any great acceptance, but in 1795, Dr. Thomas Beddoes, {{one of the leading}} phsyicians of his day, undertook a translation (claiming Brown's was deficient), accompanied by an extensive introduction to explain Brown's system. Beddoes was also a close friend of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and did much to introduce him to Brown's ideas {{as well as to the}} various German writings on the Brunonian system, which appeared suddenly after 1795 as well, mainly through the writings of Dr. Andreas Röschlaub. One source states that Beddoes influence was [...] "the most likely source" [...] of Coleridge's plan to go to Germany, and that Coleridge's philosophical interests there were often [...] "anchored in medical debates." [...] (Coleridge, Thomas Beddoes and Brunonian Medicine), Coleridge several times refers to Brown as a genius.|$|E
