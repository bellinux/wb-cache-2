50|$|Starting from 1620s, {{numerous}} Walloon {{miners and}} iron-workers, with their families, settled in Sweden {{to work in}} iron mining and refining. Walloon methods of iron production were incorporated into Swedish practice, to supplement the existing German techniques. Many Walloon workers settled around the mine <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora</b> producing Öregrund iron which represented 15 per cent of Sweden's iron production at that time.|$|R
5000|$|Judge James Wallace {{sentenced him to}} 139-years-to-life {{in prison}} (99 years-to-life for the slaying of Byrnes, 20 years-to-life for the slaying of Mary Gedeon, and 20 years-to-life for the slaying of Veronica Gedeon).

50|$|In 1842, the New York State {{government}} solicited Cook {{to build}} a new type of prison that utilized prisoners for labor. Cook recommended that a new prison be located <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora,</b> Clinton County, New York near an iron mine (known as the Clinton Correctional Facility). Cook supervised the entire construction, and created prisoner rules which were considered highly humane and liberal, as opposed to the harsh conditions found in most other prisons.|$|R
50|$|Around 1700 {{there were}} about sixty workers <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora</b> {{residents}} of the slum-like neighbourhoods around the mine. The number of workers who obtained their support from the mine {{is likely to be}} several hundred. In each mine large quantities of wood would used in mining, a method not abandoned until the 1730s. The reason for this was partly out of fear that gunpowder would be more expensive than wood, but also for danger's sake.|$|R
50|$|Kirby {{was born}} on October 20, 1889 in Beekmantown, New York to dairy farmer Edward A. Kirby and his wife Bridget G. (Loughan) Kirby. He entered state service in October, 1909 as a $22-per-month {{hospital}} attendant <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora</b> State Hospital, and in 1911 was appointed Prison Guard at Great Meadow Correctional Facility in Comstock, New York. He remained there until 1917, when he left State Corrections to operate the family farm due to his father's illness.|$|R

They go meekly and even cheerfully to their death, without rebellion or even objection. It is most exceptional that they make a fight for their lives, as that woman did {{a few years ago}} <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora,</b> and disgusted all refined people with capital punishment." ...|$|R
50|$|Joachim Piper renewed {{the mining}} {{privileges}} <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora</b> in 1532 and devoted substantial {{resources to the}} mine, mainly producing iron but also other minerals. the ownership structure changed in 1545, and a dozen wealthy individuals entered as the owners, so {{that a number of}} Germans and even the king Gustav Vasa took part. The Germans were most interested in the export of pig iron but the King persuaded them to start production of wrought iron. It lasted only a few years and following a related bankruptcy, the king took over the operation fully.|$|R
50|$|Garrett served {{three months}} <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora</b> for assault. Then he served {{two years in}} Ryker's Island for larceny. Garrett {{had a history of}} {{resisting}} arrest. After assaulting a police officer in Kentucky, Garrett was sentenced to six months in a prison farm. After his times in each prison, Garrett was recruited to work for S.H.I.E.L.D. where his criminal records mysteriously vanished. He served in Libya with agent Chasity McBride. When Chasity discovered that there were no records of Garrett, she brought this up with ExTechOp where she was swiftly transferred to a minor police action in Venezuela and her complaint to Nick Fury wasn't received by him.|$|R
5000|$|Triewald's mercantile {{activities}} {{took him}} to London where he attended lectures in Newtonian Experimental Philosophy given by John Theophilus Desaguliers and with whom he later corresponded. In 1716 Triewald was employed as an inspector at a coal mine in Newcastle, where he studied mechanics and the steam engines used there, and made improvements to them. He returned to Sweden in 1726 and <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora</b> mine and built a steam engine there under the designation [...] "fire and air machine" [...] (eld- och luftmachin in archaic Swedish). This steam engine {{is believed to be}} the first steam engine in Sweden that was put to practical and industrial use.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Dannemora</b> mine <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora,</b> Sweden {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} iron ore mines in Sweden. The mine was closed by its owners SSAB in 1992. It may have been open since the 13th century, but the first documentary reference was in 1481. The mine supplied all the ironworks making oregrounds iron by the Walloon process (using a blast furnace and finery forge), such as Österby and Leufsta (now Lövsta). Their products were particularly pure iron, due the manganese content of the iron ore. This made it the best material for conversion to blister steel, the main variety of steel made in Great Britain between the 1610s and the 1850s. The mine has a depth of 640 metres.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in Hamlin, New York, the son of Irish {{immigrants}} Thomas Elliott and Martha Jane Elliott (nee Rowley). As a child he was a devout Methodist, {{and at one point}} his parents wanted him to be a minister. As a young boy Elliott recounts that he read of the first use of the electric chair and wondered what it might be like to throw the switch at an execution. He became employed in the prison service as a regular electrician, ultimately in charge of the power-house <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora</b> Prison in upstate New York. In that capacity he remotely assisted Edwin Davis <b>at</b> electrocutions <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora</b> State Prison. Initially his involvement was to change the armatures on the generator in the power house, so that it would temporarily produce enough power to send over high-tension wires to the electric chair elsewhere in the prison complex. In his Memoirs - [...] "Agent of Death" [...] (see below) he recounted that when Davis visited Dannemora to conduct executions, that he would be invited to dinner at Elliott's nearby house. This on-the-job training and personal rapport with Davis ultimately stood him in good stead in 1926 when he applied for and accepted the post of [...] "State electrician", which had just fallen vacant by John Hulbert. On January 28, 1926 he officiated at his first execution, the double electrocution of Emil Klatt and Luigi Rapito. Although not wearing a mask or a hood, he tried to conceal his identity at first, not revealing his name. For each execution he was paid the same fee of $150.|$|R
50|$|Although {{its first}} use was in coal-mining areas, Newcomen's engine {{was also used}} for pumping {{water out of the}} metal mines in his native West Country, such as the tin mines of Cornwall. By the time of his death, Newcomen and others had {{installed}} over a hundred of his engines, not only in the West Country and the Midlands but also in north Wales, near Newcastle and in Cumbria. Small numbers were built in other European countries, including in France, Belgium, Spain, and Hungary, also <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora,</b> Sweden. Evidence of the use of a Newcomen Steam Engine associated with early coal mines was found in 2010 in Midlothian, VA (site of some of the first coal mines in the US).(Dutton and Associates survey dated 24 November 2009).|$|R
40|$|Sandvik Rock Tools is {{operating}} in a highly competitive market. This requires them to constantly improve the efficiency of their organization, {{in order for them}} to maintain their position as market leaders, both in a short-term and a long-term perspective. Sandvik Rock Tools is currently working on developing and further improving their supply chain. The supply chain is a key organizational function and improvements of the supply chain aim to yield benefits like lowered total costs and better utilized inventory levels. The purpose of our work has been to develop the supply chain between Sandvik’s in-market warehouse and their customer site <b>at</b> <b>Dannemora.</b> The main focus of this thesis has been to enable automatic data collection and to lower the stock levels at the customer site in Dannemora. This would be accomplished by improving the information flow between the two entities in the observed supply chain and by enabling real-time inventory information, easily accessible to the warehouse manager. A barcode system was implemented in the warehouse <b>at</b> the <b>Dannemora</b> customer site and was integrated with warehouse management software that was developed by the authors. The implemented barcode system and the warehouse management software were used <b>at</b> the <b>Dannemora</b> customer site for a period of two months.  The effects of the implemented barcode system working in combination with the warehouse management software were observed in several operational areas after implementation, and the results were positive and beneficial. Firstly, the barcode system and warehouse management software simplified the warehouse manager’s decision process, by providing easy access to necessary warehouse management information, like realtime inventory information. Secondly, it made the day-to-day work routine of the warehouse manager easier, this being the case because the barcode system that had been implemented had digitalized and automated many tasks that had previously been performed manually by warehouse manager. An excellent example would be the simplified process for order placement and stocktaking. Thirdly, it improved the information flow between the Dannemora customer site and Sandvik’s in-market warehouse in Sandviken, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of the entire supply chain, through shared information. The barcode implementation successfully lowered inventory levels by six percent on average...|$|R
