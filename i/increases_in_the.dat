5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply of money, regardless of the source, cause <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) and the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), the velvet belly {{is one of}} the most abundant deep-sea sharks in the northeastern Atlantic. It is found individually or in small shoals. Samplings in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages; this imbalance <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> older age classes. In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups. However, this pattern has not been observed at other sites in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|As the proton {{concentration}} <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intermembrane space, {{a strong}} electrochemical gradient is established across the inner membrane. The protons {{can return to}} the matrix through the ATP synthase complex, and their potential energy is used to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This process is called chemiosmosis, and was first described by Peter Mitchell who was awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work. Later, part of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Paul D. Boyer and John E. Walker for their clarification of the working mechanism of ATP synthase.|$|E

30|$|We {{supposed}} that an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall thickness {{leads to an}} <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall stiffness and, consequently, to an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> its elastance. When the heart rate increases, the ejection duration decreases more slowly than {{the duration of the}} filling phase. Consequently <b>the</b> volume <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atrium <b>increases,</b> leading to an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> veinous pressure: such a phenomenon can be viewed, in our model where atria are neglected, as an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ventricular elastance. <b>In</b> a similar way, an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end-systolic ventricular volume induces a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ventricular filling (more filled the ventricle is, more difficult to continue the filling is) and, consequently, induces an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood volume <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atrium: this effect is described as an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elastance proportional to the volume which, as previously explained, should depend on the heart rate. To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between the ventricular volume and the veinous pressure was not studied and remains to validate. Such a dependency was important to be able to reproduce the proposed mechanism.|$|R
