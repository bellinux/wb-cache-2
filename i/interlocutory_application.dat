Court of Appeal claimed {{it did not}} have time to hear and consider legal arguments on the record $196,000 costs awarded in an <b>interlocutory</b> <b>application,</b> falling back on the assumption that judicial discretion in this regard must be accepted.|$|E

5000|$|Shortly after Smuts's resignation, the Helen Suzman Foundation {{took the}} JSC to court over its {{allegedly}} [...] "irrational" [...] refusal to appoint certain candidates. An earlier {{decision of the}} JSC taken in April 2011 had already been declared unlawful on this basis by the Supreme Court of Appeal.

The CBI concluded that Pandey had submitted false information before the court, recommended closing the case and declared that it will frame charges against Pandey. In June 2017, Pandey filed an <b>interlocutory</b> <b>application</b> against the CBI. He argued that had not followed proper procedures while collecting the evidence: it had seized only the hard disk drive, ut not other digital equipments. He also allged that CBI had not investigated the people whose names had surfaced {{in connection with the}} scam.|$|E

2500|$|In four provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario), the superior-level courts employ {{judicial}} officers {{known as}} Masters who deal only with interlocutory motions (or <b>interlocutory</b> <b>applications)</b> in civil cases.

50|$|This is, {{for various}} reasons, an {{important}} tool. It {{is recommended that}} the request be drafted {{as long as possible}} before the trial, as failure to comply may result in various <b>interlocutory</b> <b>applications,</b> which may take time. Every effort must be taken to ensure that all these procedures are completed well before the trial date, as a postponement of the trial could have disastrous consequences for both parties.|$|R
40|$|Extract] The {{court orders}} made under s 1323 are {{dissimilar}} to orders {{made in the}} context of an <b>interlocutory</b> <b>application</b> for an injunction in that, {{in the context of}} s 1323, there is no final hearing. The preservation orders under s 1323 may be the only orders that the court gets to make. Given that ASIC applies for the preservation orders under s 1323 to protect the interests of aggrieved persons, if subsequent consequential action is taken, it may be taken by completely different parties, such as the aggrieved persons. The court orders made under s 1323 are similar to the orders made {{in the context of an}} <b>interlocutory</b> <b>application</b> for an injunction in that both of those orders are preservative in nature. In both cases the court does not determine rights and titles, but makes orders that are necessary to preserve the status quo (see ASIC v Krecichwost [2008) NSWSC 855 at [14) - [151) ...|$|E

50|$|Generally counsel {{dress in}} the {{traditional}} English manner (wig, gown, and jabot) before superior courts, although this is not usually done for <b>interlocutory</b> <b>applications.</b> Wigs are no longer worn in the highest civil court in New South Wales, the Court of Appeal. Wigs are still worn in the Supreme Court, while only robes without wigs are worn in the District Courts in civil matters. Robes and wigs are worn in all criminal cases. In Western Australia, wigs are no longer worn in any court.|$|R
5000|$|Masters are {{appointed}} by the provincial cabinet, on recommendation of the Attorney General {{in consultation with the}} Chief Justice. As provincial appointees, masters do not have inherent jurisdiction. Their jurisdiction is limited to those matters granted to them by statute and the Rules of Court. Masters preside in chambers, where they usually hear <b>interlocutory</b> <b>applications</b> and other pre-trial matters. Masters cannot hear civil trials and do not preside in criminal matters. In court, Masters were formerly addressed as [...] "Master," [...] but in a practice direction issued on September 6, 1991, then Chief Justice Esson advised the most appropriate form of address would be [...] "your Honour". Masters also sit and hear matters as registrars, hearing such matters as assessments of solicitors fees and accounts.|$|R
40|$|The {{amendments}} to the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) and subsequent case law developments have created a patchwork of rules governing the disclosure obligations of parties in criminal cases. This article argues that parties have thereby been endowed with a right that is exercisable in the courts to access the material to which the law says they are entitled. However, there are currently no proper procedural mechanisms in place for parties to make <b>interlocutory</b> <b>applications</b> to obtain such material. This article examines the competing values and ideals of a criminal discovery regime, and suggests that concepts such as further and better particulars and specific discovery can be adapted from the {{rules of civil procedure}} to create an overarching framework that can regulate applications to the court for access to materials prior to trial...|$|R
5000|$|Another notable case is In re Will of Gilbert (decd). This was {{an early}} {{case in which the}} Supreme Court said it would not {{unnecessarily}} interfere with interlocutory orders on an appeal. Jordan said [...] "... I am of opinion that...there is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a point of practice or procedure and an exercise of discretion which determines substantive rights. In the former class of case, if a tight rein were not kept upon interference with the orders of judges of first instance, the result would be disastrous to the proper administration of justice. The disposal of cases could be delayed interminably, and costs heaped up indefinitely, if a litigant with a long purse or a litigious disposition could, at will, in effect transfer all exercises of discretion in <b>interlocutory</b> <b>applications</b> from a judge in Chambers to a Court of Appeal." ...|$|R
50|$|A full {{division}} of the court consists of five justices; however, most cases are heard by a {{division of}} three justices. A single justice will preside over matters heard in ”chambers”, usually <b>Interlocutory</b> matters or <b>applications</b> for leave to appeal.|$|R
50|$|Most {{cases are}} heard {{by a panel}} of three justices {{although}} the Chief Justice may convene a larger panel in exceptional circumstances. A single justice will preside over matters heard in ”chambers”, usually <b>interlocutory</b> matters or <b>applications</b> for leave to appeal.|$|R

25|$|Administration of the Supreme Court {{is managed}} by its registry, which handles {{matters such as}} {{receiving}} and storing court documents filed in the court, and ensuring they are transmitted to judges for use during hearings. The Registry is headed by the Registrar who is assisted by the Deputy Registrar, Senior Assistant Registrars and Assistant Registrars. These officers are appointed by the President on the Chief Justice's recommendation, and {{are members of the}} Judicial Branch of the Singapore Legal Service. In addition to their administrative responsibilities, registrars deal with certain types of court proceedings in chambers, such as the assessment of damages, hearings of bankruptcy petitions and <b>applications,</b> <b>interlocutory</b> matters and pre-trial conferences. Registrars are also appointed as district judges or magistrates, which enables them to conduct preliminary inquiries to determine whether there are enough grounds for trying accused persons for criminal offences in the High Court. The Registry is also staffed by commissioners for oaths, interpreters, clerks and process servers. Justices' law clerks, who work directly under the Chief Justice's charge, assist Judges and Judicial Commissioners with legal research, particularly for Court of Appeal matters.|$|R
