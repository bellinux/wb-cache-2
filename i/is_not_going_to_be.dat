5|$|Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{is forced}} to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with him. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.|$|E

The contractor is now tying up valuable capital {{that could be used}} elsewhere while waiting for the end of a project. In addition, the contractor must bear the cost of litigation in order to enforce their mechanic's lien rights.

25|$|Welagedara Stadium is a multi-use {{stadium in}} Kurunegala, in the North Western Province of Sri Lanka, which is {{situated}} about 100km north east of Kandy. The stadium is currently used mostly for cricket matches {{and is the}} home ground of Wayamba cricket team. The stadium can hold at least 10,000 spectators. Since its wicket had been replaced from a matting wicket to a turf one it {{has become one of}} the best batting wickets in the country. It was officially declared open by the then Minister of Home Affairs, Justice Felix Dias Bandaranaike in 1972. Welagedara stadium hosted its first international match when Pakistan played there in 1985. In recent times it has regularly hosted international tour matches, unofficial test matches and U19 one-day games. The ground is an extremely picturesque one, with the giant 'Elephant Rock' forming a dramatic back-drop to the ground. It also has historic value being situated in an important location for when Kurunegala was an important Kingdom, King Bhuvanaikabahu VI, would address his subjects from the press box beneath the Elephant Rock. Even though it has a lot of amenities, the Welagedara Stadium <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for the 2012 SLPL tournament.|$|E

500|$|By October, it was rumoured in {{high society}} and abroad that Edward {{intended}} to marry Simpson {{as soon as}} she was free to do so. At the end of that month, the crisis came to a head when she filed for divorce and the American press announced that marriage between her and the King was imminent. The King's private secretary, Alec Hardinge, wrote to him on 13 November, warning: [...] "The silence in the British Press on the subject of Your Majesty's friendship with Mrs Simpson <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> maintained... Judging by the letters from British subjects living in foreign countries where the Press has been outspoken, the effect will be calamitous."

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC in October 2005, Walker suggested that the army's recruitment had been adversely affected by the Iraq War. He also commented on the war in Afghanistan, on which he said [...] "There's {{a lot of work to}} be done, of which the military is only a very small part. Ten years, 15 years, long-term. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved in a short term". In the same month, he gave {{an interview}} for The Sunday Times, in which he said that soldiers' morale had been damaged by the unpopularity of the war among the British public. Later in 2005, Walker was instrumental in drawing up new procedures for the treatment of British service personnel accused of abusing Iraqi prisoners, following claims that the army had abandoned those soldiers charged in connection with the prisoner abuses. In February 2006, Walker headed up a military delegation to Bulgaria to discuss military cooperation between the British and Bulgarian governments.|$|E
500|$|Rivera {{exhibited}} a reserved demeanor {{on the field}} that contrasted with the emotional, demonstrative temperament {{of many of his}} peers. Hall of Fame closer Goose Gossage said that Rivera's composure under stress gave him the appearance of having [...] "ice water in his veins". Commenting on his ability to remain focused in pressure situations, Rivera said, [...] "When you start thinking, a lot of things will happen... If you don't control your emotions, your emotions will control your acts, and that's not good." [...] His ability to compartmentalize his successes and failures impressed fellow reliever Joba Chamberlain, who said, [...] "He's won and lost some of the biggest games in the history of baseball, and he's no worse for the wear when he gives up a home run." [...] Rivera explained the need to quickly forget bad performances, saying [...] "the game that you're going to play tomorrow <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the same game that you just played."

500|$|Commenting on {{the release}} of the second season, Cynthia Fuchs of PopMatters said the first season of Dark Angel was one of the [...] "few straight-up successes, a ratings hit among the coveted 'youth' demographic."

[...] Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly gave the first season a B+ and spoke highly of Alba, saying that [...] "for a while [...] TV's hottest kick-butt heroine". Elka Karl of Common Sense Media gave the entire series 3 out of 5 stars, saying: [...] "While the {{dialogue}} sometimes falls flat, overall the show is well-scripted and well acted, and Alba does an excellent job of carrying the series. Dark Angel isn't perfect {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, but it is compelling television that teen sci-fi fans will enjoy." [...] While praising the first season, Randy Dankievitch of TVOvermind labelled the second season [...] "silly", criticizing [...] "dumb stories" [...] like Max's dream episode [...] "Boo", the virus that prevents Logan and Max having physical contact, and the various half-animal Manticore experiments that are revealed.|$|E
500|$|In August 2011 the Serbian {{newspaper}} Blic {{stated that}} Bond 23 would be entitled Carte Blanche {{and would be}} an adaptation of the recent continuation novel by Jeffery Deaver.

On 3 October 2011 15 domain names including 'jamesbond-skyfall.com' and 'skyfallthefilm.com' were reported to have been registered on behalf of MGM and Sony Pictures by Internet brand-protection service MarkMonitor. This led to supposition in the media that the film had been given the name [...] "Skyfall". These reports were not confirmed at the time by Eon Productions, Sony or MGM. Skyfall was later confirmed as the title at a press conference on 3 November 2011, during which co-producer Barbara Broccoli said that the title [...] "has some emotional context which will be revealed in the film". The title refers to the name of Bond's childhood home [...] "Skyfall", and the setting for the film's finale.|$|E
500|$|Consistent with Bolkovac's account, The Whistleblower portrays DynCorp International {{employees}} {{as participants in}} the postwar Bosnian sex trade with the UN turning a blind eye. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. Bolkovac responded, [...] "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> simple or a quick fix." [...] She said {{that in addition to}} Bosnia, peacekeepers had violated human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan. Kondracki added that while she wanted to be optimistic and hoped that the screening would [...] "lead to genuine discussion and thought about the UN's involvement in sex trafficking and other crimes", she worried that it might not have the desired lasting impact: [...] "I know we are going to hear a lot about what has been done since the time depicted in this film, but rhetoric only goes so far. The situation has escalated." [...] Following the theatrical release of The Whistleblower, The Guardian reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.|$|E

He called in his secretary, Rose Mary Woods, and dictated a telegram to the RNC resigning from the ticket. As Woods left the room with her notes, Chotiner stopped her, took the sheet, and ripped it up. While Chotiner understood Nixon's rage, he felt that the resignation was premature. The campaign manager urged Nixon simply to allow the public wave of support to pressure Eisenhower. He suggested that instead of going to Wheeling as Eisenhower had requested, that they resume the train tour in Missoula, Montana. Nixon sent Eisenhower a curt acknowledgment of his telegram, and a suggestion that they meet the following week in Washington, D.C. Chotiner then called Summerfield, telling him that Nixon felt he had been abused enough, and would not meet with Eisenhower until Summerfield was able to promise, on his word of honor, that the senator would be confirmed as nominee at that meeting.

500|$|When the Tea Room {{was closed}} by the National Park Service on January 1, 1999, {{officials}} said they did so {{because of the potential}} fire hazard posed by operating a kitchen in the main park building and the possibility of insect or rodent damage to historic items in the mansion, as stated in the General Management Plan adopted by the NPS the previous year. While it [...] "may be a pleasant place to enjoy a meal... that is clearly less important than the need to preserve Hampton's buildings, objects and landscapes for future generations," [...] the Park Service stated. Officials of Preservation Maryland said they were [...] "disappointed" [...] by the restaurant's closure, saying it helped attract visitors to the historic site. The former chairwoman of the Hampton women's committee—which raises money for various projects at Hampton—also criticized the decision. Since 2006, the women's group has renewed efforts to have the Tea Room reopened, saying it would draw more visitors and repeat business from locals to the park.
