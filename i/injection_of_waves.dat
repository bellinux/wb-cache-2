Probes are affected both {{by changes in}} plasma potential and also by RF-averaging of the probe characteristic, with the latter tending to drop the floating potential. We present the effect of ICRF heating on divertor Langmuir probes in the EAST experiment. Over a scan of the outer gap, probes connected to the antennas have increases in floating potential with ICRF, but probes in between the outer-vessel strike point and flux surface tangent to the antenna have decreased floating potential. This behaviour is investigated using field-line mapping. Preliminary results show that mdiplane gas puffing can suppress the strong influence of ICRF on the probes’ floating potential...|$|E

The anomalies are de ned as daily low-pass-ltered departures from the circulation varying slowly with the seasonal cycle. A wave-activity ux and refractive index for stationary Rossby waves are utilized in our analysis, each of which was dened locally for the zonally varying westerlies. Subseasonal uctuations in the lower stratosphere were often associated with zonally conned wave trains emanating upward from localized, quasi-stationary anomalies in the troposphere including blocking ridges.

In Alcator C-Mod, {{the direction of}} the steady state rotation change due to LH waves depends on the plasma current and the density. The change in rotation can be estimated by balancing the external torque <b>of</b> lower hybrid <b>waves</b> with the turbulent radial transport of the momentum. For high plasma current, the turbulent pinch and diffusion of the injected counter-current momentum are sufficient to explain the rotation change. However, for low plasma current, the change in the the intrinsic momentum transport (residual stress) for a non-rotating state is required to explain the co-current rotation change. Accordingly, we investigate the intrinsic momentum transport for the non-rotating state when diamagnetic flow and ExB flow cancel each other. The change in the intrinsic momentum transport due to lower hybrid waves is significant when the plasma current is low, which may explain the rotation reversal for low plasma current.

The <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> Alfven <b>wave</b> energy at the inner boundary is such that the Poynting flux {{is proportional to the}} magnetic field strength. The three-dimensional magnetic field topology is simulated using data from photospheric magnetic field measurements. This model does not impose open-closed magnetic field boundaries; those develop self-consistently. The physics includes: (1) The model employs three different temperatures, namely the isotropic electron temperature and the parallel and perpendicular ion temperatures. The firehose, mirror, and ion-cyclotron instabilities due to the developing ion temperature anisotropy are accounted for. (2) The Alfven waves are partially reflected by the Alfven speed gradient and the vorticity along the field lines. The resulting counter-propagating waves are responsible for the nonlinear turbulent cascade. The balanced turbulence due to uncorrelated waves near the apex of the closed field lines and the resulting elevated temperatures are addressed.

40|$|A coupled wave-current-sediment {{transport}} {{beach profile}} model {{is used to}} simulate cross-shore sandbar evolution on the time scale from days to months comprising both rapid offshore and slow onshore migrations. The discrimination of four modes of sediment transport driven by velocity and acceleration skewness, mean currents and slope effects allows addressing the dominant hydrodynamic processes governing cross-shore sandbar behavior. Acceleration-skewness-induced transport systematically results in a slow onshore sandbar migration together with a slow bar growth. Velocity-skewness-induced transport can drive onshore and offshore bar migrations with substantially larger rates. Mean-current-induced sediment transport systematically drives an offshore bar migration with either bar growth or decay. Slope effects essentially act as a damping term. The water level above the sandbar crest mainly influences the sandbar migration direction, while wave obliquity regulates {{the magnitude of the}} migration rates and is crucial to accurately simulate offshore sandbar migration during energetic obliquely incident <b>waves.</b> The inclusion <b>of</b> acceleration skewness is a necessary requirement to accurately reproduce the onshore migration of shallow sandbars.

40|$|We {{have carried}} out a {{thorough}} study of current and noise for spin-polarized and spin-entangled electrons in a beamsplitter geometry, including a local spin-orbit interaction �Rashba and Dresselhaus� {{in one of the}} incoming arms. We have considered incoming leads with one or two channels, as well as backscattering effects. The channels can be coupled via the SO interaction for incoming energies near the band crossing. We have found that the spin-orbit interaction is a useful mechanism to coherently rotate spin states. Such rotation can be used to modulate noise signals, thus providing unique signatures of spin polarization and spin entanglement. For spin-polarized electrons, noise measurements can give a direct measure of the degree of polarization along different directions. For electron pairs, the coupling between the channels can play an important role. For pairs with incoming energies near the band crossing injected into one of the channels, we find an additional modulation due to the coherent transfer of electrons between the two channels. In this case, noise measurement allows us to distinguish all the different triplets states defined along the y direction, in addition to the singlet. Furthermore, for equal strengths the combined effect of the Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions can partially cancel out. In this case, the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are separable, the interband coupling essentially disappears, and the propagation of spin states is robust against scattering off nonmagnetic impurities. We have also considered the influence of backscattering in the beam-splitter with a single channel. The main effect is an additional contribution related to the partition noise due to the tunnel barrier describing the backscattering. This reduces the visibility of the oscillations in the shot noise as the SO rotation angle 	SO is varied. It also reduces the maximal noise value found for perfect antibunching of singlets. We have generalized earlier results for the shot noise of entangled electrons by allowing the <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> packets, i. e., coherent superpositions of discrete momentum eigenstates �plane waves�.

40|$|Integrated mode-locked {{laser diodes}} are {{effective}} sources of periodic sequences of optical pulses, which {{have always been}} of great interest {{for a range of}} spectroscopy, imaging and optical communications applications. However, some disadvantages prevent their widespread use, such as the restricted tuning of their repetition rate and their output power levels never exceeding a few mW. This thesis reports on the work done to address those limitations. Two main findings are presented, the first being the generation of ultra-high repetition rate optical signals through external <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> two continuous <b>wave</b> signals. This mechanism is much simpler than other techniques previously proposed to increase the repetition rate of monolithic modelocked laser, and has proved successful in generating optical signals up to quasi-THz. It is based on <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> two continuous <b>wave</b> signals whose spacing is an integer multiple of the pulsed cavity free spectral range and whose injection wavelengths coincide with two of the monolithic laser modes. This technique allows discrete tunability of the repetition rate with a step equal to the injected cavity free spectral range, and the injected laser has been shown to lock up to a repetition rate of 936 GHz, corresponding to 26 times that of the free-running semiconductor laser (36 GHz). The presented scheme is suitable for integration, opening the way for a successful on-chip generation of ultra-high repetition rate optical signals exploiting coupled cavity phenomena. The second main finding of this thesis regards the changes induced on the pulsed operation of monolithic passively mode-locked lasers by a blue bandgap detuning applied to their saturable absorber. The quantum well intermixing technique has been used for attaining an area-selective bandgap shift on the fabricated chip, being fully postgrowth. The lasers with a detuned absorber were found to have an extended range of gain section currents and absorber voltages in which stable mode-locking operation took place. Furthermore, a comparison of mode-locked devices fabricated on the same chip, respectively with and without a bandgap detuned absorber, showed that the emitted pulses had greater peak power and were less affected by optical chirp when the bandgap of the absorbing section was shifted. A new intermixing technique has also been developed as part of this work to address some inconsistencies of the pre-existing one; the newly introduced approach has been found to provide better spatial resolution and a more precise control of the attained bandgap shift...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of estradiol cypionate (ECP) for synchronizing ovarian follicular development was determined in lactating Holstein-Friesian cattle. In Experiment 1, 13 cattle were given simultaneous intramuscular (i. m.) <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> 100 mg progesterone and 0 (control), 0. 5 or 1. 0 mg ECP on Day 3, after a synchronized ovulation (Day 0). Maximum {{diameter of the}} dominant follicle <b>of</b> <b>Wave</b> 1 was significantly larger in control cattle than in those given 0. 5 or 1. 0 mg ECP (means: 15. 7, 13. 2, and 12. 9 mm, respectively). Mean day <b>of</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>Wave</b> 2 was significantly later in controls than in those given 1. 0 mg ECP, with the 0. 5 mg group intermediate (Days 10. 2, 8. 8 and 9. 5, respectively). In Experiment 2, 14 cattle were given a CIDR-B and IM <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> 1 mg ECP and 50 mg progesterone without regard to stage of cycle (treatment = Day 0). On Day 8, the CIDR-B was removed and 500 micrograms cloprostenol injected, IM. Mean days <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> emergence (Day 3. 4; range: - 2 to 7) and ovulation (Day 12. 1; range: 10 to 14) indicated that ECP had limited efficacy for synchronizing follicular development and ovulation in dairy cattle when given at random stages of the estrous cycle...|$|R
40|$|Excitation of {{electrostatic}} modes as {{a result}} <b>of</b> the <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> an argon beam into a multispecies plasma is investigated. It is shown that the <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> a warm artificial beam into a thermal plasma may excite <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> significant amplitude {{with a range of}} phase velocities which are linearly stable. These waves appear {{as a result}} of the correlation between motions of an individual particle in a Vlasov fluid. When the free energy is derived from a warm beam and the linear instability diminishes due to the large temperature of the beam, the competing mechanism of thermal fluctuations is responsible for the main excitation <b>of</b> <b>waves.</b> This mechanism is valid for the various modes in a multispecies plasma, with a higher enhancement at the lower-hybrid than at the ion-ion-hybrid modes...|$|R
