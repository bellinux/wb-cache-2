5|$|The {{collection}} has prehistoric artifacts from early <b>hunter-gatherer</b> societies {{ranging from the}} Lower Paleolithic (1M.-150.000 BCE) to the Neolithic (9000–3200 BCE), typically spearheads, flints, hooks and pottery.|$|E
5|$|The sea, rivers, forests, lakes, {{and fields}} {{surrounding}} Seattle were once {{rich enough to}} support one of the world's few sedentary <b>hunter-gatherer</b> societies. The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing, skiing, bicycling, camping, and hiking year-round.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hunter-gatherers</b> {{tend to have}} {{an egalitarian}} social ethos, {{although}} settled <b>hunter-gatherers</b> (for example, those inhabiting the Northwest Coast of North America) are an exception to this rule. Nearly all African <b>hunter-gatherers</b> are egalitarian, with women roughly as influential and powerful as men. Karl Marx defined this socio-economic system as primitive communism.|$|R
50|$|The Caucasus <b>hunter-gatherers</b> {{descended from}} a {{population}} that split off very early around 45,000 years ago, pre-dating the split that led to differentiated populations that descended separately to Ust'-Ishim man, Oase1 and European <b>hunter-gatherers.</b> The Caucasus <b>hunter-gatherers</b> managed to survive in isolation through the last Ice Age as a distinct population.|$|R
40|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{undertaken in}} the upper Gundar Basin (Madurai district, Tamil Nadu, India) between 1991 and 1996 have yielded evidence for the Mesolithic and Iron Age-Early Historic periods. The research has revealed that microlith-using <b>hunter-gatherers</b> continued to exist during the Iron Age and Early Historic periods, and interacted with agropastoral groups. This paper discusses the settlement system of Mesolithic <b>hunter-gatherers</b> and interactions between the <b>hunter-gatherers</b> and the agropastoral groups of the Iron Age-Early Historic period.

5|$|Scholars have {{developed}} a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from <b>hunter-gatherer</b> to agricultural societies indicate an antecedent period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in southwest Asia, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Current models indicate that wild stands that had been harvested previously started to be planted, but were not immediately domesticated.|$|E
5|$|The jade {{is said to}} have {{originated}} nearby in Taiwan and is also found in many other areas in insular and mainland Southeast Asia. These artifacts are said to be evidence of long range communication between prehistoric Southeast Asian societies. By 1000BC, the inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four kinds of social groups: <b>hunter-gatherer</b> tribes, warrior societies, highland plutocracies, and port principalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{very limited}} archaeological record {{provides}} little {{to suggest that}} culture in Scotland caught up with developing societies to the south {{during this period of}} improved climatic conditions. Some finds nonetheless indicate the presence of relatively large and well-organised <b>hunter-gatherer</b> societies. No Mesolithic burial sites have been uncovered in Scotland to date. Substantial finds at the village of Dunragit were announced in 2014 including arrowheads, urns and bead necklaces from the Mesolithic. Initial press reports provided no firm dates for these artefacts.|$|E

50|$|It {{is unknown}} which {{languages}} were spoken in Sri Lanka {{prior to its}} settlement by Prakrit-speaking immigrants in the 5th century BCE. The Sinhalese term Vedda is a generic term denoting <b>hunter-gatherers.</b> In Tamil they are known as Vedar, meaning 'hunter.' Cognate terms (Such as bedar, beda) are used throughout South India to describe <b>hunter-gatherers.</b> Sri Lanka has had other <b>hunter-gatherering</b> peoples such as the Rodiya and Kinnaraya.|$|R
50|$|A 2009 study {{comparing}} mitochondrial DNA lineages of late <b>hunter-gatherers,</b> early farmers, {{and modern}} Europeans found large {{differences between the}} three groups. In particular, 82 percent of <b>hunter-gatherers</b> had maternal lineages that are rare in modern central Europeans.|$|R
5|$|A Paleolithic culture around 30,000BC {{constitutes}} {{the first known}} habitation of the Japanese archipelago. This was followed from around 14,000BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary <b>hunter-gatherer</b> culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture, including by ancestors of contemporary Ainu people and Yamato people. Decorated clay vessels from this period {{are some of the}} oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world. Around 300 BC, the Yayoi people began to enter the Japanese islands, intermingling with the Jōmon. The Yayoi period, starting around 500BC, saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery and metallurgy, introduced from China and Korea.|$|E
5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000– 70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer than today's, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} what is now Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic <b>hunter-gatherer</b> encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated a site near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers, {{probably}} with a very low density of population.|$|E
5|$|Farm Fields, a {{site near}} Kinloch, {{provides}} some of the earliest known evidence of human occupation in Scotland. Carbonized hazelnut shells found there have been dated to the Mesolithic period at 7700-7500 BC.; at this time the landscape was dominated by alder, hazel and willow scrub. A beach site above Loch Scresort has been dated to between 6500 and 5500 BC. The presence of this <b>hunter-gatherer</b> community may have been {{to take advantage of the}} local supplies of bloodstone, a workable material for the making of tools and weapons. There is a shell-midden at Papadil in the south and evidence of tidal fish traps at both Kinloch and Kilmory.|$|E
50|$|The Caucasus <b>hunter-gatherers</b> contributed {{significantly}} to modern European populations {{by way of the}} Yamna people. Around half of the Yamna people's DNA come from the Caucasus hunter-gatherers.The Caucasus <b>hunter-gatherers</b> also contributed genetically to modern Central Asians and South Asians.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Nomadic' <b>hunter-gatherers</b> (also {{known as}} foragers) move from {{campsite}} to campsite, following game and wild fruits and vegetables. Hunting and gathering was the ancestral subsistence mode of Homo, and all modern humans were <b>hunter-gatherers</b> until around 10,000 years ago.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{development}} of agriculture, most <b>hunter-gatherers</b> were eventually either displaced or converted to farming or pastoralist groups. Only a few contemporary societies are classified as <b>hunter-gatherers,</b> and some supplement, sometimes extensively, their foraging activity with farming or keeping animals.|$|R
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, Native Americans inhabited {{the region where}} the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a <b>hunter-gatherer</b> lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date. During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5km) {{from the head of}} the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.|$|E
5|$|Human {{history of}} the Grand Teton region dates back at least 11,000years, when the first nomadic <b>hunter-gatherer</b> Paleo-Indians began {{migrating}} into the region during warmer months pursuing food and supplies. In the early 19thcentury, the first White explorers encountered the eastern Shoshone natives. Between 1810 and 1840, the region attracted fur trading companies that vied {{for control of the}} lucrative beaver pelt trade. U.S. Government expeditions to the region commenced in the mid-19thcentury as an offshoot of exploration in Yellowstone, with the first permanent white settlers in Jackson Hole arriving in the 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Modern human hunter-gatherers {{have been}} in Uttar Pradesh since between around 85,000 and 72,000 years ago. There have also been prehistorical finds in Uttar Pradesh from the Middle and Upper Paleolithic dated to 21,000–31,000 years old and Mesolithic/Microlithic <b>hunter-gatherer</b> settlement, near Pratapgarh, from around 10550–9550 BC. Villages with domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats and {{evidence}} of agriculture began as early as 6000 BC, and gradually developed between c. 4000 and 1500 BC beginning with the Indus Valley Civilisation and Harappa Culture to the Vedic period and extending into the Iron Age.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} set out {{to determine}} whether or not a distinction could be made between three different kinds of (pre) historic societies, namely terrestrial <b>hunter-gatherers,</b> marine <b>hunter-gatherers</b> and agriculturalists based on the level of activity. What was examined was that, within terrestrial <b>hunter-gatherers,</b> the lower limb showed greater diaphyseal strength due to long-distance traveling and running. Within the marine <b>hunter-gatherers,</b> the upper limb showed greater diaphyseal strength due to the fact that their way of transportation would mainly involve either swimming or the use of watercrafts. Also they do not need to be as nomadic as terrestrial <b>hunter-gatherers.</b> Both terrestrial and marine <b>hunter-gatherers</b> show a great level of sexual dimorphism within their skeleton due to different jobs performed by men and women. Within agricultural societies there is a decrease in diaphyseal strength of the long bones, whether these are from the upper limb or from the lower limb, and their shape changes from more oval to more circular. Another notorious change witnessed within the transition to agriculture is that there is a decrease in sexual dimorphism. This topic is still in a primal phase of investigation and telling activity patterns from bone is still very difficult...|$|R

5|$|Murukan {{is known}} from Sangam Tamil literature. The {{earliest}} reference to Murukan {{was as a}} god who was propitiated to help in good hunting. He was the primary god of <b>hunter-gatherer</b> people from the mountainous region of southern Tamil Nadu {{very much like the}} Veddas of Sri Lanka. With the advancement of settled agriculture, Murukan became identified with the tribal chieftains as a god of war, becoming popular among all segments of the society. He was worshiped symbolically as lance and trees such as the Kadamba Neolamarckia cadamba) were considered to be sacred to him. Birds such as the peafowl or rooster were also identified with the deity. Velans were a special class of priests identified with his worship.|$|E
5|$|The cromlech was {{discovered}} in 1869 by workmen digging for road stone. An excavation later that year revealed human bones (now known to have belonged to at least 40 people), animal remains, and Neolithic pottery. Samples from the site show the tomb {{to have been in}} use for between 300 and 800years. North-West European lifestyles changed around 6000 BP, from the nomadic lives of the <b>hunter-gatherer,</b> to a settled life of agricultural farming: the Neolithic Revolution. However, analysis of the human remains found at Parc Cwm long cairn show the people interred in the cromlech continued to be either hunter-gatherers or herders, rather than agricultural farmers.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} {{history of}} Scotland includes {{all aspects of}} population history {{in what is now}} Scotland. Scotland may have been first occupied in the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE), but the earliest surviving archaeological evidence of human settlement is of Mesolithic <b>hunter-gatherer</b> encampments. These suggest a highly mobile boat-using people, probably with a very low density of population. Neolithic farming brought permanent settlements dating from 3500 BCE, and greater concentrations of population. Evidence of hillforts and other buildings suggest a growing settled population. Changes in the scale of woodland indicates that the Roman invasions from the first century CE had a negative impact on the native population.|$|E

5|$|The {{gray wolf}} {{is one of}} the world's best-known and most-researched animals, with {{probably}} more books written about it than any other wildlife species. It {{has a long history of}} association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and <b>hunter-gatherer</b> societies. Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds.|$|E
5|$|The present-day Mikea are not {{a remnant}} of an ancient Malagasy <b>hunter-gatherer</b> society, but are instead {{descendants}} of individuals who took refuge in the forest beginning in the 1800s to escape military conflict, heavy taxation and other oppressive factors. Their {{way of life is}} perceived by villagers and city dwellers alike as ancestral, contributing to a mystique about them that has inspired various myths and legends. They are commonly believed to be the mythical Vazimba, the original inhabitants of the island, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this view. While some 1,500 individuals are known to identify as Mikea, many Malagasy disbelieve that the community continues to exist in the present day.|$|E
