25|$|On the anode side, {{hydrogen}} diffuses to the anode catalyst {{where it}} later dissociates into protons and electrons. These protons often react with oxidants {{causing them to}} become what are {{commonly referred to as}} multi-facilitated proton membranes. The protons are conducted through the membrane to the cathode, but the electrons are forced to travel in an <b>external</b> <b>circuit</b> (supplying power) because the membrane is electrically insulating. On the cathode catalyst, oxygen molecules react with the electrons (which have traveled through the <b>external</b> <b>circuit)</b> and protons to form water.|$|E

25|$|A {{thyristor}} can be {{switched off}} if the <b>external</b> <b>circuit</b> causes the anode to become negatively biased (a method known as natural, or line, commutation). In some applications {{this is done}} by switching a second thyristor to discharge a capacitor into the cathode of the first thyristor. This method is called forced commutation.|$|E
25|$|The {{relation}} between current and applied voltage illustrates {{the nature of}} the photoelectric effect. For discussion, a light source illuminates a plate P, and another plate electrode Q collects any emitted electrons. We vary the potential between P and Q and measure the current flowing in the <b>external</b> <b>circuit</b> between the two plates.|$|E
40|$|The alternating-current {{electric}} {{machines are}} usually excited by voltage sources and the external elements are connected in the magnetizing circuit. Therefore the magnetic fields including nonlinear characteristics, voltage sources and <b>external</b> <b>circuits</b> {{should be considered}} together in the analysis model. Furthermore, the motion effects in field problem of electric machines must be sometimes taken into account. This paper describes a new approach for analyzing the time-periodic nonlinear magnetic field problems considered <b>external</b> <b>circuits</b> and motion in the harmonic domain by using the harmonic balance finite element method. The system equation for governing magnetic field with motion and circuits is investigated. A few applications are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Tape-automated bonding (TAB) is {{a process}} that places bare {{integrated}} circuits onto a printed circuit board (PCB) by attaching them to fine conductors in a polyamide or polyimide film, thus providing a means to directly connect to <b>external</b> <b>circuits.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{positive}} cell potential gives {{a negative}} change in Gibbs free energy. This {{is consistent with}} the cell production of an electric current from the cathode to the anode through the <b>external</b> <b>circuit.</b> If the current is driven in the opposite direction by imposing an external potential, then work is done on the cell to drive electrolysis.|$|E
25|$|While powered (energized), photomultipliers must be {{shielded}} from ambient light {{to prevent their}} destruction through overexcitation. In some applications this protection is accomplished mechanically by electrical interlocks or shutters that protect the tube when the photomultiplier compartment is opened. Another option is to add overcurrent protection in the <b>external</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{so that when the}} measured anode current exceeds a safe limit, the high voltage is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Sunlight {{passes through}} the {{transparent}} electrode into the dye layer where it can excite electrons that then flow into the titanium dioxide. The electrons flow toward the transparent electrode where they are collected for powering a load. After flowing through the <b>external</b> <b>circuit,</b> they are re-introduced into the cell on a metal electrode on the back, flowing into the electrolyte. The electrolyte then transports the electrons back to the dye molecules.|$|E

We present and discuss, as an example, the strongly dependent relationship between the exceptional points of a three-layered system and the impedance of their <b>external</b> shunted <b>circuit.</b> The achieved results evidence the PT symmetric structures based on this proposed concept can actively be tuned without any change of their geometric configurations...|$|R
50|$|An ALU has {{a variety}} of input and output nets, which are the {{electrical}} conductors used to convey digital signals between the ALU and external circuitry.

25|$|The burden {{voltage can be}} {{significant}} in very low-voltage circuit areas. To check for its effect on accuracy and on <b>external</b> <b>circuit</b> operation the meter can be switched to different ranges; the current reading {{should be the same}} and circuit operation should not be affected if burden voltage is not a problem. If this voltage is significant it can be reduced (also reducing the inherent accuracy and precision of the measurement) by using a higher current range.|$|E
25|$|When {{placed in}} the sun, photons of the {{sunlight}} can excite electrons on the p-type side of the semiconductor, {{a process known as}} photoexcitation. In silicon, sunlight can provide enough energy to push an electron out of the lower-energy valence band into the higher-energy conduction band. As the name implies, electrons in the conduction band are free to move about the silicon. When a load is placed across the cell as a whole, these electrons will flow out of the p-type side into the n-type side, lose energy while moving through the <b>external</b> <b>circuit,</b> and then flow back into the p-type material where they can once again re-combine with the valence-band hole they left behind. In this way, sunlight creates an electric current.|$|E
500|$|Leopoldo Nobili built a frog battery in 1818 out of {{complete}} frog legs {{which he called}} a frog pile.

5000|$|There are {{numerous}} possible variations to this basic scheme. The Frequency Jump version, {{also known as}} the [...] "zebra method", inserts forcing only on a specific number of cycles in a set pattern. This dramatically reduces the chance that <b>external</b> <b>circuits</b> may filter the signal out. This advantage disappears with multiple inverters, unless some way of synchronizing the patterns is used.|$|R
500|$|This is {{sometimes}} referred to as the driving point impedance because it is the impedance at the place in the network at which the <b>external</b> <b>circuit</b> is connected and [...] "drives" [...] it with a signal. [...] In his paper, Foster describes how such a lossless rational function may be realised (if it can be realised) in two ways. [...] Foster's first form consists of a number of series connected parallel LC circuits. [...] Foster's second form of driving point impedance consists of a number of parallel connected series LC circuits. [...] The realisation of the driving point impedance is by no means unique. [...] Foster's realisation has the advantage that the poles and/or zeroes are directly associated with a particular resonant circuit, but there are many other realisations. [...] Perhaps the most well known is Cauer's ladder realisation from filter design.|$|E

2500|$|An {{electric}} battery is a device consisting {{of one or}} more electrochemical cells with external connections provided to power electrical devices [...] such as flashlights, smartphones, and electric cars. When a battery is supplying electric power, its positive terminal is the cathode and its negative terminal is the anode. The terminal marked negative is the source of electrons that when connected to an <b>external</b> <b>circuit</b> will flow and deliver energy to an external device. When a battery is connected to an <b>external</b> <b>circuit,</b> electrolytes are able to move as ions within, allowing the chemical reactions to be completed at the separate terminals and so deliver energy to the <b>external</b> <b>circuit.</b> It is the movement of those ions within the battery which allows current to flow out of the battery to perform work. Historically the term [...] "battery" [...] specifically referred to a device composed of multiple cells, however the usage has evolved additionally to include devices composed of a single cell.|$|E
