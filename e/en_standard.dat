50|$|UL allows an {{individual}} {{composition of the}} door set from various components such as hinges, locks, frames, door leaves etc. as long as every single component has satisfied the UL standard and been tested individually as such. This is not true for the <b>EN</b> <b>standard.</b> Even though for each component there is a separate test standard available, which the single hardware component must satisfy, the <b>EN</b> <b>standard</b> allows only for the tested composition of components. Therefore exchanging hinges, locks, steel sheet thicknesses, etc. is generally not possible without additional tests.|$|E

50|$|Available sieve {{sizes are}} usually {{regulated}} by standards. Those in common use are ISO 565:1990 and ISO 3310-1:2000 (international), EN 933-1(European) and ASTM E11:01 (US). <b>EN</b> <b>standards</b> {{are available with}} national 'badging' so appear as BS EN, FR EN, DE, etc.|$|R
50|$|Large {{differences}} exist in opening directions {{to be tested}} (EN requires both sides to be tested, UL one side only), permitted wall types (EN lists 3 types of walls, whereas UL does not differ at all), surface temperatures permitted (UL measures the first 30 minutes only, whereas EN the full duration of the test) and sustained flaming allowances (EN no flaming, UL several types and durations allowed). Another major difference is {{the treatment of the}} exchangeability of components such as locks, hinges, and frame types. The <b>EN</b> <b>standard</b> basically requires each combination to be tested as a whole, where as UL is satisfied with the single component being tested independently from the door assembly. Further the <b>EN</b> <b>standard</b> differs in its treatment of the extension of dimensions from the UL standard. EN allows for only limited dimensional extensions, but requires in such cases a surplus of test time and better gap values. Whereas the UL Standard does not allow an increase of the dimension of the tested door, you can decrease the dimension without any restriction. Last but not least, UL requires {{at the end of the}} fire exposure a hose stream test, where water from a hose is directed to the tested assembly. No water shall penetrate and the door shall withstand the impact. The <b>EN</b> <b>standard</b> does not mention anything similar.|$|E

50|$|The furnace time / {{temperature}} curves differ {{between the}} standards UL 10B and EN 1363-1 {{in that the}} UL standard focuses most of its rigour around the 20th minute.

5000|$|More recent {{versions}} of PAS 015:1998 and BS EN 1384:1997 are nearly identical.

[...] On the other hand, the current debate between the ASTM standard and the <b>EN</b> <b>standard</b> is primarily over the issue of ventilation slots, allowed by ASTM. The debate centers over whether there is an actual need for protection from penetration by sharp objects.|$|E
5000|$|Contrary to the <b>EN</b> <b>Standard,</b> the UL Standards 10B and 10C {{requires}} a Hose Stream Test, which measures integrity of specimens after exposure to fire.
