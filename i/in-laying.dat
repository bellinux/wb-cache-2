50|$|Art Nouveau, {{also known}} as New Art, was a trend in Europe and the United States that lasted around 20 years {{beginning}} around 1890, inspiring applied arts, crafts, and design in particular. Glass artists of Nancy in Lorraine region, the north-eastern part of France, were {{at the center of}} the Arts and Crafts movement. Nancy artists advanced the technique of glass crafts from the pipe blowing craft work (Pontil) to more sophisticated artistic methods of color-glass layering, <b>in-laying,</b> sculpting, engraving, and etching. The innovative styles and techniques enabled them to express their advocating of nature as the primary source of inspiration. The Yumin Art Nouveau Collection exhibits the works of leading French Art Nouveau artists including Emile Gallé, Daum, Eugène Michel, René and Lalique.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} an investigation on the design options available for positioning the inlaid yarn in fillet warp knit structures. The geometry and structural parameters using our previously published methodology are also presented. It is shown, for example, that if inlaying guide bar does the shifting behind the needles at two needle pitch (variants 1. 11 - 1. 13, Table. 1) the filling yarn wraps the junctures from G 1 ground yarns according to repeat. This position of <b>in-laying</b> yarn provides good stability in the fabric structure, which improves {{with the amount of}} wrapping. Thus, the different positions of the inlaid yarn within the structures offer other possibilities that could be explored when designing fillet warp knit auxetic structures. The array of data for the various design options provide analytical tool for making comparisons about the physical, structural and mechanical properties of the warp knit fillet structures. It is observed that the position of <b>in-laying</b> yarn has some effect on stretch characteristics of warp knit structure...|$|E

40|$|Structural {{and dynamic}} {{analyses}} are presented for a shroudless, hollow titanium fan blade proposed {{for future use}} in aircraft turbine engines. The blade was modeled and analyzed using the composite blade structural analysis computer program (COBSTRAN); an integrated program consisting of mesh generators, composite mechanics codes, NASTRAN, and pre- and post-processors. Vibration and impact analyses are presented. The vibration analysis was conducted with COBSTRAN. Results show {{the effect of the}} centrifugal force field on frequencies, twist, and blade camber. Bird impact analysis was performed with the multi-mode blade impact computer program. This program uses the geometric model and modal analysis from the COBSTRAN vibration analysis to determine the gross impact response of the fan blades to bird strikes. The structural performance of this blade is also compared to a blade of similar design but with composite <b>in-lays</b> on the outer surface. Results show that the composite <b>in-lays</b> can be selected (designed) to substantially modify the mechanical performance of the shroudless, hollow fan blade...|$|R
5000|$|Full-porcelain dental {{materials}} include Dental porcelain (porcelain {{meaning a}} high-firing-temperature ceramic), other ceramics, sintered-glass materials, and glass-ceramics as indirect fillings and crowns or metal-free [...] "jacket crowns". They {{are also used}} as <b>in-lays,</b> on-lays, and aesthetic veneers. A veneer is a very thin shell of porcelain that can replace or cover part of the enamel of the tooth. Full-porcelain restorations are particularly desirable because their color and translucency mimic natural tooth enamel.|$|R
50|$|From the Warring States period, ovular forms become subcircular shapes. Four fantastical creatures {{adorn the}} lid of this period's example, forming upright rings. Animal pendant masks hold {{moveable}} rings in their mouths, allowing for easy transport. <b>In-lay</b> patterning surfaces in this example too, with turquoise and silver in typical registers. Curvilinear patterns accentuate the shape; the more prominent bands of decoration portray symmetrical bird figures with intertwining bodies encircling the vessel. Border designs consist of S-shaped bands around the foot, lid, and body.|$|R
5000|$|Madness Live: To The Edge Of The Universe And Beyond is {{a double}} live album by British ska band Madness. It was {{released}} in November 2006 as <b>in-lays</b> in two consecutive issues of the newspaper The Mail on Sunday. Although it is named after the group's 2005-6 tour, many of the recordings are in fact older and some had been issued before ("Razor Blade Alley" [...] and [...] "The Sun and the Rain" [...] in particular contain distinctive ad libs which make them easily recognisable as coming from the band's previous live LP, Madstock!). Two tracks, [...] "Prospects" [...] and [...] "March of the Gherkins", appear in mono.|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the use of}} a segmental Le Fort I osteotomy for interpositional autogenous iliac bone grafts in 5 patients with severe unilateral atrophy of the maxilla. Unilateral pterygomaxillary disjunction and osteotomy of the lateral and medial walls of the maxillary sinus were performed. The mucosa of the maxillary sinus was preserved and lifted cranially. It was stabilized with autogenous cancellous bone grafts. One side of the maxilla was gently downfractured until it replaced the original morphology of the alveolar crest. The inter-arch space was therefore reduced to the ideal level for placing implants. Lateral widening of the alveolar crest was obtained with on-lay bone grafts. Segmental osteotomy with bone grafting is a modification of Le Fort I swing osteotomy that has several advantages. The <b>in-lay</b> graft was not resorbed because it was rapidly revascularized and implant placement was delayed. This article presents a surgical technique for the reduction of vertical inter-arch space for the correct positioning of osseointegrated implants...|$|R
40|$|Tubular Si-infiltrated SiCf/SiC {{composites}} {{composed of}} an inner cellular ceramic and an outer dense Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) skin have been fabricated by the electrophoretic deposition of matrix phases followed by Si-infiltration for pre-feasibility testing in solar receiver applications. The tubes {{have been considered}} {{to be used as}} high temperature receiver components for the solar operation of a gas turbine or a combined cycle with temperatures up to 1300 °C and typical pressures of more than 6 bar. The cellular structure inside the tube has been introduced for the improvement of heat transfer from the irradiated outer surface of the tube to the working fluid inside. Heat transfer and permeability characteristics of the composite samples have been determined experimentally as effective properties. These properties have been used in numerical models to predict the performance of such kind of components in gas turbine service conditions. It could be demonstrated, that the heat transfer rate in a tube with a porous <b>in-lay</b> could be increased to approximately four times compared to the rate of an empty tube of the same size. The results of the study give reason for further experimental testing in service environments...|$|R
40|$|In {{completely}} randomized {{design that}} comprised two studies, physical, chemical and performance evaluations {{were conducted to}} determine the quality of commercial four layers feeds, three broiler starter and three broiler finisher feeds. In study 1, eighty 20 -week <b>in–lay</b> black harco hens were used in four replicate groups to evaluate {{the effects of the}} selected layer feeds on their laying performance for twelve weeks. While in study 2, seventy two broiler chicks were used (0 - 8 weeks) in three replicate groups to evaluate the broiler feeds. All feeds were packaged in standard polyethylene woven bags with no presence of insects or mould. All feeds were in mash form except two layers feeds in crumbled form and one pelleted feed. There were also variations in crude protein, crude fat and crude fibre contents of the various feeds as analyzed. There {{were no significant differences in}} Hen Day Production and egg diameters. However, total number of eggs laid and egg weight were significantly reduced among hens on two treatments. The highest cost of producing a dozen eggs was recorded with the pelleted feed. There were significant differences in feed intake, weight gain and feed conversion ratio among broilers on the different treatments, with the poorest performance recorded among broilers fed starter and finisher feeds from same producer. Percentage mortality was however not significant. It was concluded that none of the feeds investigated met all the requirements of an ideal feed either for broilers or layers...|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} Sikh Gurudwara in Karnataka is the Guru Nanak Jhira Sahib at Bidar. It {{was built}} in traditional Sikh architecture style, at a sacred place located at Bidar in Bidar District. It is also called Nanak Jhira, where Jhira means a spring of water exists. Legend says that Guru Nanak halted here {{on his way to}} Sri Lanka in 1512. During that period, people of Bidar were suffering from shortage of drinking water. A fountain of cool water rose out from a hill by the spiritual power of Guru Nanak. A committee took up development work of Gurudwara Nanak Jhira Sahib with the central three-storey building completed in 1966, which encases the historic Nanak Jhira spring divined by Gurunanak. The water of the fountain is collected in 'Amrit-Khud' (a tank of potion), built in white marble. There is a Sikh museum, built in the memory of Guru Tegh Bahadur, depicting the important events of Sikh history through pictures and paintings. There is a Sikh museum, built in the memory of Guru Tegh Bahadur, depicting the important events of Sikh history through pictures and paintings. Built in the Sikh architecture style, the Gurdwara is a lively blend of the Mughal and Rajput styles. Onion-shaped domes, multi-foil arches, paired pilasters, <b>in-lay</b> work, frescoes, etc. are of Mughal extraction, more specially of Shah Jahan's period, while oriel windows, bracket supported eaves at the string-course, chattris, richly ornamented friezes, etc., are derived from elements of Rajput architecture such as is seen in Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner and other places in Rajasthan.|$|R
5000|$|Dental composites, {{also called}} [...] "white fillings", are {{a group of}} {{restorative}} materials used in dentistry. Crowns and <b>in-lays</b> {{can be made in}} the laboratory from dental composites. These materials are similar to those used in direct fillings and are tooth-colored. Their strength and durability is not as high as porcelain or metal restorations and they are more prone to wear and discolouration. As with other composite materials, a dental composite typically consists of a resin-based matrix, which contains a modified methacrylate or acrylate. Two examples of such commonly used monomers include bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate (BISMA) and urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA), together with tri-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGMA). TEGMA is a comonomer which can be used to control viscosity, as Bis GMA is a big molecule with high viscosity, for easier clinical handling. Inorganic filler such as silica, quartz or glasses, are added to reduce polymerization shrinkage by occupying volume and to confirm radio-opacity of products due to translucency in property, which can be helpful in diagnosis of dental caries around dental restoration. The filler particles give the composites wear resistance as well. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler glasses and glass ceramics. A coupling agent such as silane is used to enhance the bond between resin matrix and filler particles. An initiator package begins the polymerization reaction of the resins when external energy (light/heat, etc.) is applied. For example, camphorquinone can be excited by visible blue light with critical wavelength of 460-480 nm to yield necessary free radicals to start the process.|$|R
40|$|Članek obravnava zgradbo za prvo svetovno razstavo v Londonu leta 1851. Opisane so priprave na razstavo, natečaj za projekt stavbe in predlogi, predstavljen je Paxtonov predlog in gradnja v Hyde Parku. Posebno je poudarjeno vgrajevanje lesenih elementov. Dokazana je trditev, da je Kristalna palača zgrajena tudi iz lesa. "Veliko razstavo industrijskih izdelkov vseh narodov" so odprli 1. maja 1851 in zaprli 15. oktobra 1851, nato so palačo razstavili, jo ponovno sestavili in odprli leta 1854 v Sydenhamu. Kristalna palača je arhitekturno in konstrukcijsko pomemben člen k moderni arhitekturi, le malokdo pa ve, da so pri gradnji poleg železa in stekla uporabili veliko količino lesa. The article {{presents}} the thorough {{analysis of the}} building which was built {{for the purposes of}} the first world exhibition in London, in 1851. It discusses the preparations for the exhibition, the competition of the projects, as well as different suggestions, the Paxton 2 ̆ 7 s proposal is explained and the construction process in Hyde Park as well. Special emphasis is given to the <b>in-lay</b> of wooden elements. In the article the thesis that the Crystal Palace is made of iron, glass and wood is definitely proved. "Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations" was opened on May 1, 1851 and was closed on October 15, 1851. Then the Crystal Palace was disassembled, to be reconstructed and open for the public in Sydenham, in 1854. Building of the Crystal Palace represents an important phase on the way to the modern architecture and in an architectural as well as constructional sense, though little is known that much wood was used in addition to iron and glass...|$|R
5000|$|Almost any design imaginable {{appears on}} a Charlie boot—oil derricks, animals, names, initials, logos, scenes, just about {{everything}} was sketched and worked into the upper and, less frequently, the lower foot. Charlie's signature design, dating to the pair he built [...] "on spec" [...] that Ernest Tubb bought, was the inlaid rose. It began, as did all of his creations, with a detailed sketch. He liked to work from life, so he used actual roses to inspire his design, and Charlie's immense artistic skill allowed the design to bloom. Drawing an intricate rose {{the size of a}} quarter is one thing; figuring how to create it out of leather, <b>in-lay</b> it in proportion on the boot, was quite another. So difficult and unique was this design, Charlie kept the process secret for decades, until he passed along the secrets to Miller.One client asked for bluebonnets to adorn his uppers, but Charlie hesitated because he didn't have one on hand to study. The client, a [...] "real honest man" [...] according to Charlie, soon showed up with the flower, a move that horrified him because he believed, as did most Texans, that it was illegal to pick the state flower! [...] "I have to use a real bluebonnet or rose as my model," [...] Charlie noted. [...] "The bluebonnets and Indian paintbrushes only bloom outside in the spring, but I have a source that will give them to me all year 'round. A color photograph just isn't enough to help me capture them on leather." [...] Whenever possible, Charlie, the artist, drew inspiration from the thing itself. Sometimes, however, he did not.|$|R

40|$|While we {{wait for}} {{intraoral}} scanners to gain more acceptance, impressions and models {{can be sent to}} laboratories right now for these new processes. Laborator-ies are equipped with devices that look something like a small oven. A model is mounted inside and then, using lasers, cameras, or “touch devices, ” the models are moved in a pattern that allows the scan-ners to digitally copy the forms. The dig-ital file is then sent to a computer, which creates the virtual model. Those readers who have used Invisalign ® (Align Tech-nology, Inc, Santa Clara, CA) are already familiar with this process. In the labora-tory world, Procera ® (Nobel Biocare, Yor-ba Linda, CA) (Figure 1 and Figure 2) {{was one of the first}} to use this technology. The scanner used is a probe that “feels ” around the preparation to develop the digital mo-del. In choosing a system for a laborato-ry, two things to consider are the detail and accuracy of the scanner. This of course will have a great impact on the final re-sult, much like the intraoral impression’s impact on the fit of a restoration. SOFTWARE The ideal situation is software that is “open,” in that it can import files from other sys-tems using standardized formats. For the technically oriented, these are ASCII, STL, and IGES. The software can be used to de-sign and construct crowns, bridges, <b>in-lays,</b> and implant restorations. In addition, there are modules to calculate the articu-lation as well as a system to create tele-scopic copings. The latter is intriguing as it is not always possible for the dentist to create a full arch of precisely parallel pre-parations. The computer can calculate, de-sign, and build the copings, which can be cemented to yield a well-seating bridge. Any laboratory technician who has had to wax up multiple telescopic copings with a hand-adjustable surveyor would wel-come this feature.
