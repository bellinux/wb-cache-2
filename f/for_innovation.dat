As well as reducing tax distortions, Kerr and Cramton (1998) note that auctions of units are more flexible in distributing costs, they provide more incentives <b>for</b> <b>innovation,</b> and they lessen the political arguments over the allocation of economic rents.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{of science}} {{differ in their}} views of the {{significance}} of the scientific accomplishments in the medieval Islamic world. The traditionalist view, exemplified by Bertrand Russell, holds that Islamic science, while admirable in many technical ways, lacked the intellectual energy required <b>for</b> <b>innovation</b> and was chiefly important for preserving ancient knowledge, and handing it on to medieval Europe. The revisionist view, exemplified by Abdus Salam, George Saliba and John M. Hobson holds that a Muslim scientific revolution occurred during the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Donald Routledge Hill and Ahmad Y Hassan argue that Islam was the driving force behind these scientific achievements.|$|E

5|$|The {{research}} {{showed that}} companies that considered design {{on a higher}} level of the ladder were constantly growing. Additionally, the Danish Design Centre published an Evaluation of the Importance of Design in 2006, with the result that most companies considered design as a promoter <b>for</b> <b>innovation</b> (71%), as a growth potential for the company (79%), and to make products more user friendly (71%). With increasing importance of design for the company, design management also becomes more important.|$|E
5|$|Universities are {{increasingly}} expected {{to exploit the}} intellectual property generated by their research activities and, in 2000, Bristol established the Research and Enterprise Division (RED) to further this cause (particularly for technology-based businesses). In 2001, the university signed a 25-year research funding deal with IP2IPO, an intellectual property commercialisation company. In 2007, research activities were expanded further {{with the opening of}} the Advanced Composites Centre <b>for</b> <b>Innovation</b> and Science (ACCIS) and The Bristol Institute for Public Affairs (BIPA).|$|E
5|$|Before {{the war he}} was put {{in charge}} of {{analyzing}} technical advances at home and abroad and his enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>innovation</b> earned him the nickname Armee Modernissimus ("the army modernization fanatic"). Model fought nearly all his battles in the northern and central parts of the Eastern Front; he was never tested on the steppes of southern Russia, where the open terrain would have made mobile warfare a more attractive proposition. Nevertheless, his defensive record indicated the value of his approach. At Rzhev, Orel, in Galicia and in Estonia he stymied opponents who expected to overwhelm him, and as late as November 1944, he gave the U.S. 12th Army Group a bloody nose in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest.|$|E

5|$|The Selfe family {{landed at}} Sydney's Semi-circular Quay in January 1855, when Norman was 15 years old. One {{of the reasons}} they emigrated to the colony of New South Wales was to enable him and his brother Harry to {{undertake}} engineering apprenticeships without having to pay the heavy premium required by large firms in London. They initially resided in the nearby Rocks district in a small house that had previously been the first Sydney home of Mary Reibey, a former convict who became Australia's first businesswoman. Selfe's parents had high expectations of their children, particularly of Norman, whose ability in mathematics and draughtsmanship was apparent from a young age. The brothers earned a reputation <b>for</b> <b>innovation</b> during their youth, and were the first to construct a velocipede in the country.|$|E
5|$|UND is {{classified}} by the Carnegie Foundation as a doctoral/research-intensive institution. This level of research activity {{is shown in}} UND's research statistics which, in fiscal year 2006, included program awards that reached $94.3 million, sponsored program expenditures that reached $81.2 million, and an overall research portfolio that included $315 million in total ongoing and committed accounts. Research activity at UND focuses on health sciences, nutrition, energy and environmental protection, aerospace, and engineering. As {{a major component of}} the Red River Valley Research Corridor, UND operates many research units including the Energy and Environmental Research Center, the School of Medicine, the Center for Rural Health, the Center <b>for</b> <b>Innovation,</b> the Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium, the Bureau of Governmental Affairs, the Bureau of Educational Services and Applied Research, and the Social Science Research Institute. The Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC), located on the eastern fringes of the UND campus, has been recognized as a leader in researching cleaner, more efficient forms of energy. The EERC operates a number of research units at UND including the National Center for Hydrogen Technology.|$|E

These processes, while having natural “homes” in business, academia, and government, respectively, may be replicated or substituted {{by the other}} spheres. In this model, innovation “evolves” through the selection preferences of agents: those focused on wealth creation select <b>for</b> <b>innovations</b> that promise a profit, actors focused on knowledge select <b>for</b> <b>innovations</b> that advance science, while actors focused on control select <b>for</b> <b>innovations</b> {{in line with the}} norms they seek to advance. 1 [...]...|$|R
