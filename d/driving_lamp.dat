2500|$|The {{respective}} {{purposes of}} {{front fog lamps}} and driving lamps are often confused, {{due in part to}} the misconception that fog lamps are necessarily selective yellow, while any auxiliary lamp that makes white light is a <b>driving</b> <b>lamp.</b> Automakers and aftermarket parts and accessories suppliers frequently refer interchangeably to [...] "fog lamps" [...] and [...] "driving lamps" [...] (or [...] "fog/driving lamps").|$|E
50|$|The TC.21/100 or Grey Lady {{announced}} 20 October 1953 {{came with}} a guarantee of a speed of 100 mph resulting from an improved exhaust system and an engine compression ratio raised from 7:1 to 8:1 {{to take advantage of}} the availability of better petrol. The final drive ratio was raised from 4.09:1 to 3.77:1. A paired front fog lamp and matching <b>driving</b> <b>lamp</b> became a standard fitting. The bonnet gained air scoops and wire wheels were fitted to try to enliven the car's image. A heater was fitted as standard but a radio remained an expensive option.|$|E
5000|$|The 1995 WS and onward models also {{featured}} a race-style braced swing-arm (in {{place of the}} asymmetrical 'banana' swing-arm found on the WP and WR models).Overall peak power (approx a measured 133 bhp at the rear wheel - which made the then enormous factory claims of 155 bhp, which many were sceptical of, at the crank perfectly credible) was unchanged but the torque curve on the bike was much improved.From the 1995 models weight fell back 221 kg (487 lbs) in the UK market.Some aerodynamic modifications were also introduced (most obviously narrowing the frontal area and reducing {{the size of the}} front fairing, the separate day time <b>driving</b> <b>lamp</b> disappeared and was incorporated into a new narrower twin headlamp cluster) ...|$|E

25|$|Many {{countries}} {{regulate the}} installation {{and use of}} <b>driving</b> <b>lamps.</b> For example, in Russia each vehicle may have {{no more than three}} pairs of lights including the original-equipment items, and in Paraguay auxiliary <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> must be off and covered with opaque material when the vehicle is circulating in urban areas.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} specification of the V8S included ½ hide leather interior, walnut trim, mohair hood, OZ alloy wheels, <b>driving</b> <b>lamps,</b> electric windows and door mirrors.|$|R

50|$|Another {{defining}} {{feature of}} the Shamal are its numerous headlamps in individual housings: outer round Carello low beams of the then-new projector type, inner rectangular high beams, combined turn signals and position lamps in the bumper, and two pairs of square lights in the lower grille—fog <b>lamps</b> and <b>driving</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Soul Burner was {{described}} as the 'bad boy' of Soul concepts. It included a solid roof panel and no roof rails, 245/40R19 tires, 4 bucket seats, and L-shaped day-light LED <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> around the outer edges. At the rear, two vertical exhaust pipes were placed at the extremes of the bumper.|$|R
50|$|Lamps and reflectors: Front, side, {{and rear}} turn signals; brake lights, {{front and rear}} {{position}} lights, hazard warning lights, rear reflectors, low and high beam headlamps are all required. Sidemarker reflectors and lights and fog and <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> are permitted. All devices must function correctly and emit or reflect the required colours of light.|$|R
50|$|The Diablo VT Roadster was {{introduced}} in December 1995 and featured an electrically operated carbon fiber targa top which was stored above the engine lid when not in use. Besides the roof, the roadster's body was altered from the fixed-top VT model {{in a number of}} ways. The front bumper was revised, replacing the quad rectangular <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> with two rectangular and two round units.The brake cooling ducts were moved inboard of the <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> and changed to a straked design, while the rear ducts featured the vertical painted design seen on the SE30.The engine lid was changed substantially in order to vent properly when the roof panel was covering it. The roadster also featured revised 17 inch wheels. The air intakes on top/sides were made larger than the coupe Diablos.In 1998 the wheels have been updated to 18 inches, and the engine power raised to 530 HP by adding the variable valve timing system. Top speed specification was raised to 335 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Other {{improvements}} debuting on the VT included front air intakes {{below the}} <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> to improve brake cooling, larger intakes {{in the rear}} arches, a more ergonomic interior with a revised electronically adjustable dampers, four-piston brake calipers, power steering, and minor engine refinements. Many of these improvements, save the four-wheel drive system, soon transferred to the base Diablo, making the cars visually nearly identical.|$|R
5000|$|From a {{price of}} $6000-$7250 for the S1, the Excalibur SII went up to $12,000 -$13,000 but {{justified}} that extra cost with its supplementary equipment. This included air conditioning, variable ratio power steering, adjustable steering column, servoed brakes, [...] "Positraction" [...] differential, chromed wire wheels, stereo radio, two spare tires mounted in the front fenders, <b>driving</b> <b>lamps,</b> air horns and constant level rear shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|In 1969, {{the front}} was {{modified}} slightly, making the <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> smaller {{and changing the}} shape of the turn signals. The rear turn signals were enlarged at the same time, and some alterations were made to modernise the interior. The last few vehicles were fitted with air conditioning and had automatic transmission as an option. These cars had an additional scoop fitted underneath the grille to supply air to the A/C unit.|$|R

Their product range includes bulb and light-emitting diode lighting - LED lamps, headlamps, lightbars, beacons, direction indicators, HID lighting, interior lamps, number plate lamps, rear and combination lamps, stalk lamps, plus working and <b>driving</b> <b>lamps.</b> As well as this they provide reversing aids, object detection Systems, reflectors (retroreflectors), air horns and modular harnesses.|$|R
50|$|Wipac is a British {{automotive}} {{engineering company}} based in Buckingham. The company resulted from a merger in 1941 of the British subsidiary of the American Witherbee Igniter Company (Wico) and British spark plug manufacturer Pacy to become the Wico-Pacy in Bletchley before eventually becoming the Wipac brand which became {{well known in the}} UK for car and motorbike accessories including <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> and windscreen wiper blades. Wipac moved to Buckingham in 1959 with 500 employees.|$|R
50|$|The 90 {{continued}} in production renamed 90 MK II {{with a new}} chassis and independent front suspension. The headlamps were raised by three inches to meet American regulations and the front <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> were replaced {{with a pair of}} small air intake grilles. The 90 MK II also had an enlarged OHV engine with 2267 cc. The MK IIA arrived in 1952, the main update on this model was the removal of the rear wheel spats.|$|R

50|$|The 2000GT {{design is}} widely {{considered}} a classic among 1960s gran turismos. Nozaki's bodywork {{was inspired by the}} E-type Jaguar. Its smoothly flowing bodywork was executed in aluminium and featured pop-up headlights above large plexiglass covered <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> flanking the grille similar to those on the Toyota Sports 800. Bumpers were minimal, and the car was extremely low, just 116 cm (45.7 in) to the highest point of the roof. Despite a custom open-top version built for the James Bond film You Only Live Twice, a factory-produced convertible was never offered.|$|R

5000|$|The new XC6 {{carburetor}} engine {{fitted with}} increased power of [...] SAE, [...] net. The engine bearings benefitted from improved shells. Rear anti roll bar fitted. New dashboard with three round dials, steering wheel {{is no longer}} adjustable. The spare wheel is relocated from inside the boot to under rear of the car. The rear valance is amended (Saloon only) and {{the capacity of the}} petrol tank is increased from 50 to 55 litres (saloon). Cigarette lighter fitted on all models, Super Luxe has automatic light on lockable glovebox. The front of coupés and convertibles is redesigned, incorporating a new grille with integral <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> and rectangular indicator clusters. The convertible hood now has a [...] "Panoramic" [...] rear window and the seat mechanism is improved for better accessibility.|$|R
50|$|The rotors {{first used}} were wound as sixteen axial bobbins, one per pole. Compared to the bipolar dynamo, this {{did have the}} {{advantage}} of more poles giving a smoother output per rotation, which was an advantage when <b>driving</b> arc <b>lamps.</b> Magnetos thus established a small niche for themselves as lighting generators.|$|R
50|$|On October 21, 2015, Toyota and Universal Pictures {{celebrated the}} 30th {{anniversary of the}} Back to the Future film series with a Toyota Tacoma Concept that was {{inspired}} by the original 1985 pickup that Toyota created for the 1985 film. The 2016 Tacoma 4WD was recreated using the same features and black color paint trim, KC HiLite <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> (modified with LED lighting), modified headlights and taillights (matching the 1985 version), the Toyota badging to the truck's tailgate, as well as the same D-4S fuel injection, and the 1985-inspired mudflaps. The only difference between the 1985 original and the 2016 concept is the tires: Goodyear was featured in the 1985 film, while BF Goodrich is used on the concept. Toyota notes that this is a one-off concept as there are no plans to offer it as a package or level trim.|$|R
5000|$|For 2015, the {{standard}} components of each RS model include new {{front and rear}} fascias, new grillework, <b>driving</b> <b>lamps,</b> side-sill extensions, a rear spoiler, embroidered floor mats. Stage 1 vehicles also have a performance exhaust system, while Stage 2 cars {{get all of the}} above plus a set of five-spoke 20-inch “Quicksilver” wheels and Cooper RS3 performance tires. (The rolling stock is available as an upgrade on the other two models.) Optional on all are a hood scoop, window scoops, billet pedals, a ball shifter, Roush gauges, and Roush doorsill plates. Stage 1 and Stage 2 models can also be upgraded with a reverse-sensing system and active exhaust. RS upgrades start at $4495, while the RS1 modifications add $5895 to the bottom line, and RS2 models will set you back $8495, plus the cost of the new Mustang.|$|R
5000|$|XS and SX: 1580cc XU5, three door {{version was}} {{designated}} XS {{and the five}} door version SX. Marketed as a sporty model, to complement the GTI, with the [...] XU5 injection engine. Was a little more basic than the SR models, to enhance the sporty feel, and made do without such things as luxury seats, instead having the tweed sports seats from the Peugeot 205 XS. It also came with opening rear windows (3-door), a digital clock, a black spoiler (painted spoiler from the GTI after the face-lift), <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> and a load area lamp. Options included alloy wheels, central locking/electric windows (only available as a twinned options pack), a sliding glass sunroof and front fog lights. The 309 XS is now very rare in the UK. The SX model was not available in the United Kingdom.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} dimming {{method for}} fluorescent lamps {{consists of a}} wall unit and a light unit connected by two wires only.

50|$|Available in both Coupé and Cabriolet forms, styling {{refreshed}} with restyled and body-coloured bumpers, {{similar to}} the 328 with more integrated indicators and <b>driving</b> <b>lamps,</b> and new alloy wheels with a more rounded face. The 3.2 also boasted a major interior update, with a more ergonomic layout and a more rounded instrument binnacle. Later cars, from 1987 onwards, also sported ABS brakes. Fuel injection remained the primarily mechanical Bosch K-Jetronic (CIS) with an O2 sensor in the exhaust providing feedback to a simple computer for mixture trimming via a pulse modulated frequency valve that regulated control fuel pressure. The ignition system was Marelli Microplex, with electronic advance control and one distributor per bank of the V8. The 1988 Mondial 3.2 would be the final model year that retained the relatively low maintenance costs of the 308/328 drivetrain, allowing major service items like timing belt and clutch replacement performed with the engine/transmission package still in the car.|$|R
50|$|In 1977, {{the car was}} for {{the first}} time officially badged as Chrysler-Simca in {{continental}} Europe (the Simca badge appeared on the bootlid, while the stylized Chrysler plate continued to adorn the front end). The individual models were renamed to be in line with the newly launched Simca 1307/1308 series. While the first two digits in this model naming system stood for the base engine's displacement (1.6 in case of the Chrysler 160), the latter two represented the French fiscal class in which the car slotted. Thus, the 1.6-powered model became the Chrysler-Simca 1609, as it fitted in the French 9 CV tax band (even though this model actually was cancelled from the French market lineup), and the 1.8, slotting one class higher, became the Chrysler-Simca 1610, and was fitted with the vinyl roof and extra <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> from the 2.0-litre model. However, in the UK, where only the 180 was on offer, it retained its name. To add to the confusion, the 2.0-litre retained its name in all markets.|$|R
5000|$|Toyota and Universal Pictures {{celebrated the}} 30th {{anniversary of the}} film series with a Toyota Tacoma Concept that was {{inspired}} by the original 1985 pickup that Toyota created for the 1985 film. The 2016 Tacoma 4WD was recreated using the same features and black color paint trim, KC HiLite <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> (modified with LED lighting), modified headlights and taillights (matching the 1985 version), the Toyota badging to the truck's tailgate, as well as the same D-4S fuel injection, the 1985-inspired mudflaps, and customized license plates matching the 2015 vehicles in Part II. The only difference between the 1985 original and the 2016 concept is the tires: Goodyear was featured in the 1985 film, while BF Goodrich is used on the concept. Toyota notes that this is a one-off concept as there are no plans to offer it as a package or level trim. Toyota also produced a promotional video starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd and featuring many of the locations depicted in the film series, wherein the Delorean's Mr. Fusion is used as a comparison for Toyota's hydrogen powered Mirai.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1995 model year, {{the first}} year the Outback was introduced, the Outback was a trim package on the base model Legacy wagon [...] "L", that {{primarily}} consisted of the heavy cloth interior, berber carpet floor mats, a luggage rack and fog lights with a standard height suspension. This approach was also used on the smaller Impreza wagon, with the name Outback Sport. When the 1996 model year arrived, it gained more aggressive appearing front bumper covers, with larger rallye inspired <b>driving</b> <b>lamps</b> replacing the previously installed fog lights, taller tires with more aggressive tread, and a 7.8 in ground clearance, with a 7.87 in ground clearance in Japan. The more aggressive appearance was also used on the smaller Outback Sport while omitting the increase in ground clearance from suspension modification. This approach {{was inspired by the}} Legacy having been entered into international rallying and long distance racing events, and winning the 1990 Safari Rally in the Group N category. In 1997, the Outback received the hoodscoop installed in the engine hood (bonnet) without installing an innercooler, commonly used in conjunction with a turbocharger.|$|R
50|$|The Diablo GT was noticeably {{different}} on the exterior. While previous Diablo models had differed one from another with subtle fascia refinements or {{changes in the}} brake cooling ducts, the Diablo GT opted for an all new black carbon fiber front air dam with large brake ducts and a central vent for the oil cooler (the car still featured <b>driving</b> <b>lamps,</b> the single pair of round units featured on the Diablo VT Roadster). In the front luggage compartment lid, a large air extractor was added, while the small corner vents on the front fenders were changed to NACA style ducts. The fenders themselves were widened to accommodate a wider front track. In the rear, the bumper and its lamps were removed entirely, replaced by a carbon fiber diffuser that forced the fog and backup lamps into the outer pair of tail lamps, and shielded a pair of large center-mounted exhaust pipes. The engine lid featured a large central ram air duct protruding above the roof; a rear spoiler was standard equipment. This radical new body was composed mostly of carbon fiber, with the steel roof and aluminum doors being the only components to retain their standard material. Special 3-piece OZ wheels finished the GT's exterior package.|$|R
25|$|The H1 lamp was {{the first}} tungsten-halogen {{headlamp}} light source. It was introduced in 1962 by a consortium of European bulb and headlamp makers. This bulb has a single axial filament that consumes 55 watts at 12.0 volts, and produces 1550 lumens ±15% when operated at 13.2V. H2 (55W @ 12.0V, 1820lm @ 13.2V) followed in 1964, and the transverse-filament H3 (55W @ 12.0V, 1450lm ±15%) in 1966. H1 still sees wide use in low beams, high beams and auxiliary fog and <b>driving</b> <b>lamps,</b> as does H3. The H2 {{is no longer a}} current type, since it requires an intricate bulb holder interface to the lamp, has a short life and is difficult to handle. For those reasons, H2 was withdrawn from ECE Regulation 37 for use in new lamp designs (though H2 bulbs are still manufactured for replacement purposes in existing lamps), but H1 and H3 remain current and these two bulbs were legalised in the United States in 1993. More recent single-filament bulb designs include the H7 (55W @ 12.0V, 1500lm ±10% @ 13.2V), H8 (35W @ 12.0V, 800lm ±15% @ 13.2V), H9 (65W @ 12.0V, 2100lm ±10% @ 13.2V), and H11 (55W @ 12.0V, 1350lm ±10% @ 13.2V). 24-volt versions of many bulb types are available for use in trucks, buses, and other commercial and military vehicles.|$|R
40|$|Recently, 2 -dimensional flat light {{sources have}} been {{attracting}} much attention {{for its use}} in LCD backlight applications because of its high luminous efficiency and uniformity. A long-gap discharge, mercury-free flat fluorescent lamp has been developed, which shows a high brightness (> 5000 cd/m 2) and high luminous efficacy (60 lm/W). Additionally, it has a wide operating margin and stable driving condition {{with the aid of}} an auxiliary electrode. For <b>driving</b> the <b>lamp,</b> a narrow pulse power to maintain the glow discharge state is required. Since there has been no research for this kind of <b>lamp</b> <b>driving,</b> this paper proposes a newly developed short-pulse, high-voltage lamp-driving scheme. The proposed lamp system uses a ballast with a coupled-inductor in order to raise the short pulse voltage up to the lamp ignition level and to obtain energy-recovery action during the glow discharge mode. The operation principles are presented and also the system performances such as the lighting efficiency, spatial and angular uniformities are evaluated by hardware experiments. The results show that the proposed lighting system is a good candidate for the next-generation of LCD backlight systems...|$|R
