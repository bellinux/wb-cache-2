40|$|Equal pay {{is an area}} of {{employment}} law that is complex and not easily understood. This complexity is recognised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which notes that equal pay for work of equal value has proved to be difficult to understand, both with regard to what it entails and in its application. Amendments have been made to the Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998 (EEA) to include a specific provision to regulate equal pay claims in the form of section 6 (4) -(5) of the EEA. The amendments were made in terms of the Employment Equity Amendment Act 47 of 2013, which came into effect on 1 August 2014 by presidential proclamation. Prior to section 6 (4), the EEA did not contain a specific provision regulating equal pay claims. Claims could be brought in terms of section 6 (1) of the EEA, which prohibits unfair discrimination on a number of grounds. The recent amendments to the EEA in the form of section 6 (4) -(5) (including the Employment Equity Regulations and the Code of Good Practice on Equal Pay for Work of Equal Value) in respect of equal pay claims is a response to the ILO's criticism of South Africa's failure to include specific equal pay provisions in the <b>EEA.</b> <b>Section</b> 6 (4) of the EEA provides for three causes of action in respect of equal pay. They are as follows: (a) equal pay for the same work; (b) equal pay for substantially the same work; and (c) equal pay for work of equal value. The first two causes of action are not difficult to understand as opposed to the third cause of action, which is complex. The ILO has recognised the complexity of the third cause of action, "equal pay for work of equal value". In Mangena v Fila South Africa 2009 12 BLLR 1224 (LC), the Labour Court remarked {{in the context of an}} equal pay for work of equal value claim that it does not have expertise in job grading and in the allocation of value to particular occupations. This article will deal with the third cause of action only, "equal pay for work of equal value". The purpose of this article is to critically analyse the law relating to equal pay for work of equal value in terms of the EEA (including the Employment Equity Regulations) and evaluate it against the equal pay laws of the ILO and the United Kingdom, which deal with equal pay for work of equal value. Lastly, this article seeks to ascertain whether the EEA (including the Employment Equity Regulations) provides an adequate legal framework for determining an equal pay for work of equal value claim. ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades our courts have become {{inundated}} with cases relating to sexual harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment has become a major problem in the workplace hence the decision by parliament and our courts to implement policies in the workplace to try and curb the problem. The effects of sexual harassment on a victims’ job and career can be profound. It has been proven that many employees simply decide to leave their jobs or to request a transfer than to endure the harassment until they are psychologically destroyed by the embarrassing situation. The Employment Equity Act explicitly in section 6 prohibits unfair discrimination in very specific terms. It states that no person may unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against an employee in an employment policy or practice on {{one or more of the}} grounds listed in section 6. Section 6 (3) further states that harassment of an employee is a form of discrimination where the harassment is based on any one or more of the grounds listed in section 6 (1) which includes sexual harassment. Section 60 deals with the liability of employees for the conduct of their employees committed whilst the employees are at work, where such conduct contravenes the provisions of the EEA. If the conduct is brought to the attention of the employer he or she is obliged to take the necessary steps to eliminate the alleged conduct and to comply with the provisions of the <b>EEA.</b> <b>Section</b> 60 (3) renders an employee vicariously liable for the conduct of an employee who contravenes the provisions of the EEA. An employee who cannot prove that reasonable steps were taken to ensure that the provisions of the EEA are not contravened will be held liable for the actions or their employees. An employer who can prove that reasonable steps were taken will not be held liable for the actions of the employee. The provisions of the EEA were applied in the case of Ntsabo v Real Security wherein an employee had been sexually harassed over a period of six months by a fellow employee. The employee had reported the incidents of sexual harassment to the corporation she was employed with which failed to take action against the senior employee. Instead of taking action the corporation moved her to a different work station and placed her on night shift. This gave her the impression that she was being punished for the deed of the senior employee which resulted in her resigning from the corporation and instituting a claim for constructive dismissal and damages for sexual harassment. The court found that she had been constructively dismissed and that the senior employee had contravened section 6 (3) of the EEA. The court further held that the employer (corporation) was also liable for the conduct of the senior employee in contravening the Act. In terms of the doctrine of vicarious liability on the other an employer may be held vicariously liable for the actions of its employees committed during the course and scope of their employment. The test for vicarious liability is therefore whether at the time of the alleged act of sexual harassment the employee was acting within the course and scope of his employment. The doctrine came before the court in the case of Grobler v Naspers. In this case Grobler who was employed at Naspers alleged that has had been sexually harassed by her immediate supervisor Mr Samuels. Samuels acted as trainee manager for seven months. Grobler suffered a mental breakdown as a result of the harassment and contented that she was no longer fit to work. She approached the High court for relief and alleged that Naspers (employer) was vicariously liable for the actions of Mr Samuels and the damages she suffered. In Naspers the court had to decide whether Samuels was indeed responsible for Grobler’s condition and if so whether Naspers were vicariously liable for his actions. In coming to its decision various cases were cited by the court as authority that recognised underlying policy considerations of vicarious liability. This included considerations that the employer is in a better position to pay compensation than the employee and to render the employer liable, serves as a deterrent against similar conduct in the future. The court also remarked that the common law courts acknowledge that the evolution of the doctrine continues to be guided by policy. The court ruled that policy considerations justified the finding that Naspers was vicariously liable for the sexual harassment of Grobler. It held further that both Naspers and Samuels were jointly and severally liable for the compensation to be paid. The Code of Good Practice on the Handling of Sexual Harassment Cases which was published as an annexure to the Labour Relations Act was implemented in an attempt to eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace, to provide appropriate procedures to deal with the problem and to prevent its occurrence and to promote and to encourage the development and implementation of policies and procedures which will assist in creating workplaces free from sexual harassment. The cases quoted above demonstrate the different approaches adopted by the courts in seeking to grant relief to victims of sexual harassment. It is clear that policies and procedures should be in place in the workplace that will ensure that employers are not held liable for the actions of their employees committed during the course and scope of employment. The same can however not be said when there are no policies and procedures in place in the workplace...|$|E

30|$|In their 1992 book “The adapted mind,” Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby (1992) popularized {{the term}} {{evolutionary}} psychology. They {{argued that the}} human mind contains psychological mechanisms (e.g., for mate preferences, cheater detection, leadership, status) that emerged because they enabled humans to solve different adaptive problems in the environments in which humans evolved (the <b>EEA,</b> see next <b>section</b> “Assumptions”). This book {{formed the basis for}} evolutionary psychology as a scientific field that has since made inroads in all fields of psychology, from social to cognitive and from developmental to industrial/organizational psychology. This would have been much to the delight of Charles Darwin himself who wrote: “In the distant future, I see open fields for more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation.” Nowadays, evolutionary psychology is not only recognized for its role in unifying psychology as a scientific discipline and for generating many novel hypotheses. It is also recognized for its applied contributions to other fields, such as law, medicine, political science, marketing, leadership, management, and organizational sciences (e.g., Colarelli and Arvey, 2015; Saad, 2011; Van Vugt and Ahuja, 2010).|$|R
40|$|Om onbillike diskriminasie in die werkplek te bewys, behels verskeie stappe. Ten eerste moet daar ŉ oortuigende grond of rede aangevoer word, dan moet spesifieke negatiewe praktyke of optredes bewys word en ten slotte moet die nadelige gevolge van die beweerde diskriminasie gewigtig genoeg wees om diskriminasie daar te stel. Diskriminasie is voorheen as ŉ onderafdeling van onbillike arbeidspraktyke gesien. Mettertyd het die wetgewer hierdie terme van mekaar begin onderskei en in aparte wette gekodifiseer. Diskriminasie wat tot ontslag lei, word in die Wet op Arbeidsverhoudinge (WAV) van 1995 as ŉ subtipe van outomatiese onbillike ontslag (artikel 197) omskryf. Die onbillike optrede van die werkgewer teenoor ŉ werknemer wat nog in diens is en soms diskriminasie kan insluit, word in die Wet op Gelyke Indiensneming (WGI) as onbillike diskriminasie verbied (artikel 6). Hierdie artikel verken in die eerste plek die geskiedenis oor die wyse waarop onbillike diskriminasie ŉ selfstandige eisoorsaak geword het. Die aard van die gelyste en sogenaamde arbitrêre gronde en die verskil tussen hulle het heelwat bespreking uitgelok en is die tweede fokus van hierdie ondersoek. Die ietwat gebrekkige artikel 11 van die Wet op Gelyke Indiensneming (soos in 1998) kom ook onder die loep. ŉ Derde fokus is die bewyslas in sodanige dispute. Die rol van die Internasionale Arbeidsorganisasie se Konvensie 111 word ondersoek en invloedryke beslissings van die howe word ook bespreek. Daar word krities gevra of ŉ bewese grond in alle gevalle ŉ noodsaaklike vereiste moet wees om diskriminasie te bewys. Ten slotte word gekyk na die waarde wat die wysigings, soos vervat in die Wysigingswet op Gelyke Indiensneming (Januarie 2014), kan toevoeg en word enkele ander voorstelle gemaak wat implementering met die oog op toekomstige beslegting van dispute kan fasiliteer. From {{the title}} of the article three main topics emerge: unfair discrimination, {{arbitrary}} grounds and the burden of proof. Unfair discrimination is a sensitive topic in South Africa. Over decades it was a priority of the legislator to counteract unfair discrimination in the work place. It entails a long, yet fascinating history. The saga is not yet completed, inter alia {{in the light of the}} amendments introduced by the Employment Equity Amendment Act which was signed into statute by the State President in January 2014. Discrimination was previously seen a subspecies of unfair labour practices. The first aim of this article is to relate the history of how the legislator separated unfair discrimination from the bigger umbrella term of unfair labour practices and gave it an independent standing in two statutes. It is now associated with either dismissal or conduct by the employer where an employment relationship still exists. Discrimination which is followed by dismissal is proscribed in the Labour Relations Act (the LRA) of 1995 as automatic unfair dismissal (section 197). Unfair discrimination towards an employee who is still working for an employer is prohibited in the Employment Equity Act (the <b>EEA)</b> of 1998 (<b>section</b> 6). To succeed with a claim for unfair discrimination in the work place three steps are indicated. Firstly an acceptable ground or reason must be alleged, then specific detrimental practices or conduct by the employer must be disclosed and lastly the negative impact on the employee must be forceful enough to be deemed as unfair discrimination. The respondent has the opportunity to rebut the assertion that the alleged discrimination was fair. Although unfair discrimination has been established as an independent cause of action in both the LRA and the EEA, some problems arose in deciding these disputes in court. Much uncertainty surrounds the role and nature of the listed and so called arbitrary grounds for discrimination and the difference between the two. This is the second focus of this article. Debate ensued with regard to the sustainability of the arbitrary grounds, also called the unspecified or unlisted grounds for discrimination and how the court must decide on these grounds. This article examines the source, role, nature and validity of arbitrary grounds and how they differ from the listed grounds. Finally the burden of proof in these matters is also considered. It seems that the burden of proof in the case of listed grounds should differ from that of arbitrary grounds, judging from the amendments already passed in parliament. The discussion mostly follows chronology, but sometimes deviates from this to compare and contrast certain legal opinions. The role of Convention 111 of the International Labour Organization is also re-examined and the conclusion is that the courts should again take proper notice of it. Important decisions of the courts are discussed as well as the amendments made to the labour acts to curb the problems experienced in jurisprudence. The somewhat inadequate section 11 of the EEA (as in 1998) is scrutinized. The prerequisite that an acceptable ground for discrimination must be proven to establish discrimination is specifically challenged. The possible value added by the amendments affected in the Employment Equity Amendment Act of 2014 is looked into and lastly some recommendations are made to facilitate the implementation of these amendments with the view to future dispute resolution.
