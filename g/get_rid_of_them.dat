5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by toad, that usually kill the cane toad's predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce the cane toad population. One way of doing this is by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants aggression, workers will pour out of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc {{objected to}} the use of his troops in the attack on Royan in April 1945. As a result, only part of 2e DB was employed. The {{division}} rejoined Seventh Army, crossing the Rhine on 25 April, and joining the pursuit into Bavaria. Leclerc visited Dachau concentration camp after its liberation by the Americans. In an incident that took place 8 May 1945 at Bad Reichenhall in Bavaria, he was presented with a defiant group of captured Frenchmen of the SS Charlemagne Division. He asked them why they wore a German uniform, to which one of them replied by asking why Leclerc wore an American one. Leclerc told his men to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> That was taken as a death sentence. The group of French Waffen-SS men was summarily executed by the RMT without any form of military tribunal procedure, and their bodies left where they fell until an American burial team collected them. For his services leading the 2e DB, Leclerc was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour.|$|E

A small sealed packet of cocaine drops to the ground. A shocked Rossakoff loudly proclaims her innocence and Poirot says he believes her – the true criminal is Alice who is in league with Verasco. She carried the drugs in her large skirt pockets and dropped them into her clients' pockets on the dance floor. When the raid occurred and the lights went out temporarily, Poirot was waiting by Cerberus and heard her put the packet in the dog's mouth – and Poirot took the opportunity to cut off a sample of cloth from her sleeve as proof.|$|E

Radiologist Mortimer Hartman began treating him with LSD in the late 1950s, with Grant optimistic that the treatment could make him feel better about himself and rid of all of his inner turmoil stemming from his childhood and his failed relationships. He had an estimated 100 sessions over several years. For a long time, Grant viewed the drug positively, and stated that it was the solution after many years of [...] "searching for his peace of mind", and that for {{first time in his life}} he was [...] "truly, deeply and honestly happy".

500|$|Japan's {{sentiment}} regarding {{indigenous peoples}} was crafted around {{the memory of}} the Mudan Incident, when, in 1871, a group of 54 shipwrecked Ryūkyūan sailors was massacred by a Paiwan group from the village of Mudan in southern Taiwan. The resulting Japanese policy, published twenty years before the onset of their rule on Taiwan, cast Taiwanese aborigines as [...] "vicious, violent and cruel" [...] and concluded [...] "this is a pitfall of the world; we must <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> all".

In the Wushe Incident of 1930, for example, a Seediq group was decimated by artillery and supplanted by the Taroko (Truku), which had sustained periods of bombardment from naval ships and airplanes dropping mustard gas. A quarantine was placed around the mountain areas enforced by armed guard stations and electrified fences until the most remote high mountain villages could be relocated closer to administrative control.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Caligari is told abstractly, like a fairy tale, and {{includes}} little description about or attention toward the psychological motivations of the characters, {{which is more}} heavily emphasized in the film's visual style. The original script shows few traces of the Expressionist influence prevalent in the film's sets and costumes. Through film director Fritz Lang, Janowitz and Mayer met with Erich Pommer, head of production at the Decla-Bioscop film studio, on 19 April 1919, to discuss selling the script. According to Pommer, he attempted to <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> but they persisted until he agreed to meet with them. Pommer reportedly asked the writers to leave the script with him, but they refused, and instead Mayer read it aloud to him. Pommer and his assistant, Julius Sternheim, were so impressed that he refused to let them leave until a contract was signed, and he purchased the script from them that night. The writers had originally sought no fewer than 10,000 marks, but were given 3,500, {{with the promise of}} another 2,000 once the film went into production and 500 if it was sold for foreign release, which the producers considered unlikely. The contract, today preserved at Berlin's Bundesfilmarchiv, gave Pommer the right to make any changes to the script deemed appropriate. Pommer said he was drawn to the script because he believed it could be filmed inexpensively, and it bore similarities to films inspired by the macabre horror shows of the Grand Guignol theatre in Paris, which were popular at the time. Pommer later said: [...] "They saw in the script an 'experiment'. I saw a relatively cheap film".|$|E
