40|$|The {{performance}} metrics of airflow, sound, and {{combustion product}} capture efficiency (CE) were measured for {{a convenience sample}} of fifteen cooking exhaust devices, as installed in residences. Results were analyzed to quantify the impact of various device- and installation-dependent parameters on CE. Measured maximum airflows were 70 % or lower than values noted on product literature for 10 of the devices. Above-the-cooktop devices with flat bottom surfaces (no capture hood) – including exhaust fan/microwave combination appliances – were found to have much lower CE at similar flow rates, compared to devices with capture hoods. For almost all exhaust devices and especially for rear-mounted downdraft exhaust and microwaves, CE was substantially higher for back compared with front burner use. Flow rate, {{and the extent to which}} the <b>exhaust</b> <b>device</b> extends over the burners that are in use, also had a large effect on CE. A flow rate of 95 liters per second (200 cubic feet per minute) was necessary, but not sufficient, to attain capture efficiency in excess of 75 % for the front burners.

In this work, an experimental research activity was carried out to investigate {{the influence of the}} different combustion phases on the cycle-to-cycle variation. In particular the flame kernel development and the fuel deposits burning were investigated by in-cylinder pressure measurements and optical investigations. Engine cycle resolved visualization was applied to characterize the spatial evolution of the flame front from the spark ignition until the exhaust phase. A numerical custom post-detection procedure was used to correlate the optical data with the pressure related parameters during the combustion process. The simultaneous use of optical diagnostics and pressure related analysis demonstrated the fundamental role of the first stage and late phase of the combustion on the spark ignition engine process. Flame kernel and diffusion controlled flame due to fuel deposits burning dominated the cyclic variability of in-cylinder combustion.

40|$|Mixing and {{displacement}} ventilation {{are common}} systems in commercial buildings, while mixing ventilation {{is used in}} residential buildings. Displacement ventilation provides fresh air to the occupied zone in a more efficient way than mixing ventilation {{but it is important}} to know how well it works with a floor system for heating or cooling. Can, for example, a floor heating system warm up the supply air too fast and destroy the displacement effect? Will floor cooling, combined with displacement ventilation, result in too high a vertical temperature difference and too low a temperature at feet level? The required amount of ventilation depends on the ventilation effectiveness. In standards, the recommended values for ventilation effectiveness depend on the position of the supply and <b>exhaust</b> <b>device</b> and on the difference between supply and room air temperature. Among others, for warm air heating the ventilation effectiveness is always less than 1 and can be as low as 0. 4. This would then require an increased amount of ventilation. A combination of floor heating/cooling, radiators, air cooling, displacement ventilation, mixed ventilation and different combinations of supply and return grilles have, in this study, been experimentally tested. The studies on a displacement ventilation system show lower vertical air temperature differences and higher ventilation effectiveness when it is combined with a floor heating system. With floor cooling, the displacement ventilation system should be designed with a higher supply air temperature. Furthermore, the buoyancy flows from warm or cold windows and occupants influence the airflow pattern and increase the mixing of supply air into the occupied zone...|$|E
40|$|In {{many modern}} {{building}}s, using large glazed {{areas in the}} building envelope, the solar heat load needs to be limited. To do this without disturbing the architectural display of the building, internal solar shading is often the only alternative. However, using internal solar shading means {{a great part of}} the incoming solar load still ends up inside the building, causing an often large heat load. To decrease this problem, one solution is to put exhaust ventilation close to the windows or even connected to the cavities between solar screen and window. The purpose of this is to extract the heated air before it mixes with the air further inside the room. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the possibilities to reduce the g-value of a window and solar screen by using the exhaust ventilation. The aim is to find a reduction factor of the g-value, applicable for these ventilated windows. By changing many design parameters, the aim is to see what parameters affect the efficiency of the system. The study is performed by creating a numerical model in COMSOL Multiphysics. The heat transfer and air movements around the screen and window are simulated. The study shows it is difficult to find a general reduction to the g-value by applying ventilation to the cavity. The efficiency of the system depends on numerous parameters. It is first and foremost dependent on exhaust flow but other parameters matter as well.

40|$|The present thesis aims {{to study}} the effect of human {{movements}} on local exhaust ventilation. In its simplest terms, local exhaust ventilation is a system which has the function of extracting contaminated air situated close to the contaminant source, protecting a working person from exposure to hazardous substances by containing or capturing them locally, at the emission point. As an important security measure referred to terms of health, it is crucial for the healthiness of workers to control and prevent them from the exposure to vapour, mist, dust or other airborne contaminants. Additionally, {{to a lesser degree}} of significance, it can be stressed an expected increase in worker performance due to an improvement of the working conditions. There is an existing necessity for well-defined and appropriate methods to test the performance of local exhaust devices in order to reach standard efficiency values. The lack of an international standardization led to the realization of this study, which, ultimately, has the purpose of obtaining relevant results that can be utilized for future normalized test procedures. The study entails full scale experimental measurements that include air velocity measurements in 3 dimensions, a local exhaust ventilation device with circular hood and a flat flanged plate and a controlled generation of air turbulence through physical movements of a human-sized cylinder, simulating a walking person. The present study extends previous similar studies at the University of Gävle, where the controlled air turbulence was generated by a moving plate. After meaningful results obtained in that study, one of the considerations was to better simulate a walking person, by replacing the plate for a movable cylinder. The present study points at a larger similarity occurring with a cylinder than with a plate, as regards the air flow pattern produced by a real walking person. As in the previous study, the Percentage of Negative Velocities, PNV, has been used as the main measure of turbulence induced risk of contaminant spread. The PNV represents the fraction of the time when the flow is directed opposite to the suction air stream in front of the local exhaust hood. The obtained results conclude that the use of the cylinder as a moving object has been an improvement to simulate the effect of the movement of a human being on a relaxed walking pace. The present study was carried out in parallel with the thesis work by Leyre Catalán Ros, which complements this study by analyzing the effect of an added heated dummy, simulating a person seated in front of the local <b>exhaust</b> <b>device...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} aimed at {{considering}} the aircraft engine conversion into peak or short-used energy unit, which is relevant for the task of developing the northern regions of the Russian Federation. The three-shaft turbojet engine with a twelve-stage compressor and a four-stage turbine is adopted as an aircraft engine under consideration. The afterburner with a block of jet nozzles {{is removed from the}} gas generator module, and a heating chamber is set at the outlet of the by-pass duct to raise electric power of engine and not complicate the construction by the presence of a mixing chamber. In addition, the heating chamber serves to equalize the total pressure and flow temperature in the section before the free turbine and allows the use of a short adapter between the gas generator module and the free turbine, which reduces the loss of total pressure. Then a free turbine and a diffuser with an <b>exhaust</b> <b>device</b> are installed. The output shaft of the power turbine is connected by means of a coupling to an alternating current (a. c.) generator or other special load. To find the parameters of the plant, a calculation was made in which the initial data were taken, namely a gas temperature in front of the turbine of 1530 K (the gas temperature in front of the turbine is reduced by 100 K in order to prolong the engine life; therefore, the gas temperature before the turbine was 1630 K); air flow of 364 kg/s; bypass ratio of 1. 36 (the ratio of the air flow passing through the bypass duct to the air flow entering the core). As a result, it consumes 0. 296 kg / (kWh) (fuel-aviation kerosene) and a power capacity of 78. 5 MW. For the received value of capacity the ТЗФП- 80 - 2 У 3 a. c. electric generator has been chosen as the load. As a result, the power plant, equipped with a converted engine and electric generator, has an electric power of 77. 3 MW and an efficiency of 27. 8 %. To assess the effect of introduced preheating chamber on the parameters of the gas turbine engine, a calculation was performed with no heating chamber, and it was obtained that the introduction of a heating chamber in the bypass duct to heat the bypass duct airflow from 402 K to 967 K, reduces the engine efficiency by 2 %, but increases its power by 79 % - from 43. 8 MW to 78. 5 MW. Due to the sufficiently high gas temperature, the converted engine has a relatively short lifetime. On the contrary, the free turbine has a longer life, and therefore {{there is no need to}} manufacture a free turbine for each converted engine. For an approximate evaluation of the free turbine life before the overhaul of the engine hot section, the maximum stress at the root of the working blade was calculated. For temperature values of 1000 K and stress of 242 MPa it is possible to create a turbine with a lifetime of over 30, 000 hours. </p...|$|E

The bubble formation device chosen was an up-standing double-walled nozzle. Nitrogen was used as noncondensable gas. The temperature and pressure of fluids and gas flow rates were measured appropriately. The bubble formation behaviors were recorded by using a high speed video camera and the images were stored digitally. ^ A bubble formation hydrodynamic equation was obtained from a constant flow bubble formation model to predict bubble detaching sizes with and without phase change. A linear combination of analytical formulas for static and dynamic regimes was found to be appropriate for both regimes and the transition between them. The condensation at the bubble interface was considered as the flow similarity of film condensation at the surface of a solid sphere including effects of gravitational and interfacial shear forces. Thermodynamic simplifications of interfacial variables allow for analysis of coupled heat and mass transfer without knowing the distributions of the temperature and noncondensable gas in detail.

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of the {{critical}} needs of a Three Way Catalyst (TWC) model {{is to be able}} to predict light-off. This is crucial for application studies and vehicle architectural studies because most of the emissions from a TWC occur before light-off (called cold-start emissions). Laboratory experiments give detailed insights to the reaction mechanism and analytical forms of the rate expressions as they are well-controlled and well-behaved as compared to vehicle tests. However, to predict emissions on a vehicle test, the laboratory-estimated kinetic parameters are not entirely capable because of the various uncertainties in the vehicle tests. In this work, six different vehicle data sets are used to calibrate and validate the TWC global kinetic model. Our emphasis in this work is restricted to predicting the light-off (cold-start emissions) in TWC. The kinetic model is calibrated using 4 vehicle data sets (which use the FTP drive cycle) using iSIGHT software package. The kinetic parameters of the various reactions occurring in the TWC are estimated to match the experimental data through exploratory and local optimization methods. A systematic approach (with increasing complexity) is used to estimate the kinetic parameters. The estimated parameters are then used to validate the model on two different vehicle data sets (one NEDC drive cycle and one FTP drive cycle) with different catalyst compositions and engine power (and hence different engine out exhaust compositions). The model with estimated kinetic parameters predicts the light-off reasonably well for the new data sets.
