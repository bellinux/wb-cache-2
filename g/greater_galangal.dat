50|$|Alpinia galanga, (also Languas galanga), a {{plant in}} the ginger family, is an herb used in cooking, {{especially}} in Indonesian and Thai cuisines. It {{is one of four}} plants known as galangal and is differentiated from the others with the common name <b>greater</b> <b>galangal</b> (or simply Thai galangal). The galangals are also called blue ginger or Thai ginger.|$|E
50|$|This {{herbaceous}} plant can {{grow up to}} ten feet in height, though three to five feet is more common. The leaves are lanceolate (long and thin), and the flowers are white with streaks of red, growing from a spike at the top. The plant's rhizomes, the part known as galangal, are thin and tough, {{and they are the}} principal reason the plant is cultivated. They have orange flesh with a brown coating, and have an aromatic odor and a sweet flavor. These are smaller than <b>greater</b> <b>galangal</b> which have a stronger peppery pine-like bite that is lacking in the sweeter rhizomes of lesser galangal.|$|E
40|$|Pomegranate fruit (Punica granatum) and galangal (Alpinia galanga) have {{separately}} {{been shown}} to stimulate spermatogenesis and to increase sperm counts and motility in rodents. Within traditional medicine, pomegranate fruit has long been used to increase fertility, however studies on the effect on spermatogenesis in humans have never been published. With this study we investigated whether oral intake of tablets containing standardised amounts of extract of pomegranate fruit and powder of <b>greater</b> <b>galangal</b> rhizome (Punalpin) would increase {{the total number of}} motile spermatozoa. The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial. Enrolment was based on the mean total number of motile spermatozoa of two ejaculates. The participants delivered an ejaculate after 4 - 8 days of tablet intake and two ejaculates just before they stopped taking the tablets. Seventy adult men with a semen quality not meeting the standards for commercial application at Nordic Cryobank, but without azoospermia, were included in the study. Participants were randomized to take tablets containing extract of pomegranate fruit (standardised with respect to punicalagin A+B, punicalin and ellagic acid) and freeze-dried rhizome of <b>greater</b> <b>galangal</b> (standardised with respect to 1 'S- 1 '-acetoxychavicol acetate) or placebo on a daily basis for three months. Sixty-six participants completed the intervention (active treatment: n = 34; placebo: n = 32). After the intervention the total number of motile spermatozoa was increased in participants treated with plant extracts compared with the placebo group (p = 0. 026). After three months of active treatment, the average total number of motile sperm increased by 62 % (from 23. 4 to 37. 8 millions), while for the placebo group, the number of motile sperm increased by 20 %. Sperm morphology was not affected by the treatment. Our findings may help subfertile men to gain an improved amount of motile ejaculated sperm by taking tablets containing preparations of pomegranate fruit extract and rhizome of <b>greater</b> <b>galangal.</b> ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 01357044...|$|E
40|$|Alpinia galanga, Rosc. (Zingiberaceae), {{commonly}} known as Kulanjan, <b>Greater</b> <b>galangal,</b> well known Ayurvedic herb and found throughout India. It is an Indian folkloric Ayurveda medicine primarily used as a medicine due to its anti-bronchitis, anti-inflammatory, intermittent fever, anti-cough, gastric disorder anti-bacterial, properties; The aim of {{present study was to}} gather information for the systematic identification and authentication of this particular species and pharmacognostic standardization of aerial part (leaves) and underground part (Rhizome) of this plant as per WHO guidelines. The result obtained in the present investigation might be useful in the drug industry for the identification, authentication & quality of the commercial samples supplied by suppliers. The present study may also be used for making monographs on this plant for different pharmacopoeias & official books. </p...|$|E
40|$|White root disease {{caused by}} Rigidoporus microporus is an {{important}} disease of rubber tree and {{is very difficult to}} control. The ability of some herbaceous plant species to suppress inoculum potential and infection of R. microporus was studied in a pot trial.   Nine species of herbaceous plants were examined, i. e. arrowroot (Marantha arundinacea), java curcumin (Curcuma xanthorrhiza), sansevieria (Sansevieria fasciata), Mallaca galangal (Alpinia malaccensis), <b>greater</b> <b>galangal</b> (Alpinia galanga), Indian shot (Canna indica), curcumin (Curcuma longa), wild taro (Colocasia esculenta), and water yam (Dioscorea alata). Pathogen’s inocula as mycelial colonizing rubber wood sticks were buried for 90 days in soil planted with tested plants. The results showed that formation of R. microporus rhizomorph in the soil was lower in pots planted with arrowroot, java cucurmin, sansevieria, Indian shot, and wild taro.   All herbaceous plants, except sansevieria, caused suppression of inoculum viability and rhizomorph development.   Further observation showed no colonization of rhizomorph nor necrosis of the root was found, except on Mallaca galangal and sansevieria. </p...|$|E
40|$|The unique {{characteristics}} of Indonesian cuisine {{is due to}} the use of herbs and spices mixture. One material often used is rhizomes, there are some popular rhizomes used in Indonesia such as ginger, <b>greater</b> <b>galangal,</b> turmeric, finger root, and galangal. People mostly use this rhizome only for adding flavor (taste and aroma) in food, but rhizomes also have another benefit. The {{purpose of this study is}} to present an overview of the literature relates to the function of the rhizomes as flavoring agents in seasoning, natural coloring agents, and food preservative agents, as well as health benefit function. The rhizomes is usually used for cooking, hence the effect of heat treatment on the antioxidant activity, total phenolic and total flavonoid of rhizomes are also important to be studied in this research. The volatile and non-volatile compounds in each rhizome give specific and unique flavor (aroma and taste). These characteristics are important for seasoning. The rhizomes also can act as a natural coloring agent, e. g. turmeric, which contributes to the yellow-orange color. Many researchers also proof that rhizomes can be use as natural food preservative agents. Another important function of rhizomes is the health benefits. In some pharmaceutical research, rhizomes extract are proofed as preventing and curing agents for treating some diseases, this function also related to the antioxidant activity. The chemical analysis showed that rhizome has high antioxidant activity, which is does not denature by heating, as well as the phenolic and flavonoid content of all rhizomes studied. The heating treatment could increase those all chemical characteristics...|$|E
