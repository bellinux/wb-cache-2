5|$|The Columbian mammoth {{was first}} scientifically {{described}} in 1857 by Scottish naturalist Hugh Falconer, who named the species Elephas columbi after Christopher Columbus. The animal {{was brought to}} Falconer's attention in 1846 by Charles Lyell, who sent him molar fragments found during the 1838 excavation of the Brunswick–Altamaha Canal in Georgia, in the southeastern United States. At the time, similar fossils from across North America were attributed to woolly mammoths (then Elephas primigenius). Falconer found that his specimens were distinct, confirming <b>his</b> <b>conclusion</b> by examining their internal structure and studying additional molars from Mexico. Although William Phipps Blake and Richard Owen believed that E. texianus was more appropriate for the species, Falconer rejected the name; he also suggested that E. imperator and E. jacksoni, two other American elephants described from molars, were based on remains too fragmentary to classify properly. More complete material that may be from the same quarry as Falconer's fragmentary holotype molar was reported in 2012, and could help shed more light on that specimen, since doubts about its adequacy as a holotype have been raised.|$|E

25|$|In 1922 Lorentz first {{examined}} Martin Knudsen's {{investigation on}} rarefied gases and {{in connection with}} that he discussed Le Sage's particle model, followed by a summary of his own electromagnetic Le Sage model - but he repeated <b>his</b> <b>conclusion</b> from 1900: Without absorption no gravitational effect.|$|E
25|$|In <b>his</b> <b>conclusion</b> Westlund rejects Lindquist's {{view of the}} amulet as {{a solemn}} heathen prayer. In his opinion the mention of Thor and 'the gods' reflect a post-conversion magical view of the heathen gods. He even goes as far as {{suggesting}} that the wearer of the amulet was probably a baptised Christian.|$|E
25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, certain {{scholars}} suggested that Aharon Ben Asher {{might have been}} a Karaite and not a rabbinic Jew. Aharon Dothan has examined this issue from many angles, and <b>his</b> <b>conclusion</b> is that Ben Asher was a rabbinic Jew, but Raphael Zer has raised this issue again and presented new evidence.|$|E

25|$|Pliego Carrasco {{criticizes the}} Alianza's filings {{by stating that}} they were based only on {{individual}} situations rather than a widespread study, that the information was based almost invariably on newspaper clippings, and that they only studied 26 districts. For his own study, Pliego Carrasco contrasted the growth in votes from the 2000 to the 2006 election for all parties. In all cases, the Alianza increased substantially more than the PAN, which even lost votes in the two categories of lowest marginalization. <b>His</b> <b>conclusion</b> {{is that there was}} no evidence that the PAN benefited from the expenditures. He found no statistical correlation between expenditures and the winning candidate. He derived similar conclusions for the other four programs. <b>His</b> <b>conclusion</b> is that the vote distribution does not support the hypothesis that social programs were used wholesale to influence the vote.|$|E
25|$|The {{poet and}} mythologist Robert Graves asserts that certain {{elements}} of that mythology originate with the native Pelasgian people (namely the parts {{related to his}} concept of the White Goddess, an archetypical Earth Goddess) drawing additional support for <b>his</b> <b>conclusion</b> from his interpretations of other ancient literature: Irish, Welsh, Greek, Biblical, Gnostic, and medieval writings.|$|E
25|$|In 1855, Antoine Béchamp, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Montpellier, {{conducted}} {{experiments with}} sucrose solutions {{and concluded that}} water was the factor for fermentation.

25|$|Dale Russell {{published}} a monograph on American mosasaurs. This monograph contained significant taxonomic revisions for the family. Among these were <b>his</b> <b>conclusion</b> that Platecarpus coryphaeus and Platecarpus ictericus were likely junior synonyms of P. tympaniticus while P. planfirons was too poorly preserved {{to be classified}} confidently at all. Russell also dismissed the species Tylosaurus dyspelor described by Cope as a dubious probable-synonym of Tylosaurus proriger.|$|E
25|$|Notably, Eliade {{was also}} {{preoccupied with the}} cult of Zalmoxis and its {{supposed}} monotheism. This, like <b>his</b> <b>conclusion</b> that Romanization had been superficial inside Roman Dacia, was a view celebrated by contemporary partisans of Protochronist nationalism. According to historian Sorin Antohi, Eliade may have actually encouraged Protochronists such as Edgar Papu {{to carry out research}} which resulted in the claim that medieval Romanians had anticipated the Renaissance.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} arguments (and {{the intuitive}} {{interpretations of the}} arguments above) do not directly explain how a Chinese speaking mind could exist in Searle's room, or how the symbols he manipulates could become meaningful. However, by raising doubts about Searle's intuitions they support other positions, such as the system and robot replies. These arguments, if accepted, prevent Searle from claiming that <b>his</b> <b>conclusion</b> is obvious by undermining the intuitions that his certainty requires.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} {{about whether or not}} Ibn al-Nafis participated in {{dissection}} to come to <b>his</b> <b>conclusions</b> about pulmonary circulation. Although he states in his writings that he was prevented from practicing dissection because of his beliefs, other scholars have noted that al-Nafis must have either practiced dissection or seen a human heart in order to come to <b>his</b> <b>conclusions.</b> According to one view, his knowledge about the human heart could have been derived from surgical operations rather than dissection. Other comments found in al-Nafis’s writings such as dismissing earlier observations with a reference to dissection as proof, however, support the view that he practiced dissection in order to come to <b>his</b> <b>conclusions</b> about the human heart and pulmonary circulation. Ibn al-Nafis’s comments to the contrary and the alternate explanations, however, keep his possible practice of dissection in question.|$|R

25|$|<b>His</b> <b>conclusion</b> is {{that there}} was no bias in the {{arithmetic}} errors (in other words, they were not present more often in the polling places won by one or the other candidate); he concludes that the errors were likely caused by the normal distribution of mathematical and organizational abilities of the randomly selected citizens in the polling place, and in the sometimes confusing design of the tally sheets and inadequate training of polling place workers.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1913, David Waterston of King's College London {{published}} in Nature <b>his</b> <b>conclusion</b> {{that the sample}} consisted of an ape mandible and human skull. Likewise, French paleontologist Marcellin Boule concluded the same thing in 1915. A third opinion from the American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller concluded that Piltdown's jaw came from a fossil ape. In 1923, Franz Weidenreich examined the remains and correctly reported that they consisted of a modern human cranium and an orangutan jaw with filed-down teeth.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the war Velero III was {{examined}} by Hancock for resuming foundation work but <b>his</b> <b>conclusion</b> was that a new vessel was required. In 1947 the vessel was being operated as the yacht Velero III for Nicholas A. Kessler, Los Angeles, and in 1948 was registered to Independent Tankships, Washington, D.C., as the yacht Ahmady with the home port of Wilmington, Delaware. In 1949 the vessel was being operated under the Kuwati flag.|$|E
