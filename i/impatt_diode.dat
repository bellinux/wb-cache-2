2500|$|A {{semiconductor}} diode's current–voltage characteristic can {{be tailored}} by selecting the semiconductor {{materials and the}} doping impurities introduced into the materials during manufacture. These techniques are used to create special-purpose diodes that perform many different functions. [...] For example, diodes are used to regulate voltage (Zener diodes), to protect circuits from high voltage surges (avalanche diodes), to electronically tune radio and TV receivers (varactor diodes), to generate radio-frequency oscillations (tunnel <b>diodes,</b> Gunn <b>diodes,</b> <b>IMPATT</b> <b>diodes),</b> and to produce light (light-emitting diodes). Tunnel, Gunn and <b>IMPATT</b> <b>diodes</b> exhibit negative resistance, which is useful in microwave and switching circuits.|$|R
5000|$|Current {{controlled}} {{negative resistance}} (CCNR, open-circuit stable, or [...] "S" [...] type): In this type, the dual of the VCNR, the voltage {{is a single}} valued function of the current, but the current is a multivalued function of the voltage. In the most common type, with one negative resistance region, the graph is a curve shaped like the letter [...] "S". Devices {{with this type of}} negative resistance include the <b>IMPATT</b> <b>diode,</b> UJT, SCRs and other thyristors, electric arc, and gas discharge tubes like thyratron tubes, fluorescent lamps and neon lights.|$|E
50|$|An <b>IMPATT</b> <b>diode</b> (IMPact {{ionization}} Avalanche Transit-Time diode) {{is a form}} of high-power {{semiconductor diode}} used in high-frequency microwave electronics devices. They have negative resistance and are used as oscillators to generate microwaves as well as amplifiers. They operate at frequencies between about 3 and 100 GHz or more. A main advantage is their high-power capability. These diodes are used in a variety of applications from low-power radar systems to proximity alarms. A major drawback of using IMPATT diodes is the high level of phase noise they generate. This results from the statistical nature of the avalanche process.|$|E
50|$|The <b>IMPATT</b> <b>diode</b> family {{includes}} many different junctions and metal semiconductor devices. The first IMPATT oscillation {{was obtained from}} a simple silicon p-n junction diode biased into a reverse avalanche break down and mounted in a microwave cavity. Because of the strong dependence of the ionization coefficient on the electric field, most of the electron-hole pairs are generated in the high field region. The generated electron immediately moves into the N region, while the generated holes drift across the P region. The time required for the hole to reach the contact constitutes the transit time delay.|$|E

50|$|The first {{widely used}} {{solid-state}} negative resistance device was the tunnel diode, invented in 1957 by Japanese physicist Leo Esaki. Because they have lower parasitic capacitance than vacuum tubes {{due to their}} small junction size, diodes can function at higher frequencies, and tunnel diode oscillators proved able to produce power at microwave frequencies, above the range of ordinary vacuum tube oscillators. Its invention set off a search for other negative resistance semiconductor devices for use as microwave oscillators, resulting in {{the discovery of the}} <b>IMPATT</b> <b>diode,</b> Gunn diode, TRAPATT diode, and others. In 1969 Kurokawa derived conditions for stability in negative resistance circuits. Currently negative differential resistance diode oscillators are the most widely used sources of microwave energy, and many new negative resistance devices have been discovered in recent decades.|$|E
5000|$|Negative {{differential}} resistance devices {{are widely used}} to make electronic oscillators. In a negative resistance oscillator, a negative {{differential resistance}} device such as an <b>IMPATT</b> <b>diode,</b> Gunn diode, or microwave vacuum tube is connected across an electrical resonator such as an LC circuit, a quartz crystal, dielectric resonator or cavity resonator with a DC source to bias the device into its negative resistance region and provide power. A resonator such as an LC circuit is [...] "almost" [...] an oscillator; it can store oscillating electrical energy, but because all resonators have internal resistance or other losses, the oscillations are damped and decay to zero. The negative resistance cancels the positive resistance of the resonator, creating in effect a lossless resonator, in which spontaneous continuous oscillations occur at the resonator's resonant frequency.|$|E

40|$|An <b>IMPATT</b> <b>diode</b> is a p+n {{junction}} diode reversed bias to breakdown and can generate microwave power when properly {{embedded in a}} resonant cavity. Because of low conversion efficiency {{an enormous amount of}} heat develops around the junction of the diode, which causes the thermal runaway problem and thus the burnout rating of <b>IMPATT</b> <b>diode</b> is very high.
