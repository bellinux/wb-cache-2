5|$|As is true {{for many}} species of deer, {{especially}} those in mountainous regions, elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following the retreating snows, and the opposite direction in the fall. <b>Hunting</b> <b>pressure</b> also impacts migration and movements. During the winter, they favor wooded areas and sheltered valleys for protection from the wind and availability of tree bark to eat. Roosevelt elk are generally non-migratory due to less seasonal variability of food sources.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have been}} hunting mammals in Asia {{for at least}} 40,000years, but until recently, slow lorises were only hunted at a {{sustainable}} level. However, <b>hunting</b> <b>pressure</b> since the 1960s has become increasingly unsustainable, leading to overexploitation, because of growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife. In 1985, large wildlife markets {{began to appear in}} Phnom Penh and Sen Monorom, Cambodia, followed quickly by the development of networks of hunters, traders, and middlemen. Bright flashlights make spotting slow lorises much easier at night because of their eye shine, and in the 1990s, large-scale commercial harvesting of slow lorises began as improved batteries for spotlights became available.|$|E

50|$|The {{species is}} thought to have survived the arrival of the first {{settlers}} in the Canary Islands, and become extinct after the arrival of European settlers in the 15th century.

5|$|Europeans {{discovered}} the King Island emu in 1802 during early expeditions to the island, {{and most of}} what is known about the bird in life comes from an interview French naturalist François Péron conducted with a sealer there, as well as depictions by artist Charles Alexandre Lesueur. They had arrived on King Island in 1802 with Nicolas Baudin's expedition, and in 1804 several live and stuffed King and Kangaroo Island emus were sent to France. The two live King Island specimens were kept in the Jardin des Plantes, and the remains of these and the other birds are scattered throughout various museums in Europe today. The logbooks of the expedition did not specify from which island each captured bird originated, or even that they were taxonomically distinct, so their status remained unclear until more than a century later. <b>Hunting</b> <b>pressure</b> and fires started by early settlers on King Island likely drove the wild population to extinction by 1805. The two captive specimens in Paris both died in 1822 and are believed to have been the last of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids {{have been}} a {{seasonally}} abundant source of food for people wherever people {{have been a}}ble to reach their colonies. Early records of human exploitation of shearwaters (along with albatrosses and cormorants) come from the remains of hunter-gatherer middens in southern Chile, where sooty shearwaters were taken 5000 years ago. More recently procellariids have been hunted for food by Europeans, particularly the northern fulmar in Europe, and various species by Inuit, and sailors around the world. The <b>hunting</b> <b>pressure</b> on the Bermuda petrel, or cahow, was so intense that the species nearly became extinct and did go missing for 300 years. The name of one species, the providence petrel, is derived from its (seemingly) miraculous arrival on Norfolk Island, where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers; within ten years the providence petrel was extinct on Norfolk. Several species of procellariid have gone extinct in the Pacific since the arrival of man, and their remains have been found in middens dated to that time. More sustainable shearwater harvesting industries developed in Tasmania and New Zealand, where the practice of harvesting what are known as muttonbirds continues today.|$|E

25|$|Since 1600, five {{species of}} ducks have become extinct {{due to the}} {{activities}} of humans, and subfossil remains have shown that humans caused numerous extinctions in prehistory. Today, many more are considered threatened. Most of the historic and prehistoric extinctions were insular species, vulnerable due to small populations (often endemic to a single island), and island tameness. Evolving on islands that lacked predators, these species lost antipredator behaviours, {{as well as the}} ability to fly, and were vulnerable to human <b>hunting</b> <b>pressure</b> and introduced species. Other extinctions and declines are attributable to overhunting, habitat loss and modification, and hybridisation with introduced ducks (for example the introduced ruddy duck swamping the white-headed duck in Europe). Numerous governments and conservation and hunting organisations have made considerable progress in protecting ducks and duck populations through habitat protection and creation, laws and protection, and captive-breeding programmes.|$|E
500|$|Although rare, {{the three}} species were widely {{distributed}} across the island yet allopatric to each other, with M.dolichobrachion in the north, M.pithecoides {{in the south}} and west, and M.globiceps {{in the center of the}} island. M.dolichobrachion was the most distinct of the three species due to its longer arms. [...] Mesopropithecus was one of the smallest of the known extinct subfossil lemurs, but was still slightly larger than the largest living lemurs. Known only from subfossil remains, it died out after the arrival of humans on the island, probably due to <b>hunting</b> <b>pressure</b> and habitat destruction.|$|E
500|$|Like {{many species}} of lemur, it is {{threatened}} with habitat loss from slash and burn agriculture and by increasing <b>hunting</b> <b>pressure.</b> [...] It is hunted with spears and is also captured when trees with sleeping holes are cut down. [...] The small-toothed sportive lemur is known to occur in both Ranomafana and Andringitra National Parks, although {{it may also be}} found in Midongy du sud National Park. [...] However, this national park is at the extreme southern end of its geographic range, and the sportive lemurs there may actually represent a population of Fleurete's sportive lemur.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{critically}} endangered species. Walden's hornbill reproduce very slowly {{and thus are}} unable to survive high <b>hunting</b> <b>pressures</b> coupled with heavy logging of the rainforests. It is presumed extinct on Guimaras and now survives only on Negros and Panay. The total population has been estimated at less than 160, though recent work from the Central Panay Mountain Range suggests 600-700 pairs may remain there. No recent figures are available for Negros, where it may be functionally extinct.|$|R
25|$|<b>Hunting</b> <b>pressures</b> remain, {{though at}} a reduced level. For example, 25,000–40,000 spotted nothura are killed {{annually}} through legal hunting, not counting poaching. Although some grassland species {{have increased in}} both range and numbers, they remain vulnerable to hunting {{with the use of}} dogs to flush them. Native peoples also are involved in the killing tinamou for meat, catching them in nooses or traps after imitating their calls. A family of seven in Ceará will consume 60 nothura per year. Tinamou species are among the most commonly harvested birds by subsistence hunting in the Americas.|$|R
40|$|Neotropical Primates are {{commonly}} threatened mostly caused by deforestation and <b>hunt</b> <b>pressure.</b> It {{is a reality}} that nowadays there are many subspecies of primates living in reduced areas and poorly studied due to their remote locations, political situations or expensive logistic required. Although population surveys are important to obtain baseline information to conserve critically endangered primates, there are some opportunities where population censuses could be attached with rapid conservation strategies. In this report we recommend some ideas that scientists can develop to collaborate with the survivor of their target species while other studies are underway...|$|R
500|$|Linking human {{colonization}} to {{a specific}} cause for extinction has been difficult since human activities have varied from region to region. Although no single human activity can account for the extinction of the giant subfossil lemurs, the humans are still regarded as being primarily responsible. [...] Each of the contributing human-caused factors played a role (having a synergistic effect) in varying degrees. Even the most widespread and adaptable species, such as Archaeolemur, were able to survive despite <b>hunting</b> <b>pressure</b> and human-caused habitat change until human population growth and other factors reached a tipping point, cumulatively resulting in their extinction.|$|E
500|$|The {{population}} in southern China {{has been reduced}} to a few hundred individuals, and by another report, may be locally extinct. [...] The decreasing number of pygmy slow lorises for sale corroborates reports of rapid declines in Vietnamese populations. By 2007, field sightings were becoming scarce, and there were reports that it had disappeared from large parts of its range, particularly in areas with intense logging and agriculture. In Cambodia, widespread declines have been associated with increases in <b>hunting</b> <b>pressure</b> during 2001 and 2002. In one field survey, three areas with high encounter rates in early 2008 were resurveyed in late 2008 and 2009, but no individuals were encountered. [...] This change was thought to be due to both high hunting pressures and gold mine development.|$|E
500|$|Since all extinct lemurs were {{larger than}} the ones that {{currently}} survive, and the remaining large forests still support large populations of smaller lemurs, large size appears to have conveyed some distinct disadvantages. [...] Large-bodied animals require larger habitats {{in order to maintain}} viable populations, and are most strongly impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation. [...] Large folivores typically have slower reproductive rates, live in smaller groups, and have low dispersal rates (vagility), making them especially vulnerable to habitat loss, <b>hunting</b> <b>pressure,</b> and possibly disease. [...] Large, slow-moving animals are often easier to hunt and provide a larger amount of food than smaller prey. Furthermore, leaf-eating, large-bodied slow climbers, and semiterrestrial seed predators and omnivores disappeared completely, suggesting an extinction pattern based on habitat use.|$|E
40|$|The {{releasing}} of farm-reared pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) is a {{very common}} practice in order to sustain high <b>hunting</b> <b>pressures.</b> However farm-reared birds may be carriers of parasites and diseases for the natural populations. We compared the parasite egg and oocyst prevalence and abundance of excretions found in faecal droppings collected in 13 different protected areas of Tuscany: seven areas where farm-reared pheasants are released every year to increase the reproduction and dispersion of the wild population (restocking areas) and in six areas where the production of pheasants is guaranteed only by the wild population (wild areas).

The hunting season was from May to July when the bird's plumage was in prime condition, while a rāhui (hunting ban) was enforced in spring and summer.

500|$|Over-hunting {{by humans}} {{has been one}} of the most widely {{accepted}} hypotheses for the ultimate demise of the subfossil lemurs.

[...] Despite the assumptions, evidence of butchery has been minimal until recently, although folk memories of rituals associated with the killing of megafauna have been reported. [...] Archeological evidence for butchery of giant subfossil lemurs, including Palaeopropithecus ingens and Pachylemur insignis, was found on specimens from two sites in southwestern Madagascar, Taolambiby and Tsirave. [...] Although the bones had been collected in the early 20th century and lacked stratigraphic records, one of the bones with tool marks had been dated to the time of the first arrival of humans. [...] Tool-induced bone alterations, in the form of cuts and chop marks near joints and other characteristic cuts and fractures, indicated the early human settlers skinned, disarticulated, and filleted giant lemurs. [...] Prior to these finds, only modified bones of dwarf hippos and elephant birds, as well as giant aye-aye teeth, had been found.|$|E
50|$|The New Zealand geese {{formed the}} extinct genus Cnemiornis {{of the family}} Anatidae, {{subfamily}} Anserinae.

50|$|The {{major threat}} posed to the corsac fox is poaching.
