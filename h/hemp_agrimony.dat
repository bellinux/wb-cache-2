50|$|The adult {{butterflies}} drink nectar from a {{wide variety}} of flowering plants, including buddleia, willows, dandelions, wild marjoram, danewort, <b>hemp</b> <b>agrimony,</b> and clover; they also utilize tree sap and rotten fruit.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on {{the flowers}} and seeds of <b>hemp</b> <b>agrimony</b> (Eupatorium cannabinum), gypsywort (Lycopus europaeus), and of Chrysocoma linosyris during August to October. After this feeding period, the larva builds a cocoon near the food plant in which it overwinters.|$|E
50|$|Plants {{found here}} which are rare in Falkirk District include Alternate-leaved golden saxifrage (Chrysosplenium alternifolium), Moschatel (Adoxa moschatellina) and <b>Hemp</b> <b>Agrimony</b> (Eupatorium cannabinum). The site also {{contains}} Pendulous Sedge (Carex pendula) and Lily of the Valley (Convallaria majalis) {{both of which}} are uncommon in Scotland.|$|E
50|$|There are {{woodland}} rides which support various plant life.There are springs on {{the lower}} slopes of Shorn Cliff Woods and other seepages in the area, and these provide opportunity for various plants to flourish which require this kind of habitat. These include Great Horsetail, <b>Hemp</b> <b>Agrimony</b> and Pendulous Sedge.|$|E
50|$|The {{butterfly}} is on wing from June to September {{depending on}} the location. They usually feed on nectar of scabious (Scabiosa species), <b>hemp</b> <b>agrimony</b> (Eupatorium cannabinum) and other tall flowers. The larvae feed on grass species, such as Molinia caerulea, Arrhenatherum elatius, Oryza sativa, Avena, Dactylis, Poa, Festuca, Carex, Calamagrostis and Bromus species.|$|E
50|$|Other {{areas of}} the fen become drier during periods of dry weather and support a {{different}} range of plant life. Taller vegetation is more common, particularly reed Phragmites australis and meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria. Different plants are associated with this vegetation, increasing bodiversity to include species such as <b>hemp</b> <b>agrimony</b> Eupatorium cannabinum, purple loosestrife Lythrum salicaria and great hairy willowherb Epilobium hirsutum. Scrub and woodland vegetation has developed throughout the fens with sallow and alder predominant in these areas, although Blo' Norton Fen has some oak and ash woodland.|$|E
50|$|The Chess Valley {{is partly}} within the Chiltern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), with {{wildlife}} characteristic of chalk streams and chiltern hills. It supports several key species {{listed in the}} Government's UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Mammals such as the water vole, birds including the green sandpiper, grey heron, grey wagtail, little egret, osprey, mute swan, stonechat, water rail and kingfisher, flora such as water crowfoot, purple loosestrife, <b>hemp</b> <b>agrimony,</b> water forget-me not and branched bur-reed. Freshwater fish, found include specifically the brown trout, grayling and bullhead. To support the fish population there is a rich diversity of invertebrates, including the mayfly.|$|E
