40|$|The {{majority}} of rice grown in south-east Australia is continuously flooded {{for much of}} its growing season, but reduced irrigation water availability brought about {{by a combination of}} drought and environmental flow legislation has presented a need to maintain (or even increase) rice production with less irrigation water. Delaying the application of continuous flooding until prior to panicle initiation can increase input water productivity by reducing non-beneficial evaporation losses from free water and the soil. A field experiment was conducted over two growing seasons, 2008 / 9 and 2009 / 10, comparing a conventional dry seeded treatment (the control - continuous flooding from the 3 leaf stage) with delayed continuous flooding (10 - 20 days prior to panicle initiation) with several irrigation scheduling treatments prior to flooding commencement. In the first year, the delayed water treatments were irrigated at intervals of 40, 80 and 160 Â mm of cumulative reference evapotranspiration (ETo) prior to delayed continuous flooding, thereby imposing differing degrees of crop water stress. In year 2, the 80 and 160 Â mm treatments were modified by use of a crop factor (Kc) when the plants were small and the 40 Â mm treatment was replaced with a continuously flooded treatment throughout the crop duration. Decreases in net water input (irrigationÂ +Â rainÂ -Â surface drainage) and increases in input water productivity were achieved by reducing the <b>flush</b> <b>irrigation</b> frequency during the pre-flood period. Savings of 150 and 230 Â mm (10 and 15 %) were achieved in Year 1 from the 80 and 160 Â mm cumulative ETo irrigation frequency treatments, respectively, in comparison to the control. In the second year, net water input savings of 230 and 330 Â mm (15 and 22 %) were achieved with the 80 /Kc and 160 /KcÂ mm treatments, respectively. Input water productivity of the 160 Â mm treatment was 0. 06 Â kg/m 3 (8 %) higher than the control in Year 1, while in Year 2 a 0. 15 Â kg/m 3 (17 %) increase in input water productivity above the control was achieved by the 160 /KcÂ mm treatment. Delaying the application of continuous flooding in the second year greatly extended the period of crop growth suggesting the need for earlier sowing (by 7 - 10 days) to ensure pollen microspore still occurs at the best time to minimise yield loss due to cold damage. Nitrogen fertiliser management is an important issue when delaying continuous flooding, and nitrogen losses appeared to increase with the frequency of irrigation prior to continuous flooding. This was likely due to increased denitrification from alternate wetting and drying of the soil. Further research is required to determine the most appropriate nitrogen management strategies, and to also better define the optimal pre-flood irrigation frequency.

40|$|Irrigation {{is often}} afflicted by two major {{physical}} problems: waterlogging and salinisation. Waterlogging occurs when irrigation water cannot penetrate the sub soil quickly enough due to, for instance, an impermeable clay layer.

They dissolve in water and when it evaporates the salts are {{left behind in the}} topsoil. This kills crops if the concentrations become too high. A common practice is to <b>flush</b> extra <b>irrigation</b> water to wash away the salts. A proper drainage system is essential to prevent these problems occurring. Instead of draining excess water mechanically with pumps, it can be removed by growing vegetation to absorb the water.

But the natural contaminants are coupled with artificial pollutants, which are a result of human activities, the pollution load becomes too much for the water body to handle. The main pollutant derived from the industrial wastewaters are organic and inorganic substances,solved or in suspension, with different harmfulness degree (Banu, 1998). In the early 1960 `s U.

40|$|The reuse of grey water, for {{applications}} such as toilet <b>flushing</b> and <b>irrigation,</b> represents a potential sustainable solution to water shortages experienced by regions worldwide. Although reused grey water is not intended for potable use, the potential for transmission of waterborne pathogens by aerosol inhalation, topical contact, or indirect ingestion is a key concern for grey water reuse. This thesis explores the pathogen content of grey water and investigates pathogen removal through treatment and disinfection processes. The impacts of organic and particulate material in grey water on the efficacy of disinfection processes are investigated in depth. Grey water can potentially harbour a range of pathogenic microorganisms, with opportunistic bacterial pathogens in grey water indicating a particular risk of grey water reuse for the vulnerable members of society. The disinfection of grey water is therefore critical prior to reuse. Particulate material in grey water limits the efficacy of disinfection by chlorine, ultraviolet light, and origanum essential oil, by shielding microorganisms from the applied disinfectant. Microbial resistance to the disinfectants {{was linked to the}} particle size distribution of the grey water, with increasing particle size offering greater protection to associated microorganisms. Additional organic material was shown to reduce the applied disinfectant but no impact on microorganism resistance to disinfection was observed when a constant disinfectant dose was maintained.

40|$|Context: Water is {{currently}} {{considered the most}} critical natural resource on the planet. Numerous worldwide {{studies have shown that}} rainwater harvesting systems have been needed to meet different basic needs. One of the most important steps in planning a rainwater harvesting system is to use a method to determine The optimal capacity of collection and storage tanks Method: In this paper we present different concepts of authors of articles at a global level that refer to the use of rainwater, its capture and use avoiding that this resource is wasted and that it reaches the sewers and raking with the garbage found What happens is that they contaminate and cover these teachers causing flooding. Results: Research has shown that rainwater harvesting systems promote water saving in a variety of settings, such as stadiums, universities, schools, airports and residential areas. Conclusions: it is determined that rainwater has not been taken into account as a saving factor, nor the use of this resource with respect to an environmental impact. As for the concept of catchment and use of rainwater, it is taken into account as any kind of technical effort, simple or complex, arising from the initiative of some people to store it and be used later for farmers, toilet <b>flushing,</b> urinals and <b>irrigation</b> of gardens, washing of floors, among other. If you go into a cost benefit study to collect it and take advantage of it to be replaced by drinking water, it would show very good results...|$|R

Sixty root canals from mandibular incisors were instrumented and randomly divided into six groups (n = 10) according to the irrigant used: QMiX, 17 % EDTA, 10 % citric acid (CA), 1 % peracetic acid (PA), 2. 5 % NaOCl (solution control), and distilled water (negative control). The chelating solutions were used to irrigate the canal followed by 2. 5 % NaOCl as a final <b>flush.</b> After the <b>irrigation</b> protocols, all specimens were rinsed with 10 mL of distilled water to remove any residue of the chemical solutions. Before and after the final irrigation protocols, dentin microhardness was measured with a Knoop indenter. Three indentations were made at 100 µm and 500 µm from the root canal lumen. Afterwards, the specimens were prepared for scanning electron microscopic analysis {{and the amount of}} dentin erosion was examined. Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze the results with a significance level set at 5 %. At 100 µm, all protocols significantly reduced dentin microhardness (p <. 05), while at 500 µm, this effect was detected only in the EDTA and QMiX groups (p <. 05). CA was the irrigant that caused more extensive erosion in dentinal tubules, followed by PA and EDTA. QMiX opened dentinal tubules, but did not cause dentin erosion. Results suggest that QMiX and 17 % EDTA reduced dentin microhardness at a greater depth. Additionally, QMiX did not cause dentin erosion...|$|R
