5000|$|Slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are {{cylindrical}} pins rolled from a {{strip of}} material with a slot to allow the pin to have some flexibility during insertion. Slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are also known as roll pins or [...] "C" [...] pins.|$|R
50|$|A <b>spring</b> <b>pin</b> (also called {{tension pin}} or roll pin) is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. <b>Spring</b> <b>pins</b> have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a <b>spring</b> <b>pin</b> is considered a self retaining fastener. <b>Spring</b> <b>pins</b> are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|R

50|$|When coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are installed, the {{compression}} {{starts at the}} outer edge and moves through the coils toward the center. Coiled pins continue to flex after insertion when a load {{is applied to the}} pin thus providing excellent performance to counter fatigue in dynamic applications. Coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> were invented by Herman Koehl circa 1948.|$|R

50|$|During {{development}} it is {{not practical}} to solder BGAs into place, and sockets are used instead, but tend to be unreliable. There are two common types of socket: the more reliable type has <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> that push up under the balls, although it does not allow using BGAs with the balls removed as the <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> may be too short.|$|R
50|$|In {{engineering}} and machine design, a pin is a machine element that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. A large variety of types has been known for a long time; the most commonly used are solid cylindrical pins, solid tapered pins, groove <b>pins,</b> slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> and spirally coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Heavy duty coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are {{typically}} used in high shear strength applications and hardened host materials.|$|R
5000|$|Standard duty coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> {{offer the}} best balance between {{flexibility}} and strength and are recommended for most applications.|$|R
50|$|A coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pin,</b> {{also known}} as a spiral pin, is a self {{retaining}} engineered fastener manufactured by roll forming metal strip into a spiral cross section of 2 1/4 coils. Coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> have a body diameter larger than the recommended hole diameter and chamfers on both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole, the spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole.|$|R

50|$|Coiled pins are commercially {{available}} {{in three different}} duties, standard (ISO 8750), heavy (ISO 8748) and light duty (ISO 8751), which provide {{for a variety of}} combinations of strength, flexibility and diameter to suit different mating host materials and performance requirements. Typical materials for coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> include high carbon steel, stainless steel and alloy 6150.|$|R
5000|$|ZIF sockets can be {{used for}} ball grid array chips, {{particularly}} during development. These sockets tend to be unreliable, failing to grab all the solder balls.

Three different flapping-lag-pitch hinge sequences are considered and the Lagrange method is used to derive the equations.

A brass tube protected the upper works, shielded them and kept them locked in position. A <b>sprung</b> <b>pin</b> locked the whole together.

40|$|Novel spring {{contactors}} {{were designed}} and characterized for wafer-level interposer and high-speed package test system applications, especially for wafer-level packages. These contactors {{can be used}} as replacement for vertical wafer probes as well as test sockets used in the final test. The contactor pin consists of a plunger section made of beryllium copper and a plated helical stainless steel spring wire. It is 5 mm in uncompressed total length, including the plunger and the spring. The overall diameter of the spring wire section was 0. 51 mm. The design of the contactor is much simpler and more scalable than that of traditional <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> called Pogo pins used in package tests. A test socket containing 36 contactor pins was constructed for tests and measurements. The experimental characterization shows $-$ 1 -dB bandwidth of 3. 73 GHz for 0. 8 -mm pitch, measured by the direct contact method. This experimental result correlates well with the simulated results. The rise time was 82 ps as measured by TDR, and the propagation delay was 23 ps. The electrical conduction path is through the <b>pin</b> and the <b>spring,</b> making it a reliable contact. However, the electrical path is known to be through the barrel, not the spring for the regular <b>spring</b> <b>pins...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Five-seven is a {{semi-automatic}} delayed blowback pistol chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. The pistol has {{a concealed}} hammer. Polymer materials are used {{extensively in the}} pistol's design, and even the steel slide is encased in a polymer shell. In addition to providing reduced weight and greater resistance to corrosion, this also prevents unwanted light reflection. The slide's polymer shell gives the pistol the appearance of being constructed entirely of polymers, but the slide interior, barrel, trigger, <b>springs,</b> <b>pins,</b> and similar parts are all steel. However, the pistol is unusually lightweight, weighing only 744 g (1.6 lb) with a loaded 20-round magazine.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Control of insect-scale flapping-wing robots is {{challenging}} due to weight constraints and inherent instabilities. Instead of adding more actuators {{to increase the}} controllability of the flapping-wing robot, we use a single actuator to drive a system of mechanical linkages to cause bilaterally asymmetric changes in the wing <b>hinge</b> <b>spring</b> rest angle of {{the left and right}} wings. We show in simulation that such a control input can generate wing motions which produce yaw and roll torques. A kinematic model of the mechanism was developed and an atscale prototype of this concept was built. High speed videos of its wing motions are consistent with the kinematic model and according to the simulation, are capable of generating adequate yaw and roll torques for attitude control. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} partial {{differential equations}} for the flapping and lead-lag {{degrees of freedom}} of a torisonally rigid, rotating cantilevered beam are derived. These equations are linearized about an equilibrium condition to study the flap-lag stability characteristics of hingeless helicopter rotor blades with zero twist and uniform mass and stiffness in the hovering flight condition. The results indicate that these configurations are stable because the effect of elastic coupling more than compensates for the destabilizing flap-lag Coriolis and aerodynamic coupling. The effect of higher bending modes on the lead-lag damping {{was found to be}} small and the common, centrally <b>hinged,</b> <b>spring</b> restrained, rigid blade approximation for elastic rotor blades was shown to be resonably satisfactory for determining flap-lag stability. The effect of pre-cone was generally stabilizing and the effects of rotary inertia were negligible...|$|R

Its main feature is the card reading slot on the front. The cartridges resemble half-size Famicom cartridges. One side of the cartridge is flat with title sticker, while the other side is sloped inward with notches on the left and right, which correspond to the <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> on the main Datach unit.
