500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks {{about someone who}} has got over a broken relationship, declaring the partner as [...] "so yesterday". According to Duff, the song's lyrics are very {{empowering}} towards breaking up with someone and getting over it. In a 2006 interview with Instinct, Duff said that people often told her that [...] "So Yesterday" [...] was [...] "the ultimate post-breakup anthem". She said her mother instilled the notion of inner strength in her, and that she wanted the music she makes to be positive. [...] "I don't think there's very much of that out there anymore.", she said. She {{stressed the importance of}} strong songs that are not all about how [...] "a boy broke your heart and you're never going to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> feet again", saying it was good for girls to hear.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} in her career, Beckinsale began to seek work in the United States, {{something}} she has said wasn't [...] "a conscious decision...My boyfriend was in a play on Broadway so that's why we ended up in New York, and my auditions happened to be for American films." [...] She starred opposite Chloë Sevigny in 1998's The Last Days of Disco. The Whit Stillman film focused {{on a group of}} Ivy League graduates socializing in the Manhattan disco scene of the early 1980s. Beckinsale's attempt at an American accent was widely praised. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt her role as the bossy Charlotte was [...] "beautifully played." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety was unimpressed by the film but noted that [...] "compensations include Beckinsale, looking incredible in a succession of black dresses, whose character can <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> nerves even if the actress doesn't." [...] Her performance earned her a London Critics' Circle Film Award. The film grossed $3million worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Paul {{warned the}} Galatians {{that those who}} live in idolatry “will not inherit the kingdom of God,” and in the same passage {{associates}} witchcraft with idolatry. In his letter to the Philippians, he refers to those whose “god is their stomach.” [...] In several New Testament scriptures, including the Sermon on the Mount, the term idolatry is applied to the love of money. The apostle James rebukes those who focus on material things, using language similar to that of Old Testament prophets: “When you ask , you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> pleasures. You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Russell T Davies at {{one time}} dismissed Donna's potential as an ongoing companion due to her abrasive personality, saying that [...] "she'd <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> nerves". In fact, the character was not originally scheduled to return at all. Donna did not [...] appear in his original conception of reunion episode [...] "The Stolen Earth", despite planned reappearances from Martha, Captain Jack (Barrowman), Sarah Jane (Sladen), Rose (Piper), Jackie Tyler (Camille Coduri), as well as Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke), Elton Pope from series 2 episode [...] "Love & Monsters", and the cast of spin-off series Torchwood. Davies originally intended the series four companion to be [...] "Penny", a Northern woman with whom the Doctor would share a romantic attraction. After a conversation between Catherine Tate and the BBC's Jane Tranter, in which Tate {{expressed an interest in}} returning, Davies rewrote season four to bring Donna back as the new full-time companion instead.|$|E
2500|$|... "Beg" [...] is a midtempo pop {{song with}} a percussion-driven chorus, about a {{relationship}} growing distant. [...] "Died and Gone to Heaven" [...] {{is an old}} school R song of love and passion, which features big harmonies and falsetto vocals. [...] "Gold" [...] is an uptempo soul song. Sebastian inserted a horn line into it from [...] "Shake", a live recording of an Otis Redding track. He said, [...] "You hear an old soul track, old Motown or Memphis, and it just makes you <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> feet." [...] "Battle Scars", a collaboration with Lupe Fiasco, is an R ballad with a hip hop rap about the scars left from hurtful and broken relationships. Sebastian said that usually when he writes a song he comes up with the melody first with no words, but this time some of the lyrics came at the same time. After finishing the song with David Ryan Harris it was recorded leaving the parts where Sebastian envisaged the rap should go. When Fiasco was in Australia for Supafest, Sebastian recorded his rap at his Sydney studio.|$|E

[...] "Do the words lamb and slaughter mean anything to you?" [...] He was asked: [...] "Does it <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> tits though when people are saying, Jaysus - Pat Kenny earns how much? He should be paying me to watch that shite!" [...] He was also asked: [...] "Where did the nickname Pat the Plank come from? Who {{came up with that}} beauty?" [...] Pat blamed it on Eamon Dunphy. [...] "Are you bored with the wood puns?" [...] they asked to which Pat jibed: [...] "In fairness lads I'm not the puppet round here." [...] Then {{it was time for a}} quick game of [...] "Plankety Plank" [...] which featured author Patricia Cornwell - he'd forgotten her name; Dawn French - he'd told her he'd give her €10 not to get out of bed; Brigitte Nielsen - she'd forced him to dance live on TV.

2500|$|The New Testament {{also uses}} the term [...] "idol" [...] in {{reference}} to conceptual constructs, as in Paul’s letter to the church in Colosse: [...] "Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed which is idolatry." [...] This expands the scope of that which is included in idolatry to certain behaviors and priorities, which capture attention and regard {{at the expense of}} that which is owed to God. (See also Thou shalt have no other gods before me.) Paul warned the Galatians that those who live in idolatry [...] "will not inherit the kingdom of God", and in the same passage associates witchcraft with idolatry. In his letter to the Philippians, he refers to those whose [...] "god is their stomach".
