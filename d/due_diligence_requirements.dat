It argues that to implement the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> principle effectively, lessons must be learnt from previous experience of ‘institutionalising HRIAs’ {{as well as from}} analogous self-reflective regulatory processes. Such experience dictates that there are three essential elements, beyond those set out by Ruggie, that are pre-requisites of effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> – <b>requirements</b> of transparency; external participation and verification; and monitoring and review. The required content of these elements is explored and recommendations made for minimum standards in relation to each element.

50|$|But in 2007, an Ohio Court of Common Pleas {{ruled that}} the entire Ohio Deserted Child Act was void for violating the Supreme Court's rule-making authority. In re Baby Boy Doe, 145 Ohio Misc.2d 1, 2007-Ohio-7244. There, the parent had left the child at the hospital, expressing an intent to leave the child {{and to have the}} child adopted. The parent never {{contacted}} the hospital or the state agency afterward. The non-surrendering parent's identity and location were not fully known. After being granted temporary custody, the state agency moved for permanent custody, as needed for adoption. The attorney and the guardian ad litem for the child argued that certain statutes of the safe haven act violated the separation of powers doctrine under Art IV, Sec. 5(B) of the Ohio Constitution. The court agreed, finding that the safe-haven laws' notice and anonymity statutes conflicted with the notice provisions of Juvenile Rule 15 and the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>requirements</b> of other court rules. Juv.R. 15 required issuing summons to the parties ordering them to appear before the court. Because the main purpose of the safe-haven law was to keep parents anonymous and immune from prosecution, Juvenile Rule 15 undermined the safe-haven laws' purpose. But the anonymity and notice statutes being procedural, the court rules governed. Because the notice and anonymity statutes could not be reconciled with the remaining safe-haven statutes, the whole safe-haven act was void. The original safe-haven complaint and permanent custody motion were dismissed. The case was not appealed.|$|E

40|$|Without a birth certificate, no {{identity}} card can be issued and without {{identity card}}, {{there is no}} access to formal financial services. This link seems to be trivial in industrialized countries, where {{the ability of the}} individual to participate in economic life is rarely hindered by a lack of identification. In many developing countries, however, access to financial services is often denied, because potential customers cannot be identified based upon official identity documents-a basic <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>requirement</b> under international anti-money laundering regulations. In many developing and emerging countries, poor people have no opportunity to obtain such documents, as {{a large portion of the}} population has not been registered at birth. Without a birth certificate, however, no identity card can be issued, which is required by banks for customer identity verification. To date, the problem of identification has not played a prominent role in research concerning access to financial services. In the past, researchers have primarily focused on microfinance. In order to expand access to formal financial services, new methods for customer identification must be developed which address the realities in developing countries. Initial steps to expand access for the poor population have already been taken in countries such as India and South Africa. Aside from addressing problems associated with missing identification, it is also necessary to introduce basic financial products such as micro accounts, where the low risk associated with them is taken into account. Less demanding identification means for low-risk financial products ought to be internationally recognized and instituted in order to dispel legal ambiguities. ...|$|R

The risk associated with transactions partly depends {{on the extent to}} which the insight into the target company actually holds true. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is performed to eliminate this information asymmetry. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is an audit conducted prior to the planned transaction. It can be described as a purposeful and systematic investigation of business opportunity and risk during on-going sale negotiations. The importance of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is emphasized widely in the academic literature as well as among M&A practitioners. On the other hand, researches and practitioners have differing views on what and how much is enough for a <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> audit. Therefore, this study examines the role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> in a cross-border acquisition process. The main objective of the research is fulfilled by examining the reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> recognizing the elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and analyzing the need and opportunities for enhancing the utilization of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> For the empirical part of this qualitative study five expert interviews were conducted among experienced Finnish acquirers and advisors. In addition, five expert interviews conducted for a distinct study were utilized as a secondary source of data. The results of this study present fundamental reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> However, conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is not always self-evident. Doubtful attitude towards <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> exists, though it is exceptional. Carefully planning the focus of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and compiling and managing the team conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> are identified as the main elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> Altogether, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> can have plural roles which in this study are categorized as the confirmatory, preparative, and cross-functional roles of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> The older academic literature tends to emphasize the confirmatory role whereas the current academic discussion also supports the preparative role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> It can be argued that the roles of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> differ among experienced <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practitioners based on several factors. In attempt to increase the value of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> for acquirers, more than one role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is likely to exist.

A dataset of traditional <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practices was compiled from the literature, which {{formed the basis for}} an interview which was conducted with corporate finance practices. The findings indicate that the traditional <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process is considered to be an evolving process, where <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practices of the last decade are considered to be significantly different from the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> required in acquisitions today. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is also considered to be indispensable, and its scope and importance underestimated.

To retain the guarantee on their loans, all FFELP lenders must comply with minimum <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>requirements</b> for servicing loans, including establishing a borrower's first repayment due date and making a certain number of attempts to contact delinquent borrowers. Lenders that adhere to these requirements are eligible to receive at least a standard reimbursement rate of 97 percent of the outstanding principal and accrued interest for defaults. However, pursuant to a provision of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, the Secretary of Education has the authority to designate lenders and loan servicers as "exceptional performers" in servicing FFELP loans, and loans serviced by those with the exceptional performer designation qualify for a 99 percent reimbursement rate. The amendments also provided authority to the Secretary of Education to terminate the exceptional performer program following a GAO study, if such termination is in the fiscal interest of the United States. To obtain the exceptional performer designation, loan servicers have to obtain an initial audit, by independent auditors, demonstrating at least 97 percent compliance with <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>requirements</b> for a random sample of loans they service, and they must continue to demonstrate compliance through quarterly and annual audits to maintain the designation.
