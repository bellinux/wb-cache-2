25|$|The {{choice of}} vessel(s) is highly {{dependent}} upon the particular surgeon and institution. Typically, the left <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (LITA) (previously referred to as left internal mammary artery or LIMA) is grafted to the left anterior descending artery and a combination of other arteries and veins is used for other coronary arteries. The right <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (RITA), the great saphenous vein from the leg and the radial artery from the forearm are frequently used; in the U.S., these vessels are usually harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH). The right gastroepiploic artery from the stomach is infrequently used given the difficult mobilization from the abdomen.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To assess, by scintillography, {{the effect}} of using {{bilateral}} <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> (BITAs) - prepared by two different techniques - on the sternal perfusion. Method: 35 patients undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) {{were divided into two}} groups: Group A (18) had both ITA's dissected using skeletonization technique and group B (17) as pedicle preparation. There was no difference in the two groups relating gender, age and demographic characteristics. On the 7 (th) postoperative day the patients underwent bone scintillography. The statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test with 95 % significance. Results: Group A (skeletonized ITA) showed higher perfusion (11. 5 %) of the sternum as a mean, than Group B (pedicled ITA) patients; however this was not statistically significant (P = 0. 127). On the other hand, comparing the diabetic population, seven in each group, there was a marked 47. 4 % higher perfusion of the sternum in Group A patients (skeletonized ITA) comparing to Group B (pedicled ITA) and this difference reached statistical significance (P = 0. 004). Conclusions: 1 - Sternal perfusion is not affected significantly apart from the dissection technique used for both <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> in the general population when assessed by bone scintillography. 2 - In the diabetic subgroup, a significant preservation of the sternal perfusion was observed in patients undergone skeletonized dissection of the <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries.</b> Although these findings should be confirmed in a greater number of cases, diabetic patients should have the <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> dissected using skeletonization techinque...|$|R
25|$|Graft patency is {{dependent}} {{on a number of}} factors, including the type of graft used (<b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> radial artery, or great saphenous vein), the size of the coronary artery that the graft is anastomosed with, and, of course, the skill of the surgeon(s) performing the procedure. Arterial grafts (e.g. LITA, radial) are far more sensitive to rough handling than the saphenous veins and may go into spasm if handled improperly.|$|E
25|$|One {{end of each}} {{vein graft}} is sewn on to the {{coronary}} arteries beyond the obstruction and the other end {{is attached to the}} aorta or one of its branches. For the <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery,</b> the artery is severed and the proximal intact artery is sewn to the LAD beyond the obstruction. Aside the latter classical approach, there are emerging techniques for construction of composite grafts as to avoiding connecting grafts on the ascending aorta (Un-Aortic) in view of decreasing neurologic complications.|$|E
2500|$|Generally {{the best}} patency rates are {{achieved}} with the in-situ left <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> (the proximal end is left {{connected to the}} subclavian artery) with the distal end being anastomosed with the coronary artery (typically the left anterior descending artery or a diagonal branch artery). Lesser patency rates can be expected with radial artery grafts and [...] "free" [...] <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>artery</b> grafts (where the proximal end of the thoracic artery is excised from its origin from the subclavian artery and re-anastomosed with the ascending aorta). Saphenous vein grafts have worse patency rates, but are more available, as the patients can have multiple segments of the saphenous vein used to bypass different arteries.|$|E
40|$|Revascularização do miocárdio com emprego de ambas artérias mamárias internas em pacientes com {{diabetes}} mellitus Coronary artery bypass grafting using both internal mammary arteries {{in patients with}} {{diabetes mellitus}} Objective: We sought to describe the use of both <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> (ITA) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) submitted to a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Method: Between January 1995 to August 2005, 4, 569 patients received isolated CABG in our institution. Of the initial population, 1, 298 had DM. The median age of the patients was 62 years and total mortality rate was 2. 18 % (100 patients). Both <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> were used in 700 patients. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups: with DM (group I, 148 patients), and without DM (group II, 552 patients). Patient selection for double ITA grafting was based on coronary artery anatomy and on the quality of sternum. The later was evaluated during the sternal transsection. When these two factors were considered favorable, we have both ITAs dissected, regardless whether the patient had DM. During the dissection of both <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries,</b> one must take care not to open the pleural spaces. Results: There was a small {{difference between the two groups}} in terms of morbidity and mortality. Conclusion: Our data suggests that patients with DM can benefit with the efficient use of both <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> with a small increase in the risk of complications, if its application is carefully indicated.

40|$|AbstractPediatric {{coronary}} artery bypass has been done mostly for ischemic complications of Kawasaki disease. We reviewed our clinical experience between 1987 and 1994 with <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> artery–coronary <b>artery</b> bypass in one infant and five children for varying indications. Indications for coronary bypass included Kawasaki disease (2), congenital left main coronary ostial stenosis, iatrogenic coronary cameral fistula, anomalous origin of the left {{coronary artery}} from the pulmonary artery, and single coronary artery traversing between the great arteries in a patient after cardiac transplantation. An additional cohort of 34 control patients of various ages and weights (1 day to 16. 1 years, 2. 6 kg to 62 kg) had angiographic measurements of the right coronary, left coronary, and left <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> {{with respect to the}} feasibility of performing {{coronary artery bypass}}. All six patients survived <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> artery–left anterior descending coronary artery bypass without evidence of perioperative myocardial infarction. Postoperative angiographic studies in five and color Doppler echocardiography in one showed graft patency. Retrospective angiographic measurements in the 34 control patients showed that <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> and coronary <b>arteries</b> are proportionately quite large in neonates and infants compared with those in older children and adolescents. <b>Internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> artery–coronary <b>artery</b> bypass should be considered for the expanding indications presented herein and when emergency intraoperative life–threatening situations present themselves.

40|$|ObjectiveRecent {{studies have}} shown that {{perivascular}} adipose tissue from the rat aorta secretes a substance that can dilate the aorta. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine whether this vasodilator is also present in human <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries.</b> MethodsVascular function of human <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> with and without perivascular adipose tissue was assessed with wire myography, and morphology was examined with light microscopy. ResultsThe presence of perivascular adipose tissue attenuated the maximal contraction to U 46619 and the contraction to phenylephrine (1 μmol/L) by 37 % and 24 %, respectively. Transfer of the solution incubated with a perivascular adipose tissue–intact vessel (donor) to a vessel without perivascular adipose tissue (recipient) induced a significant relaxation (36 %) in the recipient artery precontracted with phenylephrine. Transfer of incubation solution with perivascular adipose tissue alone also induced a relaxation response in the recipient vessel (37 %). The relaxation of the recipient artery induced by the transfer of incubation solution from the donor (artery with intact perivascular adipose tissue or perivascular adipose tissue alone) was absent in vessels precontracted by KCl (60 mmol/L) and was prevented by calcium-dependent potassium channel blockers (tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mmol/L; iberiotoxin, 100 nmol/L), but not by the voltage-dependent potassium channel blocker 4 -aminopyridine (1 mmol/L) and the adenosine triphosphate–dependent potassium channel blocker glibenclamide (10 μmol/L). ConclusionsPerivascular adipose tissue in human <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> releases a transferable relaxation factor that acts through the activation of calcium-dependent potassium channels. Because perivascular adipose tissue is often removed in coronary artery bypass grafting, retaining perivascular adipose tissue might be helpful in reducing the occurrence of vasospasm of the graft vessels...|$|R

40|$|Rats {{are used}} widely in ischemia–reperfusion and other heart experiments, but current {{protocols}} for thoracotomy have serious shortcomings.

Transverse thoracotomy, preferably through the fifth intercostal space, is performed after double ligature of both <b>internal</b> <b>thoracic</b> <b>arteries</b> 1 intercostal space above and 1 below the incision. Blood loss is minimal and occurs mainly with dissection of deep pectoral muscles and intercostal muscles, and the animal is better ventilated than with conventional protocols.

Postoperative computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed on all patients at monthly intervals for three to six months after surgery. In 108 patients, an additional CT study was performed 24 to 48 months after surgery. The axial CT images were used to score sternal fusion at the manubrium, the upper sternum, and the lower sternum. These scores were added to evaluate overall healing: a score of 0 to 1 reflected poor healing, a score of 2 to 4 was defined as fair healing, and a score of 5 to 6 indicated complete healing. Medical records were also retrospectively reviewed to identify perioperative variables associated with poor early sternal healing.
