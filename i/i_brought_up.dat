He also brought Iggy Pop to the studio for a guest appearance; Omar Rodriguez commented: [...] " [...] {{had been talking to}} Iggy because they were gonna work together. I don’t know if they ever did, but they’d sort of been chatting, so Ross had passed him our previous records and he liked them. So, of course <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> <b>up</b> the idea, “Why not [...] come and do something on the album?” Ross mentioned it to Iggy, and he was completely open to it. He came down to the studio for a whole day in which he sang [...] and did the ransom note [...] ".|$|E
