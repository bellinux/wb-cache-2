40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterise standard iron based Fischer- Tropsch catalysts by using the hydrogenation of CO at elevated temperatures and ambient pressure as a test reaction. The reaction test data is supplemented by the following analytical techniques; X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman scattering, temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and also inelastic neutron scattering (INS). The aim of these studies is to characterise the <b>hydrocarbonaceous</b> species present on the catalyst surface after reaction and to propose what role these <b>hydrocarbonaceous</b> species may play in the Fe/CO/H 2 surface chemistry; be it active or not. These initial characterisation studies of the reacted iron catalysts were then extended to study the temporal dependence of these species with increasing reaction time. The application of inelastic neutron scattering is shown to provide a great deal of information regarding the <b>hydrocarbonaceous</b> component present in these types of systems. Therefore the application of INS and the subsequent result constitute the majority of the discussion of this study. The research objectives for this study can be listed as follows; 1. To prepare an iron oxide catalyst using a reproducible and controlled method and to characterise this material using the methods outlined previously. 2. To react the iron oxide catalysts using a representative test reaction for the purpose of characterising the surface species present after reaction. 3. To use inelastic neutron scattering to probe and gain a vibrational spectroscopic insight to the <b>hydrocarbonaceous</b> species present. 4. To study the temporal dependence of the <b>hydrocarbonaceous</b> species and how they alter with increasing time-on-stream. The thesis will begin with an introduction to Fischer-Tropsch catalysis, with a focus on iron-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysis. The discussion will move to some heightened analysis of some previously reported INS measurements of iron Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. This prelude will be followed by the main discussion of results, that is the characterisation of the reacted iron oxide catalyst using inelastic neutron scattering and the temporal study with increasing time-on-stream.

30|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been renewed {{interest}} in the catalytic conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons. Various zeolites and zeotypes {{are known to be}} active for this reaction. Arguably, SAPO- 34 is of most interest when the target products are lower olefins (MTO—an interesting alternative to energy intensive steam cracking routes) and H-ZSM- 5 for gasoline range hydrocarbons (MTH) [24, 25]. The so-called hydrocarbon pool mechanism, wherein an active <b>hydrocarbonaceous</b> pool is the source of activity, has gained widespread acceptance in this reaction [25, 26, 27]. As reviewed in detail elsewhere, the exact nature of the hydrocarbon pool and its formation is under refinement and it may depend upon the nature of framework with larger <b>hydrocarbonaceous</b> species occurring in the case of larger pore zeolites and zeotypes. The temperature at which reaction selectivity is switched between the simple dehydration product, dimethyl ether, and hydrocarbons is a strong function of Si/Al ratio and reflects the temperature at which the active pool is formed. Historically, MTH was operated in New Zealand at the scale of 600, 000 tonnes per year, but the process was discontinued—the temperature of operation was ca. 400  °C [24]. MTO is also operated on a commercial scale. The development of carbonaceous residues from the reaction of methanol over mordenite has been investigated [28].|$|E

The reaction profile is characterised using in-line mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the material contained within a catch-pot downstream from the reactor is analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. For a fixed methanol feed, reaction conditions are selected to define various stages of the reaction coordinate: (i) initial methanol adsorption at a sub-optimum reaction temperature (1 h at 200 °C); (ii) initial stages of reaction at an optimised reaction temperature (1 h at 350 °C); (iii) steady-state operation at an optimised reaction temperature (3 days at 350 °C); and (iv) accelerated ageing (3 days at 400 °C). Post-reaction, the catalyst samples are analysed ex situ by a combination of temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) and spectroscopically by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), diffuse-reflectance infrared and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopies. The TPO measurements provide an indication of the degree of ‘coking’ experienced by each sample. The EPR measurements detect aromatic radical cations.

40|$|<b>Hydrocarbonaceous</b> overlayers {{formed on}} a range of nickel alumina and gold-doped nickel alumina {{catalysts}} during both the H 2 O and CO 2 reforming of methane has been examined using a number of techniques including thermal studies, XRD, TEM IR and Raman spectroscopy. These techniques have allowed both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the carbon and hydrogen components of coke to be achieved. Both amorphous carbon and filamentous carbon has been observed. Results show that changing the catalyst preparation routine effects the morphology of the carbon in both the CO 2 and H 2 O reforming reactions. The “dry” and steam reforming reactions were also studied by inelastic neutron scattering. This technique has permitted quantitative measurements of the extent of hydrogen retention {{for the first time and}} has allowed elementary steps associated with the reaction to be explored from a new perspective. As well as determining the nature and quantity of the <b>hydrocarbonaceous</b> overlayers, the source of the coke has also been considered in the CO 2 reforming reaction. Isotopic substitution reactions have been employed to achieve this. Temperature programmed oxidation measurements using a 13 CO 2 feedstream identify a clear role for the oxidant in the carbon retention process. The combination of techniques outlined above has permitted a series of elementary reactions to be proposed for both reforming reactions. Elementary surface reactions involving hydrogen are shown to be fast and efficient compared to those involving carbon. Furthermore, oxidation of carbon to CO is slower than that of carbon polymerisation. These statements are true for both CO 2 and H 2 O reforming and suggest the CO 2 reforming reaction has the potential to represent a environmentally friendly alternative to the industrially preferred steam reforming process.

The in situ formation of metal carbides also plays a key role in many reactions including alkyne hydrogenation and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. These phenomena have been observed over all solid catalyst types including supported metals and metal oxides and zeolites. It is highly likely that there are many systems in which coke plays a positive role which have not yet been reported due to difficulties in deconvolving this from the role coke plays in deactivation.

In detail, besides C- and O-containing species also Mn and S species and probably N-containing species were deposited. In addition, XPS signals with a high spectral resolution in the C 1 s region (not shown) reveal similar spectroscopic features for the interfactant G 50 and the graphene oxide.

Detailed physical characterizations using transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and elemental analysis reveal that the multifunctional den-drimers have been grown successfully within the confined spaces of mesopores. Although the 3 D ordered mesoporous architecture of KIT- 6 was well preserved, {{there was a significant}} and continuous decrease in pore size, specific surface area (S-BET) and pore volume when increasing dendrimer generation up to six. In order to get a compromise between the S-BET, pore size and density of functionalities, the dendrimer-functionalized KIT- 6 (DF-KIT- 6) for generation 2 (S-BET, 314. 2 m(2) g(- 1); pore size, 7. 9 nm; carbon and nitrogen contents, 19. 80 % and 1. 92 %) was selected for solid phase extraction (SPE) applications. The DF-KIT- 6 was then evaluated as a reversed-phase/anion-exchange mixed-mode sorbent for extraction of the selected acidic drugs (ketoprofen, KEP; naproxen, NAP; and ibuprofen, IBU), since the dendrimers contained both <b>hydrocarbonaceous</b> and amine functionalities. The effective parameters on extraction efficiency such as sample pH and volume, type and volume of eluent and wash solvents were optimized. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the DF-KIT- 6 based SPE coupled with HPLC-UV method demonstrated good sensitivity (0. 4 - 4. 6 ng mL(- 1) detection of limits) and linearity (R- 2 > 0. 990 for 10 - 2000 ng mL(- 1) of KEP and IBU, and 1 - 200 ng mL(- 1) of NAP).

40|$|The {{activity}} and deactivation characteristics of Pt-based lean burn De-NOx catalysts {{have been investigated}} and the relationships between temperature, nature of reductant (n-octane) and NO 2 concentrations, and the mechanism(s) of deactivation have been examined. The effects of Pt loading and particle size on the {{activity and}} deactivation have also been studied. The results show that deactivation of the catalyst is due to site blocking via an unidentified carbonaceous deposit and that the initial surface state of the Pt is crucial. In all cases clean Pt surfaces were found to display an initial period of surprisingly high activity prior to deactivation, the rate of which was inversely related to reaction temperature. Deactivation is proposed to arise {{from a combination of}} factors which inhibit adsorption and reaction of n-octane, due to encroachment onto the Pt surface of <b>hydrocarbonaceous</b> species accumulating initially on the support {{in the vicinity of the}} Pt/support interface. It is possible that these carbon-containing deposits comprise some form of organonitrogen species. The loss of activity due to this gradual encroachment results in a reduction in the temperature of the Pt particles, leading to a further decrease in reaction and/or desorption rates, and rapid deactivation then ensues. The use of higher Pt loadings leads to enhanced activity at lower temperatures and increased tolerance to the deactivating effects of surface deposition. Catalyst activity and tolerance to deactivation were further enhanced by controlled sintering, which, within certain limits, resulted in excellent, stable low-temperature De-NOx activity. The divergent activity of SiO 2 -, Al 2 O 3 -, and ZrO 2 -based catalysts reflects support effect contributions, with the former displaying poor low temperature activity and rapid deactivation while the latter supports, particularly ZrO 2, exhibited high De-NOx activity at lower temperatures without deactivation. The use of temperature "spiking" and micropulse injection techniques facilitated regeneration of the full De-NOx activity. In particular, the use of micropulse injections of CH 3 OH into the n-C 8 H 18 -O 2 -NO reaction completely circumvented deactivation and demonstrated the potential for obtaining very high NOx conversions at low temperatures...|$|E

If Pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Pyr-GCMS) has been used for years to give clues about this composition, the highly disparate results obtained show that they {{can be attributed to the}} analytical conditions used, to differences in the nature of the analogues studied, or both. In order to have a better description of Titan's tholins molecular composition, we led a systematic analysis of these materials by pyr-GCMS, exploring the analytical parameters to estimate the biases this technique can induce. With this aim, we used the PAMPRE experiment, a capacitively coupled RF cold plasma reactor (Szopa et al. 2006), to synthetize tholins with 2 %, 5 % and 10 % of CH 4 in N 2. The three samples were systematically pyrolyzed in the temperature range 200 - 600 • C with a 100 • C step. The evolved gases were then injected into a GC-MS device for molecular identification. This systematic pyr-GC-MS analysis had two major objectives: (i) optimizing all the analytical parameters for the detection of a wide range of compounds and thus a characterization of the tholins composition as comprehensive as possible, and (ii) highlighting the role of the CH 4 ratio on the tholins molecular structure. About a hundred of molecules have been identified in the pyrolysis products. Although an identical major pattern of nitriles and ethylene appears clearly for the three samples, some discriminant signatures were highlighted. The samples mainly differ by the number of released compounds. The results show especially an increase in the <b>hydrocarbonaceous</b> chains when the CH 4 ratio increases. At the opposite, the formation of poly-nitrogenous compounds seems to be easier for lower CH 4 ratios. We also performed a semi-quantitative study on the best represented chemical family in our chromatograms – namely nitriles: the existence of a relation between the quantity of a released compound and its molecular mass is consistent with the quantification of nitriles in the PAMPRE gas phase done by Gautier et al., 2011. Moreover, numerous species are present both in tholins and in the gas phase. That allowed us to make out potential precursors of the solid organic particles. From all these results, we conclude that the optimal pyrolysis temperature for a GC-MS analysis of our tholins is 600 • C. This temperature choice results from the best compromise between the number of released compounds, the quality of the signal and the appearance of pyrolysis artefacts. Lastly, thanks to a review of pyr-GCMS studies carried out on Titan tholins since the first work of Khare et al. (1981), we compared all the previous analyses between them and with our own results in order to better understand the differences...|$|E
