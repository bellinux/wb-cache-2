40|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) with a {{centrifugal pump}} requires a certain flow rate; therefore, its application for low body weight infants is frequently accompanied by oxygenator membrane malfunction and/or inadequate perfusion. To prevent low-flow associated complications, we report {{a case in}} which a novel system of dual roller pumps was used. A baby girl with a body mass index 0. 25 m 2, who experienced difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass after a Norwood-like operation, required an ECMO. Concerns for the tube lifespan reduction due to roller pump friction led to the use of a <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> pump circulation. The termination of ECMO during tube exchange is not needed, because circulation is maintained by another roller pump.

The dual wheels also allow two anchors on <b>double</b> <b>rollers</b> to be serviced.

40|$|During arthroscopies, {{bleeding}} episodes {{occur as a}} result of tissue damage. Irrigation systems assist in minimizing these disturbances. The performance of three arthroscopic irrigation systems in clearing {{bleeding episodes}} was evaluated objectively. One surgeon performed 99 shoulder arthroscopies using three irrigation systems: gravity infusion, single <b>roller,</b> and <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> pump. The three irrigation systems groups were matched postoperatively for type of surgery-acromioplasty, SLAP, release, rotator cuff repair and capsule repair, and operation duration. The recorded arthroscopies were analyzed for the presence of bleeding episodes with a special computer program that automatically detects the tinctures of red-colored blood. A least 20 % of an arthroscopic image had to be covered with blood to qualify as bleeding episode. The median (min-max) presence of bleeding episodes {{as a percentage of the}} operation time was 6. 6 % (0. 0 - 43. 6 %) for gravity infusion, 3. 7 % (0. 2 - 46. 4 %) for the single roller, and 3. 3 % (0. 0 - 19. 3 %) for the <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> pump, respectively. The large variation could be attributed to the occurrence of arterial bleeding episodes during some procedures. No significant differences were found between the irrigation systems. For a subgroup including acromioplasties and releases, significant differences were found in favor of both roller pumps (P < 0. 05). Overall, the roller pumps did not outperform gravity infusion. However, from the results, high-risk procedures for bleeding episodes were identified (acromioplasty and release of a frozen shoulder) that can benefit from the use of roller pumps. A clear view is essential to perform an arthroscopic procedure safely and efficientl...|$|R

5000|$|The {{park was}} inaugurated as Parque Interama on September 21, 1982. Its sixty attractions {{included}} the Aconcagua roller coaster, the Scorpion double giant wheel, Vertigorama <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> coaster, Aerogondolas (the longest Sky Ride in Latin America), the musical fountain, and a miniature railway circulating {{around the perimeter}} of the park.

The park struggled with setbacks from before its opening, The 1980 bankruptcy of the chief stockholder in Interama, Banco Sidesa, delayed the inaugural. Interama's estimated US$ 100 million in bad debts prompted the administration of Mayor Julio César Saguier to revoke the lease, and sue Interama, upon the 1983 return of democracy. The park was then renamed as the Parque de la Ciudad (City Park) in December of that year.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{in terms}} of {{efficiency}} and traction capabilities a recently patented toroidal traction drive variator: the so-called <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> full-toroidal variator (DFTV). By employing a relatively simple model of the elastohydrodynamic contact behavior between the disks and rollers, we compare {{the performance of the}} DFTV with classical solutions as the single-roller full-toroidal variator (SFTV) and the single-roller half-toroidal variator (SHTV). Interestingly, the DFTV shows an improvement of the mechanical efficiency over a wide range of transmission ratios, and in particular at the unit speed ratio, as in such conditions the DFTV allows for zero-spin thus strongly enhancing its traction capabilities. The relation between the torque transmission and the operational volume is also investigated for the three toroid geometries. In this case, the better performance is achieved by the SHTV, whereas the other two geometries show a similar behavior. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R

40|$|An LDA {{flow rate}} meter {{which is based on}} the LDA (Laser Doppler anemometer) {{technique}} has been developed. The principle of the LDA {{flow rate meter}} applied for circular pipe is following. The center line velocity of pulsating pipe flow was measured by the LDA. The velocity distribution profile in the pipe cross section can be numerically estimated, and then the instantaneous flow rate was calculated by the integration of the profile. Firstly, it was applied and evaluated at the pulsating flow made by an artificial heat-lung system. The system has a <b>double</b> <b>roller</b> pump with a vinyl tube of Ω-shape. Secondly, an intermittent flow rate at high fuel pressure injection system was also measured. Swirl injector generated the oscillating pipe flow under high line pressure of 5 MPa at injection frequencies of 20 and 40 Hz. There was a little difficulty at the measurement of injection flow depending on the zero velocity shifting. Finally, a correction method of zero shifting was proposed and the applicability of the flow rate meter was demonstrated...|$|R
