50|$|The CrossPad is an <b>electronic</b> <b>notepad</b> product {{introduced}} in 1997 by American fountain pen manufacturer A. T. Cross Company and IBM. The special pen contains a small radio transmitter which tells the pad {{where it is}} written. To provide the user with feedback on where it is written, the pen also contains ink and the user write on writing paper placed {{on top of the}} CrossPad. There is a small display {{at the bottom of the}} device that provides feedback about commands given, and there are six buttons which can be activated using the special pen.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we focus on {{professional}} readers who have to write recommendations in an online environment. We address the question whether taking notes on screen influences the reading process {{and the quality of}} the recommendations in terms of applicability, completeness, and persuasiveness. Seven participants each composed two pieces of advice on technical communication issues. They could use an <b>electronic</b> <b>Notepad</b> whenever they wished. Taking notes appeared to influence advice quality negatively, which may be caused by attention shifts from reading to taking notes on screen. Although we could not find a relationship between the contents of the notes and advice quality, we noted differences in note-taking approaches between the participants...|$|E

To improve mathematics education for students of engineering, we have designed and implemented “teleVISE”, a Web-based service providing mathematical problems and tutor-supported work for students. The service is utilized by several departments of Hochschule Bremen (University of Applied Sciences) to enhance presence education. teleVISE is intended to integrate calculation practice as well as abstract mathematics into the full process of mathematical work, i. e. forming and using mathematical models. It follows a process-oriented approach in the didactics and {{the design of the}} online service: modeling of real-world problems in mathematics, computing solutions, applying and verifying the computed results. teleVISE consists of two parts: The first is a growing database of mathematical problems indexed using metadata so that both students and lecturers can easily search for appropriate exercises; the second is an online collaboration and tutoring environment. An <b>electronic</b> graphical <b>notepad</b> integrated into teleVISE aids the discussion of students and tutors. Notebook computers with wireless connections and graphics tablets allow for flexibility in time and space. Our report covers the didactics, the technology, and the first experiences gained during the deployment of teleVISE.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of technologies, our {{economic}} society and life are changing significantly in the 21 th century. The way to capture their competitive advantage has become the most important issue for enterprises in the rapidly changing and uncertain business environments. Many researches have pointed out that the adoption of technology is the most important tool for enterprises to keep their competitive advantage. The survival of an enterprise in the age of knowledge-based economy depends on how to improve their technological capability. In this sense, firms should develop adequate methodologies, in order to adopt, in a successful way, new technologies in the logistics field, and also to integrate logistics into the corporate strategy for becoming even more competitive. Growing number of firms are under pressure from their partners to change their traditional management style, both operationally and organizationally, replacing them with integrated systems that help increase the speed and fluidity of physical and information flows. In order to reach this kind of integration they are investing on new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). In this paper we consider that the ICT are the devices or infrastructures to make more efficient the communications of business information among organizations (Dawe, 1994). Being so, the present paper aims: (i) to highlight the importance of ICT on logistics; and (ii) to understand the impact of ICT on the firms’ competitiveness. In this paper a conceptual model for the adoption of Logistics’ ICT is presented, by taking into consideration four determinant factors: individual, organizational, technological or innovation, and environmental. The interaction established between the referred determinant factors may be identified through the computation of the predominant factor, by using a selected set of adequate indicators and a simple geometry methodology. These procedures may provide the identification of the sources of firms’ competitive advantages that adopt Logistics’ ICT. The Logistics’ ICT analysed in this paper are grouped into four types, such as, the identification, the data communications and the data acquisition technologies. With regard to the identification technologies, firms may appeal to barcoding, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The barcoding (Chapman et al., 2003; Ellram et al., 1999), and RFID (Kumar et al., 2006; Twist, 2005; Choy et al., 2007), are identification technologies that facilitate logistics information collection and exchange. Nowadays, as regards the data acquisition technologies, the firms usually deal with a large amount of goods and data which means that data collection and exchange are critical for logistics information management and control. Good quality in data acquisition can help firms deliver customers' goods more accurately and efficiently. To attain this goal firms could appeal to some data acquisition technologies in logistics field, such as the optical scanning, the <b>electronic</b> pen <b>notepads,</b> (Lin, 2006), the voice recognition and the robotics (Dawe, 1994). ...|$|R
40|$|Professionals often {{read with}} the purpose of formulating a {{judgment}} based on what they have read. Increasingly, the documents to be used are available electronically. This adds to the complexity of the task. In the presented study, seven participants read two sets of articles that were used to formulate recommendations regarding two technical communication issues. Readers proved to be not only driven by their judgment task but by the articles they were reading as well. This strategy reduced reading efficiency. An <b>electronic</b> <b>notepad</b> was used to store copied citations from the articles. Readers evaluated these citations superficially during reading, while they evaluated them more thoroughly when the recommendations had to be written...|$|E
40|$|The National Information Infrastructure (NII) {{that will}} evolve in the 1990 's and beyond will impact many {{institutions}} of life. These include {{the way we}} learn and do science, self-caring, access to civil/information infrastructure systems & services, and management & control of manufacturing processes. The future scenario for the NII assumes wireless networks used by walkstations realizing the dream of truly ubiquitous access to the information superhighway. Some of the current obstacles in building such a ubiquitous access system on mobile high-performance platforms include the user interface for these walkstations, the ability of sniffing information across heterogeneous geographically distributed information systems, the ability of processing sensoring data for monitoring and control, and the dynamic reconfigurability of computations between the mobile unit and the stationary servers. Our effort {{in the area of}} ubiquitous computing involves the design and implementation of intelligent models and techniques to address the aforementioned obstacles. In this paper we present the architecture of an intelligent <b>electronic</b> <b>notepad,</b> called SciencePad, to support a scientist in the research environment of the future...|$|E
