40|$|The {{emerging}} {{popularity of}} absorptive, {{as opposed to}} reflective, solar glazing coatings on windows has generated renewed interest in thermally-induced cracking of glass structures. Here we analyse the stresses on glass coated with absorptive solar <b>glazing</b> <b>films</b> caused by uneven solar illumination. It is shown that the occasionally reported brittle fracture of such structures can be readily explained as being the result of differential thermal expansion of the glass. The magnitude of the effect is linearly proportional to the Shading Coefficient of the glass and is also influenced by {{the manner in which}} the glass is supported...|$|R

50|$|Safety and {{security}} films are used {{where there is}} a potential for injury from broken glass (such as glass doors or overhead <b>glazing).</b> These <b>films</b> can be applied to toughened, annealed, or laminated glass.They are available in various thicknesses, from 100 micrometer (or 4 mils minimum 2 ply) through to 525 micrometers + (21 mils). The film thickness is selected for level of protection desired and the dimensions of the glass pane.

50|$|To {{keep the}} sun's heat {{out of the}} house, a low-emissivity coating should {{be applied to the}} outside pane of glazed windows. If the windows are {{designed}} to provide heat energy in the winter and keep heat inside the house (typical of cold climates), the low-emissivity coating should be applied to the inside pane of <b>glazed</b> windows. Such <b>films</b> also reduce the amount of visible and ultraviolet radiation entering a window, and are often applied to reduce fading of the contents of a room. Silvered film may also be employed to the same end. Spectrally selective films act by blocking certain wavelengths of the sun's infrared radiation and reject heat without reducing natural light.|$|R
40|$|A large {{variety of}} {{angularly}} selective fenestration systems {{has been developed}} {{in the past two}} decades and shows great potential in improving visual comfort while reducing energy consumption, especially when combined with spectrally selective properties. Such systems include light-redirecting <b>glazing,</b> shading, <b>film</b> coatings, reflectors and others. To assess the potential of these systems accurately and reliably, one needs to be able to predict in detail how they modify the energy, direction, and spectral make-up of solar radiation. For this assessment, spectral (wavelength-dependent) Bidirectional Transmission or Reflection Distribution Functions are used, usually referred to as BTDFs or BRDFs, or more generally BSDFs for Scattering Functions. To enable a faster, cheaper, and continuous investigation of these properties over most of the solar spectrum (400 to 1700 nm), an innovative goniospectrometric instrument has been created, relying on digital imaging, on light collection by an ellipsoidal half-transparent mirror, and on a filtering method in the visible range to generate spectral radiometric BSDFs. This so-called Heliodome instrument is described in this paper. It enables the performance of new fenestration technologies to be assessed in terms of lighting and solar gains management potential. Its major innovations compared to other devices are to enable an analysis of both the visible and the near-infrared portions of the solar spectrum, to provide spectral as well as photometric light distribution data, and to ensure a continuous investigation of the transmitted or reflected light in a time-efficient way. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the colour}} {{quality of the}} {{daylight}} transmitted through different window glazing types is evaluated. The analysis considered four different types of window glazing: laminated, monolithic, coated and applied <b>film</b> <b>glazing</b> ranging in luminous transmittance from around 0. 97 to < 0. 1. The spectral transmittance data of different window glazing types are taken from the International Glazing Data Base (IGDB), which is maintained by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories (LBNL). The study showed that the CIE CRI does not {{always seem to be}} the suitable method to predict the colour quality of daylight in building for particular situations. However, {{in the context of this}} study, the prediction of colour rendering properties of window glazing by other metrics such as Colour Quality Scale (version 9), Memory CRI, Ra,D 65 (adjusted CRI metric with D 65 as the reference illuminant) performed better.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{sustainability}} of buildings {{one of the challenges}} is to address the role of the building envelope as the key climate moderator between the internal and external environments. It is exposed to the elements and needs to control air exchange as well as sunlight and sound passing through to the occupants. Therefore, it has a major impact not only on the energy utilisation within the space it controls but also on the quality of comfort. However, inside highly glazed modern buildings, achieving good comfort is often at the cost of high energy consumption. Therefore, in the light of ever increasing energy costs, improved façade design can contribute to a reduction of operational costs. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore technical, economic, environmental and indoor comfort implications of emerging glazing technologies for energy control of highly glazed buildings in arid Middle Eastern climates, which is one of the harshest climates for this building type.

40|$|This report {{examines}} how the 27 cooled labs at NOCS which experience the most passive solar gain {{can be better}} shaded from the sun. The objective is to greatly reduce the cooling load in these labs and hence electricity consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases. Cooling load can also be reduced by minimising heat from equipment and especially low-temperature freezers. Seven plates, on levels 1, 4 and 6, contain labs which have SE and SW outward-looking aspects i. e. away from the courtyards. The SE-facing labs may experience solar gain in the mornings whereas the SW-facing labs may experience solar gain throughout the working day. Currently solar gain is reduced {{by the use of}} double <b>glazing,</b> internal solar-control <b>films</b> and/or various types of internal blinds. To further reduce solar gain it is recommended that external solar-control films and brise soleil (fixed external shades) are installed while possibly retaining the blinds. Outside Plate 671 small trees could provide shade. Specific suggestions are made for labs in each plate, some of which include increasing the overhang of the new roof. The effect of solar shading on natural lighting in the labs will have to be considered in any new arrangement...|$|R
40|$|On {{the east}} and west orientations of the glazed {{buildings}} in the tropics where the solar altitude is low, the solar energy transmittance can not be effectively controlled by shading, except by blocking most of the glazed facades. Wherein, the daylight would be sacrificed. Based on this premise, to reduce the transmittance of solar energy without sacrificing daylight, the appropriate solution is the use of high performance insulated glazing system with spectrally selective coatings that distinguish between visible range (daylight) and infrared range (heat). Nevertheless, the drawback is its high capital cost. This study seeks to improve the control of total solar energy transmittance by exploitation the potential of recycled elements in such tropical countries combined with low cost glazing. The study examines the effectiveness of Sustainable <b>Glazed</b> Water <b>Film</b> (SGWF) in reducing the solar heat transmittance and maximizing the solar light transmittance indoors. The Malaysian climate and green-glazed buildings have been discussed to provide a direction to select the appropriate alternative solar control that copes with {{the east and}} west glazed facades in the tropical countries. SGWF was suggested as an alternative solar control and was numerically and experimentally investigated on glazed facades of west orientation, in the University of Malaya’s campus. The experiments involved a study of three parameters namely: water flow rate, types of glazing, and the solar radiation intensity. The effect of water film thickness was also discussed. Two full-scale rooms were used, one as a reference room, with a fixed configuration, and the other as a test room, which could be configured in different ways. It was found that the flowing water <b>film</b> on the <b>glazed</b> facades lowers the glazing surface temperature by 7. 2 to 14 °C (average) and absorbs a portion of the solar energy xx thus resulting in a decrease in the indoor temperature by 2. 2 to 4. 1 °C (average).

40|$|Air {{conditioning}} {{system is a}} process of ventilation, air movement, air cleanliness, dehumidifying and cooling in order to give comfort to occupant. In tropical climate countries like Malaysia, air conditioner is very important to cool building space. Currently, most of commercial building in Malaysia is equipped with air conditioner either by using split unit or central unit types. Installation of air conditioner requires heat gain estimation, so that the capacity of the installed air conditioner is suitable for the particular area and gives the best performance in its operation. This project is carried out to determine the heat gain and analyze performance of air conditioner at second floor Block 2. FKM buildings start the operation in 2009. In 2009, every building in FKM building is window glass single <b>glazing</b> without tinted <b>film.</b> Started from year 2011, those windows glass have been tinted to reduce glare and heat gain inside the room. Besides that, factor of recommended setting temperature by Malaysia government at 24 Â°C also affected the design of air {{conditioning system}}. Generally, the main air conditioning system working at FKM is central air conditioning system. A method has been implemented to obtain the heat gain which is cooling load temperature difference/cooling load factor, (CLTD/CLF) while for cooling capacity, energy equation throughout fan coil has been used. The heat gain study have been considered five rooms in the second floor Block 2 (lecture rooms) which are Lecture Room 5 (BK 5), Lecture Room 6 (BK 6), Briefing Room 8 (BT 8), Briefing Room 6 and 7 (BT 6 and 7), and Discussion Room 6, 7 and 8 (BP 6, 7 and 8). From these five rooms, there are only two rooms have been analyze the performance which are Bilik Kuliah 5 and Bilik Taklimat 8. The study of heat gain is conducted from 8. 00 am until 5. 00 pm. The result shows that the heat gains are 14. 43 kW, 14. 31 kW, 8. 35 kW, 15. 61 kW and 7. 3 kW, respectively. The percentage comparison heat gain against cooling coil load with load for Briefing Room 8 and Lecture Room 5 are 34. 45 % and 47. 98 % less than the heat gain by rooms. It happened because the data for cooling coil load were taken at steady state condition, while the heat gain data were measured in unsteady state condition. Thus, the fan coil still capable to cooled the rooms in steady state conditions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four sections, the fretting wear properties of high carbon chromium bearing steel; the effect of debris during fretting wear; an introduction of a new fretting wear test apparatus used in this study; {{and the effects of}} fretting damage parameters on rolling bearings. The tests were operated under unlubricated conditions. Using a crossed cylinder contact arrangement, the tests were carried out with the normal load of 3 N, slip amplitude of 50 µm, and frequency of 30 Hz at room temperature. The new fretting wear test rig {{consists of}} a sphere-on-plate arrangement, and the normal load and slip amplitude were variously changed. Using the new test rig, the tests were performed both at room temperature and 200 ℃, and tensile stresses were applied to the lower stationary specimens during the fretting wear tests. In the fretting wear tests after tempering at 200, 230, 260 and 350 ℃ in air, the high carbon chromium bearing steel showed low coefficients of friction due to a <b>glaze</b> type oxide <b>film.</b> In the fretting wear tests at 200 ℃, a very low coefficient of friction was obtained. Consequently, the oxide films on high carbon chromium bearing steel tempered at 200, 230, 260 and 350 ℃ were thought to be protective in fretting damage. Fretting wear volumes were measured using different specimen combinations and fretting oscillatory directions relative to the axes of the cylindrical specimens, although of the same material couples. It has been found that fretting wear volume is significantly governed by frictional energy (fretting damage per unit area) and frequency of metal-to-metal contact, as determined by electrical contact resistance measurements. Metal-to-metal contact was observed throughout the whole stage of fretting wear even in the case of full slip fretting wear. Fretting crack initiation is encouraged but fretting crack propagation rate is not significantly affected by high normal loads. Compressive residual stresses in the subsurface have little influence on crack initiation, but have a large influence on crack propagation rate. In the study of fracture induced by fretting wear, a critical slip amplitude which led to the shortest fracture life was identified. With the critical slip amplitude (35 µm), a higher coefficient of friction was obtained, and this result suggested a significant effect of coefficient of friction on fracture induced by fretting wear (or fretting fatigue). The mechanisms of fretting wear and fretting fatigue were also discussed. Fretting wear is predominantly governed by the total tangential shear strain due to fretting oscillation. In contrast, fretting fatigue is dominated by the maximum alternating tangential shear strain energy. As coefficient of friction affects significantly both the total tangential shear strain and the maximum alternating tangential shear strain energy, it is thought {{to be the most important}} factor which needs to be controlled to reduce damage by both fretting wear and fretting fatigue...|$|R
