5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver to a shot line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the anchor line. In current this relieves the diver from <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, while others have developed a number of mechanisms for <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eggs until {{they are ready to}} hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} Tide {{play of the}} drive, Alabama was penalized 15 yards for <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{facemask}} of a Virginia Tech player. A running play by Alexander was stopped after a loss of a yard, then Zow threw an interception directly to Virginia Tech's Phillip Summers, who returned {{the ball to the}} two-yard line. After the interception, it took Tech two plays for Pegues to push the football across the goal line for Tech's second touchdown of the game. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 177 with 8:15 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|In the army, Nurmi quickly {{impressed}} in {{the athletic}} competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle {{on his shoulder and}} a backpack full of sand. Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the soldier's oath. As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (alikersantti). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and {{went on to win the}} 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> falling rain. In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word Rama.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2008, Brown's {{leadership}} {{was presented with}} a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign. This event was dubbed the 'Lancashire Plot', as two backbenchers from (pre-1974) Lancashire urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Labour Party leadership. Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest. However, certain prominent MPs, such as Jacqui Smith and Bill Rammell, suggested that Brown was {{the right person to}} lead Britain through its economic crisis. In the Autumn, Siobhain McDonagh, a MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government, spoke of the need for discussion over Brown's position. McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterwards, on 12 September. Whilst McDonagh did not state that she wanted Brown deposed, she implored the Labour party to hold a leadership election, she was sacked from her role shortly afterwards. McDonagh was supported by Joan Ryan (who applied, as McDonagh had, for leadership nomination papers, and became the second rebel to be fired from her job), Jim Dowd, Greg Pope, and a string of others who had previously held positions in government, made clear their desire for a contest.|$|E

5|$|Producers chose {{boys who}} were {{students}} of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district Karrada was mixed and integrated with high numbers of Shiites and Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys {{to take part in}} the documentary because he knew they could be discreet about making the documentary, would not get bored, and would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing {{to take part in the}} documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to let them take part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the video cameras that the boys were to use. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq via the BBC News department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the boys while the documentary was being produced because it was such a high-risk assignment.|$|E
5|$|The {{command of}} the German V Corps, trapped with the IX Army north of Forst, passed from the IV Panzer Army to the IX Army. The corps was still <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Berlin-Cottbus highway front line. Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner's Army Group Centre {{launched}} a counter-offensive aimed at breaking through to Berlin {{from the south and}} making a successful initial incursion (the Battle of Bautzen) in the 1st Ukrainian Front region, engaging the 2nd Polish Army and elements of the Red Army's 52nd Army and 5th Guards Army. When the old southern flank of the IV Panzer Army had some local successes counter-attacking north against the 1st Ukrainian Front, Hitler gave orders that showed his grasp of military reality was completely gone. He ordered the IX Army to hold Cottbus and set up a front facing west. Then they were to attack the Soviet columns advancing north. This would supposedly allow them to form a northern pincer that would meet the IV Panzer Army coming from the south and envelop the 1st Ukrainian Front before destroying it. They were to anticipate a southward attack by the III Panzer Army and be ready to be the southern arm of a pincer attack that would envelop 1st Belorussian Front, which would be destroyed by SS-General Felix Steiner's Army Detachment advancing from north of Berlin. Later in the day, when Steiner explained {{that he did not have}} the divisions to do this, Heinrici made it clear to Hitler's staff that unless the IX Army retreated immediately, it would be enveloped by the Soviets. He stressed that it was already too late for it to move north-west to Berlin and would have to retreat west. Heinrici went on to say that if Hitler did not allow it to move west, he would ask to be relieved of his command.|$|E
