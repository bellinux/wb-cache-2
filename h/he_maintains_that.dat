5|$|Amrullah Saleh {{has been}} {{speaking}} and writing extensively {{on these issues}} in both local and international media. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the Taliban need to disarm and honor {{the integrity of the}} Afghan constitution before they could be considered for any reconciliation process.|$|E
5|$|Burke also {{criticizes the}} {{learning}} {{associated with the}} French philosophes; <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> new ideas should not, in an imitation of the emerging discipline of science, be tested on society {{in an effort to}} improve it, but that populations should rely on custom and tradition to guide them.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E
50|$|He {{retired from}} {{competitive}} bodybuilding after that {{show at the}} age of 29. <b>He</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the contest was rigged until the day he died. While he never said he thought that he should have won, <b>he</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> Arnold should not have, though he eventually got on good terms with Schwarzenegger.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the dog {{got that}} laugh to {{encourage}} him also.|$|R
25|$|In 2002 Krivosheev {{defended his}} report. <b>He</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> it was derived in a {{scientific}} manner {{by a team}} of professional researchers who had access to the military archives and that it reflected a realistic view of casualties based on the operational situation during the war. <b>He</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the database of individual war dead is unreliable, because some personnel records are duplicated and others omitted.|$|R
5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} asks what {{religion}} is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, {{is rooted in}} intuition, and that God is fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the negative divine - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> mystical experience is shared by all mankind, {{it is only the}} theories about it that differ. On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.|$|E
25|$|Nachmanides' {{position}} here is untenable if <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the Three Oaths are Halachically binding. Accordingly, {{it would}} appear that Nachmanides implicitly rejects the Three Oaths as Halachically binding, and that to treat it as such would be to effectively nullify a biblical commandment.|$|E
50|$|With {{regard to}} the problem of {{universals}} he adhered to realism, since <b>he</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> universal essences are real entities.|$|R
25|$|Estrada {{returned}} to his old home in San Juan. <b>He</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never resigned, implying that Arroyo's government was illegitimate.|$|R

25|$|In {{keeping with}} this creational view of Egyptian religion, Alford is a sceptic of the {{orthodox}} solar interpretation of obelisks and pyramids. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> these monuments commemorated {{the creation of the}} cosmos, the benben stone at the apex representing the seed of the creator-god which had been raised from the earth into the sky.|$|E
25|$|Viktor Zemskov–Zemskov {{maintained}} that the population loss due to the war was 20 million, including 16 million direct losses and 4 million deaths due to the deterioration in living conditions. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the Russian Academy of Science figure of 26.6 million total war dead includes about 7 million deaths due to natural causes based on the mortality rate that prevailed before the war. Zemskov maintains that military dead numbered 11.5 million, including nearly 4 million POWs. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the figure of 6.8 million civilian deaths in occupied regions was overstated because it included persons who were evacuated to the rear areas. He submitted an estimate of 4.5 million civilians who were Nazi victims or {{were killed in the}} occupied zone. Zemskov maintains that the government figure of 2.1 million civilian deaths due to forced labor in Germany was inflated compared to German wartime records that put the deaths of forced workers at 200,000.|$|E
25|$|Mearsheimer wrote a {{book that}} {{analyzes}} lying in international politics. He argues in Why Leaders Lie (Oxford University Press, 2011) that leaders lie to foreign audiences {{as well as their}} own people because they think it is good for their country. For example, <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> President Franklin D. Roosevelt lied about the Greer incident in September 1941, because he was deeply committed to getting the United States into World War II, which he thought was in America's national interest.|$|E
50|$|In the {{meantime}} {{he was in}} elected in 1978 as an MP of Lower Saxony. <b>He</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> position until 2004.|$|R

50|$|On 17 October 1709 Capt. Galfridus Walpole, the {{youngest}} son of Sir Robert Walpole, was appointed captain of LION (50 cannons). <b>He</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> post till 1714.|$|R
25|$|Friedländer sees Nazism as the {{negation}} of all life, {{and as a}} type of death cult. He has argued that the Holocaust is such a horrific event that its horror is almost impossible to put into normal language. Friedländer sees the anti-semitism of the Nazi Party as unique in history, since <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> Nazi anti-semitism was distinctive for being “redemptive anti-semitism”, namely a form of anti-semitism that could explain all in the world and offer a form of “redemption” for the anti-semitic.|$|E
25|$|At the preface, I H Qureshi {{addresses}} the common {{question as to}} whether it is possible to disentangle the history of Pakistan from the history of India. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> although for certain periods Pakistan shares common history with modern day India, there are periods of regional history with local significance that were actually dominated by the events outside the South Asia, especially in Central Asia and Iranian plateau. There have also been times when the region actually became arbiter of the South Asia's historical destiny.|$|E
25|$|The Polish scholar Piotr Eberhardt found that; Generally speaking, the German estimates…are {{not only}} highly arbitrary, but also clearly tendentious in {{presentation}} of the German losses <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the German government figures from 1958 overstated {{the total number of}} the ethnic Germans living in Poland prior to war as well as the total civilian deaths due to the expulsions. For example, Eberhardt points out that the total number of Germans in Poland is given as equal 1,371,000. According to the Polish census of 1931 there were altogether only 741,000 Germans on the entire territory of Poland.|$|E
60|$|He {{admitted}} that the chances of failure were great. Still, <b>he</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> success was possible, and it was better that the Venetians should die fighting than by hunger.|$|R
50|$|Walker {{was adamant}} that he filled in his forms {{correctly}} and denied all allegations relating to his ex-wives. <b>He</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has been the}} subject of a smear campaign.|$|R

25|$|German {{historian}} Ingo Haar {{called into}} question {{the validity of the}} official government figure of 2.0 million expulsion deaths in a 2006 article in the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. Since then Haar has published three articles in academic journals that covered the background of the research by the West German government on the expulsions. According to Haar the numbers were set too high for postwar political reasons. His own research indicates that all reasonable estimates of deaths from expulsions lie between around 500,000 and 600,000, <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> deaths due to disease, hunger and other conditions are already included in these numbers.|$|E
25|$|Ehrlich {{has argued}} that {{humanity}} has simply deferred the disaster {{by the use of}} more intensive agricultural techniques, such as those introduced during the so-called Green Revolution. Ehrlich claims that increasing populations and affluence are increasingly stressing the global environment, due to such factors as loss of biodiversity, overfishing, global warming, urbanization, chemical pollution and competition for raw materials. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> due to growing global incomes, reducing consumption and human population is critical to protecting the environment and maintaining living standards, and that current rates of growth are still too great for a sustainable future.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the 2010 PGA Championship at Whistling Straits (near Kohler, Wisconsin), Mickelson {{announced}} he had been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. He added that he had started medical treatment, and had become a vegetarian in hopes of aiding his recovery. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> both his short- and long-term prognosis are good, that the condition should have no long-term effect on his golfing career, and that he currently feels well. He also stated that the arthritis may go into permanent remission after one year of medical treatment. He went on to finish the championship T12, five shots behind winner Martin Kaymer.|$|E

50|$|He {{grew more}} {{critical}} of serious plays, advocating light-hearted content that confronted and assuaged the struggles of everyday life. Ever the cultural populist, <b>he</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> American art should benefit American citizens.|$|R
60|$|Atys said, in reply, {{that he was}} not surprised, {{under those}} circumstances, at his father's anxiety; but <b>he</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> this was a case to which his caution could not {{properly}} apply.|$|R
25|$|Some {{hold the}} view that {{informal}} logic is not a branch or subdiscipline of logic, or even {{the view that}} there cannot be {{such a thing as}} informal logic. Massey criticizes informal logic {{on the grounds that it}} has no theory underpinning it. Informal logic, he says, requires detailed classification schemes to organize it, which in other disciplines is provided by the underlying theory. <b>He</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> there is no method of establishing the invalidity of an argument aside from the formal method, and that the study of fallacies may be of more interest to other disciplines, like psychology, than to philosophy and logic.|$|E
25|$|Mearsheimer {{asserts that}} China's rise {{will not be}} {{peaceful}} and that the U.S. will seek to contain China and prevent it from achieving regional hegemony. He believes that China will attempt to dominate the Asia-Pacific region just as, he asserts, the U.S. set out to dominate the western hemisphere. The motivation for doing so would be to gain a position of overwhelming security and superiority against its neighbors which it sees as potential challengers to its status. Additionally, <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. will attempt to form a balancing coalition that consists primarily of India, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Vietnam and Indonesia to counter the growing strength and power projection capabilities of China. He points to increased alliances and warming U.S.–Vietnam and U.S.–India relations as evidence of this.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the single}} passage in which Ganesha appears in that epic. The story is not {{accepted}} {{as part of the}} original text by the editors of the critical edition of the Mahabharata, where the twenty-line story is relegated to a footnote to an appendix. Ganesha's association with mental agility and learning is probably one reason he is shown as scribe for Vyasa's dictation of the Mahabharata in this interpolation to the text. Brown dates the story as 8th century CE, and Moriz Winternitz concludes that it was known as early as c. 900 CE but <b>he</b> <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> it had not yet been added to the Mahabharata some 150 years later. Winternitz also drew {{attention to the fact that}} a distinctive feature of Southern manuscripts of the Mahabharata is their omission of this Ganesha legend.|$|E
