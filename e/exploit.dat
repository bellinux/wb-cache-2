5|$|In January 2013, a {{privilege}} escalation <b>exploit</b> {{was discovered in}} the Windows kernel that can allow unsigned code to run under Windows RT; the <b>exploit</b> involved {{the use of a}} remote debugging tool (provided by Microsoft to debug WinRT apps on Windows RT devices) to execute code which changes the signing level stored in RAM to allow unsigned code to execute (by default, it is set to a level that only allows code signed by Microsoft to execute). Alongside his explanation of the <b>exploit,</b> the developer also included a personal appeal to Microsoft urging them to remove the restrictions on Windows RT devices, contending that their decision was not for technical reasons, and that the devices would be more valuable if this functionality were available. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson applauded the effort, indicating that the <b>exploit</b> does not pose a security threat because it requires administrative access to the device, advanced techniques, and would still require programs to be re-compiled for ARM. However, Microsoft has still indicated that the <b>exploit</b> would be patched in a future update.|$|E
