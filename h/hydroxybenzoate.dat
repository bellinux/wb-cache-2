The acetonide group was removed by dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium iodide in dioxane and one hydroxyl {{group in the}} resulting diol 28 was protected as the triethylsilyl ether (TES) 29 with the corresponding silyl chloride and pyridine enabling oxidation of the remaining hydroxyl group to the ketone 30 with the Dess-Martin periodinane. Reaction with Eschenmoser's salt placed a methylene group (C20 in the Taxol framework) in the alpha position of the aldehyde to 31 and the next reaction introduced (the still lacking) C6 and C7 as the Grignard reagent of allyl bromide in a nucleophilic addition aided by zinc(II) chloride, which blocked the Grignard from attack on carbonate group, to alcohol 32. The newly formed alcohol was protected as the BOM ether 33 with BOMCl and N,N-diisopropylethylamine. After removal of the TES protecting group with ammonium fluoride, the carbonate group in 34 was converted to a <b>hydroxybenzoate</b> group by action of phenyllithium and the secondary alcohol to the acetate 35 by in situ reaction with acetic anhydride and DMAP. In the next step the acyloin group had its positions swapped by reaction with triazabicyclodecene (other amine bases fail) forming 36 and in the final steps ring closure of ring C was accomplished by ozonolysis at the allyl group to 37 and Aldol reaction with 4-pyrrolidinopyridine to 38.|$|E

The degree of counterion binding and the location of the counterions at the interface are shown to depend on the isomeric form of the counterion. For <b>hydroxybenzoate,</b> the para-substituted counterion is located within the headgroup region of the surfactant monolayer, and there is of order one counterion for every two surfactant ions. For the ortho-substituted counterion, the degree of counterion binding is higher. There is of order 0. 85 counterions for each surfactant ion, and the counterion is located within the hydrophobic region of the monolayer, some 5 A {{from the center of the}} headgroup distribution. Similar results were found for the chlorobenzoate counterion, but in that case it was the para-substituted counterion that was more tightly bound and located within the hydrophobic region of the surfactant monolayer. The results for the ortho-substituted <b>hydroxybenzoate</b> and for the para-substituted chlorobenzoate are consistent with those previously reported for the para-tosylate.

The metabolic fates of the substrates were compared in denitrifying, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic incubations. Under {{the latter two}} conditions, phenol was detected as a major intermediate of p-hydroxybenzoate, but no metabolites were initially found with m- or o-hydroxybenzoate. However, benzoate accumulation was noted when metabolic inhibitors were used with these samples. About 9 to 17 days was required for > 95 % removal of the parent isomers under these conditions. When aquifer slurries were amended with nitrate, the equivalent removal of the hydroxybenzoates occurred within 4 days. In the denitrifying incubations, phenol was formed from all three hydroxybenzoates and accounted for about 30 % of the initial substrate amendment. No benzoate was measured in these samples. All metabolites were identified by chromatographic mobility, mass spectral profiles, or both. Autoclaved controls were uniformly incapable of transforming the parent substrates. These {{results suggest that the}} anaerobic fate of <b>hydroxybenzoate</b> isomers depends on the relative substitution pattern and the prevailing ecological conditions.

The traditional estufagem process was set to 45 °C for 3 months. Overheating conditions, 1 month at 70 °C, were also examined. Total polyphenols (TP), total monomeric anthocyanins (TMA) and total flavonoids (TF) were assessed by spectrophotometric methods, while individual polyphenols and furans were simultaneously determined by HPLC-DAD. Antioxidant potential (AP) was estimated by ABTS, DPPH and FRAP assays, while color was evaluated by Glories and CIELab. Traditional estufagem decreased the TP and AP up to 20 % and 26 %, respectively, with final values similar to other wines. TMA of the Madeira wines from red grapes decreased during estufagem. Six hydroxybenzoic acids, three hydroxycinnamic acids, one stilbene, three flavonols and three flavan- 3 -ols were found in these wines.

40|$|The {{pathogenic}} yeast Candida parapsilosis metabolizes hydroxyderivatives of benzene and {{benzoic acid}} to compounds channeled into central metabolism, including the mitochondrially localized tricarboxylic acid cycle, via the 3 -oxoadipate and gentisate pathways. The orchestration of both catabolic pathways with mitochondrial metabolism {{as well as}} their evolutionary origin is not fully understood. Our results show that the enzymes involved in these two pathways operate in the cytoplasm {{with the exception of the}} mitochondrially targeted 3 -oxoadipate CoA-transferase (Osc 1 p) and 3 -oxoadipyl-CoA thiolase (Oct 1 p) catalyzing the last two reactions of the 3 -oxoadipate pathway. The cellular localization of the enzymes indicates that degradation of hydroxyaromatic compounds requires a shuttling of intermediates, cofactors, and products of the corresponding biochemical reactions between cytosol and mitochondria. Indeed, we found that yeast cells assimilating <b>hydroxybenzoates</b> increase the expression of genes SFC 1, LEU 5, YHM 2, and MPC 1 coding for succinate/fumarate carrier, coenzyme A carrier, oxoglutarate/citrate carrier, and the subunit of pyruvate carrier, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis uncovered distinct evolutionary trajectories for sparsely distributed gene clusters coding for enzymes of both pathways. Whereas the 3 -oxoadipate pathway appears to have evolved by vertical descent combined with multiple losses, the gentisate pathway shows a striking pattern suggestive of horizontal gene transfer to the evolutionarily distant Mucorales.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{research}} strongly supports {{a role for}} polyphenols {{in the prevention of}} degenerative diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases. Proposed mechanisms include inhibition of the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), an important step in the aetiology of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) and effects on cell signaling or gene expression. Polyphenols are the most abundant antioxidants in the diet, with intakes as high as 1 g/day, principally from fruits, vegetables, cereals, chocolate, tea, coffee, and red wine. One source that is often overlooked is beer, which is polyphenol-rich, and is regularly consumed. Studies have shown that beer increases plasma antioxidant capacity in humans 1, and in patients suffering from hyper-cholesterolemia and CHD, short-term moderate beer consumption was cardioprotective 2. There are however, vast differences in composition between beers, and some evidence that darker beers have higher antioxidant activity in vitro resulting from interactions between sugars, amino acids and phenolic acids 3. The overall aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the bioavailability and metabolism of beer phenolics and their ability to protect LDL against oxidation. Initially, an investigation of the compounds present in beer, their relative antioxidant activity and how this differs between lager, ale and stout was performed. Ethyl acetate extracts and aqueous extracts were prepared from three commercial beer samples. Separation and identification of polyphenols and other potential compounds of interest was performed using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Antioxidant activity was determined using the ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Preliminary results indicated that ale extracts possessed the most compounds of interest with highest antioxidant activity; therefore these extracts were subjected to further analyses. Centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) was used to separate ale extracts into 17 fractions of differing composition. RP-HPLC was used for the separation of CPC fractions, and subsequent identification and quantification of compounds belonging to different classes of polyphenols (hydroxycinammates, <b>hydroxybenzoates,</b> flavonoids; including one not previously reported in beer, but known to inhibit LDL oxidation), and also other compounds of interest (furans). Concentrations of compounds contained within CPC fractions have been correlated with antioxidant activity as measured using the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and FRAP assays. CPC fractions have been analysed by LC-(ESI) -MS, confirming detection of several phenolic compounds by mass.

Particularly prevalent are incidences of skin cancer now linked to UV radiation. Research efforts are directed towards finding cheap and efficient UV-absorbers to protect such light sensitive materials. Phenyl salicylates and hydroxybenzophenones constitute families of UV-absorber compounds, and this has necessitated this research. The condensation of differently substituted phenols with salicylic acid, catalyzed by either phosphoric acid (PPA), POCl 3 /ZnCl 2 or ZnCl 2 afforded the anticipated phenolic type UV -absorber molecules such as phenyl salicylate, 4 -hydroxyphenyl- 2 - <b>hydroxybenzoate,</b> 2, 3 -dihydroxyphenyl- 2 -hydroxyphenylbenzoate, 3 -hydroxyphenyl- 2 - <b>hydroxybenzoate,</b> (2, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl) (2 -hydroxyphenyl) methanone, (2, 3 - dihydroxyphenyl) (2 -hydroxyphenyl) methanone and 1, 3 -dihydroxyxanthone.

The purpose of this{{proposal is}} to setup the green process of ultrasound-assisted dual-site phase-transfer catalysis,which behaves high product yield and is an environmentally benign technology without usinghalide-containing solvents. Phase transfer catalysts have been employed to enhance the reaction of immisciblereactants under mild conditions with high conversion and high product selectivity. If amolecule of catalyst contains dual sites, {{it can be used}} to increase the reaction rate more andmore. Thus it is valuable to change the traditional manufacturing method into a phase-transfercatalyzed esterification processes with third phase which is highly concentrated in a separatephase and can be easily separated and recovered from the reaction mixture. The ultrasoundtechnology has been proved to greatly enhance the rate of chemical reaction and product yield. Hence, this proposal is willing to explore the activity of dual-site phase transfer catalysts intri-phase system under ultrasonic irradiation. It is expected to develop the related theory ofphase transfer catalysis and interfacial catalysis. The benzoates are widely used as flavoring agents, perfumery, lacquers and solvent forcellulose derivatives, and as an additive in liquid crystal materials. p-Hydroxybenzoates areused in perfumery, sunscreeing agent, etc. In the past, the manufacturing processes forsubstituted benzoates were to conduct esterification reaction with the corresponding alcoholsin the presence of sulfuric acid, and having the disadvantages of severe reaction conditions,slow reaction rates, and low yields due to reversible reactions and hydrolysis side recations. Moreover, the materials of reactors should be specially considered due to the use of sulfuricacid. Those drawbacks can be overcome by applying phase-transfer catalyzed esterificationprocesses. This proposal is the extended work of the last project and is willing to be completedwithin two years. The goal and items done are as follows. For the first year, the formation ofthe third-liquid or the third phase by the novel dual-site phase-transfer catalyst will beexplored. Effects on the third phase formation investigated will include the aqueous reactant,inorganic salt, dual-site PTC and reaction conditions, etc. the reactivity of dual-site PTC withthe organic reactant and the distribution of the catalytic intermediate between the tri-phases,the interfacial reaction mechanism and kinetics of the overall reaction under ultrasoundirradiation. The kinetic model is also developed to describe the interfacial reactions intri-phase system.

(Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom CampusThe {{human race}} {{has had to}} endure a variety of {{disabling}} and life threatening diseases which include leprosy, plaque, Black Death and numerous other infamous viruses, none of which awaken terror like the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIV infection has produced {{one of the most}} dreaded epidemics of the twentieth century, or rather, of all time, leaving no country or race untouched. Until this time, no cure for this disease has been discovered, and sufferers have to tolerate the frustrating adverse effects of the numerous Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs that have to be taken in order to live an average life. Whilst combination antiretroviral therapy has proven to be the most effective approach in treating HIV positive patients, Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) therapy seem to assure better patient adherence. An oral liquid dosage formulation is desired for paediatric HIV patients, and for those who cannot swallow other oral dosage forms such as capsules and tablets. The focus {{of this study was to}} combine lamivudine, zidovudine and nevirapine into a powder for oral suspension, and to identify incompatibilities and other factors that could possible affect the physical arid chemical stability of the formulation. Formulations were designed according to the UNICEF/WHO (2004) dosage suggestions. The first step in the product development was an investigative literature study into the stability and possible interactions between the three active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and excipients. Compatibility was confirmed by means of DSC and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) -studies. The optimal mixing time for the powders for suspension was determined before formulation of the bulk formulae began. Six suspension formulations according to patient mass were formulated containing the dosage regime for one month as suggested by WHO. Sodium propyl <b>hydroxybenzoate</b> and sodium methyl <b>hydroxybenzoate</b> were added as preservatives. The physical and chemical stability of pharmaceutical substances do play a vital role in the success of a specific product. Stability tests, physical and chemical. and preservative efficacy studies were therefore performed on all six formulations over a period of twelve weeks, at three temperature conditions, namely 25 oC+ 60 %RH, 30 °+ 65 %RH and 40 °C+ 75 %RH. In that period, in-use stability testing, to ensure the stability during patient use, was also conducted. Results obtained for pH, relative density, viscosity and moisture content indicated that no significant changes took place during the accelerated stability testing. as well as the in-use test period. 'There was a change in the physical appearance, especially the colour, with time at the 3 O 0 C+ 6 S%RH and 40 °C+ 75 %RH storage conditions, as well as during in-use testing after 12 weeks. Dissolution results showed that larnivudine, zidovudine and nevirapine were immediately dissolved, with 100 % dissolution after 10 minutes. The assay results for lamivudine, zidovudine and nevirapine remained within the specification of 90 - 110 %, but a downward trend in lamivudine assay was observed in the 300 ml and 900 ml formulation, where a result of 89. 3 % was measured after 12 weeks at 40 oC+ 75 %RH. Results for sodium methyl <b>hydroxybenzoate</b> were all within the 90 - 110 % limit. Results higher than the upper limit of 110 % were calculated for sodium propyl <b>hydroxybenzoate</b> in some samples. This could be due to integration inconsistencies during assay due to the very mall peak. Preservative Efficacy Test (PET) results were all within the USP 28 specifications, even during in-use studies, and confirmed the effectiveness of the preservative system. In conclusion it can be said that lamivudine, zidovudine and nevirapine were successfully combined in a FDC for use in paediatric, adult and geriatric AIDS patients. The powder for suspension formulations have definite marketing possibilities and could become an essential part in the fight against AIDS. Master...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of a new flavoprotein hydroxylase 3 <b>hydroxybenzoate</b> 6 -hydroxylase (3 HB 6 H) from Rhodococcus jostii RHA 1. 3 HB 6 H is able to insert exclusively oxygen in para-position and the enzyme has been chosen to study the structural basis of such regioselectivity. As main result, functional mirror image active sites direct regioselective 3 -hydroxybenzoate hydroxylation. Moreover, the nature and role of unprecedented phospholipid binding has been analyzed demonstrating a role in enzyme oligomerization and a possible protective role during catalysis. To conclude, the knowledge acquired improves our insight into the strategies of flavin-dependent regioselective hydroxylation and the results emerged in this thesis provide a foundation for further structural and kinetic studies on 3 HB 6 H and related enzymes.  ...|$|E

The degradation pathways were elucidated by performing whole-cell O- 2 uptake, enzyme activity and induction studies. Depending on the mixture of carbon source and the preculture condition, strain PPH was found to degrade 2 -hydroxybenzoate either via the catechol or gentisate route and has both salicylate 1 -hydroxylase and salicylate 5 -hydroxylase. Strain PPD utilizes 2 -hydroxybenzoate via gentisate. Both strains degrade 3 - and 4 -hydroxybenzoate via gentisate and protocatechuate, respectively.

Results of an HPLC evaluation of parabens, 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid and 2, 3 - dihydroxypropyl 4 -hydroxybenzoate showed that the decomposition of 68 months old samples stored at room temperature did not exceed 2. 0 %. The stability of both parabens in a medicinal preparation of the stated composition has thus been satisfactorily demonstrated after more than 5 years of storage under ambient conditions. The transesterification reaction was shown to influence the chemical stability of parabens to an extent comparable to hydrolysis.

The current study focuses on assessing the effects of 2 -, 3 - and 4 -hydroxybenzoate calcium (HBCa) compounds on MCF- 10 A, MDA-MB 231 and MCF- 7 epithelial breast cell lines. The HBCa-treated cells were examined using annexin V, to measure apoptosis in the three epithelial breast cell lines, after 48 h of treatment. The results indicated that 0. 5 and 2. 5 mmol/L of HBCa induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of cell death in normal MCF- 10 A cells {{was found to be}} significantly less (p = 0. 0003 – 0. 0068), in comparison to the malignant cell lines (MDA-MB 231 and MCF- 7). HBCa compounds were also found to cause cell cycle arrest in the epithelial breast cells at G 1 /G 0. Furthermore, HBCa compounds induced the upregulation of apoptotic proteins (p 53, p 21, Bax and caspase- 3), as well as the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- 2, which may suggest that apoptosis is induced via the intrinsic pathway...|$|E
40|$|The toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum Graham {{produces}} a newly discovered sub-class of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs, saxitoxins) that contain a <b>hydroxybenzoate</b> moiety {{in place of}} the carbamoyl group (GC toxins: GC 1 –GC 3). GC toxins bind strongly to sodium channels and their lipophilic nature may increase their potential to bioaccumulate in marine organisms. Cultures Australian G. catenatum strains were found to contain 12 – 63 mol% GC toxins. The GC toxins were also detected in strains from China (38 mol%), Japan (1 – 2 mol%), Portugal (58 mol%), Spain (36 – 54 mol%), and Uruguay (10 – 16 mol%). A cluster analysis of molar proportions of saxitoxin derivatives produced by strains showed clear clustering by country/region of origin, indicating that GC toxins may be very useful markers to identify the source of G. catenatum in the case of new outbreaks. The GC toxins dominate the toxin profiles of many G. catenatum strains, and can contribute significantly to sample toxicity, yet these toxins may easily escape detection using conventional chromatography, resulting in significant underestimates of sample toxicity.

40|$|Background and aims: To form nitrogen-fixing nodules on pea roots, Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae must be {{competitive}} in the rhizosphere. Our aim was to identify genes important for rhizosphere fitness. Methods: Signature-tagged mutants were screened using microarrays to identify mutants reduced for growth in pea rhizospheres. Candidate mutants were assessed relative to controls for growth in minimal medium, growth in pea rhizospheres and for infection of peas in mixed inoculants. Mutated genes were identified by DNA sequencing and confirmed by transduction. Results: Of 5508 signature-tagged mutants, microarrays implicated 50 as having decreased rhizosphere fitness. Growth tests identified six mutants with rhizosphere-specific phenotypes. The mutation {{in one of the}} genes (araE) was in an arabinose catabolism operon and blocked growth on arabinose. The mutation in another gene (pcaM), encoding a predicted solute binding protein for protocatechuate and <b>hydroxybenzoate</b> uptake, decreased growth on protocatechuate. Both mutants were decreased for nodule infection competitiveness with mixed inoculants, but nodulated peas normally when inoculated alone. Other mutants with similar phenotypes had mutations predicted to affect secondary metabolism.

30|$|Another two {{significantly}} upregulated proteins (Pput_ 4344, Pput_ 4342 with 8 - to 27 -fold change, respectively) {{were found}} {{to be involved in the}} protocatechuate ortho-cleavage, which is a parallel branch to the catechol ortho-cleavage pathway (Harwood and Parales 1996). This branch mediates the transformation of <b>hydroxybenzoate</b> to β-ketoadipate enol-lactone. The latter metabolite is a common intermediate of both the catechol and protocatechuate branches, and it thus represents the point of metabolic convergence (Figure  4). The two upregulated proteins (Pput_ 4344, Pput_ 4342) {{were found to}} catalyze the transformation of β-carboxymuconate to γ-carboxymuconolactone and then to β-ketoadipate enol-lactone. While the change in the level of these enzymes was previously observed in p-hydroxybenzoate and vanillin biodegradation (Kim et al. 2006), this is the first report demonstrating that such a change can occur during the degradation of benzoate by P. putida F 1. Our finding suggests that a fraction of benzoate could initially be hydroxylated and then channeled to the protocatechuate branch. However, the additional enzymes required for the transformation of benzoate to protocatechuate and then to β-carboxymuconate were not detected in this study, possibly due to their relatively lower abundances compared with the observed enzymes. Nevertheless, additional experiments (e.g. gene-knockdown experiments) will be needed to clarify the precise biological importance of Pput_ 4344 and Pput_ 4342 on benzoate degradation.|$|E
