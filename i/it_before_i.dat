25|$|A new {{adaption}} {{was commissioned}} by the Brighton Festival and performed by the dreamthinkspeak group. They renovated the old co-op home-store on the London Road using the whole store as a stage. They renamed <b>it</b> <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> Sleep {{and said it was}} inspired by the original play. It received positive reviews from both The Guardian and The Independent newspapers. It was funded by Arts Council England, National Lottery and a long list of other Brighton and Hove based businesses.|$|E
500|$|After {{getting a}} green-light from Rahman, they asked Scherzinger, the leader {{singer of the}} Pussycat Dolls, to write an {{interpretation}} of the song. Scherzinger was hesitant at first, stating in an interview that: [...] " [...] I was scared to death to touch it [...] afraid for people to hear <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> even wrote it". Scherzinger put her [...] "heart into writing the lyrics and put in themes from the film Slumdog Millionaire. Love and destiny were elements from the movie that she put into the track". She stated that she [...] "prayed every night to do this right". Fair and Iovine additionally hired Brick & Lace, The Writing Camp and Ester Dean to write their own interpretation of the song.|$|E
500|$|... "Cocktails" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein, who plays Human Resources {{representative}} Toby Flenderson on the series. Lost series creator J. J. Abrams was hired on as episode director, his first such credit for the series. Abrams disliked the American series when it first premiered, due to his love for the original British series. The director explained, [...] "I resented <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> saw it, because I thought, 'well, {{how are you going}} to do what Ricky and Steve did. In fact, the first season I didn't get into it at all. In the second season, they really found their voice. And that's despite having to make 22 episodes, which is twice the length of what the BBC show did. And I thought that the show became brilliant. I was really impressed by how it worked." ...|$|E
60|$|LOMAX. Oh come! I'm not a fool. I took jolly {{good care}} to blow <b>it</b> out <b>before</b> <b>I</b> chucked <b>it</b> away.|$|R
60|$|Such a sight as {{this have}} I seen many a hundred times, and I {{hope to see}} <b>it</b> again <b>before</b> <b>I</b> die.|$|R
6000|$|Her voice failed her, {{her hand}} closed gently round mine--then dropped <b>it</b> suddenly. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> could say [...] "Good-night" [...] she was gone.|$|R
500|$|A {{test pilot}} for the Ferris Aircraft Company whose will to act qualifies {{him to become}} the first earthman ever {{inducted}} into an intergalactic peacekeeping force fueled by green energy of will. Reynolds said, [...] "I've known about 'Green Lantern' my whole life, but I've never really followed <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> {{fell in love with the}} character when I met with Martin Campbell". Reynolds called the film [...] "an origin story to a certain degree, but it's not a labored origin story, where the movie begins in the third act. The movie starts when it starts. We find out Hal is the guy fairly early on, and the adventure begins". Alternatively Chris Pine and Sam Worthington had been in discussions for the role. Bradley Cooper, Jared Leto and Justin Timberlake were other top contenders, while Brian Austin Green, a Green Lantern fan, campaigned for the part, but ultimately did not audition.|$|E
2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I've never had one like <b>it</b> <b>before...</b> <b>I</b> don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be angry with me, please don't be angry. I love you terribly. I can't live without you. May the Lord protect you." ...|$|E
60|$|PROSERPINE. We had champagne! I never tasted <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> {{feel quite}} giddy.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, sir, {{there was}} the lake again, away yonder across the desert, {{perfectly}} plain, trees and all, {{just the same as}} <b>it</b> was <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right there. <b>I</b> saw <b>it</b> <b>before</b> but <b>I</b> thought <b>it</b> {{was just}} part of him. But if he's 'people,' maybe it's a {{disintegrator}} gun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ellen, {{how long}} will <b>it</b> be <b>before</b> <b>I</b> can walk {{to the top of}} those hills? I wonder what lies on the other side--is it the sea?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to-day, then, but to-morrow. Think of <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> come to-morrow. In a fortnight--or three weeks--as soon as possible." ...|$|E
60|$|ALICE. He {{followed}} me about, {{as you put}} <b>it,</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> knew you. I don't know why I quarrelled with him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I had not guessed <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> <b>I</b> {{should know}} it now,' he answered, smiling gravely. 'Your Castilian tells its own tale.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Here is her portrait,' Ned said, {{taking it}} from his pocket. 'As to what you ask me, I must think <b>it</b> over <b>before</b> <b>I</b> can promise you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm much obliged, but I'll have {{to think}} <b>it</b> over <b>before</b> <b>I</b> decide," [...] he said. [...] "Three {{years is a long}} time to bind one's self." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know. I {{have never}} seen <b>it</b> open <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> think <b>it</b> must have been left unclosed by accident. We will see where it leads to." ...|$|R
60|$|ASHER. No--I got <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> {{left for}} Washington. But I didn't {{bring it in}} to you I wanted to think about it.|$|E
60|$|Perfectly {{clear it}} was, {{perfectly}} clear, and why hadn't I seen <b>it</b> <b>before?...</b> <b>I</b> {{looked at my}} watch, and it was half-past two.|$|E
60|$|MABEL CHILTERN. I know. And I {{think you}} might have {{mentioned}} <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> am sure I have given you heaps of opportunities.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It beats me--it's bran-new--I've never {{struck the}} mate to <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> But <b>I</b> swear I think you'd do it. Look here, I'll send for the station-master.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I’ll run {{round and}} tell her," [...] said Catesby. [...] "I’d have {{arranged}} <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> only <b>I</b> thought you didn’t {{care about that}} sort of thing." ...|$|R

6000|$|VERNON. Quite right, Bennet. I {{ought to}} have asked for <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> apologise. Will you give your consent to my {{marriage}} with your niece? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir, gone to Rome--to the pope, sir! to the devil, sir! I {{should have}} thought you likely to know of <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> did!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{beautiful}} name, beautiful. Pity I didn't think of <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> wrote the usurper. But I'll {{be ready for}} him when he answers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{long will}} <b>it</b> be <b>before</b> <b>I</b> become an old friend?" [...] Amelius asked. [...] "I mean," [...] he added, with artful emphasis, [...] "an {{old friend of}} yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I know not, {{neither do}} I care: {{but it must}} be a strange road, if I do not find <b>it</b> out <b>before</b> <b>I</b> have eaten up the monster’s carcase.’ ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was no one}} in the {{adjoining}} room. We had searched <b>it</b> thoroughly <b>before</b> <b>I</b> suddenly remembered the visitor who had been the innocent cause of these exciting moments.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; he bade {{me think}} much of <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> did so, as you are concerned. And he said that you might perhaps be disappointed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, there's a real ghost---I {{heard about}} <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> left home," [...] said Carl Dudder. [...] "But I didn't {{think it would}} visit us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{perhaps you}} knew <b>it</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> did, my Lord of Murray," [...] {{answered}} Morton, his dark red brow growing darker and redder as he spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew <b>it</b> all <b>before,</b> <b>I</b> {{believed}} <b>it</b> all before," [...] {{he said at}} length, [...] "but I {{would not}} accept your baptism and {{become a member of}} your Church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It sounds so," [...] {{the girl}} said hesitatingly; [...] "but the idea is so new to me that I must think <b>it</b> over <b>before</b> <b>I</b> can come to any conclusion." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir Mart. Ah Lord, {{what have}} I done! As I {{hope to be}} saved, sir, <b>it</b> was <b>before</b> <b>I</b> was aware; for if ever I set eyes on her <b>before</b> this day, <b>I</b> wish-- ...|$|R
