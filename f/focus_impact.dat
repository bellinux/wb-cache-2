40|$|Regulatory focus theory {{proposes that}} {{decision}} making and goal pursuit occur via either a promotion focus (a sensitivity to gains and a desire for advancement and growth) or a prevention focus (a sensitivity to losses and a desire for stability and security).

We expand research on regulatory focus theory by testing whether chief executive officers’ (CEOs’) regulatory <b>focus</b> <b>impacts</b> the proclivity of firms to undertake acquisitions. Furthermore, regulatory focus theory suggests that the effects of people’s promotion and prevention foci are magnified when their regulatory focus is congruent with salient situational characteristics, a phenomenon known as regulatory fit. As a test of this idea, we demonstrate how the effects of CEO promotion and prevention <b>foci</b> are differentially <b>impacted</b> by one such characteristic, namely incentive compensation. Our findings indicate that CEO regulatory <b>focus</b> <b>impacts</b> both the quantity and scale of acquisitions undertaken by a firm.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although India has a {{long history}} of {{providing}} excellent allopathic medical education, the knowledge about oncology is scattered all over the curriculum, losing <b>focus,</b> <b>impact,</b> and usefulness. METHOD: The World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Cancer Education at the University Medical Center, Groningen in the Netherlands designed a course for Gandhi Medical College Bhopal, which stressed on problem-based teaching of oncology. The idea of the course was to provide multidisciplinary cancer knowledge. It was aimed at cancer care in general practice by creating interaction between patients, students, and teachers, thus making the emphasis and focus of teaching student and patient centered rather then teacher centered. The aim was to assess the feasibility of problem-based teaching of oncology and its effectiveness in medical education in an Indian setting. RESULTS: The undergraduate medical students gave a positive response to this method of teaching, which according to them made various cancers not just a topic to be studied for examination but a problem for the community. We found a perceptible positive change in their knowledge and attitude toward cancer as a manageable and treatable entity. CONCLUSION: Providing cancer education in a problem-based manner is possible in a non-western country once it is adjusted to local needs...|$|E

To achieve this aim, the study integrated two frameworks, Bredahl's, (2001) determinants of attitudes towards GMFs and Wansink and Kim's, (2001) strategies for educating consumers about GMFs, into a new model. To empirically examine the model, a web-based experiment using a 2 x 2 x 2 between-subjects factorial design was conducted. The experiment exposed participants to one of eight treatment groups containing a promotional message for Genetically Modified foods. The participants then completed an on-line questionnaire detailing their responses to the messages. A total of 380 useable questionnaires were collected from a national sample of consumers and analysed using ANCOVA. The results of the study suggest that the outwardly focused, two-sided message was more powerful at lowering perceptions of risks, raising perceptions of benefits and positively influencing attitudes toward the ad than either the one-sided, outwardly focused message, or the inwardly focused messages of either sidedness condition. For purchase intentions individual differences appeared to be of greater influence than message factors...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWearable {{projector}} {{and camera}} (PROCAM) interfaces, which provide a natural, intuitive and spatial experience, {{have been studied}} for many years. However, existing hand input research into such systems revolved around investigations into stable settings such as sitting or standing, not fully satisfying interaction requirements in sophisticated real life, especially when people are moving. Besides, increasingly more mobile phone users use their phones while walking. As a mobile computing device, the wearable PROCAM system should allow {{for the fact that}} mobility could influence usability and user experience. This paper proposes a wearable PROCAM system, with which the user can interact by inputting with finger gestures like the hover gesture and the pinch gesture on projected surfaces. A lab-based evaluation was organized, which mainly compared two gestures (the pinch gesture and the hover gesture) in three situations (sitting, standing and walking) to find out: (1) How and to what degree does mobility influence different gesture inputs? Are there any significant differences between gesture inputs in different settings? (2) What reasons cause these differences? (3) What do people think about the configuration in such systems and to what extent does the manual <b>focus</b> <b>impact</b> such interactions? From qualitative and quantitative points of view, the main findings imply that mobility impacts gesture interactions in varying degrees. The pinch gesture undergoes less influence than the hover gesture in mobile settings. Both gestures were impacted more in walking state than in sitting and standing states by all four negative factors (lack of coordination, jittering hand effect, tired forearms and extra attention paid). Manual focus influenced mobile projection interaction. Based on the findings, implications are discussed for the design of a mobile projection interface with gestures...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{consistently}} reported that an external focus of attention leads to better motor performance than an internal focus, but no research to date has explored this effect in a population with visual impairments (VI). External focus statements typically reference something in the environment (e. g., target) that {{may be difficult to}} conceptualize for people with VI since they cannot generate a visual representation of the object of focus. Internal focus statements could be more closely identifiable with proprioception that is not impaired in this population. Recent studies have reported that sighted adults with temporarily obstructed vision are able to receive an external focus benefit when performing discrete tasks (i. e., golf putt and vertical jump), however, it is unclear if those with VI would experience the same benefit. The purpose of this investigation was to compare how an internal focus and external <b>focus</b> <b>impact</b> the balance of children with VI. Eighteen children with VI were grouped into a moderate (n = 11) and a profound VI group (n = 7). Participants completed a familiarization trial, an internal focus trial (i. e., focusing on feet) and an external focus trial (i. e., focusing on markers) in a counterbalanced order. The moderate VI group had a lower root mean square error while using an external focus (p = 0. 04), while the profound VI group did not differ between conditions (p > 0. 05). These results suggest that while performing a task reliant on sensory feedback, an external focus benefit may be dependent on the severity of VI. Further research is needed to examine whether external focus statements can be presented in a way that may be more intuitive to those with profound VI. These findings may help to influence how professionals in health-related fields (e. g., physical therapist and physical educators) give instructions on motor performance to populations with VI...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{dynamics}} of donor-funded policy and projects in rural Nigeria, bringing out the contending understandings and uses of Community Driven Development (CDD). CDD in an approach to localizing development resources adopted by the Community-Based Poverty Reduction Project (CPRP), a partnership involving the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the Nigerian government in 2001. The study investigated what meanings those described as beneficiaries attach to CDD and associated projects, {{especially in terms of}} how they interact in the latter spaces. Also, the study explored how CDD projects actually work in practice in view of the involvement of differently positioned but related actors and the huge claims made in favour of the approach. Drawing from the fields of anthropology and development studies, the study is ethnographically grounded in a study of the implementation of CDD in Egbeda, a rural village in north central Nigeria which won funding to complete a 20 -year electrification project from the GCPRP, the semi-autonomous agency set up to implement the policy. The literature on CDD tends to <b>focus</b> <b>impact</b> evaluations and on beneficiaries as victims of elite hijack. Overall, a focus on how the organizational objectives of implementers, local State actors and beneficiaries intersect with formal politics during implementation is limited. The study makes a contribution by showing how beneficiaries constrained by cultural forces and a top-down approach to implementation still found ways of exercising agency by re-politicising CDD and projects as a further way of reducing their poverty. It also extends understandings of the dynamics of donor-funded projects by showing that in a highly centralized polity such as Nigeria's, CDD projects work {{to the extent that they}} give concerned development actors a chance to achieve separate 'projects' even if the main project fails to meet set objectives...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) introduced the Ward Health System (WHS) in 200 I to facilitate the provision of sustainable and integrated Primary Health Care (PHC) services by revitalising the principle of community co-ownership and co-management of PHC facilities. To date, {{the extent to which}} the WHS scheme has achieved its objectives remains questionable and a strong case for further re-examination of its structure, process and function, including its overall place in the PHC subsystem has been made. The FGN has also shown considerable interest in attracting the private sector to boost investment and efficiency in the healthcare sector, although it is yet to formulate any strategies towards actualising that desire. Accordingly, this research aimed at developing a sustainable procurement strategy that will facilitate the achievement of community co-ownership or co-management of PHC facilities in Nigeria, was launched. The research utilised the best practices within the UK Local Improvement Finance Trust (LIFT) procurement strategy for integrated primary and social care facilities to recommend practices that can facilitate the achievement of sustained improvement in the Nigerian context. A variety of qualitative and quantitative research methods were employed including interviews, questionnaire survey and focus groups. Strategic evaluation of the WHS model was conducted in Nigeria through exploratory interviews. The investigations indicated that the planning and implementation of on-going strategies lack <b>focus,</b> <b>impact</b> and sustainability. Consequently, further exploratory interviews were undertaken in the UK to investigate some key implementation issues on the LIFT schemes that can be used to promote sustained improvements in the Nigerian context. The best practices identified relate to stakeholder identification, analysis, engagement and aligrunent; defmition of processes, roles, responsibilities and accountabilities; periodic reviews throughout the whole-life cycle of each project; and some new project roles and tasks. Accordingly, a procurement strategy based on the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) principle that will be responsive to the peculiar needs of the host community and have adequate accountability structure for sustaining PHC facilities in Nigeria was proposed. This proposal falls in line with the new macroeconomic strategy adopted for growth and the health reform agenda of the present government, which have variously emphasised the expansion of the approach to improving healthcare delivery through increased private sector participation, whenever feasible. It is expected that the active participation of various components of the communities will offer considerable social and economic benefits such as social inclusion, employment and training opportunities for the members of the host communities in addition to the attainment of other fundamental philosophies of PHC provisioning. In addition, a supplementary questionnaire survey was carried out in Nigeria to investigate the perceptions of Nigerian professionals on the success and risk factors associated with the use of PPPs for infrastructural developments in Nigeria. The results show that seven out of the top ten most important PPP risk factors in Nigeria are endogenous (risk events and consequences of which occur within the system boundaries of the project being considered). The results also show that while the majority of the endogenous risk factors could be assigned to the private sector partner, the public sector should retain political and site acquisition risks, while relationship-based risks should be shared between the private and public sector partners. The three most important PPP success factors in Nigeria were found to be favourable legal framework, well-organised public agency to negotiate on behalf of government and strong private consortium: The comparison of the fmdings of this study with similar previous study in the UK suggests commonalities in the success factors of PPP projects. On the basis of the results of the exploratory interviews and questionnaire survey, focus groups were held to assess the appropriateness of the proposed procurement strategy in the light of on-going procurement and healthcare reforms and recent legislative developments. On the basis of the positive feedback obtained from the validation, a modified procurement strategy was put forward. However, the. need for developing a comprehensive framework for achieving continuous improvement that will make learning followed-through from plarming, design and construction into occupancy, and post occupancy to become a natural part of the process of procuring PHC facilities was highlighted...|$|E

40|$|Perceived {{external}} image {{has been defined}} as employees’ beliefs about how outsiders judge the status and image of theirorganization (Mael and Ashforth, 1992). This perceived {{external image}} may have an impact on organizational members, because itis reflecting the social value assigned by employees to their employer’s identity. Recent researches have underlined the importanceof understanding the influence of perceived organizational image on its members. Although progress has been made inunderstanding how perceived external image relates to workplace outcomes, studies about the effect of perceived organizationalimage on work attitudes and behaviors of managers are very limited in both Turkey and abroad. To our knowledge, there areonly several studies that <b>focus</b> <b>impact</b> of perceived organizational image on individual outcomes such as affective organizationalcommitment, organizational citizenship behaviors, organizational identification, and job satisfaction (Smidts et al., 2001; Herrbachand Mignonac, 2004; Carmeli, 2005). The present study aims to extend the above line of research by examining the impact ofperceived organizational image on managers’ job satisfaction, affective commitment, and organizational citizenship behavior inthe context of Turkey. Hence, this study can contribute to the growing literature by testing the link between perceivedorganizational image and important individual outcomes. Jobs satisfaction is defined as an employee’s overall affective state resulting from an approval of all aspects of his job (Lock, 1976). An employee’s level of satisfaction toward his job varies with specific aspects of the job, including the nature of the work,pay, promotion, coworkers, and organizational context (procedures, working condition). Carmeli and Freund (2002); Herrbachand Mignonac (2004) observed that perceived organizational image is related to job satisfaction. Organizational commitment is defined as a psychological state characterizing an employee’s relationship with the organizationthat has implications for the employee’s decision to remain or leave the organization (Meyer & Allen, 1997). The affectivecommitment is emotional attachment due to positive emotions about the organization (Allen and Meyer, 1990). It was found thatthere is a positive relation between affective commitment and perceived organizational image (Carmeli and Freund, 2002;Herrbach and Mignonac, 2004). Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is defined as “individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitlyrecognized by the formal reward system, and is the aggregate promotes the effective functioning of the organization” (Organ, 1988 : 5). There is no clear consensus within the literature about the dimensions of OCB. Organ has introduced five componentsof OCB: altruism (e. g., helping behaviors directed specific individual), conscientiousness (e. g., efficient use of time and goingbeyond minimal role requirements), sportsmanship (e. g., tolerating the inevitable inconveniences of work without complaining),courtesy (e. g., informing other to prevent the occurrence of work-related problems), and civic virtue (e. g., participating in the lifeof company). OCB are important for organizational efficiency, effectiveness, innovation, and adaptability within diverse organizations (Cohen and Vigoda, 2000). According to the result of a research conducted by Carmeli and Freund (2002), there is asignificant relation between OCB and perceived organizational image. Based on some empirical evidence (Smidts et al., 2001; Herrbach and Mignonac, 2004; Carmeli, 2005), we developed andtested following hypotheses in this study. H 1 : Perceived organizational image of the respondents differs significantly according to sectors in which they work. H 2 : Perceived organizational image is positively and significantly related with extrinsic job satisfactionH 3 : Perceived organizational image is positively and significantly related with emotional commitmentH 4 : Perceived organizational image is positively and significantly related with organizational citizenship behaviorThe study sample was made up of 200 middle and low level managers working in textile, food and automotive sectors inIstanbul, Turkey. The respondents were selected randomly. The research questionnaires were distributed to the respondents bypollsters. Of the 200 questionnaire, 165 were returned, response rate of 82, 5 percent. Among the participants, 15. 3 percent (23) had high school degree, 72 percent (108) were undergraduate, and 12. 6 percent (19) were graduate. Most of the participants weremale (65. 3 percent). Various measures were {{used in the present study}}. The perceived organizational image was measured by a 7 -item scale adaptedfrom Mael and Ashforth (1992). This measure was adapted to Turkish by researchers according to the method of Bristlin et al. (1973). Job satisfaction was measured by a 6 -item extrinsic satisfaction scale of Weiss et. al (1997). A 6 -item scale of Meyer andAllen (1990) was used to measure affective commitment of the managers. In order to measure organizational citizenshipbehavior, we used a 22 -item scale which developed by Organ and Konovsky (1989); Williams and Anderson (1991). Internalconsistency reliabilities (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient) of the measures which were used in the present study were satisfyingaccording to 0. 7 criterion. We have conducted Pearson correlation, ANOVA and regression analyses to test the research hypotheses. The result ofANOVA revealed that perceived organizational image of the managers did not vary significantly according to sectors in whichthey work. Hence, the H 1 was rejected. On the other hand, the other hypotheses, H 2, H 3, and H 4 are supported according toresults of both Pearson correlation and regression analyses. The findings showed that perceived organizational image affected jobsatisfaction, affective commitment and organizational citizenships behavior. The relation between the perceived organizationalimage and the other variables was low, but significant. The findings of the study support the mounting body of evidence pointingto the idea that perceived organizational image may affect mangers’ workplace behaviors and attitudes outcomes such as affectiveorganizational commitment, organizational citizenship behaviors, and job satisfaction. Our research provides support that internaland external factors of organizational affect each other. How external costumers see an organization may influence some attitudesand behaviors of organization members. Hence, employers should take into consideration that by fostering their company image;they enhance job satisfaction, commitment, and organizational citizenship behaviors of internal members of organization. Several limitations suggest that the research be viewed cautiously. First, common method bias is always an issue in surveyresearch due to gathering data from single respondent. Second limitation of the study was that it was a cross-sectional one. Thestudy was conducted in only one part of Turkey, Istanbul. Also, we have targeted managers (white collar employees) as studysample. Conducting future research using a longitudinal design and including blue collar employees and companies whichoperates in different sectors and places might contribute to the generalizability study results...|$|E

The Learning Focused Schools model was implemented to provide comprehensive school reform strategies and solutions based on exemplary practices and research-based strategies. These practices and strategies focus on five areas: Planning, Curriculum, Instruction, Assessment, and School Organization. The study analyzed the effects of the Learning Focused Schools model on the school culture and how that, in turn, affects the academic achievement of the students. The researcher compiled and analyzed data from the North Carolina Teacher Working Conditions Surveys that were administered before, during, and after the full implementation of the Learning Focused Schools model. The Learning <b>Focused</b> <b>Impact</b> Survey was developed and administered to teachers at the school to gain insight into the culture of the school and how much of an effect on that culture occurred due to the implementation of the Learning Focused Schools model.
