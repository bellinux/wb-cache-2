40|$|One of {{the main}} factors that affects the {{performance}} of MLP neural networks trained using the backpropagation algorithm in mineral-potential mapping isthe paucity of deposit relative to barren training patterns. To overcome this problem, random noise {{is added to the}} original training patterns in order to create additional synthetic deposit training data. Experiments on the effect of the number of deposits available for training in the Kalgoorlie Terrane orogenic gold province show that both the classification performance of a trained network {{and the quality of the}} resultant prospectivity map increasesignificantly with increased numbers of <b>deposit</b> <b>patterns.</b> Experiments are conducted to determine the optimum amount of noise using both uniform and normally distributed random noise. Through the addition of noise to the original deposit training data, the number of <b>deposit</b> training <b>patterns</b> is increased from approximately 50 to 1000. The percentage of correct classifications significantly improves for the independent test set as well as for <b>deposit</b> <b>patterns</b> in the test set. For example, using ± 40 % uniform random noise, the test-set classification performance increases from 67. 9 % and 68. 0 % to 72. 8 % and 77. 1 % (for test-set overall and test-set <b>deposit</b> <b>patterns,</b> respectively).

In {{this paper}} we use Molecular Dynamics {{to simulate the}} evaporation of salt water nanodroplets {{in the presence of}} an applied electric field. We demonstrate, for the first time, that electrowetted nanodroplets can produce various <b>deposit</b> <b>patterns,</b> which vary substantially from the original ring-like deposit that occurs when there is no electric field. If a direct current (DC) electric field with strength greater than 0. 03 V/Å is imposed parallel to the surface, after the water evaporates the salt crystals form a deposit on the substrate in a ribbon pattern along the field direction. However, when an alternating current (AC) electric field is applied the salt <b>deposit</b> <b>patterns</b> can be either ring-like or clump, depending on the strength and frequency of the applied AC field. We find that an AC field of high strength and low frequency facilitates the regulation of the deposit patterns: the threshold electric field strength for the transition from ring-like to clump is approximately 0. 006 V/Å.

40|$|The solid {{surfaces}} used in evaporation {{studies of}} nanoparticle sessile droplets usually exhibit significant surface roughness, causing significant pinning of the three-phase contact lines and producing {{different types of}} nanoparticle deposits, from single and multiple coffee rings (formed at the initial pining of triple contact lines) to central bumps. Here we used nanometer-scale smooth hydrophobic surfaces to investigate the evaporation of sessile water droplets containing silica nanoparticles and organic pigment nanoparticles. We observed {{a new type of}} coffee ring deposits which were not formed at the initial pinning but at the later pinning. We referred them to as the inner coffee ring deposits (ICRDs). The radius of ICRDs was smaller than the radius of the initially pinned contact area and increased with increasing concentration of added salts and nanoparticles and with increasing contact angle hysteresis of hydrophobic surfaces. We also observed different dendrite <b>deposit</b> <b>patterns</b> inside ICRDs.

This article presents a deployment strategy of multiple droplets of different colloidal composition and utilizes the inherent capillary flow driven self assembly of nanoparticles to construct stacks of multiple materials {{on a given}} glass substrate. Here we used aqueous nano-crystalline titania and nano-amorphous silica solutions as the two materials. Initially, a pure nanotitania (nanosilica) droplet is deployed and allowed to dry partially. Subsequently, a second droplet of pure nanosilica (nanotitania) is deployed co-axially on the partially dried precipitate. The proposed deployment strategy allowed significant morphological differences when the deployment order of nanosilica and nanotitania were interchanged. Compositional analysis performed using EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) showed preferential deposition of nanosilica and nanotitania along the radial {{as well as the}} axial plane of the final <b>deposit</b> <b>pattern.</b> The underlying mechanism for such a phenomenon could be attributed to the contact line dynamics of a sessile double droplet.

Overall, this work elucidates the evaporation driven dynamics of a mixed colloidal system which displays both macroscopic as well as microscopic phenomena.

The particulate gravity currents were initiated by releasing a fixed volume of fluid consisting of pure water mixed with silicon carbide particles from a lock {{at one end of}} the tank. The resulting motion and <b>deposit</b> <b>pattern</b> differ significantly from those for the propagation of a particulate gravity current along a flat-bottomed tank. The front of the current, seen from above, is approximately parabolic (with axis parallel to the flow direction) in contrast to the current in a flat-bottomed tank where it is nearly a straight line perpendicular to the flow. This feature mimics the results for pure saline currents. When seen in profile the currents do not have a clearly defined raised head, which is a feature of the flat-bottomed currents. The mass deposited per unit area varies nearly monotonically with respect to distance down the tank, again in contrast to the case of the flat-bottomed tank. The exceptions to this are the two experiments which have the highest ratio of lock height to length. The mass deposited per unit area across the V-shaped valley is much larger in the central part of the valley than it is on the flanks for any position along the valley. We find that the results can be described with remarkable accuracy by a box model using a generalization of the equation for sedimentation from a turbulent medium due to Martin and Nokes.

ConclusionThe research described in this thesis was conducted with the aim of finding a versatile group of organic semiconducting and conducting materials {{that could be used in}} a practical manner for the production of organic field effect transistors (OFETs) via a direct photopatterning process. It was established that a suitable class of materials – photosensitive Diels-Alder bridged pentacene precursors – already existed, but had not been fully exploited for this purpose. Calculations of synthetic UV-visible, infrared and partial density of states spectra, based on models of single molecules with geometries optimised using density functional theory, proved to be useful in understanding the photochemical properties of existing semiconductor materials and precursors. The viability of these calculations was tested by comparing them with the UV-visible spectra and synchrotron based x-ray photoelectron, x-ray emission and near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectra of a series of robust n-type organic semiconductors with shared perylene core structures. Narrowband UV exposures of 6, 13 -dihydro- 6, 13 -methanopentacene- 15 -one (6, 13 -MPn) and 5, 14 -dihydro- 5, 14 -methanopentacene- 15 -one (5, 14 -MPn) were carried out. It was found that they were sensitive to light with wavelengths < 325 nm and < 315 nm, respectively. The difference in the photosensitivity of the two pentacene precursors was utilised in a study of the means to independently pattern multiple layers of electronically active materials. It was also found that patterns could be transferred to films of the organic conductor PEDOT:PSS by photobleaching and that the resistance of the films changed in a predictable manner. Following this, the performance of OFETs produced using 6, 13 -MPn and 5, 14 -MPn as precursors for the active semiconductor layers was studied. A measureable increase in conductivity through the source-drain channel of 6, 13 -MPn and 5, 14 -MPn based transistors resulted when they were illuminated with broadband light and simultaneously annealed at 95 ˚C and 90 ˚C, respectively. Exposing the 6, 13 -MPn precursor to filtered light in the range from 270 - 340 nm once again resulted in conversion to a semiconductor with gate voltage enhanced mobility. In the case of the 5, 14 -MPn transistor, the output curves appeared to be affected by carrier trapping. Following the studies on the precursors of pentacene, a new range of photoprecursors for semiconductors containing thiophene rings was proposed. The photolysis wavelengths of these materials were predicted by investigating the synthetic UV-visible absorption spectra of the materials.

40|$|The Kalgoorlie Terrane of the Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, {{containing}} {{about 60}} % (~ 11 Mt) of the world’s known komatiite-hosted nickel sulphide resources, is the world’s best studied and economically most important province for this mineral deposit type. Although increasingly mature {{in terms of}} nickel exploration, the Kalgoorlie Terrane is believed to contain significant additional undiscovered nickel endowment. Using the data-rich Kalgoorlie Terrane, this thesis develops a benchmark methodology that combines geological knowledge with spatial analysis and mathematical-statistical methods to estimate undiscovered nickel resources. In the proposed methodology, nickel sulphide deposits are considered realisations of stochastic mineralisation processes and are analysed within the following framework. Komatiites in the Kalgoorlie Terrane constitute the full sample space or the permissive tract. Disjoint, naturally bound individual komatiite bodies {{that make up the}} sample space are used as the spatial analysis units. Some komatiite bodies within the sample space contain nickel sulphide deposits (mineralised) and others do not (unmineralised). In this study, the most explored mineralised komatiite bodies constitute local control areas against which nickel resources in the less explored komatiite bodies can be assessed. The concept of local control areas is analogous to the concept of global control areas which are well explored parts of permissive areas for particular deposit types worldwide. Spatial point pattern analyses showed that the spatial distribution of mineralised komatiite bodies within the sample space is clustered. In contrast, nickel sulphide deposits in individual komatiite bodies are either randomly distributed or dispersed, and not clustered. This absence of deposit clustering within individual komatiite bodies indicates that the intensity of the <b>deposit</b> <b>pattern</b> of each komatiite body may be adequately expressed as deposit density (number of deposits per km[superscript] 2). In global quantitative resource assessments, regression analysis of the well established power law relationship between deposit density and size of global control areas provides a robust method for estimating the number of deposits. In this study a power law relationship reminiscent of that in global models was found between the sizes of control areas and deposit density. In addition, this study establishes another power law relationship between nickel endowment density (nickel metal per km[superscript] 2) and the sizes of control areas. Deposit and endowment density regression models based on the two power laws suggested that, respectively, 59 to 210 (mean 114) nickel sulphide deposits and 3. 0 to 10. 0 Mt (mean 5. 5 Mt) nickel metal remained undiscovered in demonstrably mineralised komatiite bodies within the Kalgoorlie Terrane. More emphasis is placed on endowment density which may be more intrinsic to the Kalgoorlie Terrane than deposit density because deposit counts are confounded by definitional ambiguities emanating from orebody complexities. Thus the spatial pattern of mineral deposits may not coincide with the spatial pattern of mineral endowment as demonstrated by spatial centrographic analyses in this study. To estimate the amount of undiscovered nickel metal in the entire Kalgoorlie Terrane and not just in the demonstrably mineralised komatiite bodies, Zipf’s law was applied. According to Zipf’s law, the size of the largest deposit is twice the size of the second, thrice the size of the third, four times the fourth, and so on. Based on the currently known size of Mt. Keith deposit, the largest nickel sulphide deposit in the Kalgoorlie Terrane, Zipf’s law indicates that the terrane is nearly mature in terms of nickel exploration and contains only about 3. 0 Mt nickel metal in undiscovered resources. The collective implication of the regression and Zipf’s law estimates is that in the Kalgoorlie Terrane, no significant nickel resources are likely to be contained in the known komatiites that are presently not demonstrably mineralised. However if, as widely speculated, the actual size of Mt. Keith deposit is about twice the currently known size, Zipf’s law predicts 10. 0 Mt nickel metal in undiscovered nickel endowment for the Kalgoorlie Terrane. The additional 7. 0 Mt undiscovered nickel metal endowment is attributed to opening up of a new exploration search space through deeper resource delineation, within an otherwise nearly mature terrane...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} general {{methodology}} to pattern functional materials on the nanometer scale using self-assembled molecular templates on conducting substrates. A soft lithographic gas phase edge patterning process using poly(dimethylsiloxane) molds {{was employed to}} form electrically isolating organosilane patterns of a few nanometer thickness and a line width that could be tuned by varying the time of deposition. Electrodeposition was employed to <b>deposit</b> <b>patterns</b> of Ni and ZnO on these prepatterned substrates. Deposition occurred only on patches of the substrate where no organosilane monolayer was present. The process is simple, inexpensive, and scalable to large areas. We achieved formation of metallic and oxide material patterns with a lateral resolution of 80 n...|$|R
40|$|This study explores {{patterned}} {{deposition of}} cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystalline quantum dot (NQD) thin films on paper substrates using {{the process of}} mist deposition. Potential applications of the process include security/anti-counterfeiting patterns and identification labels. Barcode-like patterned NQD films were successfully deposited {{on a range of}} substrates, including various types of paper. The films were characterized for fluorescence intensity, spectrum and quality of pattern transfer from shadow mask to the deposited film. Time dependent degradation of the <b>deposited</b> <b>pattern</b> was among key aspects investigated. The results obtained indicate that NQD films deposited on paper and protected against exposure to ambient air using plastic laminate maintain integrity and show negligible degradation in photoluminescence intensity {{over a period of several}} weeks...|$|R

The linking feature is a narrow constriction which separates features when the sidewall spacer is <b>deposited</b> and <b>patterned.</b> Line jogs, possibly track changing, are necessary to establish the linking feature.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe coffee-ring effect {{denotes the}} {{accumulation}} of particles {{at the edge of}} an evaporating sessile drop pinned on a substrate. Because it can be detected by simple visual inspection, this ubiquitous phenomenon can be envisioned as a robust and cost-effective diagnostic tool. Toward this direction, here we systematically analyze the deposit morphology of drying drops containing polystyrene particles of different surface properties with various proteins (bovine serum albumin (BSA) and different forms of hemoglobin). We show that <b>deposit</b> <b>patterns</b> reveal information on both the adsorption of proteins onto particles and their reorganization following adsorption. By combining pattern analysis with adsorption isotherm and zeta potential measurements, we show that the suppression of the coffee-ring effect and the formation of a disk-shaped pattern is primarily associated with particle neutralization by protein adsorption. However, our findings also suggest that protein reorganization following adsorption can dramatically invert this tendency. Exposure of hydrophobic (respectively charged) residues can lead to disk (respectively ring) deposit morphologies independently of the global particle charge. Surface tension measurements and microscopic observations of the evaporating drops show that the determinant factor of the deposit morphology is {{the accumulation of}} particles at the liquid/ gas interface during evaporation. This general behavior opens the possibility to probe protein adsorption and reorganization on particles by the analysis of the <b>deposit</b> <b>patterns,</b> the formation of a disk being the robust signature of particles rendered hydrophobic by protein adsorption. We show that this method is sensitive enough to detect a single point mutation in a protein, as demonstrated here by the distinct patterns formed by human native hemoglobin h-HbA and its mutant form h-HbS, which is responsible for sickle cell anemia...|$|R
40|$|In this {{experimental}} investigation the evaporative behaviour {{of liquid}} droplets of both pure fluids and fluids containing nanoparticles was studied. Initial {{tests were conducted}} on drops of pure volatile liquids using IR thermography, {{and the effect of}} substrate material, drop composition, and substrate temperature was investigated. The effect of the addition of nanoparticles to the liquid drops was then investigated using a contact angle analyser which could record the drop profile in time. The effects of liquid composition, nano-particle composition, nanoparticles concentration, substrate hydrophobicity, and substrate temperature were all studied. Results obtained from IR thermography showed that there exists interfacial temperature instabilities in evaporating volatile drops, the appearance of these fluctuations was found to be dependent on the liquid and substrate in question and are self generated temperature gradients resulting from non-uniform evaporation. A stability analysis was conducted and the results give a good agreement with experimental results. The addition of nanoparticles to a liquid drop was found to alter the evaporative behaviour by enhancing pinning of the drop contact line and preventing the drop radius from shrinking. By manipulating the concentration of the particles suspended in a drop, a stick-slip evaporative process was achieved, leading to rings of particulate material formed upon total evaporation. By varying parameters such as substrate hydrophobicity, nanoparticle concentration, liquid composition, and substrate temperature, many distinct nanoparticle <b>deposit</b> <b>patterns</b> were observed upon total evaporation. It was shown that by varying these parameters, many different patterns could be achieved, and that inside these <b>deposit</b> <b>patterns</b> regular formations such as particulate rings, radial lines, and cellular structures were present.
