500|$|In 1904, in {{his early}} twenties, Joyce emigrated {{permanently}} to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife) Nora Barnacle. They lived in Trieste, Paris and Zurich. Though {{most of his adult}} life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe centres on Dublin, and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of Ulysses, he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, [...] "For myself, I always write about Dublin, because <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an August 2010 interview, Norton {{revealed}} {{that he would be}} interested in a run with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. At the time, Norton lived in Brentwood, Tennessee, which is located minutes outside of TNA's headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee and commented that wrestling is, [...] "something I enjoy doing. You miss it. I can still perform at a high level. [...] I’m still a big, strong man. I would like to give it another shot. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a couple-year run, I'll fold up my tent and call it a day." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1st Rhodesia Regiment briefly garrisoned Bloemfontein, then served {{alongside}} the South African forces in South-West Africa {{during the first}} half of 1915. The campaign made a strong impression on Harris, particularly the long desert marches—some three decades later, he wrote that [...] "to this day I never walk a step <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> any sort of vehicle to carry me". South-West Africa also provided Harris with his first experience of aerial bombing: the sole German aircraft in South-West Africa attempted to drop artillery shells on his unit, but failed to do any damage.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{break in}} filming of The Late Late Show with James Corden carpool karaoke segment which aired on June 14, 2016 and {{featured}} the band singing karaoke to their music with the host while driving through Los Angeles, Kiedis performed emergency CPR on a baby. [...] "a woman {{came out of her}} house, holding a child saying, 'My baby, my baby, my baby can't breathe!'" [...] Kiedis said. [...] "the woman thrust the baby into my arms, the baby was not breathing and I thought, 'I'm gonna try and do a little baby CPR real quick, see <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> some air in this kid. So I started rubbing the belly, bubbles came out of the mouth, the eyes rolled back into place, the ambulance showed up and I handed the baby over, who was now breathing and fine, and we went back to Carpool Karaoke." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Matter enough," [...] grumbled Bumble the Bee. [...] "I've {{got to make}} a sack of honey, and as if that isn't enough, old Mother Nature {{has ordered}} me to carry a sack of gold from each flower I visit to the next flower <b>I</b> visit. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> no honey.

2500|$|The music {{industry}} suggested that iPods {{have a substantial}} and legitimate commercial use in contrast to Grokster, to which Souter replied, [...] "I know perfectly well that I can buy a CD {{and put it on}} my iPod. But I also know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> music without buying it, I'm going to do so." [...] On the other hand, the justices seemed troubled at the prospect of ruling that Grokster's alleged business model of actively inducing infringement and then reaping the commercial benefits was shielded from liability. Grokster argued that affirming the Ninth Circuit would only prevent an injunction against future use of the P2P software, while the plaintiffs would still be free to pursue damages in the district court for alleged past wrongful acts. Much of the Court, however, expressed skepticism that Grokster's continuing enterprise could be severable from the consequences of those prior acts.|$|E
