5|$|After {{only six}} games in Milwaukee, McGrattan was traded {{back to the}} Flames, in {{exchange}} for Joe Piskula, on February 28, 2013. McGrattan's positive influence {{in the locker room}} as a player always prepared to play was cited as a reason why Calgary re-acquired him. The Flames also expected he would add a physical presence to the team, which he did in his re-debut with the Flames, a 4–2 victory over Vancouver that included several hits and a fight with Tom Sestito – his first NHL fight in over a year. He gave the crowd a salute following the fight, sending the fans <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> and earning a ten-minute misconduct. He finished the season with three goals and 49 PIM in 19 games with the Flames, and earned a two-year contract extension from the team.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{began the}} 2013–14 season with further Champions League success in their sights. Celtic were drawn with Cliftonville {{in their first}} {{qualifying}} round and easily disposed of the Northern Irish champions 50 on aggregate. They were next drawn with IF Elfsborg and squeezed by with a 10 aggregate win, with Kris Commons scoring the only goal in the first leg at Celtic Park. Although favoured {{to qualify for the}} group stages with minimal challenge after being drawn with Kazakh champions Shakhter Karagandy, Celtic found themselves losing the first leg in Karagandy 20. Celtic returned to Scotland to an electric atmosphere at Celtic Park in the home leg, in what proved to be the high point of their 2013–14 Champions League campaign. They overcame the 20 deficit to level the aggregate thanks to goals by Kris Commons and Georgios Samaras. James Forrest completed the comeback for Celtic with a 90th-minute strike, sending Celtic Park <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy.</b>|$|E

25|$|Not all bands {{took part}} in Traoré's roots revival. Les Ambassadeurs du Motel formed in 1971, playing popular songs {{imported}} from Senegal, Cuba and France. Les Ambassadeurs and Rail Band were the two biggest bands in the country, and a fierce rivalry developed. Salif Keita, perhaps the most popular singer of the time, defected to Les Ambassadeurs in 1972. This {{was followed by a}} major concert at which both bands performed as part of the Kibaru (literacy) program. The audience fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of excitement and unity, and the concert is still remembered as one of the defining moments in 1970s Malian music.|$|E
25|$|Nier: Automata {{opens with}} 2B and 9S opening {{the way for}} a future {{incursion}} into machine territory, working to clear out machine threats for the local Resistance. With help from Anemone and later Pascal, 2B and 9S defeat multiple machine threats. During their missions, they witness the birth of and later fight Adam and Eve, physical manifestations of the machine network who reveal that their creators were destroyed centuries ago. 2B and 9S also encounter A2, who is on the run from YoRHa. It is revealed that the machines are beginning to feel emotions and gather in groups, and some like Pascal's group have grown tired of fighting. 9S is eventually captured by Adam, who is killed by 2B. Deprived of his brother, Eve goes mad with grief and drives the machines under his command <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy.</b> 2B and 9S kill Eve, but 9S is infected with the machine's logic virus, forcing 2B to kill him. Despite his body dying, 9S's personality is saved in the local machine network, allowing his transfer into a new body. The second playthrough follows the opening narrative from the perspective of 9S, offering new insight into the machines and Adam and Eve. 9S also learns that humanity has been extinct since the events of Nier aside from a server on the moon holding humanity's DNA and history. YoRHa and its mission were created to keep the androids from losing morale. He also encounters a glitch when performing a standard server sync, and halts the procedure for both himself and 2B.|$|E
25|$|The winning ways {{continued}} for United with three home games {{to start the}} month. In the first, United defeated the Columbus Crew 2–0, with two first half goals. The first came on a shot by Espindola that finished off a play that began with a 40-yard run by Rolfe, who got the assist on a perfectly weighted pass through the Crew defense. Espindola had the assist on the second goal with a corner kick to the far post when Sean Franklin volleyed for the goal. Back in goal for this game, Hamid earned yet another shutout. United's impressive home unbeaten streak continued a week later, with a 1–1 draw against Sporting Kansas City. A long pass from Perry Kitchen found Pontius, who chested {{the ball into the}} path of Jairo Arrieta, and Arrieta's shot found the back of the net. United gave away the lead about a minute later, just before halftime, as a cross by Sporting's Roger Espinoza found the foot of Dom Dwyer for the tying goal. Four nights later, United again defended Fortress RFK, against MLS debutantes, Orlando City SC. Missing star striker Espindola due to injury, United started slowly and Orlando capitalized as rookie Cyle Larin, the first pick in the 2015 MLS Superdraft, pounced on a loose ball in the box and beat goalie Bill Hamid. However, United was able to rally with two goals over the final 20 minutes to come away with a 2–1 win and regain the lead in the Supporters Shield race. A free kick by Taylor Kemp found the head of Opare, who was starting in place of the injured Birnbaum. Rolfe got the game-winner, stretching his leg out to get {{on the end of a}} cross by Arrieta, and tipping it in for the goal that sent the crowd <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy.</b>|$|E

The mind control drug is calibrated to drive people <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of shopping, which is why flu shots are administered shortly before Christmas. While Homer is trapped on the Island, he is replaced by a doppelgänger who looks identical to him but speaks with a thick German accent.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Andrew Wilson {{was granted}} a new {{judicial}} hearing in his civil case against Burge by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The ruling {{was based on the}} fact that during the 1989 civil suit, the officers' defense had worked to [...] "immerse the jury in the sordid details of Wilson's crimes." [...] It did not respond to a suspect's [...] "right to be free from torture and the correlative right to present his claim of torture to a jury that has not been whipped <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of hatred".|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weeklys reviewer David Browne praised the use of strings in the song, {{saying that it was}} [...] "whipped <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> by hurricane-like strings". On Mellon Collies entry in Rolling Stones The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, [...] "Tonight, Tonight" [...] was praised as [...] "the Pumpkins at their finest".|$|E

500|$|Hastings Banda, {{the leader}} of the Nyasaland {{nationalist}} cause, returned to the territory in 1958 and began organising opposition to the federation. Having lived outside the territory for more than 25 years and having great difficulty remembering his native African language, he required the assistance of interpreters to communicate with the population, whom he stirred <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> with his speeches. After the Governor and the federal government refused to give Africans a majority in the Legislative Council, he embarked on a speaking tour of the territory. In January 1959, he stated in a speech that he [...] "put Salisbury [...] on fire... I got Salisbury rocking, rocking, and got it awake out of its political sleep...", after which his followers stoned passing cars and police officers.|$|E
500|$|All Hands on the Bad One was {{released}} on May 2, 2000, by the independent record label Kill Rock Stars, which also released the band's previous two albums. The album cover features a photo of Brownstein being hauled off a dance floor. According to Weiss, [...] "She worked herself <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> and passed out. People are laughing in the background because she's wearing a bunny suit." [...] All Hands on the Bad One reached number 177 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart, #12 on the Heatseekers Albums chart, and #5 on the KEXP Top 90.3 Album Chart for 2000. The band promoted the album with a tour across North America and England, featuring old and new songs. The band also did the set-up and sold merchandise themselves.

500|$|Now {{in the key}} of G (two semitones {{down from}} the Get Back performance), [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] begins [...] "dirge"-like with a two-note pedal point {{provided}} by layers of keyboards and acoustic guitars. Only at the one-minute mark, {{at the start of}} verse two, does the rhythm section come in, after which the instruments begin to [...] "break out of their metronomic straitjacket to attain an almost ecstatic release", as Beatles Forever author Nicholas Schaffner put it in 1977. The [...] "balmy" [...] slide guitar passage, supported by Barham's string section, follows this second verse, and from that point on – around 2:38 – the same, circular chord structure continues for the remaining four-and-a-half minutes of the song. The long fade-out sees what Schaffner termed the [...] "pseudo-symphonic tension" [...] burst <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of brass and timpani, further bottleneck soloing, and the [...] "What a pity" [...] mantra joined by [...] "Hey Jude"-style [...] "Na-na-na-na" [...] chorus.|$|E

500|$|Poe {{wrote the}} poem as a narrative, without {{intentionally}} creating an allegory or falling into didacticism. The main {{theme of the}} poem is one of undying devotion. The narrator experiences a perverse conflict between desire to forget and desire to remember. He seems to get some pleasure from focusing on loss. The narrator assumes that the word [...] "Nevermore" [...] is the raven's [...] "only stock and store", and, yet, he continues to ask it questions, knowing what the answer will be. His questions, then, are purposely self-deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss. Poe leaves it unclear if the raven actually {{knows what it is}} saying or if it really intends to cause a reaction in the poem's narrator. The narrator begins as [...] "weak and weary," [...] becomes regretful and grief-stricken, before passing <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> and, finally, madness. Christopher F. S. Maligec suggests the poem is a type of elegiac paraclausithyron, an ancient Greek and Roman poetic form consisting of the lament of an excluded, locked-out lover at the sealed door of his beloved.|$|E
500|$|Dave Zinkoff, {{the public}} address announcer, began announcing Chamberlain's point total after {{each of his}} baskets. With ten minutes {{to play in the}} game, Warriors forward Tom Meschery sensed the team concept {{breaking}} down. The team's offense had shifted to getting Chamberlain the ball and then stopping and watching instead of cutting and moving without the ball. Chamberlain needed 25points with eight minutes remaining to reach 100, a rate equivalent to 150points in a full game. He scored his 79th point with 7:51 left, breaking his own record and sending the crowd <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy.</b> The 4,124 spectators screamed, [...] "Give it to Wilt! Give it to Wilt!" [...] After he reached 80, the crowd yelled for 100. Chamberlain thought, [...] "Man, these people are tough. I'm tired. I've got 80 points and no one has ever scored 80." [...] The Warriors continued giving Chamberlain the ball. Warrior Al Attles later explained, [...] "We wanted that Wilt got the record, because we all liked him." [...] Attles himself led by example, passing up on an easy layup so that Chamberlain could score points 88 and 89, five minutes before the end.|$|E
500|$|Will {{meets his}} friends in a {{restaurant}} with the opened giftthe original La Mariée. They take turns supporting his decision to end the relationship by (halfheartedly) pointing out Anna's flaws. When Spike enters and is told what happened, he promptly calls Will a [...] "daft prick". Will reiterates Anna's last comment and realizes his mistake. They pile into Max's car and race across London to Anna's hotel, where they find that she has checked out and is holding a press conference at the Savoy Hotel. When Will arrives, Anna's publicist is telling the crowd that Anna will be taking time off from making films and leaving the UK that night. Will, {{pretending to be a}} reporter again, admits he made the wrong decision and begs Anna to reconsider. After admitting she would, Anna announces that she will be staying in Britain [...] "indefinitely." [...] Anna and Will smile at one another from across the room as the press goes <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy.</b> A montage shows their wedding and arrival at one of Anna's movie premieres, before ending with them on a bench in the private garden, Will reading to a visibly pregnant Anna.|$|E
