This change in membrane structure, which appears to be caused by the cross-linking of receptors in the plane of the plasma membrane, could be prevented by treating the cells with colchicine before addition of virus and could be reversed by treating the cells with colchicine after addition of virus.

Preliminary studies had already been made on polarographically reduced sodium nitroprusside in form- dimethylamide, and these were extended to 8 -irradiated powder, and a 8 -irradiated single crystal, of sodium nitroprusside. The results obtained from all these studies concurred, and showed the unpaired electron to be primarily in the dZ 2 orbital on iron. This conclusion was confirmed from, observations made on trapped pairs of paramagnetic anions in the irradiated crystal. This was in contrast to the conclusions of Gray and co-workers, who suggested, from their analysis of absorption spectra, that the electron was localised in a ? orbital on the nitrosyl ligand. An E. S. R. study of the dipotassium pentacyanonitrosy 1 -manganate II (d 5) showed that the unpaired electron was primarily in a dxy orbital on the manganese. This conclusion was the same as that reached from work on the isoelectronic chromium complex, by other workers. Solutions of sulphur in 65 % oleum are blue, and contain free radicals, uncharged and in low abundance, which slowly decompose to a diamagnetic species.

It was suggested that the thermal or geothermal stressing history of the metamorphic region must have changed the apparent ESR age several cycles in this period. The other possibility should also be considered that annealing and reirradiation processes repeated for many times over a long period might eect the paramagnetic characteristics, such as g (spectroscopic splitting factor) values, hyperne structures of the centers as well as change the ESR ages.

In this study, the angular dependence of the ESR spectra of these centers has been surveyed to understand the influence of heating and reirradiation. Only g values of the Ti centers measured at 100 K could be investigated since their hyperne structure was well-resolved, while the ESR spectra of Al centers were too complex for this investigation. The principal values and direction cosines of the g-tensor of the Ti centers were calculated to be nearly the same for natural, irradiated and irradiated-annealed-reirradiated samples.

40|$|Ca 2 + uptake by {{membrane}} fractions from barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv CM 72) roots was characterized. Uptake of 45 Ca 2 + {{was measured}} in membrane vesicles obtained from continuous and discontinuous sucrose gradients. A single, large peak of Ca 2 + uptake coincided with the peak of proton transport by the tonoplast H+-ATPase. Depending on the concentration of Ca 2 + in the assay, Ca 2 + uptake was inhibited 50 to 75 % by those combinations of ionophores and solutes that eliminated the pH gradient and membrane potential. However, 25 to 50 % of the Ca 2 + uptake in the tonoplast-enriched fraction was not sensitive to ionophores but was inhibited by vanadate. The results suggest that 45 Ca uptake was driven by the low affinity, high capacity tonoplast Ca 2 +/nH+ antiporter and also by a high affinity, lower capacity Ca 2 +-ATPase. The Ca 2 +-ATPase {{may be associated with}} tonoplast, Golgi or contaminating vesicles of unknown origin. No Ca 2 + transport was specifically associated with the distinct peak of endoplasmic reticulum that was identified by NADH cytochrome c reductase, choline phosphotransferase, and dolichol-P-man-nosyl synthase activities.

To study these inhomogeneities one has to use local probe techniques which can distinguish electronic, magnetic and structural variations at the nanoscale. In the present work the high-field <b>electron</b> <b>spin</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>technique</b> (HF-ESR) is used to probe electronic and magnetic inhomogeneities in two transition-metal element based systems with very different properties. The first system is an iron based hightemperature superconductor, namely a member of a so called 1111 -family, the (La,Gd) O 1 −xFxFeAs compound. Our HF-ESR spectroscopy study on Gd 3 + ion has revealed that this material exhibits anisotropic interaction between Gd and Fe layers, which is frustrated in the absence of an external magnetic field. Moreover, the study of the superconducting samples has shown a coexistence of a static short range magnetic order with superconductivity up to high doping levels. The second system is a lightly hole doped cubic perovskite LaCoO 3. Here, our HF-ESR investigation, complemented with static magnetometry and nuclear magnetic <b>resonance</b> <b>techniques,</b> has established that the hole doping induces a strong interaction between electrons on neighboring Co ions which leads to a collective high-spin state, called a spin-state polaron. These polarons are inhomogeneously distributed in the nonmagnetic matrix. This thesis is organized in three chapters. The first chapter gives basic ideas of magnetism in solids, focusing on the localized picture. The aim of the second chapter is to introduce the method of ESR. The third chapter is dedicated to the study of 1111 -type iron arsenide superconductors. In the first part X-band (9. 5 GHz) ESR measurements on 2 % and 5 % Gd-doped LaO 1 −xFxFeAs are presented. In the second part a combined investigation of the properties of GdO 1 −xFxFeAs samples by means of thermodynamic, transport and high-field <b>electron</b> <b>spin</b> <b>resonance</b> methods is presented. The last, fourth chapter presents the investigation of the unexpected magnetic properties of lightly hole-doped LaCoO 3 cobaltite by means of the <b>electron</b> <b>spin</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>technique</b> complemented by magnetization and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a direct {{measurement}} of the pair-wise anti-symmetric exchange interaction, known as the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI), in a Nd 3 +-doped YVO 4 crystal. To this end we introduce a broadband <b>electron</b> <b>spin</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>technique</b> coupled with an optical detection scheme which selectively detects only one Nd 3 +-Nd 3 + pair. Using this technique we can fully determine the spin-spin coupling tensor, allowing us to experimentally determine both the strength {{and direction of the}} DMI vector. We believe that this ability to fully determine the interaction Hamiltonian is of interest for studying the numerous magnetic phenomena where the DMI interaction is of fundamental importance, including multiferroics. We also detect a singlet-triplet transition within the pair, with a highly suppressed magnetic-field dependence, which suggests that such systems could form singlet-triplet qubits with long coherence times for quantum information applications...|$|R
40|$|Compressed Pr 0. 5 Ca 0. 5 MnO 3 films (250 nm) {{deposited}} on LaAlO 3 {{have been studied}} by <b>Electron</b> <b>Spin</b> <b>Resonance</b> <b>technique</b> under high frequency and high magnetic field. We show evidences {{for the presence of}} a ferromagnetic phase (FM) embedded in the charge-order phase (CO), in form of thin layers which size depends on the strength and orientation of the magnetic field (parallel or perpendicular to the substrate plane). This FM phase presents an easy plane magnetic anisotropy with an anisotropy constant 100 times bigger than typical bulk values. When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the substrate plane, the FM phase is strongly coupled to the CO phase whereas for the parallel orientation it keeps an independent ferromagnetic resonance even when the CO phase becomes antiferromagnetic.
