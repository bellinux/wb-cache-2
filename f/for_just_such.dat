5|$|In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, {{arrived in}} Virginia, having {{traveled}} south from Avalon, his failed colony on Newfoundland. Calvert was not welcomed by the Virginians, both because his Catholicism offended them as Protestants, {{and because it}} was no secret that Calvert desired a charter for a portion of the land that the Virginians considered their own. After a brief stay, Calvert returned to England to press <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a charter, and Claiborne, in his capacity as Secretary of State of Virginia colony, was sent to England to argue the Virginians' case. This happened to be to Claiborne's private advantage, as he was also trying to complete the arrangements for the trading post on Kent Island.|$|E
5|$|Despite its post-revolutionary mythology, {{the march}} {{was not a}} {{spontaneous}} event. Numerous calls for a mass demonstration at Versailles had already been made; the Marquis of Saint-Huruge, one of the popular orators of the Palais-Royal, had called <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a march in August to evict the obstructionist deputies who, he claimed, were protecting the king's veto power. Although his efforts were foiled, revolutionaries continued {{to hold onto the}} idea of a march on Versailles to compel the king to accept the Assembly's laws. Speakers at the Palais-Royal mentioned it regularly throughout the next month, creating enduring suspicions of the proprietor, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. The idea of a march on Versailles was widespread, and was even discussed {{in the pages of the}} Mercure de France (5 September 1789). A menacing unrest was in the air, and many nobles and foreigners fled the oppressive atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|On 24 October, The Austro-German 14th Army under General der Infanterie Otto von Below inflicted a great defeat on the Italian Army at the Battle of Caporetto. In {{fear that}} Italy might {{be put out}} of the war, the French and British Governments each promised to send six {{divisions}} to the Italian Front. All troops were rapidly and efficiently transferred between 10 November and 12 December, due to good administrative preparations made by the French Chief of Staff Ferdinand Foch, who {{had been sent to}} Italy in April 1917 to plan <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> an emergency. The Third Battle of Ypres came to an unsatisfactory close {{as a result of the}} diversion of British forces, with Haig being forced to end his advance just short of Westroosebeke.

5|$|South Vietnamese {{forces had}} been rehearsing <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> an {{operation}} since late March. On 27 April, an ARVN Ranger Battalion had advanced into Kandal Province {{to destroy a}} communist base. Four days later other South Vietnamese troops drove 16 kilometers into Cambodian territory. Lon Nol, who had initially attempted to follow a neutralist policy of his own, requested military aid and assistance from the U.S. government on 14 April. On that day, South Vietnamese forces then conducted {{the first of three}} brief cross-border operations under the aegis of Operation Toan Thang (Complete Victory) 41, sending armored cavalry units into regions of Cambodia's Svay Rieng Province nicknamed the Angel's Wing and the Crow's Nest. On 20 April, 2,000 South Vietnamese troops advanced into the Parrot's Beak, killing 144 PAVN troops. On 22 April, Nixon authorized American air support for the South Vietnamese operations. All of these incursions into Cambodian territory were simply reconnaissance missions in preparation for a larger-scale effort being planned by MACV and its ARVN counterparts, subject to authorization by Nixon.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin in March 1953, the new {{collective}} Soviet leadership started to advocate a New Course. Moscow favored replacing East Germany's Stalinist party leader Walter Ulbricht and made inquiries about Rau as a potential candidate. In response, the leading SED party ideologist, Rudolf Herrnstadt, a candidate member of the Poliburo, with assistance from Rau drew up a concept <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>such</b> a New Course in East Germany. However, the workers' uprising, which was suppressed by the Soviet army on 17June led to a backlash. Three weeks later, during a session of the then eight person Politburo (plus six candidate members) on 8July 1953, Rau made a recommendation that Ulbricht be replaced, while Rau's Spanish Civil War comrade, Stasi chief Wilhelm Zaisser, who in Spain had been known as 'General Gómez', accused Ulbricht of having perverted the party. The majority was against Ulbricht. His only supporters were Hermann Matern and Erich Honecker. At that moment however there was no viable candidate who could replace Ulbricht immediately. Suggested were first Rudolf Herrnstadt and then Heinrich Rau, but both were hesitant, thus a decision was postponed. The very next day after the meeting Ulbricht went by plane to Moscow and the Soviet leadership, who in part also feared that deposing Ulbricht might be construed {{as a sign of}} weakness, now secured Ulbricht's position. Subsequently, five members and candidate members of the Politburo lost their positions.|$|E

25|$|Page 13 - Finally, a word {{should be}} said for the inestimable value of the Type JR-1 relay {{operated}} battle lanterns, which were the only source of illumination after the ship's lighting system failed.

This is twice the number shown in the ship's machinery allowance book. The excess was obtained through an error, but in view of this experience it is believed that the quantity of 110 is the acceptable minimum for cruisers.
