5|$|The {{bridge was}} closed to motor {{vehicles}} on 15 February 2010 for refurbishment and strengthening. It was originally expected to remain closed for approximately 18 months, but after {{the condition of the}} bridge was found to be worse than expected, it was closed for 22 months. All of the timber in the decking as well as the <b>footway</b> that had rotted away were replaced, with additional timber added for strengthening. Surfaces at the carriageway and pavement decking were replaced. New steel structures were added to strengthen the bridge. All the lightbulbs were changed to more energy-efficient ones. The tollbooths were refurbished. All twelve layers of paint were stripped down until the bare metal was exposed, which was repaired and treated before three new coats of paint were added. The whole project cost £7.2 million of which the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea provided 25% of the cost and the other 75% was provided by Transport for London.|$|E

25|$|Now Hudson {{was intent}} on {{capturing}} the line to Edinburgh for his empire, and he encouraged the development of railway plans to get there; the route such a line might take continued to generate considerable controversy. There was still ambiguity about Hudson's intentions for the bridge—an easier crossing point at Bill Quay, two miles downstream had been considered—and Newcastle Town Council sought undertakings from him. In addition he promised a <b>footway</b> crossing; this was apparently not a sweetener to the Town Council, but a commercial decision, expected to bring in £250 a week. The <b>footway</b> crossing was later extended to include horse drawn vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In Carrington-street and Station-street {{the road}} is {{sufficiently}} wide to allow ordinary vehicle traffic {{on either side of}} the trams, though in Arkwright-street the aspect of the road shows pretty clearly that some difficulty will arise. If a cab is drawn at the side of the road one of the wheels must be drawn at the least a foot upon the <b>footway,</b> otherwise a collision will be inevitable. The same difficulty applies to both side of the way, and as traffic is great in Arkwright-street, the double line will be rather awkward unless the foot-way is reduced.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no single}} usage of segregation; {{in some cases it}} can mean the {{exclusion}} of motor vehicles and in other cases the exclusion of pedestrians as well. Thus, it includes bike lanes with solid painted lines but not lanes with dotted lines and advisory bike lanes where motor vehicles are allowed to encroach on the lane. It includes cycle tracks as physically distinct from the roadway and sidewalk (e.g. barriers, parking or bollards). And it includes bike paths in their own right of way exclusive to cycling. Paths which are shared with pedestrians and other non-motorized traffic are not considered segregated and are typically called shared use path, multi-use path in North America and shared-use <b>footway</b> in the UK.|$|E

25|$|Approaching Churton and Aldford, {{the river}} crosses entirely into England, and passes the grand country house of Eaton Hall, {{seat of the}} Duke of Westminster. It then {{continues}} past the village of Eccleston and beneath the A55 North Wales Expressway, tracing northwards past the Roman Eaton Road to the Chester suburbs of Huntington and Handbridge before reaching the centre of Chester. In the city centre the river passes and around the Earl's Eye(s) meadow at Queen's Park. In this vicinity, the riverside {{is used as a}} recreation area with a bandstand, benches and boat cruises, being crossed by four bridges. The first is the Queen's Park Suspension Bridge, which forms the only exclusively pedestrian <b>footway</b> across the river in Chester. The second is the Old Dee Bridge, a road bridge and by far the oldest bridge in Chester, being built in about 1387 on the site of a series of wooden predecessors which dated originally from the Roman period.|$|E
25|$|Under the superintendence of the engineers, workmen {{were told}} off {{to cut through}} the {{carriage}} and foot roads, that being the only way of preventing the flames from spreading along the bridge. The men worked with good will and soon succeeded in cutting several holes through the asphalte and timber. How to play with the water on the underside was a difficulty soon got over. Four or five men, with a courage most commendable, volunteered to be lowered down, through the holes in the pathway, by means of ropes, enabling them to direct the water directly on to the burning woodwork. For a long time their efforts seemed to be without effect; no sooner was the fire put out {{in one part of the}} bridge than another beam burst into flames. For several hours streams of water were thrown against the bridge, ultimately with success. In order to put the spreading of the fire beyond doubt, the workmen on the bridge cut through the entire width of the carriage and <b>footway,</b> making a gap at both the Newcastle and Gateshead side... In no way, however, is the safety of the bridge endangered. The railway traffic was suspended from about half past eight o'clock in the morning, until two in the afternoon, not from any apprehensions that the upper level was insecure, but on account of the smoke and flames, and also because of the hose which was lying across the rails.|$|E

In order to achieve a sufficiently high clearance above the river channels at high tide, the bridges have graded approaches that increase the roadway elevation.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{designed}} {{a variety of}} other structures, {{one of the most important}} of which was the replacement of Northgate in Chester, at the suggestion of Earl Grosvenor, mayor of the city in 1807. [...] The other three gateways, Eastgate, Bridgegate, and Watergate, which carried the <b>footway</b> of the City Walls over the medieval entrances to the city, had been replaced during the 18thcentury. [...] The earl wanted the structure to be designed in Gothic style, but Harrison advised that it would be more fitting to the adjacent Roman walls for it to be Neoclassical, and after much debate this was accepted. [...] The gateway consists of three arches, a wide central arch for vehicles, and two narrower arches for pedestrians, incorporating pairs of monolithic Doric columns. [...] Harrison then designed Denbighshire Infirmary in North Wales, built between 1810 and 1813, and in about 1820 he made some internal alterations to the Chester Exchange. [...] In 1820 Harrison was consulted by Magdalen College, Oxford, about improvements to New Building, a block of the college built in 1733, and on other alterations. His plans for New Building were adopted, and the additions were made in 1824 at a cost of £2,600 (...) [...]|$|E
500|$|After the clearance, {{development}} progressed slowly. The National Gallery {{was built}} on the north side between 1832 and 1838 to a design by William Wilkins, and in 1837 the Treasury approved Wilkins' plan for the laying out of the square, but it was not put into effect. In April 1840, following Wilkins' death, new plans by Charles Barry were accepted, and construction started within weeks. For Barry, as for Wilkins, a major consideration was increasing the visual impact of the National Gallery, which had been widely criticised for its lack of grandeur. He dealt with the complex sloping site by excavating the main area {{to the level of the}} <b>footway</b> between Cockspur Street and the Strand, and constructing a [...] high balustraded terrace with a roadway on the north side, and steps at each end leading to the main level. Wilkins had proposed a similar solution with a central flight of steps. Plinths were provided for sculpture and pedestals for lighting. All the stonework was of Aberdeen granite. In 1841 it was decided that two fountains should be included in the layout. The estimated budget, excluding paving and sculptures, was £11,000. The earth removed was used to level Green Park. The square was originally surfaced with tarmacadam, which was replaced with stone in the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|The gate, {{which is}} the best-preserved Roman gateway in the country, was built c. AD 70-96. The gatehouse, which {{originally}} had two main arched passageways with separate arched <b>footways</b> on both sides, has largely disappeared. The remaining gateway which we see today is the south-side arched footway; however, {{the remains of a}} guard tower are also visible.From The Balkerne Gate, Colchester by R.E.M. Wheeler (1920): The gate consisted of two broad carriageways, each 17 ft wide, flanked by two <b>footways,</b> each about 6 ft wide.

500|$|It {{has been}} argued that the size and {{technology}} of these revisions was so great that the credit for its design should go to Barlow and Hawkshaw. The towers remained in rough stone, rather than being finished in the Egyptian style. Work on the bridge was restarted in 1862. Initially a temporary bridge was created by pulling ropes across the gorge and making a <b>footway</b> of wire ropes with wood planks held together with iron hoops. This was used by the workers to move a [...] "traveller", consisting of a light frame on wheels, to transport each link individually, which would eventually make up the chains supporting the bridge. The chains are anchored in tapering tunnels, [...] long, {{on either side of the}} bridge and plugs of Staffordshire blue brick infilled to prevent the chains being pulled out of the narrower tunnel mouth. After completion of the chains, vertical suspension rods were hung from the links in the chains and large girders hung from these. The girders on either side then support the deck, which is [...] higher at the Clifton end than at Leigh Woods so that it gives the impression of being horizontal. The strength of the structure was tested by spreading 500tons of stone over the bridge. This caused it to sag by , but within the expected tolerances. During this time a tunnel was driven through the rocks on the Leigh Woods side beneath the bridge to carry the Bristol Port Railway to Avonmouth. The construction work was completed in 1864–111 years after a bridge at the site was first planned.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} his career, Harrison {{worked on}} two bridges in Chester. [...] At the time the only road {{crossing}} over the River Dee was the medieval Old Dee Bridge, which was becoming inadequate for the increasing volume of traffic. [...] In 1825 Harrison added three new arches on the upstream side of the bridge, and built a <b>footway</b> that was corbeled-out, also on the upstream side. [...] Meanwhile, negotiations had been underway for a much more substantial bridge. [...] In 1825 an Act of Parliament was passed for the Grosvenor Bridge to be built downstream from the Old Dee Bridge. [...] To provide access to the new bridge, properties, including a church, had to be demolished, and Harrison was involved in designing the new approach to the bridge, which was named Grosvenor Street. [...] He also prepared three different plans for the bridge, one in iron, the others in stone; one of the stone bridges had three arches, the other a single arch spanning [...] [...] The single-arch bridge would be the longest single-arch stone bridge in the world at the time, and there were doubts about its stability. [...] Harrison's design was supported by the engineers James Trubshaw and John Rennie, and Trubshaw made a limestone model of the bridge to confirm its stability. [...] By this time Harrison was aged over 80, and in 1826 he resigned from the commission. [...] Later that year the design was costed by Thomas Telford, and the town council subsequently accepted the design. [...] Trubshaw {{was in charge of the}} construction, with Jesse Hartley as his clerk-of-works. [...] The foundation stone was laid in 1827 by the Earl of Grosvenor (after whose family the bridge was named), and work began the following year. [...] It was formally opened in 1832 by the future Queen Victoria, and traffic began to cross it the following year. [...] The total cost of the bridge was just under £50,000 (...) [...] [...] Harrison did not live to see it completed, as he died in 1829.|$|E
2500|$|The initial deck layout (from west to east) {{consisted}} of two [...] lanes, an [...] shoulder or [...] "breakdown lane", and a [...] <b>footway.</b> [...] With just a diminutive reinforced concrete kerb to separate pedestrians from [...] passing traffic, {{the use of the}} <b>footway</b> was minimal. [...] The bridge had a southbound breakdown lane, on the basis that the two-way traffic flow was only meant to be temporary.|$|E
