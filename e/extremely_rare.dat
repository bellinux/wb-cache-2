5|$|Ball {{lightning}} is <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> and {{has several}} hypothesized explanations. It {{is seen in}} the form of a 15 to 50 centimeter radius ball.|$|E
5|$|Interfamilial hybrids, such {{as between}} {{chickens}} and guineafowl or pheasants, are reliably described but <b>extremely</b> <b>rare.</b>|$|E
5|$|A solar transit of Venus is an <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> event, and {{the last}} solar transit of the planet before 2004 was in 1882. The most recent solar transit was in 2012; the next one will not occur until 2117.|$|E
5|$|Although corals first {{appeared}} in the Cambrian period, some , fossils are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> until the Ordovician period, 100 million years later, when rugose and tabulate corals became widespread. Paleozoic corals often contained numerous endobiotic symbionts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{one might}} expect stylets to be fossilized since they are made of the mineral calcium phosphate, none have been found. As nemertea are {{otherwise}} completely soft-bodied, one would expect fossils {{of them to be}} <b>extremely</b> <b>rare.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Extremely</b> <b>rare</b> albino individuals, {{sometimes}} called white panthers, also occur among jaguars, {{as with the}} other big cats. As usual with albinos in the wild, selection keeps the frequency close to the rate of mutation.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{symptoms}} of poisoning appear within {{three hours of}} ingestion of the mushroom as visual hallucinations, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, irregular and slow heart beat and agitation. Severe cases involving coma, convulsions, or death are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some American {{alligators}} {{are missing}} an inhibited gene for melanin, {{which makes them}} albino. These American alligators are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> and almost impossible {{to find in the}} wild. They could only survive in captivity, as they are very vulnerable to the sun and predators.|$|E
5|$|The UCSC {{campus is}} also one of the few homes to Mima Mounds in the United States. They are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> in the United States and in the world in general.|$|E
5|$|In principle, the {{simultaneous}} occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit {{of a planet}} is possible. But these events are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> because of their short durations. The next anticipated simultaneous occurrence of a Solar eclipse and a transit of Mercury will be on July 5, 6757, and a Solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is expected on April 5, 15232.|$|E
5|$|Inducing {{vomiting}} with syrup of ipecac has {{no role in}} paracetamol overdose {{because the}} vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine. Liver injury is <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age. Children with accidental exposures do not require gastrointestinal decontamination with either gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or syrup of ipecac.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, male tigers {{participate}} in raising cubs, usually their own, {{but this is}} <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> and not always well understood. In May 2015, Amur tigers were photographed by camera traps in the Sikhote-Alin Bioshpere Reserve. The photos show a male Amur tiger pass by, followed by a female and three cubs within the span of about two minutes.|$|E
5|$|Superior {{mesenteric}} artery syndrome (SMA) is an <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> life-threatening {{condition that}} {{can either be}} congenital and chronic, or induced and acute. SMA Syndrome is characterised by compression of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, and maywhen congenitalresult from a short suspensory muscle. One surgical treatment is Strong's operation, which involves cutting the suspensory muscle, though this is not often carried out.|$|E
5|$|The addax is a {{critically}} endangered species of antelope, as classified by the IUCN. Although <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> in its native habitat due to unregulated hunting, {{it is quite}} common in captivity. The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Western Sahara. It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|A further, albeit rare, {{complication}} of CSF leak is transient quadriplegia {{due to a}} sudden and significant loss of CSF. This loss results in hindbrain herniation and causes major compression of the upper cervical spinal cord. The quadriplegia dissipates once the patient lies supine. An <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> {{complication of}} SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where {{the ability to move}} one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria like archaea are prokaryotic – unicelluar, {{and having}} no cell nucleus or other membrane-bound organelle. Bacteria are microscopic, {{with a few}} <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> exceptions, such as Thiomargarita namibiensis. Bacteria {{function}} and reproduce as individual cells, but they can often aggregate in multicellular colonies. Some species such as myxobacteria can aggregate into complex swarming structures, operating as multicellular groups {{as part of their}} life cycle, or form clusters in bacterial colonies such as E.coli.|$|E
5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance {{on its hind}} legs, usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may jump {{in the air and}} strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} fossil record of bats extends over 50 million years, their fossils are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare.</b> The fossil record of the greater noctule in the Iberian Peninsula {{suggests}} that they lived at different geographical locations from that of today. The fossils of greater noctule are almost non-existent prior to the Miocene epoch. The deterioration of the climate {{at the end of}} Neogene led to the disappearance of tropical species and vespertilionids profited by accessing a wider range of habitats.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, but most of it has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare,</b> but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E
5|$|Francium was {{discovered}} by Marguerite Perey in France (from which the element takes its name) in 1939. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis. Outside the laboratory, francium is <b>extremely</b> <b>rare,</b> with trace amounts found in uranium and thorium ores, where the isotope francium-223 continually forms and decays. As little as 20–30g (one ounce) exists {{at any given time}} throughout the Earth's crust; the other isotopes (except for francium-221) are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. The rate of {{occurrence}} drops off quickly with increasing strength—less than 1% are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger). Outside Tornado Alley, and North America in general, violent tornadoes are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare.</b> This is apparently mostly due to the lesser number of tornadoes overall, as research shows that tornado intensity distributions are fairly similar worldwide. A few significant tornadoes occur annually in Europe, Asia, southern Africa, and southeastern South America, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones like Gonu are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> {{over the}} Arabian Sea, and most storms {{in this area}} tend to be small and dissipate quickly. The cyclone caused 50deaths and about $4.2billion in damage (2007USD) in Oman, where the cyclone was considered the nation's worst natural disaster. Gonu dropped heavy rainfall near the eastern coastline, reaching up to 610mm (24inches), which caused flooding and heavy damage. In Iran, the cyclone caused 28deaths and $ in damage (2007USD).|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg's six stages {{can be more}} {{generally}} grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional. Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in his theory of cognitive development, it is <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities. Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.|$|E
5|$|Notable books set in Ehrhardt {{include the}} Oxford World's Classics series, the New English Bible, the Pelican Shakespeare, the Penguin 60s and Williamson's {{textbook}} Methods of Book Design. It {{has also been}} used by Faber and Faber and The Iconic magazine. An <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> infant variant of the typeface also exists, which {{can be seen in}} the American edition of the book Hey! Get off Our Train by John Burningham.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{examples}} of river steamboats that were {{constructed by the}} Pittsburgh and Mars Works include the Franklin, the Aetna and the Pennsylvania. Another, christened the Oliver Evans but renamed the Constitution by its eventual owners, was lost along with the eleven crew members when its boiler exploded near Point Coupee, Louisiana. Evans was deeply distressed by the news, although he defended the safety of high-pressure engines and cited any explosions as an <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> occurrences.|$|E
5|$|Oxidation states above +2 in an {{uncharged}} {{species are}} <b>extremely</b> <b>rare,</b> although a cyclic mercurinium(IV) cation, with three substituents, {{may be an}} intermediate in oxymercuration reactions. In 2007, a report of synthesis of a mercury(IV) compound, mercury(IV) fluoride, was published,|journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.|date=2007|volume=46|issue=44|pages=8371–8375|doi=10.1002/anie.200703710|pmid=17899620}} but later experiments could not replicate the synthesis. In the 1970s, there was a claim on synthesis of a mercury(III) compound, but it is now thought to be false.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is an <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> metal, {{occurring}} at {{a concentration of}} only 0.005 ppm in Earth's crust. It is sometimes mistaken for silver. Platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum and as alloy with the other platinum-group metals and iron mostly. Most often the native platinum is found in secondary deposits in alluvial deposits. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum-group metals. Another large alluvial deposit is in the Ural Mountains, Russia, {{and it is still}} mined.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{severe weather}} was ongoing {{at the start}} of April 27 and {{continued}} for the entire day virtually unbroken. For the second day in a row, the SPC issued a high risk of severe weather for the Southern United States, and late that morning the SPC increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along a corridor from Meridian, Mississippi, to Huntsville, Alabama, an <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> issuance exceeding the high risk standards. Conditions for tornadoes became increasingly favorable for an extreme tornado outbreak.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the other}} notes issued by this banks range from scarce to rare. The {{banknotes}} from the First National Bank of Porto Rico are particularly scarce, {{this is because}} the institution's issues didn't even reach quantities of 20. Only two bills from the $100 denomination have been known to survive, similarly two from the $20 issue are left, with one of them being acquired by Amon G. Carter before his death. Carter was known to exhibit the piece, but didn't make it available for sale. More than a dozen $10 banknotes survived, seldom appearing at auctions. Other <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> banknotes include the 2 and 4 real notes of 1813 and all of the denominations issued by the Caja de Ahorros de Ponce. In contrast, the paper money used by the Puerto Rico Railroad Company is still known to appear occasionally in the market. Outside of these, the clandestine bills issued by the Central Republican Board of Cuba and Puerto Rico, range from scarce (5-peso bill) to <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> (20-peso notes).|$|E
5|$|The Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> {{species of}} requiem shark, {{in the family}} Carcharhinidae. A small and stocky gray shark, it grows not much longer than , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species can be {{identified}} by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly serrated near the base and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free rear tip. Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and caudal fin lower lobe.|$|E
5|$|The genus Amphidromus {{is unusual}} in that it {{includes}} species that have dextral shell-coiling and species that have sinistral shell-coiling. In addition, some species within this genus are particularly notable because their populations simultaneously include individuals with left-handed and right-handed shell-coiling. This is an <b>extremely</b> <b>rare</b> phenomenon, and very interesting to biologists. Studies focused on the soft anatomy of Amphidromus are scattered and fragmentary. Information on the internal anatomy is known only from a few species, and no larger, comparative morphological study has ever been carried out.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species of}} Pteranodon are {{traditionally}} recognized as valid: Pteranodon longiceps, the type species, and Pteranodon sternbergi. The species differ {{only in the}} shape of the crest in adult males (described above), and possibly in the angle of certain skull bones. Because well-preserved Pteranodon skull fossils are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare,</b> researchers use stratigraphy (i.e. which rock layer of the geologic formation a fossil is found in) to determine species identity in most cases.|$|E
5|$|While {{prohibited}} drugs are generally {{viewed as being}} the most dangerous, the misuse of prescription drugs are linked to more deaths in several countries. Cocaine and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015 the drug most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia was diazepam (Valium). While fatal overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, cocaine and alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as caffeine are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare.</b>|$|E
5|$|Winters are mild with {{frequent}} frosts and cold spells. Temperatures are usually mild {{during the day}} and cold during the night. Most precipitation results from frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and sudestada, which bring long periods of precipitation, cloudiness and cooler temperatures, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. Dull, gray and damp weather characterize winters in the Pampas. Occasionally, tropical air masses from the north may move southward, providing relief from the cool, damp temperatures. Snowfall is <b>extremely</b> <b>rare.</b> When it does snow, it usually lasts for only a day or two.|$|E
5|$|All Assay Commission medals are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare.</b> Except for the 1977 medal, none is {{believed}} to have been issued in a quantity of greater than 200, and in most years fewer than 50 were struck. Additional copies of several 19th-century issues are known to have been illicitly struck; the Mint ended such practices in the early 20th century. The obverse of the 1909 issue, depicting Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, was reused as Cortelyou's entry in the Mint's series of medals honoring Secretaries of the Treasury. The later pieces were struck with a blank reverse, but in the early 1960s, the reverse design from the Assay Commission issue was used with the Cortelyou obverse, and an unknown number sold to the public. The restrikes are said to be less distinctly struck than the originals.|$|E
5|$|Although {{classified}} as poisonous, reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are <b>extremely</b> <b>rare.</b> After parboiling—which weakens its toxicity and {{breaks down the}} mushroom's psychoactive substances—it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound muscimol. The mushroom {{was used as an}} intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.|$|E
