5|$|The soil {{consists}} of young stratified silt loam or very <b>fine</b> <b>sand</b> loam {{which makes the}} subsoil weak in structure with common kankers at only five feet. The course of the rivers within Faisalabad are winding and often subject to frequent alternations. In the rainy season, the currents are very strong. This leads to high floods in certain areas which do last {{for a number of}} days. The Rakh and Gogera canals have encouraged the water levels in the district however the belt on the Ravi River has remained narrow. The river bed does include the river channels which have shifted the sand bars and low sandy levees leading to river erosion.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the bones}} {{collected}} were encased in siltstone nodules surrounded by <b>fine</b> <b>sand</b> and silt, with the rest lying in clay. The bones were disarticulated and scattered over a 5 x 2m (17 x 8ft) area, but most were not far from their natural positions. The position of some bones was disturbed by a bulldozer, and some were broken by mechanical equipment before they were collected. Preparing the specimen was difficult, due to the hardness of the siltstone matrix {{and the presence of}} siderite; acid preparation was attempted, but most of the matrix was removed mechanically. The skeleton consisted of partial skull bones; teeth; cervical, dorsal and caudal vertebrae; ribs; a sternum; coracoids; arm and hand bones; claws; hip bones, and leg bones. The original specimen number was BMNH R9951, but it was later re-catalogued as NHMUK VP R9951.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the species}} of Marginatae {{associated}} with willow, five (I.salicis-herbaceae, I.substellata, I.praetervisa, I.salicis and I.mixtilis) {{can be readily}} distinguished from I.saliceticola as their spores feature distinct, strongly protruding excrescences. In addition, they are found in vastly different habitats: I.mixtilis and I.praetervisa favour willow only in montane habitats, while I.salicis-herbaceae and I.substellata grow exclusively in montane habitats. I.salicis is rare in Nordic countries, and is typically collected from dunes. Of the other two listed by Vauras and Kokkonen, the spores of I.dunensis are distinctly larger and of a different shape to those of I.saliceticola, and the cystidia are shorter. While the species is typically found on the beach, it grows on <b>fine</b> <b>sand,</b> {{and has not been}} recorded in Finland. I.obtusiuscula also has larger spores of a different shape, and they are a darker colour, owing to their thick cell walls. Phylogenetic analysis of the respective internal transcribed spacer sequences has confirmed that I.obtusiuscula and I.saliceticola are separate species.|$|E

25|$|Parrotfish {{are named}} for their parrot-like beaks and bright colours. They are large herbivores that graze on the algae that grows on hard dead corals. Equipped with {{two pairs of}} {{crushing}} jaws and their beaks, they pulverize chunks of algae-coated coral, digesting the algae and excreting the coral as <b>fine</b> <b>sand.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aeolian or eolian (depending on the parsing of æ) is {{the term}} for {{sediment}} transport by wind. This process results {{in the formation of}} ripples and sand dunes. Typically, the size of the transported sediment is <b>fine</b> <b>sand</b> (<1nbsp&mm) and smaller, because air is a fluid with low density and viscosity, and can therefore not exert very much shear on its bed.|$|E
25|$|The 1853 lease {{required}} {{the company to}} reduce the pollution being washed out of its mills and down the beck. Slime pits were dug to catch the <b>fine</b> <b>sands</b> and slimes, which were then treated {{in a number of}} circular buddles. In these, water-borne <b>fine</b> <b>sands</b> were sprayed onto a sloping conical floor. Heavy lead-rich sands and muds settled near the centre of the buddle and lighter waste flowed to the edges. They helped both to increase lead recovery and reduce pollution.|$|R

40|$|The Ecological Status (ES) of {{littoral}} {{coastal waters}} from Catalonia (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea) has been evaluated between 2002 and 2010 using MEDOCC (MEDiterranean OCCidental) index. Macroinvertebrate assemblages inhabiting both littoral <b>fine</b> <b>sands</b> (< 20 m depth) and littoral sandy muds (25 – 35 m depth) have been sampled. The relative abundance of four Ecological Groups (e. g., sensitive, indifferent, tolerant, and opportunistic taxa) {{has been studied}} along a disturbance gradient. Sensitive taxa are often present in disturbed situations, and tolerant species are usually associated {{with the presence of}} opportunistic taxa, both in <b>fine</b> <b>sands</b> and muddy sediments. Sensitive species dominate in sandy habitats, while tolerant species dominate in muddy bottoms. The ES of Catalan coastal waters measured with the samples collected in littoral <b>fine</b> <b>sands</b> has improved since 2002, and all locations rated above a good ES in 2010. The ES measured with the samples collected in littoral sandy muds was above a good ES although the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) was always lower than in littoral <b>fine</b> <b>sands.</b> Consequently, the ES of all water bodies was rated as good or high ES in 2010, and no water body was at risk of noncompliance of Water Framework Directive (WFD) requirements.

25|$|Issues with <b>fine</b> <b>sand</b> {{entering}} the Tavor's chamber, which were identified {{over the two}} years of testing, were rectified by numerous small adjustments. A number of other improvements and changes to the design were also made between 2001–2009. Tavor CTAR-21 bullpup assault rifles saw combat service in Operation Cast Lead, used by Givati Brigade and Golani Brigade, and the soldiers reported the Tavor bullpup assault rifles functioned flawlessly.|$|E
25|$|In the Japanese {{language}} {{the name}} of the city is written using the hiragana syllabary instead of kanji characters because, according to the city, it looks endearing and soft. The name of the city of Uruma comes from a poetic name for Okinawa Island. A folk etymology, which was adopted by the city itself, segments uruma into uru (<b>fine</b> <b>sand</b> or coral in Okinawan) and *ma (island?). Another theory relates it to urumaa, meaning cricket in Okinawan.|$|E
25|$|In 1891 Baron Rothschild {{financed the}} {{development}} of a bottle factory in Tantura, as he planned to use the <b>fine</b> <b>sand</b> on the shore to manufacture glass bottles for the fledging wine industry in Zikhron Ya'akov. A building was constructed under the supervision of Meir Dizengoff, a French glass specialist was brought in, dozens of workers were hired, and three ships were purchased to transport raw material and bottles. But, he abandoned the factory in 1895 after a string of failures.|$|E

The reserve was created in 1993 and encompasses an area of 934,756 hectares. On land, there are arid scrubbrush, coastal dunes and an estuary. It extends into the far upper part of the Gulf of California.|$|E
25|$|When the Basinghall Mining Syndicate {{took over}} the mine in 1936 all the old {{equipment}} in the mill was removed and a completely new electrically-powered plant was designed for high production rates. The entire output of the mine was crushed in a ball mill {{to the size of}} <b>fine</b> <b>sand</b> before being passed into a bank of froth flotation cells. In these, organic oils and acids caused the galena particles to become attached to rising air bubbles to form a grey foam which overflowed a weir at the top. These gave a good separation: concentrates averaged 75% galena and the waste tailings only 0.2% galena. The concentrate was dried, conveyed to ore-bins and then hand-loaded onto lorries for carriage to smelting mills at Ryton near Newcastle upon Tyne. However the ball mill was unable to cope with the high volumes of ore in the early 1940s. New concentrating tables were introduced. By the 1950s these processed 60% of the ore and produced concentrates of 82% galena. The remaining 40% of ore went to the ball mill and froth flotation plant.|$|E

25|$|The northwestern {{corner of}} Whitchurch–Stouffville {{is outside the}} moraine and {{is part of the}} Schomberg Lake plain, an ancient lake-bed overlain by silts and <b>fine</b> <b>sands.</b> The soil formed over the former lake-bed is well-drained, arable farmland.|$|R
25|$|With 80–90% of {{oil spill}} costs {{invested}} in shoreline cleanup, {{there is a}} search for more efficient and cost-effective methods to extract oil spills from the shorelines. Biodiesel has displayed its capacity to significantly dissolve crude oil, depending on {{the source of the}} fatty acids. In a laboratory setting, oiled sediments that simulated polluted shorelines were sprayed with a single coat of biodiesel and exposed to simulated tides. Biodiesel is an effective solvent to oil due to its methyl ester component, which considerably lowers the viscosity of the crude oil. Additionally, it has a higher buoyancy than crude oil, which later aids in its removal. As a result, 80% of oil was removed from cobble and <b>fine</b> <b>sand,</b> 50% in coarse sand, and 30% in gravel. Once the oil is liberated from the shoreline, the oil-biodiesel mixture is manually removed from the water surface with skimmers. Any remaining mixture is easily broken down due to the high biodegradability of biodiesel, and the increased surface area exposure of the mixture.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{was also}} involved {{in the construction of}} the 1st Australian Logistics Support Group (1 ALSG) base amid the sand dunes at Vung Tau following its occupation in May 1966. Although a detachment of engineers from 1 RAR Group had commenced basic works to prepare the area prior to the lodgement, including a basic water supply and road construction, much work remained. Lacking basic facilities for logistic operations including unloading facilities, roads and hardstanding, 1 ALSG struggled to become operational and commence logistic support to 1 ATF forward at Nui Dat. Meanwhile, basic hygiene and stifling heat were also a significant problem. Urgent work was required and the development plan included cutting and spreading the sand dunes, reclaiming large areas of swamp land, road construction, establishing accommodation, hardstanding, storage areas, workshops and vehicles parks, as well as extensive drainage works. Other tasks included winning construction resources, water purification and supply, electricity generation, survey, bridging and rafting, and civil aid. Helipads were also constructed to enable 1 ALSG to be resupplied by helicopter and for 2 Field Ambulance to receive casualties. Later, in April 1968 a quarry was also constructed at Vung Tau to supply crushed rock, gravel and <b>fine</b> <b>sand</b> for the pavement of roads, airfields, helipads and development of hardstanding.|$|E

500|$|The Tucannon River and its tributary, the Pataha Creek {{also have}} valleys {{partially}} filled with alluvial deposits from the Missoula and Bonneville floods. Although they lie some distance up the Snake River drainage, the flood waters of Lake Lewis backed up this drainage {{far enough to}} deposit sediments. Floodplain deposits consist of up to six distinct Touchet Beds, as well as loess silt and <b>fine</b> <b>sand.</b> These alluvial and loess deposits narrow as they approach the basalt valley walls, and thicken into the central valley, with a maximum sediment thickness of between [...] Due to the elevation of the valley, only six of the flooding events caused water to back into the Tucannon Valley in sufficient volume to deposit distinct layers.|$|E
500|$|Construction on {{the line}} started in 1985. Survey and {{clearing}} work for the twin 2,500-foot (762 m) Anacostia River tunnels began in March 1985. A 24-foot (7.32 m) long, 19 foot (5.8 m) diameter tunnel boring machine built by the Hitachi Zosen Corporation was shipped to the U.S. to drill the tunnel, which required boring techniques [...] "so novel that they have never before {{been used in the}} eastern United States." [...] The tunnel boring machine ate through [...] "T5" [...] (relatively <b>fine</b> <b>sand</b> mixed with gravel and boulders which occasionally required workers to physically break the boulders apart) and clay formations about [...] beneath the riverbed. The walls of the tunnel were lined with concrete as the machine moved. Liquid nitrogen was used to harden the ground where the inbound tunnel reached the northern side of the Anacostia River, to lessen the possibility of cave-ins due to the wet earth.|$|E
500|$|Boston and Cape Ann {{were the}} most heavily damaged. In Boston, damage was {{concentrated}} in areas of infill near the harbor; infill is less sturdy in earthquakes than solid land. From 1,300 to 1,600 chimneys in the city were damaged in some way, the gable ends of some houses collapsed, {{and a number of}} roofs were damaged by falling chimneys. Stone chimneys and buildings were damaged in Falmouth (present-day Portland, Maine), Springfield, Massachusetts, and New Haven, Connecticut, as well. Some church steeples in Boston were damaged, ending up tilted from vertical. Stone fencing in rural areas was damaged. Observers also reported that several springs dried up, new ones were created, and cracks appeared in the ground near Scituate, Lancaster, and Pembroke. In this last town, observers noted water and <b>fine</b> <b>sand</b> coming from the crack. Non-structural damage was minor; residents reported damage to china and glassware, and a distiller lost some of his product after a cistern was damaged. The Cape Ann earthquake may also have created the first recorded tsunami in U.S. history. Observers in the Leeward Islands nearly [...] south of Cape Ann, reported a receding of water followed by a large wave that lifted several boats ashore and left fish floundering on the beach.|$|E
