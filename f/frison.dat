5|$|Revival was {{nominated}} for three Harvey Awards in 2013: Best New Series, Best Writer, and Best Artist. Jenny <b>Frison,</b> who {{has been called the}} underappreciated star of the series, {{was nominated}} for Best Cover Artist in 2013 and 2015 in part because of her work on Revival.|$|E
5|$|During publication, some Revival {{merchandise}} {{was offered}} by third-parties. On October 25, 2014, Screen Panel released four art prints {{based on the}} series created by Angela An, Randy Ortiz, and <b>Frison.</b> In 2016, an Em Cypress minimate figure {{was included in the}} first wave of the Comic Book Heroes series from Diamond Select Toys. The figure was available in a two pack with Cassie Hack, another Tim Seeley creation.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{its initial}} release, the series {{received}} mostly positive reviews and sold through multiple printings. Revival {{was nominated for}} three Harvey Awards in 2013, and <b>Frison</b> was nominated in the Best Cover Artist category in 2013 and 2015 {{in part because of}} her work on the series. Critics praised the series for differentiating itself from other zombie comics, but later faulted the story's pace and sprawling cast. By the end of the series, sales of individual monthly issues had fallen nearly 78% from the first issue peak.|$|E
5000|$|The Roman conquest {{had little}} impact on the ancient {{settlement}} of farmer-fishermen. Far greater changes occurred several centuries later, with the Saxons and <b>Frisons</b> invasions in the early sixth century. In 513, King Arthur landed {{on the island of}} Cézembre, just facing the coast, with the new King of Armorica, Hoël I. This new regime favoured the settlement of missionaries from Cornwall, and in particular one of King Hoël's sons, Saint Lunarius (or Léonor), together with Saint Pompeius (or Coupaia), Saint Tugdual's brother, or Saint Sève and numerous monks and secular priests, who started clearing the local forest of Ponthul and erected a first chapel on the location of the present [...] "Old Church".|$|R
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{pressure}} on the Spanish infantry, the Marquis del Vasto collected his cavalry and charged over Stanley's infantry, being in turn repelled. He was nearly killed when an English soldier attacked him with a battleaxe, but a Spanish light horseman surnamed Arenas saved him by transfixing the English with his lance. Del Vasto retired from the fight and met Verdugo and Johann Baptista von Taxis, who sallied from Zutphen with several troops to join the battle. At the same time they were conversing, English troops unsuccessfully attacked Zutphen's sconce {{on the other side of}} the IJssel, which was defended by Count Herman van den Bergh with some men. For a moment, Verdugo thought that the skirmish was inside Zutphen and the town burghers had risen in arms against the few Spanish troops he had left behind the walls. Leicester committed the same mistake, believing that the <b>Frisons</b> under Count William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg were fighting against the Spanish inside Zutphen.|$|R
500|$|Leicester {{waited for}} the Spanish convoy near the small village of Warnsveld, {{half a mile from}} Zutphen. Supported by the Earl of Essex, Sir John Norreys, Sir William Stanley, Lord Willoughby, his nephew the poet and courtier Sir Philip Sidney and William Russell, Leicester {{commanded}} 1,500 infantry and 200 cavalry, according to the coeval English scholar Edward Grimeston. Famiano Strada increases these numbers to 3,000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and Alonso Vázquez to about 8,000, many of them veteran <b>Frisons</b> under Count William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg. The 19th century American historian John Lothrop Motley, on the other hand, reduces the strength of the English force to 200 cavalry and 300 pikemen, though adding that [...] "a much stronger force of infantry was held in reserve and readiness". The English soldiers, unlike the Dutch, were anxious to engage the Spanish troops. Rowland York told Leicester that he understood Spanish tactics, and that Spaniards were incomparable to English soldiers.|$|R

25|$|After {{the landing}} the Frisian {{strategy}} was to prevent the Hollanders from leaving the coast and coming inland. According to {{the tale of the}} Hainautian chronicler Froissart the Frisian leader he names Yves Joncre (a giant {{of a man who had}} fought in Prussia, Hungary, Turkey, on Rhodes and on Cyprus), who was known to the Hollanders and their allies as le Grand <b>Frison,</b> and who is usually identified as Juw Juwinga, a headling from the city of Bolsward, was one of only a few who argued against this strategy, saying that the Frisians should go home and let the Hollanders try to fight the marshy terrain. He was, however, outvoted.|$|E

2500|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{may have}} {{believed}} {{themselves to be}} partly descended from Huns, through their Angle, Saxon, and Jute ancestors. In his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, the historian Bede stated:... any of which nations [...] knew there were in Germany, from whom the Angles or Saxons, who now inhabit Britain, {{are known to have}} derived their origin; for which reason they are still corruptly called Garmans by the neighboring nation of the Britons. Such are the <b>Frisons,</b> the Rugins, the Danes, the Huns, the Ancient Saxons, and the Boructuars (or Bructers). There are also in the same parts many other nations still following pagan rites, to whom the aforesaid soldier of Christ designed to repair, ...As James Campbell has noted, this list of peoples has generally been regarded by historians as being a list of peoples living in Germany at the time Bede wrote this passage in the 8th century, [...] "ut the sense of the Latin is that these are the peoples from whom the Anglo-Saxons living in Britain were derived." [...] He wrote that the list of peoples fits the 5th century better, when the Anglo-Saxons began migrating to Britain, than the 8th century, and noted that [...] "Huns sound odd; it is equally odd that Priscus heard of a boast by Attila that he had authority over the islands in the ocean." ...|$|R
500|$|During the series, Norton and Seeley {{worked with}} colorist Mark Englert, letterer Christopher Crank (credited as [...] "Crank!"), and cover artist and fellow studio partner Jenny <b>Frison.</b> Although <b>Frison</b> was planned {{to create the}} covers from the beginning, Norton {{provided}} the design for {{the cover of the}} first issue. At Seeley's suggestion, Norton drew the covers for the collected paperback editions. When the script for issue twelve called for a young character to draw his own comic within the story, five of the pages featured art by Art Baltazar and the cover was drawn by Skottie Young. Both artists are known for their cartoon-like style.|$|E
500|$|Revival is a horror-science fiction comics series {{described}} by its creators as [...] "a rural noir". It {{was written by}} Tim Seeley, with art by Mike Norton, coloring by Mark Englert, and covers by Jenny <b>Frison.</b> The series was published by Image Comics as 47 monthly issues released between July 2012 and February 2017. It has since been collected into both paperback and hardcover editions.|$|E
500|$|Previews of {{the first}} issue were {{included}} in The Walking Dead #99 and alongside five other upcoming comics in Image's 2012 Free Comic Book Day sampler before the first issue was released on July 11, 2012. It had an initial print run of about 18,000 copies and was available with two covers: the standard version by <b>Frison</b> and a 1-in-10 alternate cover by Craig Thompson. As an added incentive to retailers who normally order on a non-returnable basis, unsold copies of qualifying orders could be returned to Image {{in exchange for a}} credit to their account. It quickly sold out at the distributor level and went through at least four printings by December 2012, including one as part of the [...] "Image Firsts" [...] line of $1 reprints in November. By the end of the year, the first issue had sold an estimated 29,100 copies.|$|E
500|$|Subsequent issues also {{performed}} well, requiring additional printings to satisfy demand. The series took a planned one-month hiatus after the fifth issue, which also needed a reprint, {{to release the}} first paperback collection. During the break, Image offered an extra 10% discount to retailers who increased their orders by 125% {{in an effort to}} bring orders in line with demand and eliminate the costs associated with additional printings. In January 2013, the Phantom group, retailers who commission exclusive covers to provide further attention to series they believe deserve more support, selected Revival {{to be part of the}} [...] project. Under the Phantom label, the first ten issues were reprinted with new interlocking cover art by <b>Frison.</b> They were only available at stores operated by the retail group. When asked about the book's success in a January 2014 interview, Seeley said [...] "We live and die by word-of-mouth, and so far, the readers and the comic press have been great about spreading the word about our very unusual and unique comic book." ...|$|E
500|$|... "One Door Closes", {{an episode}} focused on Bobbi Morse's history, {{received}} {{a poster of}} her with the [...] "real S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] logo, that [...] "embraced the basics" [...] of four-color printing, utilizing magenta, cyan, black and yellow, while still having layers and complications, much like the character of Morse. The poster was designed by Delicious Design League. The poster for [...] "Afterlife" [...] by Dave Johnson, highlights the divide within S.H.I.E.L.D. and the alliances on each side. With Coulson in the middle, Agents Gonzales, Morse, Mackenzie and Weaver stem from the [...] "real S.H.I.E.L.D.", while Hunter, Fitz and Simmons stem from the other. [...] "Melinda"s poster, by Jenny <b>Frison,</b> mirrored {{the focus of the}} episode by prominently featuring an image of May, highlighting her backstory and why she is called [...] "the Cavalry". Marvel teamed with Nathan Fox on the poster for [...] "The Frenemy of My Enemy", which depicts Ward, Kara, and Bakshi in [...] "Hydra red"; Coulson, Hunter, and Fitz in [...] "S.H.I.E.L.D. blue"; and Deathlok neutral.

60|$|Robert the <b>Frison</b> {{heard of}} it, {{and tried to}} persuade Hereward.|$|E
60|$|In July, Baldwin died. Arnoul, the boy, was Count of Flanders, and Richilda, his sorceress-mother, {{ruled the}} land in his name. She began to oppress the Flemings; not those of French Flanders, round St. Omer, but those of Flemish Flanders, toward the north. They {{threatened}} to send for Robert the <b>Frison</b> to right them.|$|E
6000|$|Hereward {{knew well}} the {{exploits}} of Robert le <b>Frison</b> in Spain and Greece. [...] "I trust that your noble uncle," [...] he asked, [...] "is well? He was one of us poor sea-cocks, and sailed the swan's path gallantly, till he became a mighty prince. Here is a man here who was with your noble uncle in Byzant." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{when they}} came riding in, the great Marquis {{at the head of}} them all, with Robert le <b>Frison</b> on one side of him, and on the other Hereward, looking [...] "as fresh as flowers in May," [...] she looked down on him out of her little lattice in the gable, and loved him, once and for all, with all her heart and soul.|$|E
60|$|Robert the <b>Frison</b> and Richilda {{had come}} to open war, and Gerbod the Fleming, Earl of Clueter, had gone over from England to help Robert. William had sent Fitz-Osbern, Earl of Hereford, the scourge and tyrant of the Welsh, to help Richilda. Fitz Osbern had married her, there and then. She had asked help of her liege lord, the King of France, and he had sent her troops. Robert and Richilda had fought on St. Peter's day, 1071,--nearly two years before, at Bavinchorum, by Cassel.|$|E
60|$|On a bench at {{the door}} of his high-roofed wooden house sat Dirk Hammerhand, the richest man in Walcheren. From within the house sounded the {{pleasant}} noise of slave-women, grinding and chatting at the handquern; from without, the pleasant noise of geese and fowls without number. And as he sat and drank his ale, and watched the herd of horses in the fen, he thought himself a happy man, and thanked his Odin and Thor that owing to his princely supplies of horses to Countess Gertrude, Robert the <b>Frison</b> and his Christian Franks had not harried him to the bare walls, as they would probably do ere all was over.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked out}} stealthily through the blind {{of the little}} window in the gable. There rode down the street Robert le <b>Frison</b> in full armor, and behind him, knight after knight, a wall of shining steel. But by his side rode one bare-headed, his long yellow curls {{floating}} over his shoulders. His boots had golden spurs, a gilt belt held up his sword; but his only dress was a silk shirt and silk hose. He laughed and sang, and made his horse caracol, and tossed his lance in the air, and caught it by the point, like Taillefer at Hastings, as he passed under the window.|$|E
60|$|But Hereward {{had learned}} that art of war, which enabled the Norman to crush, piecemeal, with {{inferior}} numbers, the vast but straggling levies of the English. His men, mostly outlaws and homeless, kept together by the pressure from without, and free from local jealousies, resembled rather an army of professional soldiers than a country posse comitatus. And to the discipline which he instilled into them; to his ability in marching and manoeuvring troops; to his care for their food and for their transport, possibly, also, to his training them in that art of fighting on horseback in which the men of Wessex, if not the Anglo-Danes of the East, {{are said to have}} been quite unskilled,--in short, to all that he had learned, as a mercenary, under Robert the <b>Frison,</b> and among the highly civilized warriors of Flanders and Normandy, must be attributed the fact, that he and his little army defied, for years, the utmost efforts of the Normans, appearing and disappearing with such strange swiftness, and conquering against such strange odds, as enshrouded the guerilla captain in an atmosphere of myth and wonder, only to be accounted for, in the mind of Normans as well as English, by the supernatural counsels of his sorceress wife.|$|E
6000|$|And Hereward, likewise, for {{the first}} time in his life, was loath to go to war. He was, doubtless, rich enough in this world's goods. Torfrida herself was rich, and seems to have had the {{disposal}} of her own property, for her mother is not mentioned in connection therewith. Hereward seems to have dwelt in her house at St. Omer as long as he remained in Flanders. He had probably amassed some treasure of his own by the simple, but then most aristocratic, method of plunder. He had, too, probably, grants of land in Holland from the <b>Frison,</b> the rents whereof were not paid as regularly as might be. Moreover, as [...] "Magister Militum," [...] ("Master of the Knights,") he had, it is likely, pay as well as honor. And he approved himself worthy of his good fortune. He kept forty gallant housecarles in his hall all the winter, and Torfrida and her lasses made and mended their clothes. He gave large gifts to the Abbey of St. Bertin; and had masses sung for the souls of all whom he had slain, according to a rough list which he furnished,-- bidding the monks not to be chary of two or three masses extra at times, as his memory was short, and he might have sent more souls to purgatory than he had recollected. He gave great alms at his door to all the poor. He befriended, especially, all shipwrecked and needy mariners, feeding and clothing them, and begging their freedom as a gift from Baldwin. He feasted the knights of the neighborhood, who since his baresark campaign, had all vowed him the most gallant of warriors, and since his accession of wealth, the most courteous of gentlemen; and so all went merrily, as it is written, [...] "As long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will speak well of thee." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1956, George and June <b>Frison</b> {{adopted a}} daughter, Carol <b>Frison</b> Placek, {{who was born}} in 1952 (Beaver 2006). George {{continued}} to work as an avocational archaeologist until 1962 when the <b>Frison</b> family ranch and hunting and guiding business ended (<b>Frison</b> 2004). [...] While attending a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Denver in 1961, <b>Frison</b> learned that in order to succeed with an academic career in archaeology, he must have a formal university education. <b>Frison</b> sought advice from Professor William Mulloy at the University of Wyoming regarding future research and educational possibilities, and in 1962 he decided to enroll at the University of Wyoming, at age 37, to finish his undergraduate work (<b>Frison</b> 2004).|$|E
50|$|George <b>Frison</b> {{was born}} in Worland, Wyoming on November 11, 1924 (Thomson Gale 2007). Frison’s father {{was killed in an}} {{accident}} in 1924 before George <b>Frison</b> was born. Frison’s mother left when George was three, and his paternal grandparents in Wyoming raised him. <b>Frison</b> took to ranching as a young man and helped his grandparents run the family ranch.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 George <b>Frison</b> {{received}} a Bachelor of Science degree with honors in anthropology from the University of Wyoming (Vittitow 2006). <b>Frison</b> proceeded {{to graduate school}} at the University of Michigan with a fellowship from the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, under James B. Griffin and Arthur Jelinek (Beaver 2006). <b>Frison</b> soon learned that the current literature on human hunters and hunting lacked credibility, and rarely took into account the hunted animal’s behavior, and often portrayed the hunter using unrealistic and illogical forms of hunting methodology (<b>Frison</b> 2004).|$|E
50|$|<b>Frison</b> officially joined Vicenza on the {{deadline}} {{day of the}} 2008 summer transfer window. At Vicenza, {{he was awarded the}} number 1 jersey, and he worked as understudy to veteran goalkeeper, Marco Fortin, but <b>Frison</b> went on to make 8 league appearances that season. In June 2009 Vicenza bought <b>Frison</b> outright from Treviso for an additional €5,000. Treviso went bankrupted in summer 2009.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frison</b> was {{intrigued}} by fossil dinosaur and mammoth bones he found as a youngster in Wyoming, along {{with a variety of}} archaeological features such as chipped and ground stone tools, rock shelters, rock art, and scaffold burials (Vittitow 2006). Many researchers, such as geologist Harold Cook, paleontologist Glenn Jepsen, and anthropologist Waldo Wedel were investigating the areas near the <b>Frison</b> ranch for various research projects. <b>Frison</b> {{was intrigued}} by Paleontologist Barnum Brown, of the American Museum of Natural History, who excavated dinosaur beds close to the <b>Frison</b> ranch in 1934. <b>Frison</b> brought several cigar boxes of fossils to him to identify. Barnum was the researcher who identified the bison bones at the Folsom site in New Mexico, so he discussed the Folsom complex with a young George <b>Frison,</b> who had never heard of Folsom before. These experiences were helping to shape Frison’s interest in and knowledge of both fossils and ancient American cultures (Vittitow 2006).|$|E
50|$|When he was 11 {{years old}} {{he had his}} first, and most unforgettable, {{incident}} with a bison bull in a state park near Thermopolis, about 50 mi from his home ranch, when ten loose bison wandered from the park, and <b>Frison</b> was able to secure permission to assist local cowhands to escort the bison back to the park. A young bison bull that created too much confusion among the other bison was left behind. <b>Frison</b> found the bison bull grazing {{a few days later}} and decided to outrun the bull on horseback. After both <b>Frison</b> and the bison cleared two fences, the bull stopped at the third fence, turned 180 degrees and decided to charge. <b>Frison</b> soon learned how an awkward and docile bison could soon be a danger, as both <b>Frison</b> and his horse toppled to the ground when the bull passed between the horse’s legs. However, all three managed to sustain no injury (<b>Frison</b> 2004).|$|E
50|$|George <b>Frison</b> was an {{accomplished}} hunter and learned about hunting and animal behavior from his grandfather. Through experience and family ethics, <b>Frison</b> as a hunter {{was able to}} adopt a philosophy of conservation that worked for both the hunter and the hunted, and the common environment that both had to live in. <b>Frison</b> later believed that his philosophy must also have been the philosophy of early hunters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frison</b> {{returned}} to Vicenza on 30 June 2010, {{ahead of the}} 2010-11 Serie B season. Upon {{his return to the}} club, <b>Frison</b> became a regular at the biancorossi, making 12 league starts for the club in this first half of the new season. On 19 January 2011, however, he was loaned out to Frosinone. On 31 January 2011, Pierluigi Frattali transferred from Frosinone to Vicenza, in exchange. During his loan spell with Frosinone, <b>Frison</b> became the first choice keeper, making 17 league appearances. On 30 June 2011, <b>Frison</b> {{returned to}} Vicenza following the expiration of the loan deal.|$|E
50|$|During the 2009-10 Serie B campaign, <b>Frison</b> {{continued}} as the club's second choice goalkeeper behind Fortin and ahead of Cristian Cicioni and José Rocchi. On 18 January 2010, Serie A side Genoa signed <b>Frison</b> on a six-month loan deal from Vicenza. In return, Danilo Russo moved to Vicenza in a co-ownership agreement. Once at Genoa, <b>Frison</b> {{was given the}} number 1 jersey, and served as the third choice goalkeeper behind Marco Amelia and Alessio Scarpi. Despite making no Serie A appearances for the Ligurian club, <b>Frison</b> played a friendly match for Genoa {{at the end of}} season.|$|E
