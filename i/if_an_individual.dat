5|$|Rothbard {{accepted}} the Labor theory of property, but rejected the Lockean proviso, arguing that <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> mixes his labor with unowned land then {{he becomes the}} proper owner eternally, and that after that time it is private property which may change hands only by trade or gift.|$|E
5|$|It {{rejects the}} Christian {{emphasis}} on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing that <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age {{examples of how}} to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.|$|E
5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E

5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. <b>If</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> feels Vairagya (detachment {{from the}} world), the Jabala Upanishad {{maintains}} that no preconditions apply, {{and the individual}} has the spiritual right to renounce immediately. This principle in the Jabala Upanishad was cited by medieval-era scholars such as Adi Shankara, Vijñāneśvara, Sureśvara, and Nilakantha as the Vedic basis that makes renunciation an individual choice and right. This choice {{has been referred to}} as a Vikalpa by the later scholars, which the society and state must respect. The Jabala Upanishad concurred with some Dharmasastras on the right to renounce and lead a monastic life, but its views contradicted others such as those in Manusmriti verses 6.35–37. The text fed a debate on the right of the individual, and medieval Hindu scholars relied on and sided with the Jabala Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. Genetic testing {{can be used to}} confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> or embryo carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene that causes the disease. Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E

5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E
5|$|Section 10 {{requires}} the authorisation of any prosecution {{by the director}} of the appropriate prosecution agency before a case can go ahead; this is a shift from the old regime, which required the consent of the Attorney General for England and Wales. Section 11 explains the penalties for individuals and companies found guilty of committing a crime. <b>If</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> is found guilty of a bribery offence, tried as a summary offence, they may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and fined up to £5,000. Someone found guilty on indictment, however, faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited fine. In addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} or seizures {{are typically}} denied a pilot license. In Canada <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> {{has had no}} more than one seizure, they may be considered after five years for a limited license if all other testing is normal. Those with febrile seizures and drug related seizures may also be considered. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration does not allow those with epilepsy to get a commercial pilot license. Rarely, exceptions can be made for persons who have had an isolated seizure or febrile seizures and have remained free of seizures into adulthood without medication. In the United Kingdom, a full national private pilot license requires the same standards as a professional driver's license. This requires a period of ten years without seizures while off medications. Those who do not meet this requirement may acquire a restricted license if free from seizures for five years.|$|E
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> ANIM is <b>a</b> {{result of}} a {{metabolite}} defect, then additional tests are required.

5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E
25|$|In most {{countries}} floating charges {{can only be}} granted by companies, LLPs or similar entities with separate legal personality. <b>If</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> person or a partnership {{was to try to}} grant a floating charge, then in most jurisdictions which recognise floating charges this would be void as a general assignment in bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|William James' {{hypothesis}} of pragmatism {{stems from the}} efficacy of religion. <b>If</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> believes in and performs religious activities, and those actions happen to work, then that practice appears the proper choice for the individual. However, if the processes of religion have little efficacy, {{then there is no}} rationality for continuing the practice.|$|E
50|$|For example, <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> Sun {{is placed}} in 10 degrees 51 minutes Aquarius then their Sun sign would be ruled by Uranus, but the dwad, being {{in the range of}} 10 to 12.5 degrees would be placed within Gemini(the 5th dwad), so the individual's sub-ruler would be the Mercury, which rules Gemini.|$|R
50|$|Both the European Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights have {{clarified}} {{that the}} right to a fair trial applies not only to judicial proceedings, but also administrative proceedings. <b>If</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> right under the law is at stake, the dispute must be determined through a fair process.|$|R
50|$|For example, <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> {{right eye}} is {{shielded}} and light shines {{into the left}} eye, constriction of the right pupil will occur, {{as well as the}} left. This is because the afferent signal sent through one optic nerve connects to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, whose axons run to both {{the right and the left}} oculomotor nerves.|$|R
25|$|Article 10 – {{individuals}} {{are entitled to}} a fair trial, and this is generally recognized to involve the right to an interpreter <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> does not understand the language used in criminal court proceedings, or in a criminal accusation.

25|$|To {{get into}} the {{amusement}} park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport {{to go to the}} park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then {{they will not be able}} to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.|$|E
25|$|These three {{components}} make up nature connectedness and {{are required for}} a healthy relationship with nature. <b>If</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> feels connected to nature (possibly by spending time in it), {{they may be more}} inclined to care about nature, and protect the environment. Recent research has found that nature exposure (and feeling connected to nature at a trait level) provides many benefits to humans such as well-being.|$|E
5000|$|This {{selection}} for cooperation is even stronger <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> action in <b>an</b> interaction is observed by third-party individuals, {{for the possibility}} of forming a reputation arises.

25|$|Organizational {{identification}} and workplace {{freedom of speech}} {{has an effect on}} an individual's choice of expressing dissent (Kassing, 2000). <b>If</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> highly identifies himself or herself with the organization, {{they are more likely to}} use the dissent strategy that mirrors the organization's values.

25|$|Although 90% of HPV {{infections are}} cleared {{by the body}} within two years of infection, it is {{possible}} for infected cells to undergo a latency (quiet) period, with the first occurrence or a recurrence of symptoms happening months or years later.

25|$|Objective tests assume {{personality}} is consciously accessible {{and that it}} can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the Forer effect to suggest some of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they really are. Issues with these tests include false reporting because {{there is no way to}} tell <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> is answering a question honestly or accurately.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> delta waves {{disappear}} with {{increases in}} the heart rate, {{he or she is}} considered to be at lower risk of SCD. This is because the loss of the delta wave shows that the accessory pathway cannot conduct electrical impulses at a high rate (in the anterograde direction). These individuals typically do not have fast conduction down the accessory pathway during episodes of atrial fibrillation.|$|R
50|$|There are {{differences}} and similarities worth noting {{when it comes}} to biological needs and social needs. Biological needs are required for survival in everyday life, whereas social needs are acquired and learned.
