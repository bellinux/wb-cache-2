40|$|Residual gases {{always found}} <b>in</b> <b>glass</b> <b>shells</b> are CO 2, O 2 and N 2. In those cases where high water vapor {{pressure}} is maintained in the furnace, water {{is also found}} <b>in</b> the <b>shells.</b> Other evidence {{for the existence of}} water <b>in</b> <b>shells</b> is the presence of water-induced surface weathering of the interior shell surface. Water and CO 2 are the predominant volatiles generated by the pyrolysis of both inorganic and hydrolyzed metal-organic gels. The pyrolysates of unhydrolyzed metal-organic gels also contain, in addition to water and CO 2, significant levels of organic volatiles, such as ethanol and some hydrocarbons; on complete oxidation, these produce CO 2 and water as well. Water is most likely the initial blowing agent, it is produced copiously during the initial stages of heating. In the later stages, CO 2 becomes the dominant gas as H 2 O is lost at increasing rates. Water <b>in</b> the <b>shell</b> arises mainly from gel dehydration, CO 2 by sodium bicarbonate/carbonate decomposition and carbon oxidation, and O 2 and N 2 by permeation of the ambient furnace air through the molten shell wall...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} coating/substrate modulus {{mismatch}} and margin geometry on contact damage in bi-layer systems were investigated. Following an earlier study, convex specimens having curvature of 12 mm inner coating diameter and 1 mm thick brittle {{layer on a}} polymeric and dental composite support bases were produced. Sample coating geometry at the margins was varied by grinding {{the edge of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>shells</b> <b>in</b> various shapes. The specimens were tested by applying single cycle load at the specimen’s axis of symmetry using flat indenter of low elastic modulus. The effects of margin geometry and support layer modulus on radial crack initiation and damage evolution was examined, with particular attention paid to the relevance of such damage to lifetime-limiting failures of all- ceramic dental crowns. Finite element modeling was used to evaluate stress distribution <b>in</b> the <b>glass</b> coating. Experimental trends interrupted with peak maximum principal stresses at the margins. The results of this study illustrate that the fracture behaviour of brittle layered structures is not dominated by certain variables. It is demonstrated that critical loads for initiation of radial cracks are sensitive to support layer modulus as well as margin geometry. Support layer modulus {{plays an important role in}} crack propagation and subsequent damage patterns, especially at specimen side walls...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{methods and}} experimental {{results of the}} semi-active control of noise transmission <b>in</b> a curved <b>glass</b> <b>shell</b> with attached piezoelectric macro fiber composite (MFC) actuators. The semi-active noise control is achieved via active elasticity control of piezoelectric actuators by connecting them to an active electric shunt circuit that has a negative effective capacitance. Using this approach, {{it is possible to}} suppress the vibration of the <b>glass</b> <b>shell</b> <b>in</b> the normal direction with respect to its surface and to increase the acoustic transmission loss of the piezoelectric MFC-glass composite structure. The effect of the MFC actuators connected to the negative capacitance shunt circuit on the surface distribution of the normal vibration amplitude is studied using frequency-shifted digital holography (FSDH). The principle of the used FSDH method is described in the paper. The frequency dependence of the acoustic transmission loss through the piezoelectric MFC-glass composite structure is estimated using measurements of the specific acoustic impedance of the curved glass shell. The specific acoustic impedance is measured using two microphones and a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). The results from the LDV measurements are compared with the FSDH data. The results of the experiments show that using this approach, the acoustic transmission loss <b>in</b> a <b>glass</b> <b>shell</b> can be increased by 36 dB in the frequency range around 247 Hz and by 25 dB in the frequency range around 258 Hz. The experiments indicate that FSDH measurements provide an efficient tool {{that can be used for}} fast and accurate measurements of the acoustic transmission loss in large planar structures...|$|R

40|$|There {{are some}} {{disadvantages}} {{in the traditional}} segmental baffle heat exchanger for the transversal fluid flow <b>in</b> its <b>shell</b> side, such as the high flow resistance, large heat transfer dead region, and so on. For overcoming those above disadvantages, a kind of new efficient and energy saving shell-and-tube heat exchanger with sidelling flow <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> side is developed, the traditional segmental baffles are substituted by leading type shutter baffles, therefore, the fluid in some local regions flows over tubes inclinedly. The velocity distribution and velocity variation at the same position of main flow region in sidelling flow heat exchanger and segmental baffle heat exchanger is studied and compared. It is confirmed that, with the leading type shutter baffles <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> side, the vortex <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> side is weaken, flow field is greatly homogenized, and the velocity <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> side is increased. Shutter baffles are helpful to reduce the pressure drop <b>in</b> <b>shell</b> side and increase effective heat transfer area, which provides references for structure improving of shell-and-tube heat exchanger...|$|R
