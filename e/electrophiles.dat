5|$|Aggarwal has {{developed}} an alternative method employing the same sulfide as above and a novel alkylation involving a rhodium carbenoid formed in situ. The method too has limited substrate scope, failing for any <b>electrophiles</b> possessing basic substituents due to competitive consumption of the carbenoid.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction in organic synthesis is diverse. The reaction has come to encompass reactions of many types of sulfur ylides with <b>electrophiles</b> well beyond the original publications. It has seen use {{in a number of}} high-profile total syntheses, as detailed below, and is generally recognized as a powerful transformative tool in the organic repertoire.|$|E
5|$|Enolate {{trapping}} {{with various}} <b>electrophiles</b> is decidedly less common. In one study, the Nazarov cyclization is {{paired with a}} Michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to β-nitrostyrene. In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions: it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization {{and in the next}} step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R-group.|$|E

50|$|The favored azaenolate is the {{dominant}} starting molecule for the subsequent alkylation reaction. There are two possible faces of accessing for any <b>electrophile</b> to react with. The steric interaction between the pyrrolidine ring and the electrophilic reagent hinders the attack of the <b>electrophile</b> from the top face. On the contrary, when the <b>electrophile</b> attacks from the bottom face, such unfavorable interaction does not exist. Therefore, the electrophilic attack proceeds from the sterically more accessible face.|$|R
50|$|Self-condensation is {{an organic}} {{reaction}} {{in which a}} chemical compound containing a carbonyl group acts both as the <b>electrophile</b> and the nucleophile in an aldol condensation. It is also called a symmetrical aldol condensation {{as opposed to a}} mixed aldol condensation in which the <b>electrophile</b> and nucleophile are different species.|$|R
5|$|Once the {{cyclization}} has occurred, an oxyallyl cation is formed. As discussed extensively above, {{the typical}} course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization. However, these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and <b>electrophiles,</b> respectively. Oxyallyl cation trapping {{has been developed}} extensively by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field. The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners. Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity.|$|E

25|$|The method {{works on}} {{unbranched}} aliphatic aldehydes, {{which are often}} poor <b>electrophiles</b> for catalytic, asymmetric processes. This {{may be due to}} poor electronic and steric differentiation between their enantiofaces.|$|E
25|$|Some {{additions}} {{which can}} not be executed with nucleophiles and <b>electrophiles,</b> can be succeeded with free radicals. As with the free-radical substitution, the radical addition proceeds as a chain reaction, and such reactions are the basis of the free-radical polymerization.|$|E
25|$|The {{toxicology}} of {{a particular}} aziridine compound depends on its structure and activity, although sharing the general characteristics of aziridines. As <b>electrophiles,</b> aziridines are subject to attack and ring-opening by endogenous nucleophiles such as nitrogenous bases in DNA base pairs, resulting in potential mutagenicity.|$|E

25|$|After the N–H proton, the {{hydrogen}} at C2 {{is the next}} most acidic proton on indole. Reaction of N-protected indoles with butyl lithium or lithium diisopropylamide results in lithiation exclusively at the C2 position. This strong nucleophile can then be used as such with other <b>electrophiles.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{scope of}} this mode of {{activation}} is immense, with constant new reports of different combinations of <b>electrophiles,</b> nucleophiles and catalyst structures. Furthermore, analogous reactions involving oxyanion intermediates such as enolate addition to nitroso compounds or opening of epoxides have also been successfully catalyzed with this strategy.|$|E

25|$|The π-bond in the {{ethylene}} molecule {{is responsible}} for its useful reactivity. The double bond is a region of high electron density, thus it is susceptible to attack by <b>electrophiles.</b> Many reactions of ethylene are catalyzed by transition metals, which bind transiently to the ethylene using both the π and π* orbitals.|$|E
25|$|Neutral alanes are not {{nucleophilic}} {{enough to}} deliver organic groups to electrophilic substrates. However, upon activation by a nucleophile, the resulting aluminates are highly nucleophilic {{and add to}} <b>electrophiles</b> with retention of configuration at the migration carbon. Thus, stereospecific hydroalumination followed by nucleophilic attack provides a method for the stereospecific synthesis of olefins from alkynes.|$|E
25|$|Directed ortho metalation (DoM) is an {{adaptation}} of electrophilic aromatic substitution in which <b>electrophiles</b> attach themselves exclusively to the ortho- position of a direct metalation group or DMG through the intermediary of an aryllithium compound. The DMG interacts with lithium through a hetero atom. Examples of DMG's are the methoxy group, a tertiary amine group and an amide group.|$|E

50|$|In electrophilic {{substitution}} in aliphatic compounds, an <b>electrophile</b> displaces {{a functional}} group. This reaction {{is similar to}} nucleophilic aliphatic substitution where the reactant is a nucleophile rather than an <b>electrophile.</b> The four possible electrophilic aliphatic substitution reaction mechanisms are, SE1, SE2(front), SE2(back) and SEi (Substitution Electrophilic), are also similar to the nucleophile counterparts SN1 and SN2. In the SE1 course of action the substrate first ionizes into a carbanion and a positively charged organic residue. The carbanion then quickly recombines with the <b>electrophile.</b> The SE2 reaction mechanism has a single transition state in which the old bond and the newly formed bond are both present.|$|R
50|$|In a {{follow-up}} step the sensitive metalalkenyl group {{is replaced by}} an <b>electrophile</b> E+.|$|R
25|$|Many {{synthetic}} catalysts {{have been}} able to successfully employ this strategy to activate a variety of <b>electrophiles.</b> Using a chiral BINOL catalyst, for instance, the Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction involving the addition of enones to aldehydes can be effected with high enantioselectivity. The nucleophile is an enolate-type species generated from the conjugate addition of PEt3 to the enone, and adds enantioselectively to the aldehyde coordinated to catalyst.|$|E
25|$|In {{part because}} its lower electronegativity, boron often forms {{electron-deficient}} compounds, {{such as the}} triorganoboranes. Vinyl groups and aryl groups donate electrons and make boron less electrophilic and the C-B bond gains some double bond character. Like the parent borane, diborane, organoboranes are classified in organic chemistry as strong <b>electrophiles</b> because boron is unable to gain a full octet of electrons. Unlike diborane however, most organoboranes do not form dimers.|$|E
25|$|The aldol {{reaction}} may proceed via two {{fundamentally different}} mechanisms. Carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, {{can be converted}} to enols or enol ethers. These species, being nucleophilic at the α-carbon, can attack especially reactive protonated carbonyls such as protonated aldehydes. This is the 'enol mechanism'. Carbonyl compounds, being carbon acids, can also be deprotonated to form enolates, which are much more nucleophilic than enols or enol ethers and can attack <b>electrophiles</b> directly. The usual electrophile is an aldehyde, since ketones are much less reactive. This is the 'enolate mechanism'.|$|E
