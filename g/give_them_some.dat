500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the game, {{a young man}} named Danny Roman, suffers from chronic {{insomnia}} caused by worry, stress, and repressed memories. He is admitted to a mental institution for it, where he consults a mad scientist, Dr. Reubens, who treats Danny with his Cognitive Regression Utilizing pSychiatric Heuristics (C.R.U.S.H.) device, which has a sentient female persona. The device's helmet places Danny under hypnosis, during which he can regain control of his sanity by collecting his lost marbles, and facing his primal fears in the form of monsters (i.e. cockroaches, blockwalkers, slugs). Danny starts spilling the beans to Reubens about his city life; moving into his first apartment and his suffering job as a chef. He depends on Reubens for some serious help if he wants to get a good night's sleep. Later, when C.R.U.S.H. projects the image of a bucket and shovel at the beach onto the helmet, he recalls his love life some few years ago with a girl named Tina (who Reubens mistakenly thought was Danny's mother, a recurring joke). Returning the next summer, Danny is jilted for a more handsome man. Devastated, Danny ends up sitting on the pier in shame, accidentally falling into the ocean below, but eventually rescued. Reubens explains that the rejection causes him to distance himself from women, and tells him to get some rest. The next day, while Dr. Reubens tunes up his machine, making questionable noises, Danny recommends he <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>some</b> time alone, but the word [...] "alone" [...] has Reubens lead Danny to recollect the time he was assaulted as a young boy at a local funfair by three thugs, however, Danny blames himself, not his parents, for his mistake, as he ditched his parents to go to the funfair alone, but they find and rescue him (again). He then promised his parents that he'd [...] "stay with them forever." [...] Dr. Reubens uses this evidence to come to a conclusion that homesickness is the cause of his insomnia, recommending that Danny moves back into his parents' house, but his conclusion is proved wrong when Danny returns one more time. Dr. Reubens snaps at Danny for wearing out his machine further, and questions if he is merely [...] "toying" [...] with them. Pushing the limit, Reubens regresses Danny all the way to his childhood, when he was only six years old, against Danny's own will. Danny cries, begging that Reubens stop [...] "unlocking doors that should stay bolted," [...] but in the end, he reveals that his parents went out on a date and left him at his house alone, with disturbing shadows of the night leaving Danny in psychological trauma. Danny discovers that his childhood fears at that time, principally being afraid of the dark, are the real cause his insomnia, sending him [...] "spiraling back into [...] six-year-old self." [...] Reubens is full of disgust that his treatment was a complete waste and that Danny ruined his machine due to his nyctophobia, but tells Danny he's cured. Right when Reubens begins to snap Danny out of hypnosis, C.R.U.S.H. goes over the edge and seems to attack Danny's mind, with Reubens panicking and Danny's life on the line while the screen fades to black {{at the start of the}} attempt.|$|E
