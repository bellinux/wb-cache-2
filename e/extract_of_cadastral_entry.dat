40|$|Satellite {{images are}} used for feature {{extraction}} among other functions. They are used to extract linear features, like roads, etc. These linear features extractions are important operations in computer vision. Computer vision has varied applications in photogrammetric, hydrographic, cartographic and remote sensing tasks. The extraction of linear features or boundaries defining the extents of lands, land covers features are equally important in Cadastral Surveying. Cadastral Surveying is the cornerstone <b>of</b> any <b>Cadastral</b> System. A two dimensional cadastral plan is a model which represents both the cadastral and geometrical information of a two dimensional labeled Image. This paper aims at using and widening the concepts of high resolution Satellite imagery data for <b>extracting</b> representations <b>of</b> <b>cadastral</b> boundaries using image processing algorithms, hence minimizing the human interventions. The Satellite imagery is firstly rectified hence establishing the satellite imagery in the correct orientation and spatial location for further analysis. We, then employ the much available Satellite imagery to extract the relevant cadastral features using computer vision and image processing algorithms. We evaluate the potential of using high resolution Satellite imagery to achieve <b>Cadastral</b> goals <b>of</b> boundary detection and extraction of farmlands using image processing algorithms. This method proves effective as it minimizes the human demerits associated with the Cadastral surveying method, hence providing another perspective <b>of</b> achieving <b>cadastral</b> goals as emphasized by the UN cadastral vision. Finally, as Cadastral science continues {{to look to the}} future, this research aimed at the analysis and getting insights into the characteristics and potential role of computer vision algorithms using high resolution satellite imagery for better digital Cadastre that would provide improved socio economic development...|$|R

The current system of land {{registration}} {{has been in place}} for over 130 years and in that time very few changes have been made to it, despite substantial changes in society. Whilst this system does still fulfil its purpose of providing guarantee to title, an upgrade is necessary for several reasons. These include reducing the cost of the system; extending the applications and marketable uses <b>of</b> registered <b>cadastral</b> survey information; improving overall efficiencies of lodgement, registration, examination and use <b>of</b> <b>cadastral</b> survey information; and ensuring that the system can take full advantage of developing technology. The development of a digital environment to manage land information, in particular, cadastral data, seems to be the most logical solution. The digital concept has already been embraced by many areas of the land information industry, however the lodgement <b>of</b> <b>cadastral</b> survey data is still basically a manual process. In the future it is possible that surveyors may lodge all plans to the local municipality, the Land Titles Office or even directly into a digital cadastral database in a digital format.
