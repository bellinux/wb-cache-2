5|$|As {{part of this}} Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilise the people behind the RCC, erode {{the power of the}} traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, AVEN members {{participated in}} the first asexual entry into an American pride parade when they walked in the San Francisco Pride Parade. In August 2010, {{after a period of}} debate over having an asexual flag and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up a system to create one, and {{contacting}} as many asexual communities as possible, a flag was announced as the asexual pride flag by one of the teams involved. The final flag had been a popular candidate and had previously seen use in online forums outside of AVEN. The final vote was held on a survey system outside of AVEN where the main flag creation efforts were organized. The flag colors have been used in artwork and referenced in articles about the sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Cannery Row {{is set in}} Monterey, California, before World War II. In Sweet Thursday, Doc {{returns from}} the war to find Cannery Row almost deserted {{and many of his}} {{colorful}} friends gone. Even his close friend Dora, who ran the Bear Flag Restaurant, a whorehouse, has died, and her sister Fauna has taken her place as madam. A former social worker, Fauna teaches the girls <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> a table properly, hopeful they will marry wealthy men. Doc's friends Mack (Mac in Pipe Dream) and Hazel (both men) are still around. They decide Doc's discontent is due to loneliness, and try to get him together with Suzy, a prostitute who has just arrived in Monterey. The two have a brief romance; disgusted by her life as a hooker, Suzy leaves the bawdy house and moves into an abandoned boiler. She decides she cannot stay with Doc, but tells her friends that if Doc fell ill, she would care for him. The accommodating Hazel promptly breaks Doc's arm as he sleeps, bringing the two lovers back together. At the end, Doc and Suzy go off to La Jolla to collect marine specimens together.|$|E

5|$|The Cubs' closer for 1981, Dick Tidrow, had a 3–10 {{season with}} a 5.06 ERA, and as a result, in 1982 Smith, Willie Hernández and Bill Campbell shared closing duties. Smith pitched well and even started five games from mid-June to early July. Significantly, former Cubs star pitcher Ferguson Jenkins {{returned}} to the team in 1982, and became {{a major influence on}} the young reliever; Smith credited Jenkins with simplifying his delivery, introducing him to the slider and forkball, and teaching him <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up hitters. In what would be the last start of his career, Smith picked up his first major league hit, a home run off eventual Hall of Famer Phil Niekro. Smith managed only two singles {{for the rest of his}} career. He saved 17 games during that season and performed as the regular closer for the Cubs, a position he held for the next five years.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, {{there is}} some degree of {{empiricism}} and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes {{with the use of}} a powerful computer, mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> about doing the proof. For example, the Collatz conjecture has been verified for start values up to about 2.88×1018. The Riemann hypothesis has been verified for the first 10 trillion zeroes of the zeta function. Neither of these statements is considered proved.|$|E

The inquest heard detailed reports into the men's injuries {{at the hands of the}} mob with multiple gunshot wounds to hands, legs arms and faces. Relatives at the inquest demanded an apology from Dr Nicholas Hunt, the government appointed pathologist, as he had used photographs of the dead men in a seminar in <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up temporary mortuaries in disaster zones without permission from the families.|$|E
25|$|Cookery A {{consists}} of British printed cookery books. Among the major works held are four copies of Hannah Woolley’s The Queen-Like Closet. The earliest edition is from 1672. Woolley {{was one of}} the first women in England to have earned a living from writing and selling books. There are two copies of Pomona: or the Fruit Garden Illustrated (1729) written by the English garden designer, Batty Langley; the book is a gardener's manual for growing, picking and preserving fruits, as well as pruning and caring for plants. Charles Carter's The Complete Practical Cook : or, a new system of the whole art and mystery of cookery (1730) is an illustrated recipe book. It contains copperplate engravings showing <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> and arrange a table for various courses in an 18th-century dinner.

The next day, approximately 300fans protested the merger by marching with signs and chantings slogans in Tokyo's Hibiya district. Days later, JPBPA members voted overwhelmingly {{for the right to}} strike as part of a bid to maintain the two-league system and prevent team mergers. Of about 750members of the players’ union, 98% voted in favor of strike rights. Fewer than ten members opposed striking.

25|$|The UN {{held the}} third global women's conference in Nairobi. During the conference, Maathai {{arranged}} {{seminars and presentations}} to describe the work the Green Belt Movement was doing in Kenya. She escorted delegates to see nurseries and plant trees. She met Peggy Snyder, the head of UNIFEM, and Helvi Sipilä, the first woman appointed a UN assistant secretary general. The conference helped to expand funding for the Green Belt Movement {{and led to the}} movement's establishing itself outside Kenya. In 1986, with funding from UNEP, the movement expanded throughout Africa and led to the foundation of the Pan-African Green Belt Network. Forty-five representatives from fifteen African countries travelled to Kenya {{over the next three years}} to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up similar programs in their own countries to combat desertification, deforestation, water crises, and rural hunger. The attention the movement received in the media led to Maathai's being honored with numerous awards. The government of Kenya, however, demanded that the Green Belt Movement separate from the NCWK, believing the latter should focus solely on women's issues, not the environment. Therefore, in 1987, Maathai stepped down as chairman of the NCWK and focused on the newly separate non-governmental organization.|$|E
