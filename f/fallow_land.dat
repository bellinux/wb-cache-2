500|$|With the {{southern}} region secured, Nguyễn Ánh {{turned his attention}} to agrarian reforms. Due to Tây Sơn naval raids on the rice crop via inland waterways, the area suffered chronic rice shortages. Although the land was extremely fertile, the region was agriculturally under-exploited, having been occupied by Vietnamese settlers only relatively recently. Furthermore, agricultural activities had also been significantly curtailed during the extended warfare with the Tây Sơn. Nguyễn Ánh's agricultural reforms were based around extending to the south a traditional form of agrarian expansion, the đồn điền, which roughly translates as [...] "military settlement" [...] or [...] "military holding", the emphasis being on the military origin of this form of colonization. These were first used during the 15th century reign of Lê Thánh Tông in the southward expansion of Vietnam. The central government supplied military units with agricultural tools and grain for nourishment and planting. The soldiers were then assigned land to defend, clear and cultivate, and had to pay some of their harvest as tax. In the past, a military presence was required because the land was being seized from the conquered indigenous population. Under Nguyễn Ánh's rule, pacification was not usually needed but the basic model remained intact. Settlers were granted <b>fallow</b> <b>land,</b> given agricultural equipment, work animals and grain. After several years, they were required to pay grain tax. The program greatly reduced the amount of idle, uncultivated land. Large surpluses of grain, taxable by the state, resulted.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to carry out a survey of vascular plants in <b>fallow</b> <b>lands</b> and to perform their multifaceted analysis. The study investigated quantitative and qualitative changes taking place in fallow vegetation with the passage of time from the abandonment of purposeful cultivation. Plant patches in 1 – 2 -year, 3 – 6 -year, 7 – 10 -year and more than 10 -year fallows were studied. Vascular plants of <b>fallow</b> <b>lands</b> within the study area comprise 442 species. 3 – 6 -year fallows were richest in species (355). With increasing fallow age, the number of species decreased to 205 species in fallows older than 10 years. Hemicryptophytes dominated in plant communities of <b>fallow</b> <b>lands.</b> Therophytes were the co-dominant biological type in the youngest fallows. Chamaephytes and geophytes in all fellow age groups accounted for about 5 %. Among vascular plants of <b>fallow</b> <b>lands,</b> native species dominated and their percentage increased with increasing fallow age, while at the same time the proportion of archeophytes decreased. With the increasing age of fallows, the proportion of species characteristic of forest communities also increased, whereas the percentage of segetal species simultaneously decreased.
