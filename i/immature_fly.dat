40|$|Species composition, {{seasonality}} {{and distribution}} of <b>immature</b> <b>fly</b> populations on a southern Queensland feedlot during 2001 – 2003 were determined. Similar data were collected on feedlots in central New South Wales and central Queensland. The fly species recovered in the highest numbers were Musca domestica L.

Houseflies preferred the warmer months from October to June, but stable flies preferred the cooler months and peaked in spring (September–November) and autumn (March–May). Larval abundance ratings recorded in the feedlot and numbers of larvae extracted in the laboratory from corresponding samples followed similar trends. Larvae of M. domestica were most abundant {{in the hospital and}} induction area and least abundant in horse stables and yards. Pupae of M. domestica were abundant in the hospital and induction area and drains, but least abundant in horse stables and yards.

40|$|Random {{samples were}} taken for 3 yr from five sample areas in cattle feedlot pens. The {{goal was to}} {{determine}} where, when, and under what conditions occurred the development of immature stages of the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), and the house fly, Musca domestica L., (Diptera: Muscidae). Feedlots practiced either minimum (possible annual manure removal), intermediate (annual manure removal and possible insecticide use), or intense (manure removal and insecticide use scheduled several times annually) management to control fly pests 2 ̆ 7 populations. <b>Immature</b> stable <b>flies</b> were affected by feedlot management: managements ranked (highest to lowest numbers of flies) were minimum, intermediate, and intense. Numbers of <b>immature</b> house <b>flies</b> were not affected by feedlot management. The feed apron sample area consistently yielded the highest numbers of both pests. <b>Immature</b> stable <b>flies</b> were found predominantly in the early (cool) season; <b>immature</b> house <b>flies</b> were found predominantly in the later (warm) season. The number of stable <b>fly</b> <b>immatures</b> correlated strongly to adults in 1986 and 1987. At least 47 spp. of associated arthropods were found coinhabiting with these pests. The predominant predator (≈ 17 spp. total) species was Platystethus cornutus Grav. (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) while the predominant potential competitor (≈ 30 spp. total) species was Coproica sp. (probably vagans) (Diptera: Sphaeroceridae). Predators were found in about equal numbers between feedlot managements and sample areas in all 3 yr. Potential competitors were found in about equal numbers between feedlot managements; along the feed apron was the predominant sample area in all 3 yr. The high percentage of organic matter at the feed apron was the major contributing factor to successful development of pests and competitors. Regression analysis showed potential for predicting numbers of <b>immature</b> stable <b>flies.</b> <b>Immature</b> stages of the stable fly appeared more sensitive {{to changes in the}} microhabitat than <b>immature</b> house <b>flies.</b> Improved manure management practices along the feed apron could significantly impact both fly species at cattle feedlots. ...|$|R

Despite their considerable forensic potential, their use has been limited because morphological species identification, at any life stage, is very challenging. This study investigated whether DNA could be extracted and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) barcode sequences obtained for molecular identification of each immature life stage of the forensically important Australian flesh fly, Sarcophaga (Sarcorohdendorfia) impatiens (Walker). Genomic DNA extracts were prepared from all larval instars and puparia. Amplification of the barcoding region was successful from all extracts, but puparia amplicons were weak. All sequences were identified as S. impatiens with 99. 95 % confidence using the Barcoding of Life Database (BOLD). Importantly, crop removal was necessary to eliminate PCR inhibition for specimens from late second and early third instars.

40|$|Background: The {{location}} of the microhabitats where <b>immature</b> phlebotomine sand <b>flies</b> of the genus Lutzomyia develop {{is one of the}} least-known aspects of this group of medically important insects. For this reason strategies of source reduction approach for their control have not been possible in contrast to other insect vectors (such as mosquitoes), because their juvenile stages in terrestrial microhabitats is difficult to detect. Methods: Direct examination of soil samples, incubation of substrates and the use of emergence traps were the methods used to identify juvenile stages in 160 soil samples from urban and forest habitats within the foci of Leishmania transmission in Colombia. Immatures collected were identified subsequent from the rearing and emergence of adults using taxonomic keys or the analysis of the mitochondrial marker cytochrome oxidase I. Plant species associated with the natural breeding sites were identified and physicochemical properties of the soils were analyzed. Results: A total of 38 (23. 7 %) sampling sites were identified as breeding sites, 142 phlebotomine sand flies were identified, belonging to 13 species of the genus Lutzomyia and two of Brumptomyia.

Cow comfort is an important consideration when selecting housing, particularly in areas with harsh winters.

40|$|Medico-legal entomology, {{the study}} and {{application}} of insect science to criminal investigations, is most notably used to estimate a minimum post-mortem interval (minPMI). Examining blow fly development to make this estimation provides the minimum {{time it takes to}} reach the oldest stage associated with the remains. Unfortunately, providing {{the time it takes to}} reach a stage may underestimate the age of the insects during the lengthier post feeding stage and intra-puparial period. Hyperspectral remote sensing is introduced as a means to solve this issue and to examine the potential for narrowing these lengthier stages into days within the stages. Hyperspectral remote sensing involves sensing, recording and processing reflected and emitted energy to produce point source measurements. Spectral measurements of both immature Protophormia terraenovae and Lucilia sericata were completed from second instar to adult emergence from the mid-section, anterior and posterior ends of developing <b>immature</b> blow <b>flies.</b> Functional regressions and coefficient functions were examined for model prediction and generalization to identify demarcations within stadia to age the <b>immature</b> blow <b>flies.</b> Aging P. terraenovae larvae was successful at wavelengths ranging from 400 - 1000 nm, however, at that wavelength range, only the last day of the intra-puparial period could be distinguished from the first five days.

The tests were performed using the progeny of adults collected in the field. The immatures were maintained in a growth chamber at 25. 0 ± 0. 5 oC and 12 - 12 h photoperiod.

Applications in dairy farms were performed at dosages and concentrations predetermined in laboratory experiments, to employ the two formulations at an equal insecticidal potential.

40|$|Following {{eclosion}} {{from the}} pupal case, {{wings of the}} <b>immature</b> adult <b>fly</b> unfold and expand to present a flat wing blade. During expansion the epithelia, which earlier produced the wing cuticle, delaminate from the cuticle, and the epithelial cells undergo an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). The resulting fibroblast-like cells then initiate a programmed cell death, produce an extracellular matrix that bonds dorsal and ventral wing cuticles, and exit the wing. Mutants that block wing expansion cause persistence of intact epithelia within the unexpanded wing. However, the normal progression of chromatin condensation and fragmentation accompanying programmed cell death in these cells proceeds with an approximately normal time course. These observations establish that the Bursicon/Rickets signaling pathway is necessary for both wing expansion and initiation of the EMT that leads to removal of the epithelial cells from the wing.

50|$|A. mixta {{has been}} seen on the wing in all {{months of the year}} but most {{commonly}} from July to Late October or early November. After emergence, the <b>immature</b> adults <b>fly</b> away from water and spends their time feeding and becoming sexually mature.

Once mature, they return to water and begin mating behaviour with the males patrolling looking for females. A. mixta males are less territorial than other male aeshnas. Males form a tandem pairing with a female on the wing and copulate. After mating the male and female split up and the female oviposits alone. The eggs develop and then enter dipause and it is as diapause eggs that A. mixta overwinter. In spring the eggs hatch into a prolarva which only lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes, the prolarva then molts into a stadium 2 larva. Larval development is rapid and adults emerge in summer. A. mixta is a univoltine species, that is to say that it completes its life-cycle in one year.|$|R

Adult stable fly emergence densities were significantly correlated with substrate microbial respiration rate,NH 4 -N concentration, EClab, total C concentration, pH, and moisture content.

The {{objective of this}} study was to relate physiochemical and microbial properties of these substrates to the presence or absence of stable fly larvae. Properties included pH, temperature, moisture, ammonium concentration, electrical conductivity, and numbers of coliform, fecal coliform, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus bacteria. Each physiochemical sample was classified as a function of belonging to one of the three 2 -m concentric zones radiating from the feeder as well as presence or absence of larvae. In total, 538 samples were collected from 13 sites during 2005 – 2011. Stable fly larvae were most likely to be found in moist, slightly alkaline substrates with high levels of ammonium and low temperature. The probability of larvae being present in a sample was the highest when the moisture content was 347 % relative to dry weight and the average pH was 8. 4. Larvae were recovered within all zones, with a nonsignificant, but slightly higher, percentage of samples containing larvae taken 2 – 4 m from the center. All methods used to enumerate bacteria, except total coliform, indicated decreasing concentrations in hay bale residue throughout the summer.

The substrate at these sites, consisting of waste hay mixed with bovine manure and urine, provided an excellent developmental habitat for <b>immature</b> stable <b>flies.</b> Stable flies were the most frequently collected fly emerging from these sites with a yearly average of 1, 581 emerging per square meter. Stable fly emergence from these sites began in early May (235 annual accumulated Day-Degree 10 °C [DD 10]), peaked in late June and early July (400 - 900 DD 10) and then dropped to very low levels in late July (3 ̆e 900 DD 10). The temporal pattern of stable fly emergence from the hay feeding sites differed from that of adult populations measured with sticky traps. Adult populations increased in the spring before significant emergence from the hay feeding sites was observed, dipped in midsummer soon after the hay feeding sites became nonproductive, and then rebounded {{in the late summer}} when emergence from the hay feeding sites was very low. The drop in productivity of the hay feeding sites appeared to be because of endogenous factors associated with decomposition of the substrate rather than temperature or precipitation. Winter hay feeding sites appear to be primary sources of stable flies during the early summer, however, they are not responsible for late summer and fall stable fly populations. Overall, the inner most 2 -m annulus of the hay feeding sites was the most productive, however, spatial variation among sites was observed.

40|$|Developing {{animals are}} {{particularly}} vulnerable to predation. Hence, precocial young of many taxa develop predator escape performance that rivals that of adults. Ontogenetically unique among vertebrates, birds transition from hind limb to forelimb dependence for escape behaviours, so developmental investment for immediate gains in running performance may impair flight performance later. Here, in a three-dimensional kinematic study of developing birds performing pre-flight flapping locomotor behaviours, wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) and a newly described behaviour, controlled flapping descent (CFD), we define three stages of locomotor ontogeny in a model gallinaceous bird (Alectoris chukar). In stage I (1 – 7 days post-hatching (dph)) birds crawl quadrupedally during ascents, and their flapping fails to reduce their acceleration during aerial descents. Stage II (8 – 19 dph) birds use symmetric wing beats during WAIR, and in CFD significantly reduce acceleration while controlling body pitch to land on their feet. In stage III (20 dph to adults), birds are capable of vertical WAIR and level-powered flight. In contrast to altricial species, which first fly when nearly at adult mass, we show that in a precocial bird the major requirements for flight (i. e. high power output, wing control and wing size) convene by around 8 dph (at ca 5 % of adult mass) and yield significant gains in escape performance: <b>immature</b> chukars can <b>fly</b> by 20 dph, at only about 12 per cent of adult mass...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{understand}} {{factors that}} facilitate insular colonization by black flies, we tested six hypotheses related to life-history traits, phylogeny, symbiotes, island area, and distance from source areas. Location Four northern islands, all within 150 km of the North American mainland, {{were included in}} the study: Isle Royale, Magdalen Islands, Prince Edward Island, and Queen Charlotte Islands. Methods <b>Immature</b> black <b>flies</b> and their symbiotes were surveyed in streams on the Magdalen Islands, and the results combined with data from similar surveys on Isle Royale, Prince Edward Island, and the Queen Charlotte Islands. Black flies were analysed chromosomally to ensure that all sibling species were revealed. Tests of independence were used to examine the frequency of life-history traits and generic representation of black flies on islands vs. source areas. Results A total of 13 - 20 species was found on each of the islands, but no species was unique to any of the islands. The simuliid faunas of the islands reflected the composition of their source areas in aspects of voltinism (univoltine vs. multivoltine), blood feeding (ornithophily vs. mammalophily), and phylogeny (genus Simulium vs. other genera). Five symbiotic species were found on the most distant island group, the Magdalen Islands, supporting the hypothesis that obligate symbiotes are effectively transported to near-mainland islands. An inverse relationship existed between the number of species per island and distance from the source. The Queen Charlotte Islands did not conform to the species-area relationship. Main conclusions The lack of precinctive insular species and an absence of life-history and phylogenetic characteristics related to the presence of black flies on these islands argue for gene flow and dispersal capabilities of black flies over open waters, possibly aided by winds. However, the high frequency of precinctive species on islands 500 km or more from the nearest mainland indicates that at some distance beyond 100 km, open water provides a significant barrier to colonization and gene exchange. An inverse relationship between number of species and distance from the source suggests that as long as suitable habitat is present, distance {{plays an important role in}} colonization. Failure of the Queen Charlotte Islands to conform to an area-richness trend suggests that not all resident species have been found. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|R

We conducted sampling, observations and field pollination experiments. The flies were attracted by the odour of female-phase inflorescences in the early morning {{on the first day of}} anthesis.

The flowering events and fly behaviours were well synchronized. In the field pollination experiments, the inflorescences bagged with a fine mesh (insect exclusion) produced almost no fruits, whereas those bagged with a coarse mesh (bee exclusion) produced as many fruits as the open-pollinated controls. These results indicate that the flies are the most efficient and specialised pollinators for their host, A. macrorrhizos. These flies, in return, depend on A. macrorrhizos for food and habitat through most of their life cycle.

Large size horizontal sticky traps within the confined spaces were used to trap the sand flies. Newly eclosed male sand flies were identified based on their un-rotated genitalia. Cumulative results show that Phlebotomus sergenti the vector of Leishmania tropica rests and breeds inside caves that are also home to rock hyraxes (the reservoir hosts of L. tropica) and several rodent species. Emerging sand flies were also trapped outside covered caves, probably arriving from other caves or from smaller, concealed cracks in the rocky ledges close by. Man-made support walls constructed with large boulders were also identified as breeding habitats for Ph. sergenti albeit less important than caves. Soil samples obtained from caves and burrows were rich in organic matter and salt content. In this study we developed {{and put into practice}} a generalized experimental scheme for identifying sand fly breeding habitats and for assessing the quantities of flies that emerge from them.

40|$|Regulation of {{forensic}} practice {{in many countries}} prevents the pathologist performing an immediate autopsy. During the period prior to autopsy, the corpse and the insects possibly associated with it are stored in a mortuary with temperatures ∼ 4 °C. When a corpse is found in a late stage of decay, <b>fly</b> <b>immatures</b> may be present as small or large larval masses. The purpose of refrigeration at 4 °C is {{to slow down the}} decomposition of the corpse as well as the temporary disruption of the activity and development of the bacteria and the necrophagous insects associated with the corpse. The aim of this research is to investigate the growth and development of different larval masses of the blowfly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) when stored in a cold environment (4 °C). The research was divided into experimental sessions comprising different storage conditions (continuous or cyclic exposure to a cold environment) for immature stages (second and third instar) and included four different sizes of larval mass (∼ 100, 500, 1, 000, and 5, 000 larvae) feeding on 4 [*]kg of beef liver and replicated three times. Results show that if the larval mass has a size of ∼ 5, 000 larvae, and the larvae have already reached third instar, then when they are exposed to a cold environment, their development continues. The storage condition at 4 °C does not disrupt the development of such larvae. The number of larvae and their instar that make up the larval mass are essential data for the subsequent estimation of a correct minimum postmortem interval...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Members of {{the family}} Simuliidae were studied in a single, {{confined}} drainage system. In addition to determining the occurrence and distribution of the species present, biological and ecological observations were made. Specific measurements and observations were accomplished to determine {{as much as possible}} about the habitat specificity and life cycle characteristics of the simuliids present. Rearing and association experiments were also carried out on many species. Sixteen species representing four genera were studied. In addition, one series of Prosimulium specimens could not be identified definitely, and one new species of Simulium was found and studied. Adult emergence extended from early January to late November. Twinnia and Prosimulium representatives were generally the first black flies to emerge. Light appeared to be the primary limiting factor as to adult emergence in all species studied in detail. Males almost always emerged earlier than the females. All Twinnia, Cnephia, and Prosimulium species, and Simulium argus, S. canadense, S. pugetense, and S. tuberosum had one generation per year. S. articum, S. decorum, S. piperi, S. venustum, and S. sp. # 1 all had two generations per year, and S. vittatum had three. Larval and pupal duration times were recorded for most species, and varied greatly. The effect of water temperature and velocity on these times could not be accurately determined. Although overwintering stages varied, most of the species studied passed the winter months in the egg. Oviposition was never observed, although determinations were made on egg deposition sites and conditions for four species. Drift of Prosimulium larvae was much greater than with the same stages of Simulium. Physical and biological conditions under which black <b>fly</b> <b>immature</b> stages flourished were extremely diverse. Both crayfish and predaceous caddisflies were very effective in maintaining minimal larval concentration levels in certain situations...|$|R
40|$|The {{immature}} {{stages of}} the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) and house fly, Musca domestica L., were monitored in ten potential breeding materials found outside cattle feedlot pens. Samples were taken over a three year period. Samples were also taken from piles of grass clippings in urban suburban areas over a two year period. Samples taken along the back fence and along the perimeter of sewage lagoons produced few immature {{stages of the}} house fly or stable fly. Very few stable fly larvae were collected from the silage in bunker silos or haylage. The stable flies were most consistently produced in samples from the runoff ditch. Largest numbers of stable flies were collected in samples from grass clippings, spilled silage, silage {{at the base of}} the bunker silo and spilled silage. The immature stages of the house fly were rarely collected from piled manure and grass. Spilled grain, haylage, and spilled grain produced large numbers of house <b>fly</b> <b>immatures.</b> ^ Although these two species develop in similar habitats, they were collected together in only 3 % of the samples collected. Differences in the physical parameters of the materials and a seasonal separation of the two species may be an explanation. ^ Adult stable flies were monitored during three winters at two, four, and 13 locations with Alsynite fiberglass traps and by examination of the interiors of buildings. No stable flies were found inside buildings during the winter. Adult stable flies were consistently caught on Alsynite traps at one location during two winters and at two other locations during one winter. Distribution and physiological age of these flies indicate that they emerged from pupae that had developed at or near the location where they were captured. Potential breeding sites were examined. A few third instars were found in silage in midwinter, but silage should nor be considered a major source for overwintering stable flies. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Ecological and {{production}} studies of Prosimulium caudatum Shewell, P. dicum Dyar and Shannon, Simulium arcticum Malloch and S. canadense Hearle (Diptera: Simuliidae) {{were made in}} 1971 and 1972 in three streams near Corvallis, Oregon. The {{purpose of the study}} was to characterize the biology and population dynamics of larvae, and to compare the production of the four species under various spatial and temporal conditions. A total of 54 annual production estimates was derived utilizing 37 stations. In addition, 17 annual drift and 22 emergence (as pupae) determinations were made. Data on the physical and chemical characteristics of the streams, and on larval associates, parasites, predators and food types were obtained at all stations. Laboratory experiments provided data on feeding rates and predator impact. The two Prosimulium species always coexisted, and occurred in all streams. Simulium arcticum and S. canadense were studied in two streams only. All species were univoltine and had egg stage durations exceeding 40 weeks. Prosimulium spp. larvae appeared in mid-February and were on riffles for an average of 10. 3 weeks. Simulium arcticum hatching began about six weeks later. Larvae of this species developed in an average of 8. 8 weeks. Development of S. canadense began about nine weeks later than for Prosimulium spp. but lasted nearly as long. All four black flies had six larval instars. All larvae were filter feeders, and fed primarily on the suspended materials in the streams. Detritus made up from 65 - 90 % of the diet, with the rest being filamentous algae. Alimentary tract clearing of larvae was usually accomplished in less than one hour. Black <b>fly</b> <b>immatures</b> were associated with about 75 other benthic insect species. Of these, nine were likely important simuliid natural enemies. Fish were minor black fly predators. Gastromermis nematodes occurred in about 3 % of all mature simuliid larvae. Annual losses due to drift averaged about 6 %. Simuliid drift appeared to be a function of standing crop density. Growth-related crowding may also have been a factor. Effects of diel light conditions, temperature and discharge were minimal. A diel emergence pattern existed for Simulium spp. adults only. The time between emergence and oviposition was likely about 0. 5 week for all species. Emergence at most stations was single peaked, and averaged 3. 6 weeks in duration. The sampling universe at each station could be effectively partitioned to exclude areas where larvae did not exist. Thus, the weekly stratified random sampling program provided population estimates with error terms of usually 15 % or less. All quantitative data were expressed on a per m² of overall riffle basis (and not on a per m² of habitat basis) to make the study more comparable to other benthic research. Density, biomass {{and production}} differences between stations, streams and years were minimal for each species, and therefore were treated as replicates. Initial densities ranged from over 11000 to about 16000 larvae/m². Mortality for aggregates of all species was similar, with about 70 % of all losses occurring during the first half of larval life. Growth for all species was generally logistic and averaged over 0. 090 gig per day annually. Production, averaged for 1971 and 1972, in g/m², was: P. caudatum, 2. 644; P. dicum, 2. 908; S. canadense, 3. 141; and S. arcticum, 3. 950. This species ranking also held for initial density, mean density and mean biomass. Biomass and production were almost always closely correlated. Mortality variations had a greater influence on production than did growth rate. Averaged for all species, the mean total mortality due to drift and parasites was 6. 2 % and 0. 5 % respectively. An average of 10. 7 % of colonizing larvae survived to emerge. Predator-caused losses were estimated to provide the 82. 6 % needed to balance the loss budget. Black fly larvae were the dominant processor of suspended materials in the three streams. On the average, they outnumbered all other primary consumers combined on riffles by a factor of 27. Simuliid larvae functioned as the primary prey reservoir for as many as 20 species of insect carnivores from February through June of both years...|$|R
