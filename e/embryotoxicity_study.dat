40|$|Concentrations of polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) in Forster’s tern (Sterna forsteri) {{eggs from}} San Francisco Bay {{have been reported}} to range up to 63 µg g- 1 lipid weight. This value exceeds the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (1. 8 µg g- 1 egg wet weight; ~ 32 µg g- 1 lipid weight) reported in an <b>embryotoxicity</b> <b>study</b> with American kestrels (Falco sparverius). As a surrogate for Forster’s terns, common tern (Sterna hirundo) eggs were treated by air cell injection with corn oil vehicle (control) or a commercial penta-BDE formulation (DE- 71) at nominal concentrations of 0. 2, 2, and 20 µg g- 1 egg. As a positive control, kestrel eggs received vehicle or 20 µg DE- 71 g- 1 egg. In terns, there were no effects of DE- 71 on embryonic survival, and pipping or hatching success; however, treated eggs hatched later (0. 44 d) than controls. Organ weights, organ-to-body weight ratios, and bone lengths did not differ, and histopathological observations were unremarkable. Several measures of hepatic oxidative stress in hatchling terns were not affected by DE- 71, although there was some evidence of oxidative DNA damage (8 -hydroxy-deoxyguanosine; 8 -OH-dG). Although DE- 71 did not impair pipping and hatching of kestrels, it did result in a delay in hatch, shorter humerus length, and reduced total thyroid weight. Concentrations of oxidized glutathione, reduced glutathione, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and 8 -OH-dG in liver were greater in DE- 71 -treated kestrels compared to controls. Our findings suggest common tern embryos, and perhaps other tern species, are less sensitive to PBDEs than kestrel embryos...|$|E
40|$|Insulin glargine (LANTUS) {{is a new}} insulin analog {{that has}} a {{prolonged}} duration of action with no pronounced peak of activity, rendering it an ideal basal insulin {{for the treatment of}} diabetes. The aim of these studies was to assess the reproductive and embry-otoxicity of insulin glargine. Reproductive toxicity was assessed in 25 male and 25 female Wistar rats per group treated with a daily subcutaneous injection of control; 1 IU/kg, 3 IU/kg, and 10 IU/kg insulin glargine; or 3 IU/kg NPH insulin in the premating andmat-ingperiods, and throughout pregnancy and lactation in the females. Embryotoxicity was assessed in 20 female rats per group injected with daily subcutaneous doses of control; 2 IU/kg, 6. 3 IU/kg, and 20 IU/kg insulin glargine; or 6. 3 IU/kg NPH insulin from the 7 th to 18 th day of pregnancy. Embryotoxicity was also assessed in 20 female rabbits per group treated with 0 IU/kg, 0. 5 IU/kg, 1 IU/kg, and 2 IU/kg insulin glargine, or 1 IU/kg NPH insulin from the 6 th to 18 th day of pregnancy. The data demonstrated that, with the exception of toxicologic effects induced by hypoglycemia in re-sponse to high doses of insulin glargine and NPH insulin (including the premature dropout of female rats in the reproductive toxic-ity study, and increased incidence of abortions, early intrauterine deaths, and single anomalies in the rabbit <b>embryotoxicity</b> <b>study),</b> insulin glargine had no effects on reproduction, embryofetal de-velopment, and postnatal development in rats. Maternal and em-bryofetal toxicity in rabbits treated with middle and high doses of insulin glargine was related to the hypoglycemic effect of insulin...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of novel}} drugs and {{chemicals}} requires reliable data on their potential toxic effects on humans. Current test systems are mainly based on animals or in vitro–cultured animal-derived cells {{and do not}} or not sufficiently mirror the situation in humans. Therefore, in vitro models based on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have become an attractive alternative. The article summarizes the characteristics of pluripotent stem cells, including embryonic carcinoma and embryonic germ cells, and discusses the potential of pluripotent stem cells for safety pharmacology and toxicology. Special attention is directed to the potential application of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) for the assessment of developmental toxicology as well as cardio- and hepatotoxicology. With respect to embryotoxicology, recent achievements of the embryonic stem cell test (EST) are described and current limitations as well as prospects of <b>embryotoxicity</b> <b>studies</b> using pluripotent stem cells are discussed. Furthermore, recent efforts to establish hPSC-based cell models for testing cardio- and hepatotoxicity are presented. In this context, methods for differentiation and selection of cardiac and hepatic cells from hPSCs are summarized, requirements and implications with respect to the use of these cells in safety pharmacology and toxicology are presented, and future challenges and perspectives of using hPSCs are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Spermio- and embryotoxicities of Cu, Ag, Cd, and Hg were {{investigated}} in Paracentrotus lividus, the dominant echinoid {{species of the}} Mediterranean. Spermiotoxicity was studied by assessing the effects of sperm exposure on fertilization rate (FR) {{as well as on}} the induction of transmissible damages to the offspring. <b>Embryotoxicity</b> was <b>studied</b> by assessing developmental defects in larvae exposed to the tested metals throughout their development. Sperm exposures resulted in significant decreases of FR, depending on both metal concentration and duration of the exposure. Lowest spermiotoxic concentrations recorded when sperm were exposed for 75 min to the metals were 10 - 7 M Hg(II), 10 - 6 M Ag(I), 10 - 5 M Cu(II), and 10 - 5 M Cd(II). Tested metals did not exert any transmissible damage to spermatozoa that could result in larval malformations in the offspring, even for concentrations that dramatically reduced FR. Single-element exposures of embryos for 72 h resulted in developmental defects whose occurrence and severity showed a steep dose dependence, indicating that once a threshold is reached, any further increase in toxicant concentration rapidly enhances the impairment of target function(s). Those observations suggest the involvement of a saturable protective mechanism. Lowest observed embryotoxic concentrations of the metals were 10 - 7 M Hg(II), 2. 5 x 10 - 7 M Ag(I), 5 x 10 - 7 M Cu(II), and 10 - 5 M Cd(II) and are in the range of concentrations reported in heavily polluted marine environments. Thus, the possibility of impairment of echinoid development actually exists in metal contaminated marine environments, possibly threatening echinoid populations in those environments...|$|R
40|$|Cefazolin sodium is an {{essential}} drug that is widely used in clinical therapy for certain infective diseases caused by bacteria. As drug impurities {{are considered to be}} one of the most important causes of drug safety issues, we <b>studied</b> <b>embryotoxicity,</b> cardiotoxicity, and neurotoxicity of nine cefazolin sodium impurities in zebrafish embryo and larvae for the objective control of impurity profiling. LC-MS/MS was employed to analyze the compound absorbance in vivo, and the structure-toxicity relationship was approached. Our results suggested that the structure of MMTD (2 -mercapto- 5 -methyl- 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole) is the main toxic functional group for embryo deformities; the 7 -ACA (7 -aminocephalosporanic acid) structure mainly affects motor nerve function; and both the MMTD and 7 -ACA structures are responsible for cardiac effects. Impurity G (7 -ACA) presented with the strongest toxicity; impurity A was most extensively absorbed to embryo and larvae; and impurity F (MMTD) exhibited the strongest apparent toxic effect; Therefore, impurities F and G should be monitored from the cefazolin sodium preparations...|$|R
40|$|Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB) {{accumulate}} {{in the environment}} and in both humans and animals. In in vivo and in vitro studies technical PCB mixtures were toxic to embryos. In the present study highly purified PCB congeners were studied for their embryotoxic potential, employing cultured rabbit embryos of different stages. Toxicological endpoints were blastocyst formation, growth and cell proliferation. In addition, expression of the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) was <b>studied.</b> <b>Embryotoxicity</b> may not only be based on direct toxic effects on the embryo itself but may be mediated by changes in the maternal genital tract. AhR expression was studied on mRNA- and protein level in human endometrium. PCB damaged rabbit embryos in a congener- and stagespecific manner. Cell proliferation in blastocysts was reduced by 50 % by coplanar PCB in concentrations as low as 0. 3 ng/ml culture medium, i. e. in concentrations known to occur in not specifically exposed humans. Morulae were damaged by various mixtures of highly purified PCB, but not as strongly as blastocysts. In women of reproductive age, AhR was expressed in an age- and cycle-dependent way. The highest expression occurred {{about the time of}} ovulation and in younger women as compared with older ones. We conclude that the embryotoxic potential of coplanar PCB strongly needs further investigation. Special attention has to be paid to the low concentrations in which PCB damaged embryos. Because the Ah-Receptor is expressed in human endometrium not only the embryo itself but also endometrial function may be affected by PCB. (orig.)

40|$|In {{search for}} {{alternative}} methods for developmental toxicity testing, we investigated whether {{embryonic stem cell}} (ESC) differentiation and its modulation by toxic exposure could be monitored by proteome profiling. We compared the proteomes of mouse ESC, differentiating ESC (DIF) and differentiating ESC exposed to the embryotoxicant monobutyl phthalate (MBP). Experiments were performed in duplicates for each cell culture and the proteins extracted from the cells were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The identified proteins were quantified using a label-free quantitative method based on counting the observed peptides as an index of protein abundance. Fifty-seven proteins were upregulated in DIF relative to ESC, whereas 42 proteins were downregulated. Most of the upregulated proteins could be correlated with cardiomyocyte functionality. In contrast, the downregulated proteins were principally pluripotency markers, chaperones and ribosomal proteins. Higher expression levels of enzymes involved in DNA mismatch repair (MSH 6) and in methylation reactions (MAT 2 A, AHCY) were also detected in the ESC, suggesting that these processes are more active in the ESC. In addition, the detection of gluthatione S-transferase alpha 4 (GSTA 4) and Park 7 DJ- 1 protein (antioxidant) in ESC indicates that these cells have potential detoxification mechanisms. Furthermore, MBP affected the expression of 33 proteins, including MYH 6, a cardiomyocyte-specific protein, which was significantly downregulated. MBP also affected the expression levels of chaperones, metabolic enzymes and chromatin modulating proteins, suggesting that MBP alters the differentiation process. Western blot analysis of MYH 6 and HSPB 1 confirmed the proteomic data. In addition, a favorable correlation was observed between protein expression and published changes in the expression of related genes at the transcriptomics level. Together, the results reveal potential protein markers {{that may be used}} as endpoints in an ESC based animal free alternative test for <b>embryotoxicity</b> though further <b>studies</b> are required for confirmation...|$|R
