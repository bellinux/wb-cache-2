25|$|Bjarne Stroustrup {{originally}} observed, in {{his book}} The Design and Evolution of C++, that pointer placement new is necessary for hardware that expects a certain object at a specific <b>hardware</b> <b>address.</b> It is also required {{for the construction of}} objects that need to reside in a certain memory area, such as an area that is shared between several processors of a multiprocessor computer.|$|E

50|$|For {{protocols}} {{that have}} only link-local addresses, such as Ethernet, <b>hardware</b> <b>addresses</b> assigned by manufacturers in networking elements are unique, {{consisting of a}} vendor identification and a serial identifier.|$|R
50|$|Operating systems usually create {{symbolic}} {{names for}} the serial ports of a computer, rather than requiring programs to refer to them by <b>hardware</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E
50|$|Adaptive load {{balancing}} (balance-alb): includes balance-tlb plus receive {{load balancing}} (rlb) for IPV4 traffic, {{and does not}} require any special network switch support. The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation. The bonding driver intercepts the ARP Replies sent by the local system {{on their way out}} and overwrites the source <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> with the unique <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> of one of the NIC slaves in the single logical bonded interface such that different network-peers use different MAC addresses for their network packet traffic.|$|E
50|$|ARP {{may also}} be used as a simple {{announcement}} protocol. This is useful for updating other hosts' mappings of a <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> when the sender's IP address or MAC address has changed. Such an announcement, also called a gratuitous ARP message, is usually broadcast as an ARP request containing the sender's protocol address (SPA) in the target field (TPA=SPA), with the target <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> (THA) set to zero. An alternative way is to broadcast an ARP reply with the sender's hardware and protocol addresses (SHA and SPA) duplicated in the target fields (TPA=SPA, THA=SHA).|$|E
50|$|In 2008, the C Standards Committee {{extended}} the C language {{to address these}} issues by providing a common standard for all implementations to adhere to. It includes a number of features not available in normal C, such as, fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces, and basic I/O <b>hardware</b> <b>addressing.</b>|$|R
50|$|In earlier {{personal}} computers, {{attempting to}} write data to <b>hardware</b> <b>addresses</b> {{outside of the}} system's main memory could cause hardware damage. Some crashes are exploitable and allow a malicious program or hacker to execute arbitrary code allowing for the replication of viruses or the acquisition of data which would normally be inaccessible.|$|R
5000|$|C {{is widely}} used for system {{programming}} in implementing operating systems and embedded system applications, because C code, when written for portability, {{can be used for}} most purposes, yet when needed, system-specific code can be used to access specific <b>hardware</b> <b>addresses</b> and to perform type punning to match externally imposed interface requirements, with a low run-time demand on system resources.|$|R
5000|$|Assume a host {{needs to}} make a local {{delivery}} to another host on the local network, and the target host has an IPv6 address of fe80::2aa:ff:fe28:9c5a (as in Example 2 above). In {{order to make a}} Layer-2 (e.g. Ethernet) delivery, it needs to know the target host's <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> (e.g. [...] "Ethernet MAC address"). But in order to do this, it must first determine which <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> to send it to. To do this, an IPv6 host will construct the Solicited-node Multicast Address related to the target address.|$|E
5000|$|The Micro Address Controller (The MAC, {{also called}} RMAC, for [...] "Rask MAC" [...] ("Speedy MAC"). It {{implemented}} <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> arithmetic, {{which in the}} ND-100 had been done in microcode.|$|E
5000|$|The {{principal}} packet {{structure of}} ARP packets {{is shown in}} the following table which illustrates the case of IPv4 networks running on Ethernet. In this scenario, the packet has 48-bit fields for the sender <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> (SHA) and target <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> (THA), and 32-bit fields for the corresponding sender and target protocol addresses (SPA and TPA). Thus, the ARP packet size in this case is 28 bytes. The EtherType for ARP is 0x0806. (This appears in the Ethernet frame header when the payload is an ARP packet. Not to be confused with PTYPE below, which appears within this encapsulated ARP packet.) ...|$|E
40|$|Draft for the pre-Copenhagen mailing of Extensions for the {{programming}} language C to support embedded processors For {{use by the}} C++ performance group. Chapter 3 in this document describes the new interface for Basic I/O <b>hardware</b> <b>addressing</b> as it is seen from C. The interface description has now been updated to reflect the modifications agreed upon at the Toronto meeting. The major change is that the interface is made data type independent. The data type for an I/O access operation is now defined by the access_type type instead of by the function parameters. Annex B describe implementation considerations. (It is mostly a collection of the language independent parts of N 1233). To do: The goal is that it become possible {{to use the same}} interface from C and C++. Text in the performance group TR should therefore be updated to describe how the same interface for basic I/O <b>hardware</b> <b>addressing</b> can be implemented based on C++ templates...|$|R
50|$|A {{network switch}} is a {{multiport}} network bridge that uses <b>hardware</b> <b>addresses</b> to process and forward data {{at the data}} link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model. Some switches can also process data at the network layer (layer 3) by additionally incorporating routing functionality that most commonly uses IP addresses to perform packet forwarding; such switches {{are commonly known as}} layer-3 switches or multilayer switches.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} system of cueing {{informal}} interactions using the combination of Bluetooth <b>hardware</b> <b>addresses</b> to identify people and a database of user profiles. We outline the synergies between the mobile and social software infrastructures, and present a novel architecture for instigating face-to-face interaction designed to meet varying levels of privacy requirements. Finally we present {{a discussion of the}} lessons learned from a six-month user study involving over one hundred subjects. ...|$|R
50|$|Alignment {{concerns}} {{can affect}} areas {{much larger than}} a C structure when the purpose is the efficient mapping of that area through a <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> translation mechanism (PCI remapping, operation of a MMU).|$|E
50|$|MAC {{addresses}} {{are most}} often assigned by the manufacturer of a network interface controller (NIC) and are stored in its hardware, such as the card's read-only memory or some other firmware mechanism. If assigned by the manufacturer, a MAC address usually encodes the manufacturer's registered identification number and may {{be referred to as}} the burned-in address (BIA). It may also be known as an Ethernet <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> (EHA), <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> or physical address (not to be confused with a memory physical address). This can be contrasted to a programmed address, where the host device issues commands to the NIC to use an arbitrary address.|$|E
5000|$|Target <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> (THA): Media {{address of}} the {{intended}} receiver. In an ARP request this field is ignored. In an ARP reply this field is used to indicate the {{address of the}} host that originated the ARP request.|$|E

In 2004 it reached beta status.The game targets Multi-platform, supporting FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Linux distributions, and Microsoft Windows by utilizing SDL and OpenGL. <b>Hardware</b> <b>addressed</b> is OpenGL 1.5 (while recommending [...] "OpenGL 2.0 or greater") with around 256 MB of RAM, 1 GHz processor and common PC input devices (keyboard, mouse).|$|R
30|$|The ToLHnet {{protocol}} sits at {{the network}} layer of the ISO/OSI model. It is able to span different transmission media, being largely unaware {{of the details of}} the underlying data link, media access control (MAC), and physical layers. The physical network topology is arbitrary, and it does not need any MAC-level addressing or filtering capabilities. Nodes are permanently identified by 48 -bit <b>hardware</b> <b>addresses</b> and are automatically assigned temporary 16 -bit network addresses upon network configuration.|$|R
40|$|A new mobile-phone–based {{system uses}} Bluetooth <b>hardware</b> <b>addresses</b> and a {{database}} of user profiles to cue informal, face-to-face interactions between nearby users who don’t know each other, but probably should. Mobile phones have been adopted faster than any technology in human history and are now available {{to the majority of}} people on Earth who earn more than US$ 5 a day. More than 600 million phones were sold in 2004, many times more than the number of personal computers sold that year...|$|R
5000|$|Address mapping. Sometimes {{protocols}} need to map {{addresses of}} one scheme on addresses of another scheme. For instance to translate a logical IP address {{specified by the}} application to an Ethernet <b>hardware</b> <b>address.</b> This {{is referred to as}} address mapping.|$|E
50|$|The BSAVED {{format is}} a device-dependent raster image format; the file header stores {{information}} about the display <b>hardware</b> <b>address,</b> {{and the size of}} the graphics data.The graphics data follows the header directly and is stored as raw data in the format of the native adapter's addressable memory.|$|E
5000|$|A Trunk was {{a generic}} {{name and a}} <b>hardware</b> <b>address</b> within a Port to which a {{peripheral}} controller would be assigned [...] A Trunk was a generic name for a controller {{for a number of}} Stream devices.A Stream was the generic name for the channel under which individual peripheral devices could be referenced.|$|E
40|$|Media Access Control (MAC) address {{randomization}} is a privacy technique whereby mobile devices rotate through random <b>hardware</b> <b>addresses</b> {{in order}} to prevent observers from singling out their traffic or physical location from other nearby devices. Adoption of this technology, however, has been sporadic and varied across device manufacturers. In this paper, we present the first wide-scale study of MAC address randomization in the wild, including a detailed breakdown of different randomization techniques by operating system, manufacturer, and model of device...|$|R
50|$|The {{first two}} reside inside the FDC IC while the Control port {{is in the}} {{external}} <b>hardware.</b> The <b>addresses</b> of these three ports are as follows.|$|R
50|$|It follows that, in principle, {{the network}} {{identity}} of a device should be established before permitting network connectivity, for example by using digital certificates in place of <b>hardware</b> <b>addresses</b> which are trivial to spoof as device identifiers. Furthermore, a consistent identity model has to account for typical network devices such as routers and switches which can't depend on user identity, since no distinctive user {{is associated with the}} device. Absent this capability in practice, however, strong identity is not asserted at the network level.|$|R

5000|$|The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is an {{obsolete}} computer networking protocol used by {{a client}} computer to request its Internet Protocol (IPv4) address from a computer network, when all it has available is its link layer or <b>hardware</b> <b>address,</b> such as a [...] MAC address. The client broadcasts the request, and does not need prior knowledge of the network topology or the identities of servers capable of fulfilling its request.|$|E
50|$|In the {{original}} IBM PC, the basic RAM limit is 640 kB. This {{is to allow}} for <b>hardware</b> <b>addressing</b> space in the upper 384 kB (upper memory area (UMA)) of the total addressable memory space of 1024 kB (1 MB). Ways to overcome the 640k barrier, as {{it came to be}} known, involved using special addressing modes available in the 286 and later x86 processors. The 1 MB total address space was a result of the 20-bit address space limit imposed on the 8086 (and 8088) CPU.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{computer}} programming tasks reference memory {{in terms of}} powers of two because of the inherent binary design of current <b>hardware</b> <b>addressing</b> systems. For example, a 16-bit processor register can reference at most 65,536 items (bytes, words, or other objects); this is conveniently expressed as [...] "64K" [...] items. [...] An operating system might map memory as 4096-byte pages, in which case exactly 8192 pages could be allocated within [...] bytes of memory: [...] "8K" [...] (8192) pages of [...] "4 kilobytes" [...] (4096 bytes) each within [...] "32 megabytes" [...] (32MiB) of memory.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a system of}} sensing a social environment and cueing informal interactions between nearby users who don't know each other, but probably should. Proximate people are detected and identified using Bluetooth <b>hardware</b> <b>addresses</b> and matched from a database of user profiles. We show how inferred information from the mobile phone can augment existing profiles and we present a novel architecture for instigating face-to-face interaction designed to meet varying levels of privacy requirements. Finally, additional features are discussed as in response to results from an on-going user study involving one hundred subjects...|$|R
