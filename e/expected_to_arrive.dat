Graves returned to New York to organize a larger relief effort; this did not sail until 19 October, two days after Cornwallis surrendered.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made the plume highly buoyant; this, {{together}} with settled weather conditions, allowed the plume to rise to a great height with little cross-mixing. When the fire was reduced in intensity it was reported to be possible that the plume would be less buoyant and that ground-level smoke concentrations could then rise significantly. By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; it was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> in northern Spain by the weekend.|$|E

When {{the remainder of the}} parachute battalion arrived, he would hand over to their commander Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Pine-Coffin.

5|$|Entering {{college at}} the age of 18 Hsing discovers that 4-Hiroshi Canaval, the teacher of Navigation, has asked her to be placed {{directly}} into the second-year navigation course. Hsing shows an aptitude for the subject, and in her third year chooses to make it her profession. Luis chooses to become a doctor, and their academic separation leads to Hsing and Luis slowly drawing apart from one another. Hsing finds herself attracted to Hiroshi, and the two begin a romantic relationship. Three days after their wedding Hiroshi tells Hsing that the focus of his life's work is not simply navigation, as is generally believed, but concealing a secret {{from the rest of the}} ship. A few years earlier an unexpected gravitational effect led to the ship experiencing a vast acceleration, putting it 40 years ahead of schedule; it is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> at Hsin Ti Chiu in five years.|$|E
5|$|Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George, {{as well as}} future Prime Minister Winston Churchill were in {{attendance}} for the match. The press billed the match as England versus Wales, and noted that the Welsh fans included high numbers of woman as well as mothers with babies. There were special trains laid on for the Cardiff fans, which began arriving at Paddington train station from 4am onwards. The Metropolitan Railway put on additional trains to commute fans from Baker Street station to Wembley Park; one every two minutes. Between 11am to kick off, 30,000 fans per hour travelled this route; some 100,000 fans were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> at the ground. The Welsh fans made special excursions across London; some travelled to St. Paul's Cathedral, where they sang Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. Other fans went to The Cenotaph, Whitehall, where they dressed it in Welsh colours to honour the veterans of the First World War.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Krycek head to {{a subway}} station, where Dr. Girardi is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> for Grissom's funeral. Mulder sees Cole there, and Cole seems to shoot Girardi, but this is shown to be in Mulder's head. In reality, Cole has {{captured}} Girardi and holds him hostage, about to show him a similar fate as his other victims. By searching surveillance footage, they track his location and find Girardi wounded. Mulder finds Cole, who is ready to kill himself. Krycek, believing Cole is holding a gun instead of the Bible he is actually holding, shoots him, and Cole dies of his wounds. Mulder and Scully find both of their files on the case missing. Krycek reports to the Smoking Man and others, telling them that {{the dissolution of the}} X-Files and the separation of Mulder and Scully has been ineffective, and their determination is only stronger. He also notes that Scully is a bigger problem than they anticipated.|$|E
5|$|On 16 March, five {{companies}} from the Camel Corps and mounted infantry scouts, {{supported by a}} 12-pounder artillery battery and a Maxim machine gun battery, crossed the Darfur frontier and four days later occupied Um Shanga.

With {{the main body of}} his force <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> that evening, having only two days supply of water with them, Kelly considered withdrawing back to Sudan. Instead, he divided his force, forming a fast moving column, consisting of thirty mounted infantry scouts, 240 men from the Camel Corps, two artillery pieces and eight Maxims, which left for Jebel el Hella at dawn on 22 March.|$|E

Honolulu was in the final stages of preparation on October 29, when the Australia flying Kalākaua's royal flag sailed past Diamond Head, making its way to Honolulu Harbor. As the alert quickly spread across Oahu, a battery of guns began firing along the waterfront from Diamond Head to the port, and a frenzied scramble began to complete the decorations. After 281 days of constant travel, Hawaii's last king was home.|$|E

5|$|The National Library of Somalia was {{established}} in 1975, and came under {{the responsibility of the}} Ministry of Education, Culture and Higher Education. In 1983, it held approximately 7,000 books, {{little in the way of}} historical and cultural archival material, and was open to the general public. The National Library later closed down in the 1990s. In June 2013, the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies organized a shipment of 22,000 books from the United States to Somalia as part of an initiative to restock the library. In December of the year, the Somali authorities officially launched a major project to rebuild the National Library.

In preparation for the relaunch, 60,000 additional books from other Arab League states are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrive.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{elements of the}} castle were also positioned for particular effect. Unusually, the huge Great Gatehouse faced south-east, away from the main road, hiding its extraordinary architectural features. This may have been because Thomas intended {{to establish a new}} settlement in front of it, but the gatehouse was also probably intended to be viewed from the harbour, where the most senior visitors were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrive.</b> The Lilburn Tower was positioned so as to be clearly - and provocatively - visible to Edward II's castle at Bamburgh, 9 miles (15km) away along the coast, and would have been elegantly framed by the entranceway to the Great Gatehouse for any visitors. It was also positioned on a set of natural basalt pillars, which - although inconvenient to build upon - would have enhanced its dramatic appearance and reflection in the meres.|$|E

25|$|While the {{immediate}} cause was the extreme optimism and subsequent disappointment at the Nivelle offensive {{in the spring}} of 1917, other causes were pacificism (stimulated by the Russian Revolution and the trade-union movement) and disappointment at the non-arrival of American troops whom French soldiers on the front had unrealistically been <b>expecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>arrive</b> within days of the U.S. declaration of war.
