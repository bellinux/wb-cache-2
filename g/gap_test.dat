Several commercial tests are available but there are few and unconfirmed reports of their efficacy. This study aimed to assess and compare the efficacy of the following H pylori serological tests in patients treated or not treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) : Pyloriset Latex, Helico-G, Biolab Malakit, and Bio-Rad <b>GAP</b> <b>Test</b> IgG. Venous blood was tested at random in 124 patients, 64 of whom had received NSAID and 60 who had not. H pylori IgG antibodies were detected by latex agglutination (Pyloriset), or by ELISA (the remaining tests). Endoscopic gastric antral biopsy specimens were also obtained for urease activity, culture, and histology. Detection of H pylori by at least two of these was considered as a true positive, and its absence in all biopsy specimens as a true negative. The sensitivity values in the presence (or absence) of NSAID were: Pyloriset Latex, 59 (60) %; Helico-G, 79 (74) %; Biolab Malakit, 85 (81) %; and Bio-Rad <b>GAP</b> <b>Test</b> IgG, 100 (95) %.

40|$|The "safe gap" {{is defined}} as the maximum gap between two close-fitting, flat, {{machined}} metal surfaces that will just prevent an explosion within a vessel from producing a propagating combustion wave in the gases that surround the vessel. At present three distinctly different apparatuses are used throughout the world to determine experimentally the maximum safe gap for different combustible gases and vapors. Unfortunately, the maximum safe gap thus determined sometimes differs widely from vessel to vessel. This report investigates the nature of the processes by which the explosion is transmitted to the surrounding media, paying particular attention to the differences from apparatus to apparatus. It is found that the time constants associated with the combustion process and with vessel exhausting are markedly different for the different vessels and that the pressure levels developed inside a vessel during the test also vary markedly from vessel to vessel. Based on these observations, it is recommended that a more thorough theoretical and experimental investigation of the safe <b>gap</b> <b>testing</b> procedures and vessel design be made as the basis for a proper design for adequate safe <b>gap</b> <b>testing</b> of all combustible vapors and gases...|$|R

40|$|We have {{compared}} the sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values of three commercial serological assays for {{the diagnosis of}} Helicobacter pylori infection. A qualitative latex method (Pyloriset; Orion Diagnostics), a semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (<b>GAP</b> <b>test</b> IgG; Bio-Rad), and a quantiative ELISA (Helico-G; Porton Cambridge) were used in 109 untreated dyspeptic patients. The presence of H. pylori was established when the results of culture and/or histology of the gastric biopsies taken were positive. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 62 % (52 % in 42 patients younger than 45 {{years of age and}} 69 % in 67 patients older than 45 years of age). Sensitivities and specificities were 68 and 76 % for Pyloriset, 89 and 77 % for <b>GAP</b> <b>test</b> IgG, and 82 and 83 % for Helico-G. The positive predictive values for all three tests were between 85 and 90 %. The predictive values for the absence of disease with a negative result were 62, 82, and 74 % for Pyloriset, the <b>GAP</b> <b>test,</b> and Helico-G, respectively. With Helico-G in the younger group (less than 45 years), sensitivity significantly lower (71 versus 87 %) and a positive predictive value lower than those for the older group (greater than 45 years) were found. Either the sensitivities and specificities of commercial methods for the measurement of antibodies to H. pylori in serum must be improved or the relationship between the presence of antibodies and the presence of bacteria in the stomach at the time of investigation is too weak to allow the use of serological techniques instead of culture and histological investigation of gastric biopsy materia...|$|E

40|$|Pressure {{thresholds}} are minimum pressures {{needed to}} start explosive initiation that ends in detonation. We obtain pressure thresholds from three sources. Run-to-detonation times are the poorest source but the fitting of a function gives rough results. Flyer-induced initiation gives {{the best results}} because the initial conditions are the best known. However, very thick flyers are needed to give the lowest, asymptotic pressure thresholds used in modern models {{and this kind of}} data is rarely available. <b>Gap</b> <b>test</b> data is in much larger supply but the various test sizes and materials are confusing. We find that explosive pressures are almost the same if the distance in the <b>gap</b> <b>test</b> spacers are in units of donor explosive radius. Calculated half-width time pulses in the spacers may be used to create a pressure-time curve {{similar to that of the}} flyers. The very-large Eglin gap tests give asymptotic thresholds comparable to extrapolated flyer results. The three sources are assembled into a much-expanded set of near-asymptotic pressure thresholds. These thresholds vary greatly with density: for TATB/LX- 17 /PBX 9502, we find values of 4. 9 and 8. 7 GPa at 1. 80 and 1. 90 g/cm{sup 3 }, respectively...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare hearing {{performance}} {{relating to}} the peripheral and central auditory system between solvent-exposed and non-exposed workers. METHODS: Forty-eight workers exposed to a mixture of solvents and 48 non-exposed control subjects of matched age, gender and educational level were selected {{to participate in the}} study. The evaluation procedures included: pure-tone audiometry (500 - 8, 000 Hz), to investigate the peripheral auditory system; the Random <b>Gap</b> Detection <b>test,</b> to assess the central auditory system; and the Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap, to investigate subjects' self-reported hearing performance in daily-life activities. A Student t test and analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were computed to determine possible significant differences between solvent-exposed and non-exposed subjects for the hearing level, Random <b>Gap</b> Detection <b>test</b> and Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap. Pearson correlations among the three measures were also calculated. RESULTS: Solvent-exposed subjects exhibited significantly poorer hearing thresholds for the right ear than non-exposed subjects. Also, solvent-exposed subjects exhibited poorer results for the Random <b>Gap</b> Detection <b>test</b> and self-reported poorer listening performance than non-exposed subjects. Results of the Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap were significantly correlated with the binaural average of subject pure-tone thresholds and Random <b>Gap</b> Detection <b>test</b> performance.
