40|$|This {{document}} {{presents an}} evaluation of the consequences of the liberalisation of the cocoa marketing system on poverty in Côte d'Ivoire. The liberalisation generated efficiency gains in the marketing process that benefited to farmers. However, a major consequence of the liberalisation was the suspension of forward contracts on the international market and between producers and trading companies. Furthermore, the liberalisation coincided with a fall in the international cocoa prices. Hence, the vulnerability of cocoa farmers increased dramatically both because of a more important risk exposure and more limited risk management instruments. The fall of their income and a more difficult access to credit lead farmers to reduce their use of <b>intrants</b> and their consumption expenses. In particular, the education expenses, which occur before the beginning of the cocoa season, were severely hurt. Last, the liberalisation induced a decrease in the role played by the co-operatives, which were unable to compete with new private operators. cocoa – poverty – marketing organisation, cote d'ivoire...|$|E

Traditionally, input costs {{have been used to}} estimate the value of education and health services. The Handbook provides detailed analysis and recommendations regarding appropriate methodologies and data to improve volume output measures for these services. The author welcomes the efforts of the OECD in this area. However, it is argued that output measures should focus on the estimates of the volume of production of these services rather than their social valuation. As such, unit costs should be used as weights when aggregating outputs rather than marginal social valuations, which introduce a degree of subjectivity.

40|$|International audienceThe savannah {{regions of}} Central Africa are {{undergoing}} numerous mutations based on high demographic rate, rapid urbanisation and cotton crisis, the main financial income of agricultural populations. This situation has favoured market emergence of consumable food, particularly maize and cowpea in the region, in association or in opposition with cotton. This situation raises up questions concerning: i) {{the impact of}} corn and cowpea emergence on food security in relation with increase of urbanisation, ii) the relation of this dynamic with financial income of producers and iii) the organisation of actors for the competitiveness of maize and cowpea. In this respect, a diagnosis of the channels of these grains has been undergone in Cameroon, Chad and Central Africa Republic. The diagnosis focused the production system (production constraints, storage, and commercialisation at farm level), the commercialisation system and product quality (national and regional fluxes, price construction and fluctuation, etc.), and the consumption system (at household level). The results obtained confirm the emergency of maize and cowpea in cotton production areas from the years 80 s. This localised emergence {{may be related to}} the fact that producers benefit from technical and logistic support of cotton development structures to obtain fertilisers and pesticides which are used both on cotton and grains (maize and cowpea). But the maize and cowpea production systems face main constraints based on: a sprayed production system (0. 5 – 2 ha/actor), low technological production level (manual practices), low access to improved seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. As a consequence, the increase of maize and cowpea production is based on the increase of production areas, but with low productivity. In these conditions, the production system may not fulfil sustainable food security and financial income of producers. In addition, constraints related to storage, processing and commercialisation conditions have direct effects on the market quality of the grains. With respect to market potential, the urbanisation phenomenon offer offer a regional opportunity for maize in the central Africa area, while Nigeria market offer the same opportunity for cowpea. Action for improvement of maize and cowpea involves: action on <b>intrants</b> channel for the improvement of productivity and promotion of integrated regional food market...|$|E

En grandes cultures, certains agriculteurs et {{conseillers}} ont d’ores et déjà développé de nouvelles pratiques allant dans le sens d’une telle réduction. Des entretiens réalisés auprès d’agriculteurs de trois zones de grandes cultures (Eure, Indre et Oise) et un travail de formation-action mené avec de conseillers de Chambres d’Agriculture dans le cadre du réseau mixte technologique « systèmes de culture innovants » nous permettent de caractériser la diversité des changements {{mis en oeuvre}} dans les exploitations, les processus d’apprentissage qui les accompagnent pour les agriculteurs, l’évolution du métier qui se dessine pour les conseillers. La construction d’espaces d’échange et d’expérimentation est une ressource clé qui permet aux uns et aux autres de réduire les incertitudes pratiques, cognitives et sociales auxquels ils se trouvent confrontésHow {{to comply}} with the new expectations of the French government regarding a reduction in the use of pesticides? Some farmers and advisers working in arable crops areas have already engaged in developing new practices which aim at reducing the use of inputs (pesticides as well as nitrogen or fuel). We chose to combine agronomists’ and social scientists’ approaches to investigate among such farmers who work within three different areas (Eure, Indre, Oise districts). Our aim was to capture and understand their long-term paths, the changes which occurred along those paths, the learning processes which supported such changes. We also carried an action-training program among some advisers working in the Chambres of Agriculture, whose program was supported by a R&D network called “innovative cropping systems”. In the present paper, we identify a diversity of paths according to some sociological and agronomic criteria and discuss this diversity {{in the light of the}} efficiency-substitution-redesign framework. We then show that (i) collective advise, (ii) farmer‘s own information search; (iii) on-farm trials carried on by the farmer, on his own or with the support of peers or of an adviser, are key in the development of new practices at farm level. We finally present the diverse situations acknowledged by the advisers as requiring different skills and resources to provide an efficient technical advice as well as their appraisal of the uncertainty regarding the change of their professional model. We finally suggest that the development of low-input practices will be facilitated if farmers as well as advisers can find some discussion and experimentation spaces in which they get means to overcome the practical, cognitive and social uncertainties they face in changing their professional practice...|$|E
40|$|International audienceChina impacts {{directly}} {{upon the}} world cotton market as {{it has become a}} structural importer in spite of its position of first producing country. The adoption of genetically modified cotton (GMC) at large scale led some external observers to anticipate that Chinese production will increase substantially at the expense of to the demand towards structural cotton-exporting countries. Owing to the negotiations within the WTO Doha Round, the perception of the Chinese cotton power has shifted to criticism of its unfair subsidy policy. Both of these views are debatable and suffer from a lack of insight on the evolution of the cotton production in China. The paper is an attemps to document the debate and to fill that gap. Cotton production in China is located is three main regions, along the Yellow River Valley, the Yangse River Valley and in the Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region where cotton production has been launched in the ' 70 s. The fate of this production cannot be disconnected from the general features of the Chinese agriculture. The Chinese agriculture is engaged into a period of great mutation. In spite of high yield level, agricultural activities can no longer ensure sufficient income to farmers. Off-farm activities enable farmers' incomes not to lag further behind the ones of the urban households, but agriculture appears to lack attractiveness, rural areas are being emptied of their working forces, the fate of this agriculture within the forthcoming years seems to be under question. Its shift towards provinces located further from the economically dynamic coastal areas would depend upon the implementation of the recent policy destined to correct income disparities, so far at the expense of rural areas. Cotton is being produced according to the high input/high output approach that benefited from the policy to secure against climatic hazards and economic risks through input subsidy and purchase price guarantee. Since its entrance to WTO, China is no longer providing any direct subsidy to cotton growers. Production intensification nevertheless keeps on and the use of GMC can be regarded as a further stage of this intensification process. This is a matter of reality worth considering before extrapolating the Chinese success in using GMC to other developing countries. The outcome of the intensification process however is hampered by the lack of collective actions among farmers. The farmers' reluctance in getting involved into collective actions impacts negatively upon the profitability of cotton production and can endanger the sustainable use of GMC through undesirable shift of the cotton pest complex. In the short run, it is doubtful that China could reverse its importing position in the cotton world market. This might sound heartening to the cotton exporting countries but not sufficient to prevent them from engaging into measures to increase its competitiveness through productivity gain. La Chine est le premier pays producteur de coton dans le monde mais sa forte consommation la place en position d'importateur structurel. La production chinoise est issue d'une agriculture familiale, avec une sole cotonnière d'environ 0, 3 ha par exploitation, dont le niveau d'intensification lui permet d'atteindre l'un des rendements les plus élevés au monde. C'est le résultat d'une volonté politique pendant près d'un demi-siècle, à partir d'une recherche dynamique et d'un soutien aux producteurs à travers subvention aux <b>intrants</b> et garantie de prix d'achat. Dès la veille de l'entrée de la Chine à l'OMC, il n'y a plus de subvention directe aux producteurs de coton et la production cotonnière se poursuit dans une filière de plus en plus libéralisée. Le mode d'intensification persiste en raison du développement du marché des intrants; l'utilisation de variétés de coton génétiquement modifié (CGM) s'inscrit comme une nouvelle étape de l'intensification. L'absence de velléité de coordination pour mener des actions collectives pénalise cependant la rentabilité de la production cotonnière et peut hypothéquer la durabilité de l'utilisation du CGM. Les fortes fluctuations de prix découragent les paysans à s'engager dans une spécialisation cotonnière accrue et elles se répercutent dans une production instable. La Chine devrait rester importatrice nette de coton, surtout dans un contexte de déclin de l'activité agricole...|$|E
40|$|La nappe aquifère de Hesbaye, logée dans les craies du Crétacé, est sollicitée à raison de trente {{millions}} de mètres cubes par an. Bien que naturellement protégée par une épaisseur de 5 à 20 mètres de limons, de nombreux indices montrent une dégradation de la qualité des eaux souterraines, notamment par les nitrates. Les concentrations en nitrates atteignent 15 à 25 mg. l- 1 dans la partie semi-captive de la nappe et sont systématiquement supérieures à 35 mg. l- 1 dans la partie libre. Malgré de fortes fluctuations temporelles, les teneurs augmentent en moyenne de 0, 35 mg. l- 1 à 0, 7 mg. l- 1 par an selon la situation semi-captive ou libre de la nappe. La détermination des paramètres hydrodynamiques et de transport de la craie par plus de 35 traçages répartis sur 11 sites, a permis de réaliser un modèle local (10 km 2) de transport simulant la propagation des nitrates dans la nappe. Le modèle a montré que cette dernière est, malgré une certaine homogénéisation, très sensible aux apports de surface engendrant une très forte variation spatiale des concentrations. La nappe réagit de manière très différente selon que les apports de surface sont d'origine ponctuelle ou diffuse. Pour les pollutions ponctuelles, les concentrations fluctuent rapidement avec des valeurs maximales et minimales observées respectivement en périodes de basses eaux et de hautes eaux. Cette situation est liée à un phénomène de dilution de la pollution par les eaux en provenance de l'amont. En cas de suppression d'une pollution ponctuelle, la qualité de la nappe s'améliore rapidement (délai de 1 à 2 ans). Pour les pollutions diffuses, les concentrations minimales s'observent en période de rabattement de la nappe : le front de nitrates migre plus lentement (environ 1 à 2 m par an) que les vitesses de rabattement de la nappe (jusqu'à 5 m par an) et les <b>intrants</b> restent nuls durant des périodes pouvant aller jusqu'à 3 ans. Différentes simulations mathématiques ont montré que si la quantité d'intrants d'origine diffuse diminue de manière permanente, la nappe mettra une vingtaine d'années pour se rééquilibrer. Ces constatations sont primordiales {{dans le cadre de}} la mise en œuvre de mesures de protection puisque, si les résultats de la suppression des pollutions ponctuelles sont rapidement mais localement observés, ceux liés à la diminution des pollutions d'origine diffuse sont observés dans des délais nettement plus longs (une à deux décennies). Ces résultats montrent clairement que toute gestion qualitative des aquifères doit être basée sur des actions à long terme. The Hesbaye area {{is located}} in the northeastern part of Belgium. The aquifer formations consist of chalk deposits. Groundwater provides about 80, 000 m 3 d- 1. Despite 5 to 20 meters of superficial loess deposits, the groundwater quality is threatened by increasing nitrate concentrations of 0. 35 mg×L- 1 per year in the semi-confined part of the aquifer to 0. 7 mg×L- 1 in the unconfined aquifer. Presently, nitrate concentrations are between 15 and 25 mg×L- 1 in the semi-confined part of the aquifer but are more than 35 mg×L- 1 (reaching locally 150 mg×L- 1) in the unconfined part that covers 95 % of the area. Nitrate concentrations have such a high spatial variation that various statistical treatments (such as kriging used to draw iso-concentration maps) have failed. This failure {{is due to the fact}} that the concentrations are highly influenced by surface land use (grass land, culture land, villages, point source pollutants, etc.). In addition, nitrate content in the aquifer varies vertically with decreasing values at depth (gradient of 0. 7 mg×L- 1 ×m- 1). Aquifer parameters were determined by 38 pumping and tracer tests conducted in radial convergent or cylindrical flow at 11 sites. Results showed that hydraulic conductivity values ranged from 1 × 10 - 6 m×s- 1 to 4 × 10 - 2 m×s- 1 and effective porosities from 0. 5 % to 7 %, showing that the aquifer was heterogeneous. Dispersivity values were affected by scale effects and varied according to chalk weathering or fracture zones. They ranged from less than 5 m in fractures to more than 60 m in weathered chalk (as in the upper part of the aquifer) and in the chalk matrix. In the chalk, transport processes were influenced by the immobile water effect due to diffusive transfer from the moving to the non-moving fluid. Non-effective porosity filled by non-moving fluid was estimated between 8 to 42 %. The transfer constant ranged from 0. 98 × 10 - 7 s- 1 to 10 × 10 - 7 s- 1. The determination of the transport parameters allowed simulation of nitrate transport at a regional scale. The SUFT 3 D (Saturated and Unsaturated Flow and Transport Model), developed by the Hydrogeology Section of the Georesources, Geotechnologies and Building Materials Department of Liege University was used. The modelled groundwater zone was defined as a 2. 0 x 4. 5 km rectangle of 10 km 2. The aquifer was subdivided into 6 layers of 3350 cells (50 x 50 m wide and 3 to 15 m thick). Boundary flow conditions were defined as a prescribed head (Dirichlet conditions) to the north and the south of the area modelled. As the model simulations run for a time period of 30 years, the northern Dirichlet conditions had to be adapted to the regional and seasonal water table fluctuations that were observed during this period. At the south boundary, as the aquifer is drained by the river Geer, the water table is fixed at the river bed altitude. The eastern and western boundaries were, according to the regional piezometry, assumed to be impermeable. For the transport boundary conditions, prescribed flux (Cauchy conditions) was used for the aquifer top. Elsewhere Neumann conditions were usedSimulations were run for the period from 1963 to 1992. Nitrate inputs were averaged yearly and estimated according to actual input conditions. These conditions were calculated by simulation of nitrate flows through the non-saturated part of the aquifer using the EPIC-Model and taking into account the amount of nitrate fertilisers used by farmers (given by the Belgian government Statistical Institute). Initial conditions were calculated according to the 1963 nitrate inputs. Simulations demonstrated that it is important to distinguish the origin of the pollution as either point or non-point (diffuse) sources. For point source pollutants (such as contaminated infiltration basins), aquifer nitrate concentrations increased during low water level periods due to weaker dilution linked with a poor regional water gradient. During high groundwater levels, dilution is more important and the nitrate concentration decreases. If a point source pollutant is suppressed, aquifer quality is improved within one to two years. This demonstrates the importance of protective actions that could be applied within the framework of the protection zones around collecting galleries and pumping fields. For diffuse contamination the mean input over the area (10 m depth below cropped areas) increased from 1. 32 × 10 - 7 mg×m- 2 ×s- 1 in 1963 to 5. 14 × 10 - 7 mg×m- 2 ×s- 1 (i. e., a factor of four). According to these values, concentrations ranged from 11 mg×L- 1 to 22 mg×L- 1 (i. e., increasing by 0. 5 mg×L- 1 per year) between 1963 and 1992. Predictive simulations, using 1992 input, show that it will take more or less 30 years for the aquifer to be in equilibrium with the 1992 input. At that time the mean concentration value will be around 30 mg×L- 1. The main results of the simulations clearly show that if actions are taken to decrease nitrate inputs, even if the aquifer nitrate contents rapidly react to the new input, nitrate levels will decrease slowly and take about 30 years to be in equilibrium with the new inputs. This long delay is due to the immobile water effect that is characteristic of the chalk aquifer. Thus it is important to inform environmentalists who work on action programs (such as the water directive imposed by the European Community in the vulnerable zones) that the effects of their actions must be based on 10 to 20 year scenarios. To this estimation, based on the reaction time of the aquifer to a new input, one must also add the time transfer of the pollutant through the unsaturated part of the aquifer...|$|E
