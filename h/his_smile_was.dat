2500|$|Apart {{from his}} {{intolerance}} of injustice and corruption, Bao {{was well known}} for his filial piety and his stern demeanor. In his lifetime, Bao gained the name [...] "Iron-Faced Judge" [...] (鐵面判官) {{and it was also}} said among the public that <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> [...] "rarer than clear waters in the Yellow River".|$|E
60|$|The Prince did not flinch. <b>His</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> {{perfectly}} courteous and acknowledging.|$|E
60|$|Barnet nodded, {{and smiled}} again; but <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> sadder than hers.|$|E
5000|$|Eia Panice the White is cold, {{ruthless}} and dreadful; <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> seldom seen, {{and to be}} feared.|$|R
6000|$|... 1st Lady. Gay, indeed! <b>His</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>were</b> like plumcake, the sweeter {{the deeper}} iced. I {{never saw him}} speak civil word to woman, but to her.|$|R
60|$|Tom {{smiled at}} the eager face; <b>his</b> <b>smiles</b> <b>were</b> very {{pleasant}} to see when they did come, for the gray eyes could be tender underneath the frown.|$|R
60|$|Guillot had {{recovered}} himself. <b>His</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> wicked, but his bow perfection.|$|E
60|$|He gave {{a little}} start, and then smiled, but <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> rueful.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice was {{trembling}} all over. The man's eyes were hateful, <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> hideous.|$|E
50|$|His {{teeth are}} startlingly perfect, {{straight}} and white, and <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> a trademark he retains from his election days (which often contrasts jarringly {{with the rest}} of his appearance).|$|R
60|$|He {{tried to}} reach her across the table, and his {{movements}} were lazy and slow, like <b>his</b> <b>smile.</b> <b>His</b> tone <b>was</b> coaxing.|$|R
60|$|Sogrange <b>was</b> amused. <b>His</b> <b>smile,</b> however, <b>was</b> hidden. Only {{the tip of}} his {{cigarette}} was visible.|$|R
60|$|He {{took his}} eyes off the road and glanced down at her curiously. <b>His</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> self-confident, exultant.|$|E
60|$|Mabane {{smiled at}} her, and <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> a revelation even to us {{who knew him}} so well.|$|E
60|$|The {{only person}} unmoved {{seemed to be}} de Freece. <b>His</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> even more amiable than usual as he began his run.|$|E
60|$|She shrank, poor creature, {{even from}} <b>his</b> <b>smile.</b> There <b>was,</b> as she thought, {{something}} contemptuous in the good-humor of it.|$|R
60|$|With that, {{he shook}} his {{likeness}} at Hugh, and giving him a grin, compared with which <b>his</b> usual <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> amiable, disappeared, and shut the door.|$|R
60|$|Once {{more the}} Prince's lips parted. <b>His</b> <b>smile</b> this time <b>was</b> definite, transfiguring.|$|R
60|$|His {{expression}} changed, but {{the effort}} of it was visible. <b>His</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> forced, and his words, light though they were, troubled her.|$|E
60|$|Violet {{decided that}} <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> very {{becoming}} {{to him and}} that she liked the way his dark hair grew over his forehead.|$|E
60|$|Draconmeyer and Selingman both {{came over}} to greet the English Minister. Selingman's blue eyes were {{twinkling}} with humour, <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> broad and irresistible.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>his</b> <b>SMILE</b> piece <b>is</b> to {{visually}} remind {{the participants and}} viewers how they each {{make a difference in}} this world and how ultimately we are all interconnected.|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt, no doubt." [...] Mr. Tulkinghorn is as imperturbable as the {{hearthstone}} {{to which}} he has quietly walked. [...] "The matter is not of that consequence that I need put you {{to the trouble of}} making any conditions, Mr. Guppy." [...] He pauses here to <b>smile,</b> and <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>is</b> as dull and rusty as his pantaloons. [...] "You are to be congratulated, Mr. Guppy; you are a fortunate young man, sir." ...|$|R
60|$|But hardly had she so spoken, {{when she}} found her brother was civilly {{offering}} a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment; never had <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>been</b> stronger, nor <b>his</b> eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her.|$|R
60|$|His {{speech was}} thick, and <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> rather idiotic, {{by reason of}} his having drunk more than his usual {{allowance}} at dinner that day.|$|E
60|$|He smiled, but <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> singular. He {{began to}} suspect at last that her only purpose--to what end he could not guess--was to detain him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Twas {{a serious}} person with locks of gray [...] And a figure like a crescent; [...] His gravity, clearly, {{had come to}} stay, [...] But <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> evanescent.|$|E
60|$|Marlow <b>smiled</b> <b>his</b> {{retrospective}} <b>smile</b> which <b>was</b> kind {{as though}} he bore no grudge against people he used to know.|$|R
6000|$|Ah Sin was his name; [...] And I {{shall not}} deny, [...] In {{regard to the}} same, [...] What that name might imply; [...] But <b>his</b> <b>smile</b> it <b>was</b> pensive and childlike, [...] As I {{frequent}} remarked to Bill Nye.|$|R
60|$|With a bashful wonder, {{but with}} right hearty will, Danny Mains availed himself of this gracious privilege. Stillwell snorted. The signs of <b>his</b> phenomenal <b>smile</b> <b>were</b> manifest, {{otherwise}} Madeline {{would have thought}} that snort an indication of furious disapproval.|$|R
60|$|His eyes gleamed for {{a moment}} with a light which she did not understand. <b>His</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> tolerant, even genial, but his face {{remained}} like the face of a sphinx.|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> full of composure. It was {{as though}} the truth which sat {{enshrined}} in the man's soul lifted him above all the ordinary emotions of fear of misunderstandings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell Hawkins I've {{abandoned}} that fishing trip," [...] he said. [...] "I've {{got another}} job." [...] Then he faced Mr. Merrick. <b>His</b> <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> not pretty, {{but it was}} a smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear sir, it {{is painful}} {{for me to}} discuss it, but if the money is not paid on the 14th, there {{certainly}} will be no marriage on the 18th." [...] <b>His</b> insufferable <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> more complacent than ever.|$|R
60|$|He <b>smiled.</b> <b>His</b> {{optimism}} <b>was</b> justified. Something {{had turned}} up.|$|R
6000|$|But <b>his</b> tranquilly {{commanding}} <b>smile</b> <b>was</b> Jeff's, and <b>his</b> lean grace; and Jeff's familiar amused voice {{greeted her}} paralyzed amazement with: ...|$|R
