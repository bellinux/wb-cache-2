40|$|Background: Currently {{there is}} little {{published}} evidence exploring the experience of post discharge surgical patients who have developed infection following hip and knes joint surgery. This mixed methods syudy used both quantitative (Phase One) and qualitative (Phase Two) methodologies to explore the experience of patients with self-reported surgical site infection Methods: Phase One - Used a researcher developed postal questionnaire to identify the incidence of self-reported surgical site infection at six weeks post surgery as well as investigating the patients' experience of diagnosis, treatment and outcome following surgical site infection. Phase Two - Recruited from Phase One, twenty three patients were recruited from Phase One and {{invited to participate in}} one to one unstructured, audio taped qualitative interviews. Guided by Husserlian phenomenological approach to data collection and analysis informed by Colaizzi's method of data analysis, nine patients shared their lived experience of developing an infection post surgery. Findings: Phase One - A total of 523 patients were identified at one NHS trust and after exclusions questionnaires and stamped addressed envelopes were posted 505 patients six weeks following either total hip or total knee replacement surgery. A reponse rate 88. 5 % led to a final analysis of 447 questionnaires to reveal that 23 (or 5. 1 %) patients developed a surgical site infection, 7 in total hip replacement and 16 in total knee replacement patients. Ten infections were identified prior to discharge and 13 post discharge. Only 6 of the 23 patients were first seen by a <b>hospital</b> <b>practitioner</b> after suspecting a surgical site infection. 4 patients sought review by their general practitioner, who then referred them on to a hospital pratitioner. The remaining 13 patients utilised a combination of different management pathways. In Phase Two analysis of the nine verbatim transcriptions revealed 5 main themes of (1) Vulnerability, (2) Perception of infection, (3) Significant event, (4) Yo yoing and (5) Pendulum of care.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To audit the {{workload}} {{of a general}} <b>practitioner</b> <b>hospital</b> and to compare the results with an earlier study. DESIGN [...] Prospective recording of discharges from the general <b>practitioner</b> <b>hospital</b> plus outpatient and casualty attendances and of all outpatient referrals and discharges from other hospitals of patients from Brecon Medical Group Practice during one year (1 June 1986 - 31 May 1987). SETTING [...] A large rural general group practice which staffs a general <b>practitioner</b> <b>hospital</b> in Brecon, mid-Wales. PATIENTS [...] 20, 000 Patients living in the Brecon area. RESULTS [...] 1540 Patients were discharged from the general <b>practitioner</b> <b>hospital</b> during the study period. The hospital accounted for 78 % (1242 out of 1594) of all hospital admissions of patients of the practice. There were 5835 new attendances at the casualty department and 1896 new outpatient attendances at consultant clinics at the hospital. Of all new outpatient attendances by patients of the practice, 71 % (1358 out of 1896) were at clinics held at the general <b>practitioner</b> <b>hospital.</b> Since the previous study in 1971 discharges from the hospital have increased 37 % (from 1125 to 1540) and new attendances at consultant clinics 30 % (from 1450 to 1896). The average cost per inpatient day is lower at this hospital than at the local district general hospital (pounds 71. 07 v pounds 88. 06 respectively).

40|$|Abstract Background Independent {{evaluation}} of clinical evidence is advocated in evidence-based medicine (EBM). However, authors' conclusions are often appealing for readers who look for quick messages. We assessed {{how well a}} group of Malaysian <b>hospital</b> <b>practitioners</b> and medical students derived their own conclusions from systematic reviews (SRs) {{and to what extent}} these were influenced by their prior beliefs and the direction of the study results. Methods We conducted two cross-sectional studies: one with <b>hospital</b> <b>practitioners</b> (n = 150) attending an EBM course in June 2008 in a tertiary hospital and one with final-year medical students (n = 35) in November 2008. We showed our participants four Cochrane SR abstracts without the authors' conclusions. For each article, the participants chose a conclusion from among six options comprising different combinations of the direction of effect and the strength of the evidence. We predetermined the single option that best reflected the actual authors' conclusions and labelled this as our best conclusion. We compared the participants' choices with our predetermined best conclusions. Two chosen reviews demonstrated that the intervention was beneficial ("positive"), and two others did not ("negative"). We also asked the participants their prior beliefs about the intervention. Results Overall, 60. 3 % correctly identified the direction of effect, and 30. 1 % chose the best conclusions, having identified both the direction of effect and the strength of evidence. More students (48. 2 %) than practitioners (22. 2 %) chose the best conclusions (P Conclusions The majority of our participants could not generate appropriate conclusions from SRs independently. Judicious direction from the authors' conclusions still appears crucial to guiding our health care practitioners in identifying appropriate messages from research. Authors, editors and reviewers should ensure that the conclusions of a paper accurately reflect the results. Similar studies should be conducted in other settings where awareness and application of EBM are different. Please see Commentary: [URL]. </p...|$|R
40|$|Withdrawal of {{life support}} therapy {{involves}} controlled removal of life support modalities including artificial respiration and circulation {{with intent to}} provide a comfortable death. Withdrawal of life support therapy is necessary prior to procedures such as organ donation after cardio-circulatory death, but remains poorly explored in current literature. To enhance the current evidence, we conducted a thorough structured review, an observational study, and a qualitative comparison of components comprising withdrawal of life support therapy in both donor and non-donor patient groups. At all stages, we considered how results impacted donation after cardio-circulatory death. Withdrawal of life support therapy processes vary between countries, <b>hospitals,</b> <b>practitioners,</b> and patients.

40|$|Tuberculosis {{was once}} very prevalent, chronic, debili-tating, {{difficult}} to treat, and incurable.

40|$|International audienceThe work {{reported}} in this paper aims to design a knowledge-based system {{in order to improve}} the first contact between an expectant mother and the <b>hospital</b> <b>practitioners</b> in charge of pregnancy following-up (midwives, gynecologists). Our work focuses on the appointment making process which is most of the time carried out by auxiliary nurses of the gynecology and obstretric department. Generally, these auxiliary nurses have only a few minutes to collect information from expectant mothers, to identify the risk level of the pregnancy, and to make an appointment with the relevant and available practitioner. Two main difficulties have been identified in this process: the call pickup rate and errors in making appointment. These two difficulties have become for us two principal areas for improving the service quality given to patients.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{a recent}} {{increase}} in activities to promote evidence-based practice (EBP), {{it was unclear}} how Malaysian <b>hospital</b> <b>practitioners</b> received this new approach in medicine. This study examines their confidence and perceptions on EBP. Findings We conducted cross-sectional surveys using a self-administered questionnaire during two EBP training courses in two Malaysian hospitals in January and June 2007. Our subjects (n = 144) were doctors and nursing and allied health staff (NAH) participating in the EBP courses. Our questionnaire covered three domains: confidence and understanding (six items), attitude (five items) and barriers to practice (four items). We presented simple descriptive statistics, including the sum ratings and the proportions with different responses for each item, and compared different groups using Mann-Whitney U test for scaled ratings and Chi-square test for dichotomous responses. Ninety-two doctors and 52 NAH staff completed the surveys. Overall, doctors expressed slightly higher confidence on EBP compared to NAH staff. Out of a maximum sum rating of 27 over six items, doctors reported an average of 18. 3 (SD 3. 2) and NAH staff reported an average of 16. 0 (SD 3. 4), p = 0. 002. Doctors were also more positive in their views on EBP. For example, 67. 4 % of doctors disagreed, but 61 % of NAH staff agreed that "the importance of EBP in patient care is exaggerated", and 79. 3 % of doctors disagreed, but 46. 2 % of NAH staff agreed that "EBP is too tedious and impractical". Similar responses were observed for other items in the domain. Doctors and NAH staff shared similar concerns on barriers to evidence-based practice. The highest proportions considered poor facilities to access evidence a barrier (76 % of doctors and 90 % of NAH), followed by poor awareness of evidence (62 % of doctors and 70 % of NAH) and time constraints (63 % of doctors and 68 % of NAH), p = 0. 09 for the combined rating of four items in the domain. Conclusions The findings of our survey suggest a need for greater efforts in promoting EBP among Malaysian <b>hospital</b> <b>practitioners</b> especially for NAH staff. From the responses based on the barriers to EBP, improving facilities for accessing evidence and promoting more user-friendly resources to address time constraints {{appear to be the}} priorities. </p...|$|R
