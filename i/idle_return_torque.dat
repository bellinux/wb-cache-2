60|$|With the {{peculiar}} sensitiveness {{on the subject}} of the disgraceful action of going to sleep out of bed, which is the lot of all mankind, Mr. Idle persisted in this declaration. The same peculiar sensitiveness impelled Mr. Goodchild, on being taxed with the same crime, to repudiate it with honourable resentment. The settlement of the question of The One old man and The Two old men was thus presently complicated, and soon made quite impracticable. Mr. Idle said it was all Bride-cake, and fragments, newly arranged, of things seen and thought about in the day. Mr. Goodchild said how could that be, when he hadn't been asleep, and what right could Mr. Idle have to say so, who had been asleep? Mr. Idle said he had never been asleep, and never did go to sleep, and that Mr. Goodchild, as a general rule, was always asleep. They consequently parted for the rest of the night, at their bedroom doors, a little ruffled.

30|$|The {{abatement}} {{performance of}} biofiltration reactors {{relies heavily on}} the biofilm formed {{on the surface of}} packing materials (Acuña et al. 2002). Biofilm formation allows a microbial lifestyle that is entirely different from the planktonic state (Flemming and Wingender 2010). The formation of mature biofilm on various surfaces is a major consideration when running biological reactors in discontinuous mode since some of the attached cells can detach from the surface during the <b>idle</b> phase and <b>return</b> to the planktonic form. In this situation, biofilm formation is extremely difficult. Microorganisms differ greatly in their ability to form biofilm or to degrade pollutants (Lee et al. 2009; Alinejad et al. 2017). Some types of microorganisms may play a leading role in biofilm formation, whereas others possess strong degrading capabilities but have a weak aptitude for forming biofilm. Therefore, the understanding of the specific functions of different microorganisms will provide us with insight into the biofiltration process of VOC-containing waste gases during discontinuous operation mode.|$|R

40|$|Topography exerts a {{profound}} {{influence on the}} large-scale circulation of western boundary and circumpolar currents. Flow over variable topography generates topographical torques (bottom pressure torques) which can drive meridional flows and indirectly influence the internal structure. The role of topography, and in particular that of bottom pressure torques, on idealised, wind-driven gyre and channel models is investigated. In gyre models with sloping side-walls, the wind-driven transport is returned across latitude lines by bottom pressure torques, while friction is important in altering potential vorticity (PV) within an isopycnal layer and allowing a closed circulation. In the channel model zonal jets develop at latitudes where the topography does not reach the surface. Bottom pressure torques again drive meridional flows along topography. These bottom pressure <b>torques</b> <b>return</b> the wind-driven flow along western boundaries as in the gyre models, and can act to transfer vorticity from the wind-driven gyres into zonal jets. Through steering the depth-integrated flow, the topography influences the frictional torques in the layer, and hence the location and relative magnitudes of the PV sources. Differences in these sources can lead to regional differences in the homogenised P...|$|R
30|$|The {{hybrid system}} also {{referred}} to as System I in this paper, is compared with other alternative systems such as a system described in [41]. The authors of [41] describe a greedy approach that acquires resources as and when required. This system is modified by incorporating a mechanism to remove idling resources to improve its performance. This modified system uses a broker that scales up when it needs an additional resource and scales down if no more requests are pending on a particular resource. This enables the broker to increase its profits by ensuring <b>idling</b> resources are <b>returned</b> to the service provider. This system is called the non-proactive system or System II. A hybrid system that functions as System II during the training period (accepting all client requests) and switches to the proactive system (System I) {{at the end of the}} training period is an interesting topic for future research. In System III, users obtain the resources directly from the public cloud provider without broker (in the intermediary enterprise) intervention. With this system, users incur the additional overhead of starting and stopping resources as well as handling the matchmaking and scheduling operations. Thus, for System III, only total user cost is compared to that of System I and System II, as there is no broker involved and thus no broker profit is accrued.|$|R
60|$|One day {{we walked}} out, a little party of three, to Albano, {{fourteen}} miles distant; possessed {{by a great}} desire to go there by the ancient Appian way, long since ruined and overgrown. We started at half-past seven in the morning, and within {{an hour or so}} were out upon the open Campagna. For twelve miles we went climbing on, over an unbroken succession of mounds, and heaps, and hills, of ruin. Tombs and temples, overthrown and prostrate; small fragments of columns, friezes, pediments; great blocks of granite and marble; mouldering arches, grass-grown and decayed; ruin enough to build a spacious city from; lay strewn about us. Sometimes, loose walls, built up from these fragments by the shepherds, came across our path; sometimes, a ditch between two mounds of broken stones, obstructed our progress; sometimes, the fragments themselves, rolling from beneath our feet, made it a toilsome matter to advance; but it was always ruin. Now, we tracked a piece of the old road, above the ground; now traced it, underneath a grassy covering, as if that were its grave; but all the way was ruin. In the distance, ruined aqueducts went stalking on their giant course along the plain; and every breath of wind that swept towards us, stirred early flowers and grasses, springing up, spontaneously, on miles of ruin. The unseen larks above us, who alone disturbed the awful silence, had their nests in ruin; and the fierce herdsmen, clad in sheepskins, who now and then scowled out upon us from their sleeping nooks, were housed in ruin. The aspect of the desolate Campagna in one direction, where it was most level, reminded me of an American prairie; but what is the solitude of a region where men have never dwelt, to that of a Desert, where a mighty race have left their footprints in the earth from which they have vanished; where the resting-places of their Dead, have fallen like their Dead; and the broken hour-glass of Time is but a heap of <b>idle</b> dust! <b>Returning,</b> by the road, at sunset! and looking, from the distance, on the course we had taken in the morning, I almost feel (as I had felt when I first saw it, at that hour) as if the sun would never rise again, but looked its last, that night, upon a ruined world.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT LIFE IS BUT A DREAM: THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS IN TWENTIETH CENTURY AMERICAN LITERATURE by Jeremy M. Gerrard Master of Arts in English California State University, Chico Fall 2010 This thesis {{analyzes}} and re-defines the American Dream in {{twentieth century}} American literature {{through the lens}} of what I refer to as ???the incompatible triad. ??? This three-part, interacting force includes Restless Youth/ Time, Relative Desire/ Reinvention, and Idle Complacence. In short, restless youth and idle complacence both promote the urge to move; relative desire compels Americans to want more and to reinvent themselves whenever necessary; time applies the pressure and dictates the urgency???and often futility???of those movements and desires; <b>idle</b> complacence then <b>returns</b> as the inevitable ending, the state Americans have been conditioned to reject, and the consolation prize in the bout for happiness. Since my thesis suggests that all protagonists of twentieth century American Dream literature find their fates governed by this triad, I have chosen novels that cover different time periods, genders, ages, and races. Specifically, this thesis will discuss the triad???s involvement in Theodore Dreiser???s Sister v Carrie (1900), Ralph Ellison???s Invisible Man (1952), and Philip Roth???s American Pastoral, each novel warranting its own chapter. Revisiting the American Dream through the innovative lens of the incompatible triad allows us to re-examine the texts and their protagonists in a unique way, as it offers {{a deeper understanding of the}} ideological dream that had guided these protagonists. This analysis of American literature forces us to re-think the means by which Americans have pursued, and continue to pursue their diverse sorts of happiness. CSU, Chic...|$|R

Molecular modeling is a vital component for structure-based drug design. Currently implemented technology combines data and graphics to give the user visual capabilities to assist in discovering possible binding arrangements. Visual modeling has become a tremendous help to scientists in reducing the amount of time needed to create new inhibitory compounds. However, the visual medium used for modeling lacks the ability to convey the forces between the molecules to the user. Potentially, tactile feedback can provide this missing information. SensAble Devices has developed a device capable of producing force feedback to a user-defined environment called the PHANToM, The PHANToM is a 6 dimensional (3 translational and 3 rotational) haptic device that can <b>return</b> force and <b>torque</b> to the user through a hand held stylus. The system configuration for molecular modeling consists of integrating the haptic device with a high-end PC running Windows NT and developing code to model the intermolecular forces. The programming language used was C with some C++ constructs and the OpenGL graphics library for the graphics implementation. The optimized code running with the system has proven capable of calculating and relaying tactile feedback between a 100 -atom active site of a protein and a small 15 -atom inhibitor in real time (ca. 1 millisecond). Trials are now underway on the system to evaluate accuracy and explore other forms of useful output. Once this is accomplished, modeling will be done on an active site and an untested inhibitor to evaluate novel binding modes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of an initial bout of eccentric or concentric actions and a subsequent bout of eccentric actions on muscular strength. Twenty-four healthy males, 24 - 45 yr old, were placed in three groups that performed eccentric actions in bouts 1 and 2 (ECC/ECC, N = 8), concentric actions in bout 1, and eccentric actions in bout 2 (CON/ECC, N = 8) or served as controls (N = 8). Bouts involved unilateral actions with {{the left and right}} quadriceps femoris. Ten sets of 10 repetitions with an initial resistance equal to 85 % of the eccentric or concentric one repetition maximum (1 RM) were performed for each bout. Three minutes of rest were given between sets and 3 wk between bouts. Two weeks before bout 1 and 1, 4, 7, and 10 d after bouts 1 and 2, eccentric and concentric 1 RM were measured for the right quadriceps femoris and a speed-torque relation established for the left quadriceps femoris. Eccentric and concentric 1 RM decreased (P less than 0. 05) 32 % 1 d after bout 1 for group ECC/ECC. The speed-torque relation was down-shifted (P less than 0. 05) 38 %. Eccentric 1 RM and eccentric and isometric <b>torque</b> <b>returned</b> to normal 6 d later. Concentric 1 RM and torque at 3. 14 rad-s(exp - 1) had not recovered on day 10 (- 7 % for both, P less than 0. 05). Decreases in strength after bout 2 for group ECC/ECC only occurred on day 1 (- 9 % for concentric 1 RM and 16 % downshift of the speed- torque relation). Group CONIECC showed the opposite responses; marked decreases in strength after bout 2 but not bout 1. The results indicate that the initial decrease in strength after performance of a novel bout of eccentric exercise is comparable for eccentric, concentric and isometric muscle actions. Recovery of strength, however, appears to occur more rapidly for eccentric and isometric actions. They suggest that performance of a prior bout of eccentric but not concentric actions, as done in this study, can essentially eradicate decreases in strength after a subsequent bout of eccentric exercise. It is suggested that neural factors are, in part, responsible for adaptations to eccentric exercise...|$|R
