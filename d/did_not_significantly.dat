5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns {{began an}} {{artillery}} bombardment {{that was probably}} the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affect the Union position.|$|E

5|$|The 1995 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active Pacific {{hurricane season}} since 1979. Of the eleven tropical cyclones that formed during the season, four affected land, with the most notable storm of the season being Hurricane Ismael, which killed at least 116people in Mexico. The strongest hurricane in the season was Hurricane Juliette, which reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h), but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affect land. Hurricane Adolph was an early-season Category 4 hurricane. Hurricane Henriette brushed the Baja California Peninsula in October.|$|E

While the Commission generally operated efficiently, some mistakes occurred such as clothing and scrap metal being sold well beneath their market value. The volume of sales dropped rapidly after 1947 and the Disposals Commission was disbanded in July 1949. By this time the commission had sold £135,189,000 worth of equipment.|$|E

5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced}} to Europe in the 14thcentury, it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affect castle building until the 15thcentury, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16thcentury, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was {{a renewed interest in}} castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.|$|E
5|$|Angus Maddison {{estimates}} that the country's gross domestic product was equivalent to $450 per head in 1990 United States dollars—a sum that was above subsistence level, and which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> change {{until the beginning of}} the Song dynasty in the late 10th century. Sinologist Joseph Needham has disputed this and claimed that China's GDP per capita exceeded Europe by substantial margins from the 5th century BCE onwards, holding that Han China was much wealthier than the contemporary Roman Empire. The widespread circulation of coin cash enriched many merchants, who invested their money in land and became wealthy landowners. The government's efforts to circulate cash had empowered the very social class which it actively tried to suppress through heavy taxes, fines, confiscations, and price regulation schemes.|$|E

5|$|The 1991 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} season in over 24years in which no hurricanes developed from tropical waves, which are the source for most North Atlantic tropical cyclones. The {{hurricane season}} officially began on June1, and ended on November30. It was the least active in four years due to higher than usual wind shear across the Atlantic Ocean. The first storm, Ana, developed on July2 off the southeast United States and dissipated without causing significant effects. Two other tropical storms in the season– Danny and Erika– <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affect land. Danny dissipated east of the Lesser Antilles, and Erika passed through the Azores before becoming extratropical. In addition, there were four non-developing tropical depressions. The second depression of the season struck Mexico with significant accompanying rains.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} {{appeared}} in 1917 with 793 pages, published by Cambridge University Press. The second, enlarged edition appeared in 1942, with 1116 pages; it extended {{many of the}} chapters somewhat but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> change Thompson's thesis. Since then it has been reprinted and abridged many times, including in 1943, 1944, 1945, 1948, 1951, 1952, 1959, 1961, 1963, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2014. It has thus been in print continuously since the Second World War. The book has been translated into German, Spanish, French, and Greek. The 1961 edition, skilfully abridged down to 346 pages by John Tyler Bonner, presents the essence of Thompson's argument.|$|E

5|$|Unusually, Hurricanes Bonnie and Charley {{produced}} {{tropical storm}} force winds in the Azores, {{and the former}} caused one fatality. Tropical Storm Danielle was one of few tropical cyclones known to make landfall on the Delmarva Peninsula. The storm caused minor damage and two fatalities in the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States. One other hurricane in the season – Frances – <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affect land. The system developed in the central Atlantic, and tracked well away from land, and brought only light rainfall to Newfoundland. In addition to the 7 storms, there were three non-developing tropical depressions. The first depression of the season caused flooding in Cuba and Florida while the other two depressions did not affect any land. Collectively, the storms in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season caused $26.502billion in losses and 73fatalities.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier who}} participated in the battle {{reported}} that only 20 uninjured troops were left to defend the police station as the second Syrian column reached Samakh (Tzemah). The only heavy weapon the defenders possessed was ineffective against Syrian armor. Fearing their forces would be completely cut off, an order was given by the Haganah to retreat and leave the wounded, Tzvika Levkov among them. The retreat was disorganized and heavy Israeli casualties were recorded as Samakh's police station fell. Reinforcements from the Deganias, commanded by Moshe Cohen, arrived but were immediately hit by the Syrians and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affect the battle. Aharon Israeli, a platoon commander in these reinforcements, wrote that it was clear as soon as they arrived that the battle was over. Cohen would not hear of a retreat initially, but when the force saw Levkov fall into a trench, they hastily withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} motion of Nanmadol, the typhoon crossed Luzon in under six hours, {{emerging}} into the South China Sea before 1800UTC on December2. Though land interaction with the Philippines <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affect the cyclone, a shortwave trough forced Nanmadol to sharply curve northward, bringing it into hostile atmospheric conditions within the Luzon Strait. At 0000UTC on December3, the JMA downgraded Nanmadol to severe tropical storm status. Increased wind shear and the advection of dry air further weakened the tropical cyclone, and by midday on December3, the storm's center of circulation became decoupled {{from the rest of}} the convection. At 2340UTC that day, Nanmadol made landfall near Fangliao, Pingtung in Taiwan, becoming the first December tropical cyclone to strike the island in 108years of record-keeping. Roughly six hours later on December4, the JMA determined that Nanmadol had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. These remnants soon merged with another low-pressure area, creating a more powerful system that later tracked over Japan.|$|E

5|$|On 28 February Michael {{met with}} Polish envoys in Braşov. He {{was willing to}} {{recognise}} the Polish King as his sovereign {{in exchange for the}} crown of Moldavia and the recognition of his male heirs' hereditary right over the three principalities, Transylvania, Moldavia and Wallachia. This <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> delay his attack however; on 14 April 1600 Michael's troops entered Moldavia on multiple routes, the Prince himself leading the main thrust to Trotuş and Roman. He reached the capital of Iaşi on 6 May. The garrison surrendered the citadel the next day and Michael's forces caught up with the fleeing Ieremia Movilă, who was saved from being captured only by the sacrifice of his rear-guard. Movilă took refuge in the castle of Khotyn together with his family, a handful of faithful boyars and the former Transylvanian Prince, Sigismund Báthory. The Moldavian soldiers in the castle deserted, leaving a small Polish contingent as sole defenders. Under the cover of dark, sometime before 11 June, Movilă managed to sneak out of the walls and across the Dniester to hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski's camp.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{initially}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> {{alter the}} operation of the manor or the village economy. William reassigned large tracts of land amongst the Norman elite, creating vast estates in some areas, particularly along the Welsh border and in Sussex. The biggest change in the years after the invasion was the rapid {{reduction in the number of}} slaves being held in England. In the 10th century slaves had been very numerous, although their number had begun to diminish as a result of economic and religious pressure. Nonetheless, the new Norman aristocracy proved harsh landlords. The wealthier, formerly more independent Anglo-Saxon peasants found themselves rapidly sinking down the economic hierarchy, swelling the numbers of unfree workers, or serfs, forbidden to leave their manor and seek alternative employment. Those Anglo-Saxon nobles who had survived the invasion itself were rapidly assimilated into the Norman elite or economically crushed.|$|E
