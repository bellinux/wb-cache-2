Although many methods for power generation are being actively investigated, efficient methods for solving energy problems {{must be based on}} reducing energy consumption. Thermal insulation can decrease heat energy loss and conserve energy waste, especially in the construction, transportation and industrial fields. In this study, polyester (PET) hollow fibers were blended with various ratios of low-melting-point PET fibers (10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %). The fibers were blended using opening, carding, laying and needle punching (150 needles/cm 2, 225 needles/cm 2 and 300 needles/cm 2) to prepare PET <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The PET <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabrics</b> were thermally plate pressed (TPP) and air-through bonding (ATB).

For saving the cost and quick response to the apparel market, many researchers and companies are trying to explore the non-conventional methods to produce fabrics for apparel applications by skipping some processing steps during apparel fabrics manufacturing process. For decades, nonwovens are being used as supporting materials in the clothing industry, as such, they are used as fusible interlinings and reinforcements. Since last few years, because of the advancements in the nonwoven technology and materials, innovative <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabrics</b> have been developed with the acceptable aesthetical properties for fashion garments. The most prominent example of the <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric</b> for clothing is “Evolon” produced by Freudenberg Germany. The main {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the limitations in the current <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabrics</b> used for the apparel applications and to realise the functional properties of the fabrics that are suitable for apparel applications. Fabrics for apparel applications, especially for garments, require aesthetical and mechanical properties such as drape, hand feel, flexural rigidity, moisture management, tensile characteristics, thermal characteristics and air permeability. This study aims to develop <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabrics</b> with enhanced mechanical and aesthetical characteristics by selecting the appropriate materials and nonwoven processes and process parameters. The developed hydroentangled <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric</b> was comprised on Tencel® and bicomponent (PE/PET) sheath core staple fibres. In this study, two different processes were employed for the preparation of the <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabrics</b> for apparel applications. The first process consisted of carding, needlepunching and hydroentanglement. The second process involves carding, preneedling (for tucking of fibres) and hydroentanglement.

In addition, recent applications {{are associated with}} various types of ‘intelligent’ self-healing and anticorrosion coatings that use the stimuli-responsive behavior of polymer-based nanoparticles (Motornov et al. 2010). Yang and Lin (2004) developed temperature-responsive wound dressing materials from polypropylene <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric</b> (PP) and acrylic acid (AA) by γ-irradiation-induced method to achieve PP-g-AA and modified by N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) through graft-copolymerization along with ultraviolet photografting to achieve PP-g-AA-g-NIPAAm bigraft <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric.</b> Then chitosan was impregnated onto (PP)-g-AA-g-PNIPAAm bigraft <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric</b> material. Their research finds the evolution of relative wicking time and the antibacterial assessment on the dressing materials. The relative wicking time was found to decrease for the PP-g-AA-g-PNIPAAm-chitosan. Studies on the transport of bacterial and water vapor transmission rates (WVTR), the permeance and the permeability through the modified <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric,</b> have also been conducted. As pure PP is porous, it shows the highest values of WVTR and permeance. After some changes, the PP-g-AA-g-PNIPAAm forms a dense cross-section, so the permeance and permeability values of WVTRdrop sharply. Relative wicking time of PP-g-AA-g-PNIPAAm increases with increasing the temperature and then levels off for temperatures above 328  °C due to the thermo-sensitive behavior of the PNIPAAm. Since chitosan is a cationic polysaccharide and the bacterial cell surfaces are negatively charged, the adsorption of the negatively charged cell surfaces onto the <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric</b> increases with increasing the charge density on the chitosan containing PP-g-AA, resulting in {{a decrease in the}} viable cell number. The modified <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric</b> with chitosan can be considered for wound dressing, as the values of WVTR, permeance and permeability of the PP-g-AA-g-PNIPAAm-chitosan are comparable to the commercial products (Yang and Lin 2004).|$|R

Our model for realistic rendering is based solely on the output of the simulation and relies on existing techniques for realistic rendering of fibrous materials. We use modern programmable graphics hardware to ensure interactive frame rates...|$|R

30|$|The {{hydrostatic}} resistance {{increases with}} increase in {{weight of the}} fabric in all gowns. The hydrostatic results are statistically significant for untreated <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric,</b> plasma treated single layer and dual layer fabrics at 95 % confidence level. Plasma treatment with flurocarbon imparts lower surface energies to <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric</b> surface which increases resistance of treated fabric against blood. Dual layered of plasma treated polypropylene with PTFE gown offers better resistance than Single layer plasma treated polypropylene gown because of presence of PTFE.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} the immobilization of flame retardants on polypropylene <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabrics.</b> We used cyclic phosphazenes as a flame retardant. <b>Nonwoven</b> <b>fabrics</b> were activated by atmospheric pressure plasma treatments {{in order to}} improve the adhesion with cyclic phosphazenes. The quality of adhesion was tested by wash-off treatment using various liquids. The results of FTIR and LDI TOF mass spectrometry analysis are reported and shows that plasma treatment of nonwoven PP textile improves the initial attachment of phosphazenes on the textile surface...|$|R
30|$|Bursting {{strength}} (Roy and Ray 2009 b) of <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric</b> {{increases with}} increase in fabric weight, needle punch density {{and depth of}} needle penetration and for a further increase in the optimum value of needle density and depth of needle penetration, reduction in bursting strength observed. With the increase in fabric weight (Roy and Ray 2009 a), bending modulus of <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric</b> increases, {{on the other hand}} bending modulus achieves maximum value with the increase in punch density and depth of needle penetration, but further increase in such density and depth of needle penetration reduces bending modulus. For fabric weight (Madhusoothanan et al. 1998), the study also shows the same trend for jute/viscose blend needle punched <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric,</b> but as the proportion of viscose, the fibre proportion increases with blend proportion the decrease in bending modulus observed.|$|R
30|$|P.L. Mahalaxmi <b>nonwoven</b> banana <b>fabric</b> shows higher {{elongation}} % {{compared to}} Graint Naine and Shrimanti <b>nonwoven</b> banana <b>fabric</b> in C.D. Whereas, P.L. Graint Naine <b>nonwoven</b> banana <b>fabric</b> shows higher elongation % than Mahalaxmi and Shrimanti <b>nonwoven</b> banana <b>fabric</b> in M.D. Higher tensile {{strength in the}} M.D. can observed compare to C.D. for all three varieties of P.L. <b>nonwoven</b> <b>fabric.</b> In P.L. non-woven fabric majority of fibers are oriented in M.D. of fabric. Hence, for the tensile test in M.D. of the fabric, the fibers can easily be reoriented {{much closer to the}} test direction, but if the testing is carried out in C.D. the majority of the fibers cannot be oriented in the test direction. Hence the contribution of fibers towards the load bearing is much higher in the testing of M.D. than in the C.D.|$|R
