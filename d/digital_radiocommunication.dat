40|$|The authors {{discuss a}} {{training}} methodology in telecommunications transmission systems engineering {{based on a}} computer-aid approach. They begin with a justification of the uses of digital simulation and highlight its advantages. They then consider the steps in planning simulation experiments. Aspects of the modeling of transmission systems are then examined. A simple experiment is considered {{which can be used}} for analyzing <b>digital</b> <b>radiocommunication</b> systems. It is noted that the main advantage of the proposed approach is its versatility in invention and innovation in transmission situationsPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{works are}} now {{undertaking}} {{to study the}} improvement of the channel capacity when using a multiple array of transmitting and receiving antennas. Nevertheless, the capacity is strongly dependent on the correlation between the various channels and extensive measurements are needed to characterize this correlation. In this paper, we consider the case of a subway tunnel and a carrier frequency of about 900 MHz (GSM-R), which has been adopted for the European railway <b>digital</b> <b>radiocommunication</b> systems. After a brief presentation of the channel sounder, the main characteristics of a SISO channel, such as the power delay profile, are given. Then, considering a system of 4 x 4 antennas, the spatial power correlation at the base and mobile stations is calculated. Lastly, from the eigenvalue decomposition of the transfer matrix, the channel capacity is deduced and compared to the capacity calculated by assuming i. i. d. Rayleigh channels. I...|$|E
40|$|Passive {{testing is}} the process of {{collecting}} traces of the messages exchanged between an operating implementation and its environment, in order to verify that these traces actually belong to the language accepted by the provided specification. The specification has in general the form of a finite state machine (FSM). In this paper, we present an extension of the existing algorithms to consider the specification as an extended finite state machine (EFSM). An algorithm is also introduced {{to take into account the}} number of states and transitions covered. In this paper we also present the results of our experiments on a signalling protocol that is a component of the european <b>digital</b> cellular <b>radiocommunication</b> system GSM, the GSM-MAP. 1. Introduction The objective of conformance testing is to evaluate whether a protocol implementation has the same behaviour as its specification. In active conformance testing, the implementation under test (IUT) is placed in a dedicated testing [...] ...|$|R
