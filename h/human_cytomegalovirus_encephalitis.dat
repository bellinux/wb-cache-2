40|$|Paraffin-embedded {{necropsy}} {{material from}} 6 patients with <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (HCMVE) corroborated by immunocytochemistry and 11 control cases were examined {{for the presence}} of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA by a nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). A characteristic 183 base pair (bp) fragment of the HCMV genome could readily be amplified in 4 cases of HCMVE. In 2 cases of HCMVE, viral DNA could be demonstrated only sporadically by PCR, due most likely to inefficient DNA extraction or DNA degradation. All control cases remained negative. The nPCR provides a specific method for detecting HCMV DNA in routinely processed biopsy and necropsy material and may be used in archival tissues for the diagnosis of infection. Fixation of samples and DNA extraction are, however, crucial steps and require careful control if PCR is used for detection of HCMV, to avoid false negative results...|$|E
40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> (HCMV) <b>encephalitis</b> {{in adult}} nonimmunosuppressed {{patients}} {{has rarely been}} reported. We have diagnosed HCMV encephalitis in an anti-HCMV immunoglobulin G-negative, nonimmunosuppressed young woman by HCMV DNA PCR and virus isolation from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). At the same time, HCMV antigen and HCMV DNA could be demonstrated in peripheral blood leukocytes, and the virus was isolated in fibroblast cultures. After 22 days of acute illness, the virus disappeared from the CSF. Remarkably, the patient did not generate detectable anti-HCMV antibodies within 5 months after the beginning of illness. To investigate the significance of HCMV DNA detection in CSF, samples of CSF, blood cells, and serum from 35 nonimmunosuppressed patients with various neurological disorders (but no herpes simplex virus central nervous system [CNS] disease) were tested for HCMV DNA, antigen, and antibodies. Eleven of these patients {{were found to be}} positive for virus DNA and/or antigen in peripheral blood leukocytes. Additionally, HCMV DNA was detected in the CSF of two patients with noninflammatory CNS diseases. A causative role of HCMV in the CNS diseases of these two patients was not evident. In summary, HCMV DNA amplification from CSF samples is a very suitable method to verify HCMV-associated encephalitis, but it should be taken into consideration that there are few cases of positive PCR with DNA from CSF without any known clinical correlative...|$|R

Data from various groups have been suggestive of a pathogenetic role of herpesviruses, particularly <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus,</b> in accelerated allograft coronary artery disease; however, results are not yet conclusive. This study examines the hypothesis that <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> infection of allograft tissues is related pathogenetically and directly to accelerated coronary artery disease. Using in situ DNA hybridization and polymerase chain reaction, we examined particular coronary artery segments from 41 human heart allografts (ranging from 4 days to greater than 4 years after transplantation; mean, 457 days) and 22 donor age- and gender-comparable, coronary site-matched trauma victims for presence of <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> DNA. <b>Human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> genome was detected in 8 of 41 (19. 5 %) allografts and in 1 of 22 (4. 5 %) control hearts.

In the human cytomegalovirus-positive hearts, viral genome was localized to perivascular myocardium or coronary artery media or adventitia. <b>Human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> genome was not detected in arterial intima of any allograft or control heart, although <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> genome was readily identified within intima of small pulmonary arteries from lung tissue with <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> pneumonitis.

40|$|AbstractHuman {{cytomegalovirus}} utilizes {{cellular signal}} transduction pathways to activate viral or cellular transcription factors {{involved in the}} control of viral gene expression and DNA replication. In the present study, we demonstrate that Harvey-ras-transformed cells show increased permissiveness to <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> when compared to their parental non-transformed cells. Both the progeny viral yield and the protein levels were elevated in the human cytomegalovirus-infected Harvey-ras-transformed cells requiring active viral gene replication, {{as shown by the}} infection with UV-inactivated <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus.</b> Inhibition of Ras or of key molecules of the Ras pathway, effectively suppressed viral infection in the Harvey-ras-transformed cells. On a cellular level, the human cytomegalovirus-infected Harvey-ras-transformed cells formed larger cellular foci, which were significantly higher in number, compared to the uninfected cells and preferentially recruited <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> virions, thereby incriminating <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> infection for the increased transformation of these cells. Furthermore, proliferation assays revealed a higher rate for the human cytomegalovirus-infected Harvey-ras-transformed cells compared to mock-infected cells, whereas <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> infection had no considerable effect on the proliferation of the non-transformed cells. Higher susceptibility to apoptosis was also detected in the human cytomegalovirus-infected ras-transformed cells, which in combination with the higher progeny virus reveals a mode by which <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> achieves efficient spread of infection in the cells expressing the oncogenic Harvey-ras (12 V) gene.

Two modifications of PhCMV*- 1 were also studied: P 1129, in which the tet operator sites were reduced from seven to one; and P 1125, in which <b>human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> sequences were replaced by adenovirus major late promoter and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase initiator sequences.

In the viral genome, PhCMV*- 1 exhibited regulation up to 7 -fold during late times of infection, whereas P 1125 displayed nearly 100 -fold regulation.

Objectives: We aimed to study viral replication and serological response in the first months post kidney transplant in patients undergoing universal prophylaxis or preemptive therapy and correlate the findings with the clinical course of <b>Human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> infection. Patients and methods: Independent from the clinical strategy adopted for managing <b>Human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> infection, prophylaxis versus preemptive therapy, the pp 65 antigenemia assay and serological response were assessed on the day of transplantation, and then weekly during {{the first three months of}} post-transplant. Results: From the 32 transplant recipients, 16 were positive for pp 65 antigenemia, with a similar incidence rate in each group. There were no positive results in the first three weeks of monitoring; the positivity rate peaked at week eight. There was a trend for a higher and earlier frequency of positivity in the universal prophylaxis group in which the course of the <b>Human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> infection was also more severe.

Conclusion: Routine monitoring during the first three post-transplant months has a positive impact on the early detection of <b>Human</b> <b>cytomegalovirus</b> viral replication allowing for timely treatment in order to reduce morbidity of the disease.
