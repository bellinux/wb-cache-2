40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} magnetic resonance (MR) angiography {{in the assessment of}} spinal vascular malformation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with spinal vascular malformations (30 dural arteriovenous fistulas, two perimedullary arteriovenous fistulas, and two intramedullary arteriovenous malformations) underwent MR angiography and MR imaging before and after endovascular or surgical treatment. RESULTS: MR angiography showed residual flow in perimedullary vessels in seven patients with <b>dural</b> <b>fistula</b> after embolization with liquid adhesive. In all seven, treatment failure was confirmed with arteriography. Long-lasting disappearance of flow in perimedullary vessels was demonstrated at MR angiography in 22 patients with <b>dural</b> <b>fistula.</b> MR imaging demonstrated normalization of spinal cord volume in 16 of 22 patients and signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images in three patients. Disappearance of cord enhancement was observed in five of 21 patients and of perimedullary enhanced vessels in six of 13 patients. In one additional patient with <b>dural</b> <b>fistula</b> treated with embolization, early posttreatment MR angiography showed disappearance of flow in perimedullary vessels, which reappeared at follow-up and was consistent with reopening of a small residual fistula. Posttreatment MR angiography demonstrated transient reduction of flow in the nidus in two patients with intramedullary malformations treated with embolization. Permanent disappearance of flow in the perimedullary vessel was seen after endovascular treatment in two patients with perimedullary fistula. CONCLUSION: MR angiography is more sensitive than MR imaging in depicting residual or recurrent flow in peri- or intramedullary vessels, which indicates patency of the vascular malformation...|$|E

40|$|Background : We present our {{findings}} concerning the laterocavernous sinus (LCS) drainage of cavernous region <b>dural</b> <b>fistulas,</b> focusing {{our attention on}} the anatomy of LCS as it may have important implications in the treatment. Patients and Methods : Thirty-one consecutive patients with cavernous region <b>dural</b> <b>fistulas</b> treated endovascularly between 2005 and 2008 were reviewed. Five patients had angiographic features such as cavernous region <b>dural</b> <b>fistulas</b> draining with superficial middle cerebral vein (SMCV) via LCS. Clinical records of these 5 patients were focused upon to determine their presenting symptoms, angiographic features, endovascular treatments and clinical outcomes. Results : Among 31 cases of cavernous <b>dural</b> arteriovenous <b>fistula</b> (DAVF), 5 (16 &#x 0025;) cases with leptomeningeal veins [SMCV, petrosal vein] reflux via LCS were noted. The 5 cavernous region <b>dural</b> <b>fistulas</b> were defined as Cognard type III and Barrow type A (1 / 5), B (1 / 5), C (1 / 5) and D (2 / 5). All 5 patients underwent immediate obliteration of the cavernous region <b>dural</b> <b>fistulas</b> in 3 sessions of transarterial and 2 sessions of transvenous embolization. An angiographic obliteration and clinical cure was achieved in all patients. We encountered one minor complication of local hair loss induced by X-ray radiation. A complete resolution of the initial presenting symptoms was observed {{within a few days}} to weeks. Six-month follow-up angiogram in 5 patients showed obliteration and no recanalization of CCF. Conclusion : It is very important to diagnose the presence of laterocavernous sinus in <b>dural</b> arteriovenous <b>fistulas</b> during diagnostic angiography.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{present a}} rare case of tension pneumocephalus (TP) after head trauma not {{involving}} mask ventilation {{but based on}} pathological respiration pattern, kussmaul breathing. TP is rare condition and exceptionally rare when positive airway pressure has not been applied. In this particular case, the vacuum and one-valve intracranial effects causing pneumocephalon were instead accentuated by a pathological pattern of respiration due to severe ketoacidosis – a condition not previously reported in the literature. MethodsThis is a case report showing a rare cause of pneumocephalon caused by patients own respiration. We retrospectively reviewed the patients’ journal to find {{the cause of his}} severe pneumocephalon. The patient has not been ventilated and the only cause of TP in this case seems to be his own rapid and pathological breathing caused by ketoacidosis. ConclusionIn the presented case, pathologic deep and rapid respiration exerted additional pressure on the <b>dural</b> <b>fistula</b> allowing ambient air at a pressure above ICP to drive itself into the intracranial space.

40|$|Cerebral aneurysms and {{arteriovenous}} malformations (AVMs) are well-known {{sources of}} intracranial hemorrhage, {{but can also}} manifest as other clinical symptoms or remain clinically asymptomatic. The aim was to document and analyze cases of aneurysm or AVM with brain infarction. Survey on 4804 stroke patients treated at the Department of Neurology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland between 1978 and 2000 using the Lausanne Stroke Registry. Twenty patients presented with cerebral aneurysm and 21 with cerebral AVM. Hemorrhage was present in 100 % of the AVM and in 75 % of the aneurysm patients; in one (5 %) of the remaining aneurysm patients, aneurysm and infarction were located in different territories. Infarction associated with Sylvian artery aneurysm was found in three (15 %), vertebrobasilar ischemia because of fusiform left vertebral artery aneurysm in one (5 %), and <b>dural</b> <b>fistula</b> draining to the distal transversal and left sigmoid sinus associated with a stroke in {{the territory of the}} left anterior inferior cerebellar artery in one patient.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Dural {{arteriovenous}} fistulas (DAVFs) with cortical venous drainage often present with hemorrhage or neurological deficits and prompt treatment is indicated. Disconnection of the draining vein is considered curative. We present the multimodality treatment results of 35 patients with cranial DAVFs with exclusive cortical venous drainage. Materials and methods Between January 2010 and January 2017, 35 consecutive patients with cranial dural fistulas with exclusive cortical venous drainage were treated. There were 27 men and eight women, mean age 68 years (range 45 - 87). Clinical presentation was hemorrhage in 23 (66 %), pulsatile bruit in two (6 %), seizures in one (3 %) and blurred vision in one (3 %). In eight patients (22 %), the DAVF was an incidental finding. Location of the DAVFs was convexity in 25 (71 %), posterior fossa in eight (23 %) and tentorium in two (6 %). Results Surgery {{was performed in}} four patients with anterior cranial fossa fistulas and in one patient with a tentorial <b>dural</b> <b>fistula.</b> In 30 patients, embolization with Onyx via the arterial route was the primary treatment with complete obliteration in one session in 25 patients.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe dural tear is a dreaded {{complication}} of lumbar surgery. HypothesisOur management protocol {{has made it}} possible to deal with this problem effectively. Materials and methodsRetrospective review of 1359 patients operated between 2000 and 2010. In the event of dural tear, a therapeutic protocol was applied: suturing the dural wound if possible. A collagen patch lined with a layer of fibrin glue protected the suture. If the suture was considered tight, a non-aspirating drain was set up for 48 h. In the other cases, no drain was set up. All the patients were left supine for 48 h and they received intravenous antibiotics for the same duration. We analyzed the number and the type of breaches, the possibility of suturing, clinical symptoms (headache), and delayed complications (<b>dural</b> <b>fistula</b> or meningoceles). ResultsThe 1359 procedures included 23 dural tear complications (1. 7 %). The tears were often small in size and reparable. There were no late complications detected: no symptomatic fistula or meningocele. None of the patients had a second surgery. DiscussionThis protocol provided effective management of dural tears in lumbar surgery, with no application problems. We suggest a number of improvements: the use of the Valsalva maneuver to test the suturing, a stand-up test for the patient, and a systematic late MRI to detect meningoceles. There is no reason to change the other points in the protocol: suturing, controlled drainage for watertight wounds, no drainage for the non-watertight wounds, antibiotics, and supine bed rest position 48 h.

40|$|SUMMARY: Three {{patients}} {{are presented with}} slowly progressive tetraparesis caused by an intracra-nial dural arteriovenous fistula with exclusive perimedullary venous drainage. MR imaging showed a swollen cervicothoracic cord with central myelopathy and dilated perimedullary veins. Bilateral verte-bral angiography initially failed to demonstrate the fistulas, and diagnosis was established with external carotid angiography. All 3 patients were successfully treated with glue embolization, 1 after failed surgical exploration. Angiographic cure of the fistula resulted in clinical cure in 1 patient and stabilization in 2 patients. Intracranial <b>dural</b> <b>fistula</b> (DAVF) consists of a meshwork ofarteriovenous shunts and can be localized anywhere in the dura surrounding the brain. DAVFs are acquired lesions, probably {{as a result of}} venous thrombosis. Drainage of the fistula can be into a dural sinus, with or without reflux into cortical veins, or directly into cortical veins. Drainage into cortical veins is often associated with intracranial hemorrhage or seizures. The DAVF consists of multiple dural branches of various dural arteries converging {{at the site of the}} fistula to join a single draining vein. Surgical or endovascular repair is aimed at closure of the draining vein. If only feeding arteries are oc-cluded and not the draining vein, collateral vessels usually de-velop and the fistula reopens. 1 - 3 Rarely, intracranial dural fistulas drain exclusively into veins around the brain stem and further downward into peri-medullary veins. This retrograde drainage causes congestion in the perimedullary venous system, which, in turn, leads to decreased tissue perfusion with edema and progressive loss of cord function. 4 - 6 In this article, we report 3 patients who presented with progressive cervical cord dysfunction caused by an intracra-nial DAVF with perimedullary venous drainage who were treated with endovascular occlusion of the draining vein with glue...|$|E
