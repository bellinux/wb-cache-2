50|$|Lycopus europaeus, {{common names}} gypsywort, <b>gipsywort,</b> bugleweed, European bugleweed and water horehound, is a {{perennial}} {{plant in the}} Lycopus genus, native to Europe and Asia, and naturalized elsewhere.

50|$|Many {{varieties}} {{of plant and}} tree life {{can be found in}} and around the shores of the lakes and the water channels. Plants such as Angelica, great willowherb, amphibious bistort, betony, <b>gipsywort</b> and yellow flag iris are all common to the area. Many water loving willow trees can be seen around the lakes, these are managed to promote new growth and more willow trees.|$|E

50|$|Seasonal ditches support {{interesting}} invertebrates. Insects {{provide food}} for birds and bats. There is {{a variety of}} shelter for birds, and coots nest by an artificial pond alongside <b>gipsywort</b> (Lycopus europaeus) and brooklime (Veronica beccabunga). The Gardens has areas with a different cutting regime, {{in that they are}} not cut until late summer. This allows flowering plants to set seed and grow, which, in turn, provides habitat for native species including small mammals.|$|E
50|$|The {{trees along}} the canal include pedunculate oak, ash, crack willow and field maple. The area is colonised with common reed, reed sweet-grass and the more open areas support marsh-marigold, yellow water-lily, water dock and <b>gipsywort.</b> Meadowsweet and great willowherb flourish. There is also common valerian, purple-loosestrife, common marsh-bedstraw, yellow iris, ragged robin and marsh woundwort. Woodland flowers such as primrose, bluebell, yellow {{archangel}} and bugle thrive in a small wood near the tunnel entrance and under the towpath hedgerows. This wetland area supports a variety of fungi, liverworts and mosses.|$|E

Many dicotyledons also occur, {{such as water}} mint (Mentha aquatica), <b>gipsywort</b> (Lycopus europaeus), skull-cap (Scutellaria species), touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), brooklime (Veronica beccabunga) and water forget-me-nots (Myosotis species).|$|E
50|$|The large pond is {{populated}} with spiked water-milfoil (Myriophylium spicatum), Canadian waterweed (Elodea canadensis), yellow-flowered fringed water-lily (Nymphoides peltata), and beds of bulrush (Typha latifolia), common reed (Phragmites australis), sea club-rush (Scirpus maritimus) and grey club-rush (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani). The pond provides a habitat and {{breeding ground for}} a variety of waterfowl such as the mute swan, tufted duck, coot and dabchick. Other avians species nesting at the pond include gadwall, water rail, reed warbler, sedge warbler, reed bunting and other passerines. The three smaller ponds are more shallow - one sufficiently so to dry up in times of low rainfall. They host rushes (Juncaceae) and bulrush, water mint (Mentha aquatica), false fox-sedge (Carex otrubae), great willowherb (Epilobium hirsutum), common fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), <b>gipsywort</b> (Lyccous europaeus), branched bur-reed (Sparganium erectum), common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palusrre), and water-plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica). Two species, parsley water-dropwort (Oenanthe lachenalii) and sea club-rush indicate brackish water.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gipsywort</b> is {{a rather}} straggly {{perennial}} plant with slender underground runners and grows to a height of about 20 to 80 cm. The stalkless or short-stalked leaves are in opposite pairs. The leaf blades are hairy, narrowly lanceolate-ovate, sometimes pinnately-lobed, and with large teeth on the margin. The inflorescence forms a terminal spike and is composed of dense whorls of white or pale pink flowers. The calyx has five lobes and the corolla forms a two-lipped flower about 4 mm long with a fused tube. The upper lip of each flower is slightly convex with a notched tip and the lower lip is three-lobed, the central lobe being the largest and bearing a red [...] "nectar mark" [...] to attract pollinating insects. There are two stamens, the gynoecium has two fused carpels and the fruit is a four-chambered schizocarp. The flowers are visited by many types of insects, and can be characterized by a generalized pollination syndrome.|$|E
