5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> him of his previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers {{of what was to}} lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E

Like a father sharing his life experiences with his daughter, he said, [...] "Just like the time {{you told me you}} intended to begin charity work, <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> you to think whether you would have the strength and the money when more people came to you for help.

I care so deeply about the Galaxy organization, and I believe I could help in a small way to aid the team in its quest for a sixth MLS championship." ...|$|E

5000|$|Because the Shia {{believe that}} Muhammad said Hadith al-Thaqalayn on many occasions, the Shia have many {{different}} versions of what Muhammad said. One such version corresponds closely to what the Sunnis also believe in:Muhammad said: [...] "One of them (i.e. the Thaqalayn) is the Book of God {{and the other one}} is my select progeny (Itratî [...] ), that is family (Ahlul-Bayt). Beware of how you behave (with) them when I am gone from amongst you, for God, the Merciful, has informed me that these two (i.e., Quran and Ahlul-Bayt) shall never separate from each other until they reach me at the paradisial pool (hawd) (of al-Kawthar). <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> you, in the name of God, about my Ahlul-Bayt. <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> you, in the name of God, about my Ahlul-Bayt. Once more! <b>I</b> <b>remind</b> you, in the name of God, about my Ahlul-Bayt." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although White and Stieglitz {{had tried}} to {{reconcile}} their differences before White died, Stieglitz never forgave White for breaking from him in 1912. Upon hearing about White's untimely death, Stieglitz wrote to Kuehn, [...] "Poor White. Cares and vexation. When I last saw him {{he told me he}} was not able to cope with [...] twenty years ago. <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> him that I warned him to stay in business in Ohio ‒ New York would be too much for him. But the Photo-Session beckoned. Vanity and ambitions. His photography went to the devil." [...] In spite of these words, Stieglitz had 49 of White's photographs, including 18 created jointly with Stieglitz, in his personal collection when he died.|$|E

I added that the instructions to the military governors would preclude their mixing in political affairs, and that I should remove them if I found any of them contravening these orders. <b>I</b> <b>reminded</b> the Amir Faisal that the Allies were in honour bound to endeavour to reach a settlement in accordance with the wishes of the peoples concerned and urged him to place his trust whole-heartedly in their good faith.|$|E
