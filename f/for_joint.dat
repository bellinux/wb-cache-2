5|$|A {{successful}} {{invasion of}} Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt {{was a rich}} province, and {{in the days of}} the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities <b>for</b> <b>joint</b> military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.|$|E

The freight service would have occurred during off-peak hours only, but simultaneous with subway service, with passenger trains running in 30-minute or one-hour headways during these times. A 1912 proposal had freight running at night between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., while the 1925 plans called <b>for</b> <b>joint</b> freight and passenger service during early mornings (5 a.m. to 6 a.m.), middays (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), and overnights (8 p.m. to 5 a.m.).|$|E

5|$|For {{his first}} run for Governor of Oregon in 1958, the Republican Party opposed his {{candidacy}} {{going into the}} primary election. The large political base he had cultivated allowed him to win the party's primary despite the party's opposition. In the primary he defeated Oregon State Treasurer Sig Unander for the Republican nomination. In July 1958, after the primary election, Hatfield married Antoinette Kuzmanich, a counselor at Portland State College (now Portland State University). The marriage during the campaign drew some attention as the Catholic Kuzmanich converted to Hatfield's Baptist religion. The couple would have four children: Elizabeth, Mark Jr., Theresa and Vincent ("Visko"). He continued his campaign for the governor's office after the wedding, but avoided most public appearances with fellow Republican candidates for office and did not mention them during his campaign, despite requests by other Republicans <b>for</b> <b>joint</b> appearances.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{bilateral}} ties were characterised {{by trade}} and economic co-operation; {{other areas of}} bilateral co-operation were explored from 2000 onwards.

In 2004, three Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) {{in the areas of}} information technology, education and diplomatic ties, and co-operation-in-general were signed. Bilateral co-operation between both countries was also extended to defence matters in 2008 when another MoU was signed, which proposed <b>for</b> <b>joint</b> military trainings and collaboration in the defence industry between the Malaysian and Vietnamese militaries. The MoU also provided for the navies of both countries to prevent Vietnamese fishermen from encroaching into Malaysian waters for fishing activities as well as to control piracy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} double strap shear tests loaded in tension to investigate the bond between CFRP sheets and steel plates. Both normal modulus (240 GPa) and high modulus (640 GPa) CFRPs {{were used in the}} test program. Strain gauges were mounted to capture the strain distribution along the CFRP length. Different failure modes were observed <b>for</b> <b>joints</b> with normal modulus CFRP and those with high modulus CFRP. The strain distribution along the CFRP length was found to be similar for the two cases. A shorter effective bond length was obtained <b>for</b> <b>joints</b> with high modulus CFRP whereas larger ultimate load carrying capacity can be achieved <b>for</b> <b>joints</b> with normal modulus CFRP when the bond length is long enough. The Hart-Smith Model was modified to predict the effective bond length and ultimate load carrying capacity of joints between the normal modulus CFRP and steel plates. The Multilayer Distribution Model developed by the authors was modified to predict the load carrying capacity of joints between the high modulus CFRP and steel plates. The predicted values agreed well with experimental ones...|$|R

5|$|Ine's {{predecessor}} on {{the throne}} of Wessex was Cædwalla, {{but there is some}} uncertainty about the transition from Cædwalla to Ine. Cædwalla abdicated in 688 and departed for Rome to be baptized. According to the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List, Ine reigned for 37 years, abdicating in 726. These dates imply that he did not gain the throne until 689, which could indicate an unsettled period between Cædwalla's abdication and Ine's accession. Ine may have ruled alongside his father, Cenred, for a period: there is weak evidence <b>for</b> <b>joint</b> kingships, and stronger evidence of subkings reigning under a dominant ruler in Wessex, not long before this time. Ine acknowledges his father's help in his code of laws, and there is also a surviving land-grant that indicates Cenred was still reigning in Wessex after Ine's accession.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{composite}} materials offer remarkable {{potential in the}} upgrade of civil engineering structures. The evolution of CFRP (carbon fibre reinforced polymer) technologies and their versatility for applications in civil constructions require comprehensive and reliable codes of practice. Guidelines {{are available on the}} rehabilitation and retrofit of concrete structures with advanced {{composite materials}}. However, {{there is a need to}} develop appropriate design guidelines for CFRP strengthened steel structures. It is important to understand the bond characteristics between CFRP and steel plates. This paper describes a series of double strap shear tests loaded in tension to investigate the bond between CFRP sheets and steel plates. Both normal modulus (240 GPa) and high modulus (640 GPa) CFRPs were used in the test program. Strain gauges were mounted to capture the strain distribution along the CFRP length.
