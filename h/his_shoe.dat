Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifth}} match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff faced Smackdown General Manager Theodore Long (with Palmer Canon). Two referees from each show officiated the match. Theodore Long, began by {{avoiding}} Eric's attacks. As Canon climbed on the apron, and distracted the referees, Bischoff used his obi to choke Long. Bischoff continued choking Long and applied the sleeper hold. Cannon distracted the referees again as Long hit Bischoff with <b>his</b> <b>shoe.</b> The Boogeyman's music played with Bischoff sending the referees {{up the ramp}} to stop him. The Boogeyman delivered a pumphandle slam to Bischoff and Long pinned Bischoff to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Next, Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, Eric Young, and Petey Williams) were {{pitted against}} the 4Live Kru (B.G. James, Kip James, Konnan, and Ron Killings) in an Eight-Man Tag Team match.

Roode won the bout for his team by pinning Kip after Konnan betrayed his teammates and bashed Kip {{over the head with}} a steel chair. After the match, Konnan also bashed B.G. over the head with the chair before leaving the ring.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{was born}} in 1990, the son of Thomas Robinson, Sr., and Dorothea Robinson. [...] Robinson began playing pee-wee {{football}} by age 10 and played the game with <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> untied, thus earning the nickname [...] "Shoelace" [...] as a child. [...] Those who saw him play at Westside Park in Deerfield Beach recall:"Kids would go for <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> on tackles, and he'd {{come up to the}} huddle in just socks. [...] His coach couldn't stand it at first and neither could his parents. They'd tie wristbands around <b>his</b> <b>shoes.</b> When that didn't work, they tried athletic tape. They even rolled his socks over <b>his</b> <b>shoes.</b> He was a marvel, and he wasn't even finished with the sixth grade." ...|$|R

5|$|Graf's {{unit was}} interned {{for over a}} week with more than 30,000 other {{disarmed}} soldiers in a primitive camp with minimal food and sanitation. Following {{the letter of the}} Allied agreement, units fighting on the Eastern Front were to become Soviet prisoners. Graf and most of the JG52 personnel were handed over by the American forces to the Soviet Union on 15 May 1945. On 20 August, he and other senior Luftwaffe officers, including Hartmann and Hans Hahn, were moved to POW Camp No. 150 in Gryazovets, northeast of Moscow. This was a (relatively) more comfortable confinement than the regular labour camps and intended to provide a more sympathetic environment for high-profile prisoners. When Graf was found not to be malleable for their purposes, the Soviet regime put him on trial for war-crimes. However, when insufficient evidence could be produced, the charges were dropped. Erich Hartmann however, was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years of forced labour. On 8 December 1945, Graf was moved to POW Camp No. 27 in Krasnogorsk, Moscow. The author, Musciano, mentions that he was subject to solitary confinement for extended periods, but that he had his final order hidden in <b>his</b> <b>shoe</b> and would re-read it to keep his sanity.|$|E

Dillon came onto the apron, and attempted to attack Taylor with <b>his</b> <b>shoe.</b> Taylor sent Landel into Dillon, and placed Landel on the top turnbuckle.

The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off <b>his</b> <b>shoe</b> and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on stereotypically African American fare such as fried chicken.|$|E
25|$|Williams hit his {{athletic}} peak in 1996, beginning with an American indoor record of 20.40seconds over 200m {{in the early}} stages of the season, which was the third fastest indoor time that year. He finished as runner-up in the event behind Kevin Little at the USA Indoor Track and Field Championships. While competing at the Fresno Relays in California, Williams' 100m race was spoiled when <b>his</b> <b>shoe</b> came off. Keen to check his competitive level, Williams opted to run an impromptu 200m at the meet instead. He clocked a personal record time of 19.87seconds into a headwind, a time that only Michael Johnson and Frankie Fredericks had beaten since 1992.|$|E

The lightning set his hair on fire, moved down his left arm and left leg and knocked off <b>his</b> <b>shoe.</b> It then crossed over to his right leg just below the knee. Still conscious, Sullivan crawled to his truck and poured the can of water, which he always kept there, over his head, which was on fire.|$|E

25|$|Rîmaru's father Florea {{was also}} a serial killer. In the summer of 1944, a string of four murders rocked wartime Bucharest. Each victim (all were female) lived in a {{basement}} apartment, where the criminal would enter at night during a storm and bash their heads with a blunt object. Each time, the killer left fingerprints and footprints from military boots of size 42 or 43. On 23 October 1972, a year after his son's execution, Florea Rîmaru died at age 53 after falling off a train. This was officially an accident, but some authors suggest {{he might have been}} eliminated by Securitate agents, though the reason for this alleged assassination remains unclear. His body was brought to the Medico-Legal Institute, where the man's height of 174 cm and <b>his</b> <b>shoe</b> size of 42 attracted attention. Sure enough, the 1944 fingerprints matched his. Both their first victims even had similar names: Florea first killed Elena Udrea, while his son Ion killed first Elena Oprea. Dr. Butoi, the psychologist, theorizes that a gene predisposing one to violent crimes was transmitted from father to son, as the murders happened under remarkably similar circumstances.|$|E
500|$|Berry overcame several {{physical}} ailments {{during his}} football career, a fact he became famous for, {{but one that}} according to Berry was often exaggerated by the media. He was skinny and injury prone, such that when his college teammates saw {{him for the first}} time they sarcastically dubbed him, [...] "Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy". Reportedly, because one leg was shorter than the other, Berry had to wear padding inside <b>his</b> <b>shoe</b> in order to walk properly. However, according to Berry, this was not entirely true. In actuality, bruised nerves near the sacroiliac joint occasionally caused misalignment in his back, which in turn affected his legs and caused one to become slightly shorter; it was not a permanent condition. To alleviate this, he wore a back brace for 13 years in the NFL. That he required specialized shoes was a myth, which Berry says was perpetuated by an overzealous information director with the Colts when Berry tried to compensate for his condition by putting something in <b>his</b> <b>shoe</b> during training camp.|$|E
500|$|Chaplin felt The Gold Rush was {{the best}} film he had made to that point. It opened in August 1925 {{and became one of}} the highest-grossing films of the silent era with a profit of $5 million. The comedy {{contains}} some of Chaplin's most famous sequences, such as the Tramp eating <b>his</b> <b>shoe</b> and the [...] "Dance of the Rolls". Macnab has called it [...] "the quintessential Chaplin film". Chaplin stated, [...] "This is the picture that I want to be remembered by" [...] {{at the time of the}} film's release.|$|E
