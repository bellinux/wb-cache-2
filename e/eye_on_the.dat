5|$|Bony crests {{are found}} on the skulls of many theropods, {{including}} many tyrannosaurids. Alioramus, a possible tyrannosaurid from Mongolia, bears a single row of five prominent bony bumps on the nasal bones; a similar row of much lower bumps is present on the skull of Appalachiosaurus, {{as well as some}} specimens of Daspletosaurus, Albertosaurus, and Tarbosaurus. In Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus, there is a prominent horn in front of each <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lacrimal bone. The lacrimal horn is absent in Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which instead have a crescent-shaped crest behind each <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> postorbital bone. These head crests may have been used for display, perhaps for species recognition or courtship behavior.|$|E

5|$|Abandoned by Emperor Manuel, Stephen IV {{approached}} Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Around {{the same}} time, {{a group of}} Hungarian barons and prelates {{sent a letter to}} Emperor Frederick, stating that they were willing to accept his suzerainty. Stephen III also dispatched his envoys to Frederick, who decided not to intervene, but ordered his vassalsthe King of Bohemia, the Duke of Austria, and the Margrave of Styriato keep an <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> political situation in Hungary. King Vladislaus' son, Sviatopluk, even married Stephen III's sister, Odola. The betrothal of Stephen III to an unnamed daughter of Yaroslav Osmomysl, Prince of Halych, was also arranged around this time.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Taft {{wanted to}} be chief justice, and kept a close <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> health of the aging incumbent, Melville Fuller, who turned 75 in 1908. Taft {{believed}} Fuller likely to live many years. Roosevelt had indicated he was likely to appoint Taft if the opportunity came to fill the court's center seat, but some considered Attorney General Philander Knox a better candidate. In any event, Fuller remained chief justice throughout Roosevelt's presidency.|$|E

Squeezit accomplishes this task, but has failed to include himself in the deal to rescue his friends, and the devil has him decapitated. Queen Doris sends Bust Rod to keep an <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> king, and to ensure he doesn't find out where she's hidden Frenchy.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Báthory {{was elected}} King of Poland on 15 December 1575. He adopted {{the title of}} Prince of Transylvania and made Christopher voivode on 14 January 1576. An Ottoman {{delegation}} confirmed Christopher's appointment at the Diet in Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania) in July. The sultan's charter (or ahidnâme) sent to Christopher emphasized that he should keep the peace along the frontiers. Stephen set up a separate chancellery in Kraków to keep an <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> administration of Transylvania. The {{head of the new}} chancellery, Márton Berzeviczy, and Christopher cooperated closely.|$|E

5|$|As Tropical Depression Five-E {{approached}} Mexico, the country's government released {{tropical storm}} watches and warnings for {{certain parts of}} the coastline. When the tropical depression formed on July 5, the government issued a tropical storm warning from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo. Other interests in the Pacific Ocean were asked to keep an <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> developing depression. The morning of July 6, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo. The earlier tropical storm warning remained in effect, for another six hours, when the warning was demoted into a tropical storm watch. On the afternoon of July 6, the government discontinued the tropical storm watch up to Acapulco. The remaining tropical storm watch was discontinued on July 7, after the tropical depression had made landfall and began to weaken. The government's weather center also released thirteen tropical cyclone bulletins and four warnings for personal caution.|$|E

The new layout features wooden floors, with simply dressed tables. On each table sits three stones to signify the three Roca brothers, while the tableware is Rosenthal china. The enlarged kitchen in the new location includes space for thirty chefs to work and also features Joan Roca's open plan office, {{so that he can}} keep an <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chefs even while he is doing more administrative tasks. At least one of the three brothers is present for every service. There is a capacity for 45 diners.|$|E

5|$|Many {{tropical}} cyclones develop {{when the}} atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance {{in the atmosphere}} are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an <b>eye.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> {{other end of the}} spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses. A tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} ridge {{caused the}} storm to slow and {{turn back to}} the west. After the formerly hostile shear relaxed, Bindu became a tropical cyclone again on January11, redeveloping an <b>eye.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> next day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 150km/h (90mph), while the JTWC estimated maximum 1minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). By that time, the cyclone had turned back to the south-southwest. Drier air and wind shear resulted in weakening, and Bindu was downgraded to a severe tropical storm on January14. At 18:00UTC the next day, the storm passed about 140km (85mi) southeast of Rodrigues island, by which time the circulation was exposed north of the dwindling convection. The MFR downgraded Bindu to tropical depression status on January16. An approaching trough turned the system to the south on the next day, and Bindu became extratropical late on January17. The remnants turned sharply eastward due to a ridge, later looping back to the west on January20. Another trough turned the storm southward on January21 and absorbed the circulation the next day.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Dinah {{can be traced}} back to a poorly {{organized}} area of disturbed weather that formed on August18 close to Guam and was embedded in the monsoon trough, at the time situated near the equator. At 06:00UTC on August19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system, as the system started to show signs of organization. Shortly thereafter, a low pressure area developed along the axis of the system, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to start keeping an <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> low. Late on August20, there was a rapid increase in the coverage of the thunderstorm activity, and satellite intensity estimates via the Dvorak Technique reached T2.0/. Based on this, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression at 00:00UTC on August21.|$|E

5|$|The tuatara has a third <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, {{but it may be}} useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E
5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, at least on the surface. There was the Austrian censure to be reckoned with, as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very close <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., nothing out of the ordinary was published. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the contributors of Hermes o Logios dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.|$|E
5|$|P. sibiricus is {{the largest}} known species of Psittacosaurus. The skull of the type {{specimen}} is 20.7centimetres long (8.25in), and the femur is 22.3cm (8.75in) in length. It is also distinguished by its neck frill, which is longer than any other species, at 15 to 18% of skull length. A very striking feature of P. sibiricus {{is the number of}} 'horns' around the eyes, with three prominences on each postorbital, and one in front of each <b>eye,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> palpebral bones. Similar horns found on the postorbital of P. sinensis are not as pronounced but may be homologous. The jugal has extremely prominent 'horns' and may contact the premaxilla, both features also seen in the possibly related P. sinensis. There is a flange on the dentary of the lower jaw, similar to P. mongoliensis, P. meileyingensis, and P. sattayaraki. It can be told apart from the other species of Psittacosaurus by a combination of 32 anatomical features, including six that are unique to the species. Most of these are skull details, but one unusual feature is the presence of 23 vertebrae between the skull and pelvis, unlike the 21 or 22 in the other species where the vertebrae are known.|$|E
