500|$|Work on {{geological}} {{surveys in}} the area started prior to 2001, with surveys being performed by the Geological Survey of Norway. The contract to build the tunnel and all other earthwork on the section from Solstad to Hønsveien was awarded to Mika, with the tunneling costing NOK425 million. The tunnel was built using the drilling and blasting method using two points of entry, the entrance on the Asker side and from a crosscut at Skaugum. Work started in February 2002 and was concluded in May 2005. Construction involved blasting [...] of earthwork [...] and drilling [...] of holes for pre-injection. The construction used [...] of gunite, [...] of concrete, 24,000 bolts, [...] of water- and <b>frost</b> <b>protection,</b> [...] of noise- and frost isolation and [...] of cable conduit. Near the entrance at Asker, the tunnel is closest to the surface, and is between [...] below the basements of residential houses.

500|$|Among {{the major}} {{concerns}} were leaks; during the {{construction on the}} Romerike Tunnel, there was a one-year delay and severe cost overruns due to improper construction methods. One of the main aims in the Skaugum Tunnel project was therefore to avoid similar leaks, and the criteria were set to [...] per minute per [...] This was achieved by using sufficient time for the pre-injection, as well as continuous pregrouting through the entire tunnel. However, water still dripped into the tunnel, which caused several types of damage. In some places, it dripped onto the track causing it to rust, while in other places it fell onto electrical equipment. There were also issues with water running down the walls and collecting in the cable conduit, and the limestone in the water mixing with the ballast. By 2011, the emergency lighting system had to be replaced {{because of the high}} humidity. The National Rail Administration has stated that savings made by the specifications in the water and <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> methods have caused high maintenance costs because the small leaks which are present {{have done a lot of}} harm. In addition, areas with leaks suffer from icing. This has been part of a trend where older tunnels are nearly maintenance-free, while newer tunnels have incurred high maintenance costs.|$|E

2500|$|A serious viticultural {{concern for}} Chablis {{vineyard}} owners is <b>frost</b> <b>protection.</b> During the bud break {{period of a}} grapevine's annual cycle, the Chablis region is vulnerable to springtime frost, from March to early May, which can compromise the crop yield. Formerly, the financial risk involved saw many producers turn to polyculture agriculture, pulling up vineyards to plant alternative crops. The 1957 vintage was hit particularly hard by frost damage: the regional authorities reported that only 11 cases (132 bottles) of wine were produced.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s, {{technological}} advances in <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> introduced preventive measures, such as smudge pots and aspersion irrigation to the region. Smudge pots work by providing direct heat to the vines while aspersion involves spraying the vines with water {{as soon as}} temperatures hit [...] and maintaining persistent coverage. The water freezes on the vine, shielding it with a protective layer of ice that functions igloo-style, retaining heat within the vine. While cost {{is a factor in}} using smudge pots, there is a risk to the aspersion method if the constant sprinkling of water is interrupted of causing worse damage to the vine. There is no such protection against hail, which in 2016 caused serious difficulties for some Chablis vignerons.|$|E
2500|$|Vine {{training}} {{systems can}} be broadly classified {{by a number of}} different measurements. One of the oldest means was based on the relative height of the trunk with the distance of the canopy from the ground being described as high-trained (also known as [...] "high culture" [...] or vignes hautes) or low-trained (vignes basses). The ancient Romans were adherents of the high-trained vine systems with the tendone system of vines trained high over head along a pergola being one example. In the 1950s, Austrian winemaker Lenz Moser advocated the high-culture style of training, recommending low density plantings of vines with trunks 4ft (1.25 m) high. One of the benefits of a high-trained system is better <b>frost</b> <b>protection</b> versus low-trained systems such as the gobelet training system which tend to hang low to the ground. Some training systems such as the Guyot and cordons can be adapted to both high and low trained styles.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the use of}} {{irrigation}} is disparaged or even prohibited in many premium wine producing regions, its use in Washington is absolutely vital and is a major asset in quality wine production. The average vineyard in Eastern Washington receives approximately [...] in annual rainfall, most of it during the winter months. Without irrigation, agriculture in the region would not be possible. Compared to other wine regions that do not need or practice irrigation, a vineyard manager in Washington State has {{more control over the}} potential quality of the grapes. Utilizing drip irrigation and controlling the amount of water the vines receive and wine allows the grower to limit the amount of vigor (and thus yields) of vine and leverage water stress to produce more concentrated flavors and phenolic compounds in the grape. Growers will often withhold water early in the growing season to control the leaf canopy, which can have a beneficial business aspect by saving money compared to using costly viticultural chores such as sucker pruning, leaf striping and mildew treatment to control and tend to the leaf canopy. Applying a controlled amount of water during the ripening period following veraison encourages the grapes to ripen faster without a reductive loss in quality. One additional benefit {{of irrigation}} is <b>frost</b> <b>protection.</b> Following harvest, growers will soak the soil of the vineyard to moisten the soil down to two feet. As temperatures drop, this water can form a protective layer of ice that will give the vine a few extra degrees of protection from freezing temperature that may damage the roots.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Deeper winter snow is {{hypothesized}} to favor shrub growth and may partly explain the shrub expansion observed {{in many parts}} of the arctic during the last decades, potentially triggering biophysical feedbacks including regional warming and permafrost thawing. Weexperimentally tested the effects of winter snow depth on shrub growth and ecophysiology by measuring stem length and stem hydrogen (δ 2 H), carbon (δ 13 C), nitrogen (δ 15 N) and oxygen (δ 18 O) isotopic composition of the circumarctic evergreen dwarf shrub Cassiope tetragona growing in high-arctic Svalbard, Norway. Measurements were carried out on C. tetragona individuals sampled from three tundra sites, each representing a distinct moisture regime (dry heath, meadow, moist meadow). Individuals were sampled along gradients of experimentally manipulated winter snow depths in a six-year old snow fence experiment: in ambient (c. 20 cm), medium (c. 100 cm), and deep snow (c. 150 cm) plots. The deep-snow treatment consistently and significantly increased C. tetragona growth during the 2008 – 2011 manipulation period compared to growth in ambient-snow plots. Stem δ 15 Nand stemN concentration values were significantly higher in deep-snow individuals compared to individuals growing in ambient-snow plots during the course of the experiment, suggesting that soil N-availability was increased in deep-snow plots as a result of increased soil winterNmineralization.

40|$|Cranberry growers manage {{water on}} bogs to ensure {{sufficient}} moisture and adequate drainage for optimum plant growth. Water management practices on cranberry bogs {{differ from those}} used for other forms of agriculture because {{of the variety of}} ways that water is used in cranberry culture. Water is used for disease and insect control, <b>frost</b> and heat <b>protection,</b> sanding, harvesting, and protection from winter desiccation and cold injury. Because of the periodic need for sizable amounts of water, impoundment of water adjacent to the bogs is a normal farming practice in cranberry production. In addition to storage ponds and sumps, components of a typical water management system for a cranberry bog include irrigation systems, wells, flood gates and flumes, lift pumps, and drainage ditches and pipes. Water can be used and re-used within a cranberry bog because its irrigation system and water storage reservoir are often interconnected. In some instances, water can also be recycled among growers. Therefore, water uses on cranberry bogs are not always consumptive. Newly established bogs, however, do require more irrigation to satisfy the needs of growing vines. Because cranberry culture typically is carried out in moist areas such as wetlands and marshes, irrigation needs are limited and comparatively small (averaging between 0. 4 and 1. 5 inches per week from rainfall and irrigation combined, during the growing season). Important environmental considerations directly related to water management include: 1) conservation of fresh water supplies; 2) prevention of contamination of surface and groundwater by pesticides, fertilizers, or sediments; 3) optimizing plant growth, yield, and resistance to pests and diseases...|$|R
