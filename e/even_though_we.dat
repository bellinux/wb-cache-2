The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that spirituality is at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

25|$|Given {{that reason}} alone cannot {{determine}} whether God exists, Pascal concludes that this question functions like a coin toss. However, {{even if we}} do not know the outcome of this coin toss, we must base our actions on some expectation about the outcome.

25|$|These studies {{point to}} the fact that <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> only attend to and process limited information, we have a vast amount of {{knowledge}} at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our memories for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.|$|E

25|$|However, {{things are}} not quite that simple. The zero-point energy cannot be {{eliminated}} by dropping its energy from the Hamiltonian: When we do this and solve the Heisenberg equation for a field operator, we must include the vacuum field, which is the homogeneous {{part of the solution}} for the field operator. In fact we can show that the vacuum field is essential for the preservation of the commutators and the formal consistent of QED. When we calculate the field energy we obtain not only a contribution from particles and forces that may be present but also a contribution from the vacuum field itself i.e. the zero-point field energy. In other words, the zero-point energy reappears <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> may have deleted it from the Hamiltonian.|$|E
25|$|A very {{different}} reason for Kol Nidre was {{suggested by the}} Zohar; God has already threatened and vowed terrible punishments upon the Jewish people for their sins, but by our own demonstration that we can unbind ourselves from vows using Kol Nidre we hope to persuade God to similarly annul His own vows of calamity. As stated in the Orot Sephardic mahzor: According to the holy Zohar, Kol Nidre is recited on Yom Kippur because, at times, the Heavenly judgment is handed down as an 'avowed decree' for which there can normally be no annulment. By reciting the Kol Nidre annulment of vows at this time, we are asking of God that He favor us by annuling any negative decrees of judgment that await us, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> are undeserving of such annulment.|$|E
25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
25|$|Passion {{is closely}} aligned with faith in Kierkegaard's thought. Faith as a passion is what drives humans to seek reality and truth in a transcendent world, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> {{everything}} <b>we</b> can know intellectually speaks against it.

500|$|... "Hero" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey. It was released on October 19, 1993, via Columbia Records as the second single from Carey's third studio album, Music Box (1993). Originally intended for Gloria Estefan, the song was written by Mariah and produced by her and Walter Afanasieff. While writing the song, Carey did not connect to its style or sound, therefore forfeiting {{it over to the}} soundtrack of the film of the same name. However, after being convinced to keep it, she personalized it, giving it a more pop and R melody, as well as changing some of the lyrics to more precisely fit her personality. Lyrically, the song is regarded as one of Carey's most inspirational and personal ballads, with its protagonist declaring that <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> may feel discouraged or down at times, in reality, we are [...] "heroes" [...] if we look inside ourselves and see our own inner strength; in time, it will help us [...] "find the way." ...|$|E

50|$|Some {{ambiguity}} {{exists in}} the literature concerning the distinction between quasi-static and reversible processes, as these are sometimes taken as synonyms. The reason is the theorem that any reversible process is also a quasi-static one, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> (as <b>we</b> have illustrated above) the converse is not true. In practical situations, {{it is essential to}} differentiate between the two: any engineer would remember to include friction when calculating the dissipative entropy generation, so there are no reversible processes in practice. The definition given above is closer to the intuitive understanding of the word &ldquo;quasi-&rdquo; (almost) &ldquo;static&rdquo;, and remains technically different from reversible processes.|$|R
500|$|As {{with the}} Mr. Hooper episode, [...] "Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce" [...] was studied {{extensively}} for comprehension and attention. After it was filmed, it was screened before a test audience of 60 children in four daycare centers. The results found several unintended negative effects. As The Christian Science Monitor said, [...] "it bombed". Despite Gordon's reassuring the Muppets Elmo, Big Bird, and Telly, children {{believed that their}} parents' arguments would lead to their divorce. They also were unsure that Snuffy and his little sister Alice's parents loved them despite the divorce, were unclear where the characters' parents lived (especially their father, who had never appeared on the show before). Many viewers also thought that Snuffy and Alice would never see their father again. According to Singer, [...] "The kids came away with negative messages... The kids misunderstood arguments. They said arguments did mean divorce. Some thought Snuffy's parents were moving away <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> said just the opposite.

I have always had a good relationship with Raúl, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> have hardly met on international duty." [...] Speaking about Raúl's record with the Spanish national team as the nation's leading top scorer, Villa said, [...] "I've got 25 goals but he's got 44 and is still playing. I'd be delighted to reach that tally as I'd help the national team achieve great victories and, in many years' time, I could see my name on a [...] that another young lad was trying to beat.

That was 29 years ago. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> have remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper." [...] Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski convinced Scott that {{it would be possible to}} film in 3D with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company 3ality Technica provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation. According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget. Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the Alien films was added in post-production using color grading processes, and the 3D equipment was based on post-Avatar technology.|$|E
