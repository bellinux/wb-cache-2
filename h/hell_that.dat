5|$|Small gold goat statues {{are hidden}} in the game's world. Collecting this allows the goat to restart the game with various {{modifiers}} in play, such as changing the goat model to a demon goat, a giraffe, or an ostrich, or adding a jetpack to the goat that can be activated at any time. Various easter eggs are scattered about the sandbox, such as a castle where one can become the Queen of all Goats, or where the goat character gains a move similar to Sonic the Hedgehog's spin attack. The game's lead developer Armin Ibrisagic noted after release that the game's setting is a parody {{of the concept of}} Purgatory, having left references to Heaven and <b>Hell</b> <b>that</b> were later found by fans. Ibrisagic also noted the inclusion of some elements based on the 2014 Ukrainian revolution (ingame this was actually a small protest of people holding nonsensical or obscene signs).|$|E
25|$|According to Catholic belief, {{death is}} {{immediately}} {{followed by the}} judgment in which the soul's eternal destiny is specified. Some are eternally united with God in Heaven, envisioned as a paradise of unending bliss, where Theosis is completed and one experiences the beatific vision. Conversely, others reach <b>Hell,</b> <b>that</b> is chiefly a state of eternal, irreversible separation from God often envisioned as an abode of unending torment, often characterised as a fire that may be considered metaphorical.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a legend}} in East Anglia about a ghostly black hound from <b>hell</b> <b>that</b> roams the coast and lonely lanes of Norfolk. The hound {{is the size of}} a small horse and appears from the depths of Beeston Bump with malevolent flaming red eyes. Anyone confronted by the Doom Dog will be dead within a year. Sometimes, Black Shuck has {{appeared}} headless and, at other times, he appears to float on a carpet of mist, rather than running. The Black Shuck often terrifies his victims out of their wits, although the apparition is said not to harm its victims. The legend was the inspiration behind Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Conan Doyle had been on a golfing holiday at the nearby Links Hotel in West Runton, and it was in the sitting room of the hotel that his friend, Bertram Fletcher Robinson, recounted the legend of the Black Hound from the Bump.|$|E
25|$|John Winchester {{gives it}} to the demon Azazel in return for Dean's life being spared after a near-fatal car crash. At {{the end of the}} second season, Azazel uses the Colt as the key to open one of the Gates to <b>Hell</b> <b>that</b> Samuel Colt had sealed. The last bullet is then used to kill Azazel, though the gun is later altered to allow the use of more bullets. Towards the end of the third season, Lilith's {{right-hand}} demon, Crowley, acquires the gun and hides it. It is then featured in two time-travel episodes – Dean using a past version of it when he is sent back to 1973, and his future self discovering it when Dean is sent five years into the future – before Crowley returns it to the Winchesters so they can kill Lucifer. However, after Dean shoots Lucifer in the head at point-blank range, an unharmed Lucifer boasts there are five things in creation which the gun cannot kill, and he is one of them. The Colt is subsequently lost and absent for several years until Mary Winchester retrieves it back from a Prince of Hell, Ramiel.|$|E
25|$|Skinner {{was born}} in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, to Grace and William Skinner. His father was a lawyer. He became an atheist after a Christian teacher tried to assuage his fear of the <b>hell</b> <b>that</b> his {{grandmother}} described. His brother Edward, {{two and a half}} years younger, died at age sixteen of a cerebral hemorrhage. He attended Hamilton College in New York with the intention of becoming a writer. He found himself at a social disadvantage at Hamilton College because of his intellectual attitude. While attending, he joined Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He wrote for the school paper, but, as an atheist, he was critical of the religious school he attended. After receiving his Bachelor of Arts in English literature in 1926, he attended Harvard University, where he would later research, teach, and eventually become a prestigious board member. While he was at Harvard, a fellow student, Fred Keller, convinced Skinner that he could make an experimental science from the study of behavior. This led Skinner to invent his prototype for the Skinner Box and to join Keller in the creation of other tools for small experiments. After graduation, he unsuccessfully tried to write a great novel while he lived with his parents, a period that he later called the Dark Years. He became disillusioned with his literary skills despite encouragement from the renowned poet Robert Frost, concluding that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write. His encounter with John B. Watson's Behaviorism led him into graduate study in psychology and to the development of his own version of behaviorism.|$|E

The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. Those {{are some of the things}} that I would like to take back. It was really fucked up.

Fans might be surprised at her references to 'the <b>hell</b> <b>that</b> we built' and the 'violent times,' but Mariah thinks this song is for 'anyone who’s been in an abusive relationship.' 'You know what? I’ve been through too much at this point,' she said. 'I want happiness and I want pure and real love, but the side effects of what other relationships have put me through cause me to be kind of on the defensive a lot of the time. And if somebody isn’t mature or caring and loving and open-hearted enough to understand that, then it’s tough, but this is a song for people who need that.' Mariah hopes that this song helps people feel 'a little bit stronger.' ...|$|E

500|$|... finally {{reveals a}} side of Mariah we don't see that often — her true self. The Mariah we usually see and hear is a glossy one. Psychologists might say her affect is 'off' — meaning her {{gestures}} and facial expressions don't match her mood. There's a reason for that, as she explains on 'Side Effects', which is the emotional abuse she says she suffered during her marriage to music mogul Tommy Mottola. Mariah, who is usually quite guarded, has alluded to the subject in songs like 'Petals', but never has she gone into such detail as she does on 'Side Effects', in which she refers to the marriage as a 'private <b>hell</b> <b>that</b> we built'. Even though it's been 11 years since they split up, she sings in a lower register that she's still 'wakin' up scared some nights ... dreaming about the violent times'. Her emotional scars left her 'a little protective ... a little defensive ... a little depressed', which makes her 'fake a smile' as she 'deal with the side effects'. Even though it features Young Jeezy, {{it sounds like a}} rock power ballad.|$|E

The {{only thing that can}} open it is a key which is sought by the Minion, a demonic spirit that transfers itself into the nearby host body when his previous one is killed off. Awakening in New York City, the Minion tracks down Karen Goodleaf as Lukas arrives to America to protect her and the key. Michael Haag in his book Templars: History and Myth: From Solomon's Temple to the Freemasons (2009) said, [...] "The budget for this film was $12million. A pity they did not spend a cent on research (citing that one reference was 600 years out) ... Lundgren is a butt-kicking Templar monk with a spiked leather glove whose sacred duty it is to do what the Templars have always done and stop a key that has kept the Anti-christ imprisoned for thousands of years from falling into the right hands.". The DVD and Video Guide of 2005 described the film as being [...] "possibly one of the worst films ever".|$|E

[...] Although the previous episode, [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub", also featured similar party scenes, the party was much darker and more decrepit in [...] "Open House", and Breaking Bad music supervisor Thomas Golubic tried to select music appropriate for that darker tone. Originally he tried using variations of punk rock, hip hop and dubstep, but felt it was inappropriate and wanted something that [...] "deeper into Jesse's headspace". He chose the song [...] "If I Had a Heart" [...] by Swedish musician Fever Ray which was used during a sequence of scenes before and during Jesse's party.

500|$|The party scenes at Jesse's house {{sought to}} {{illustrate}} Jesse's internal guilt and self-hatred for having murdered Gale Boetticher {{in the third}} season finale, [...] "Full Measure". Gilligan said these scenes were written {{because he wanted to}} demonstrate that the actions of the characters in Breaking Bad have major consequences. The writing staff spent weeks discussing how Jesse would react to having killed Gale, and went with the course of events in [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] in part because they felt it would be the most unexpected for the audience. Bryan Cranston praised these scenes, saying [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} way to show a person going through a private <b>hell.</b> <b>That</b> everybody suffers, deals with their own personal loss in many different ways." [...] The scenes were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy. Breaking Bad music supervisor Thomas Golubic tried to select music appropriate for both the party and Jesse's state of mind, using variations of punk rock, hip hop and dubstep. During one scene when Jesse, Skinny Pete and Badger are snorting meth together, Badger leans down outside of the shot to take the drugs, then Skinny Pete pops back up in a match cut. The shot was conceived by MacLaren during filming.|$|E
