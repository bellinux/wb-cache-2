He thought he could get it all back by staging this fight of his that came off in Jersey City last night. And if everything had gone right he might have got afloat again. But it seems as if he can't touch anything without it turning to mud. On the very day before the fight was to come off, the poor mutt who was going against the champion goes and lets a sparring-partner of his own knock him down and fool around with him. With all the newspaper men there too! You probably saw about it in the papers. It made a great story for them. Well, that killed the whole thing. The public had never been any too sure that this fellow Bugs Butler had a chance of putting up a scrap with the champion that would be worth paying to see; and, when they read that he couldn't even stop his sparring-partners slamming him all around the place they simply decided to stay away. Poor old Fill! It was a finisher for him.

5000|$|Then, it was very, very difficult, if not {{impossible}} to produce the sort of robot voice which {{would have to be}} monotone. So we found out that in Edinburgh University, they were creating the human voice artificially. They gave us a vibrator - of course, of course, everybody smiled at - not that kind of vibrator. And it was a vibrator that people who had their larynx removed through cancer would be able to put the vibrator under their chin, and it made a constant buzz. buzzing noise. And then, of course, that sound was transmitted to the air inside the mouth. And I was then able to modulate that by mouthing the words. So, let's <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>straight,</b> fellas.

5000|$|The Very Best of Dexys Midnight Runners is a best of {{compilation}} album by Dexys Midnight Runners. The album contained seven Dexys hits {{that had}} also been album tracks ("Geno, [...] "There, There My Dear", [...] "The Celtic Soul Brothers", [...] "Come On Eileen", [...] "Jackie Wilson Said", [...] "Old", and [...] "This Is What She's Like") but was more notable as the first album to contain ten of Dexys' non-album singles, including [...] "Let's <b>Get</b> <b>This</b> <b>Straight</b> (From the Start)", [...] "Because Of You", [...] "Show Me", [...] "One Way Love", [...] "Breaking Down the Walls of Heartache", [...] "Dance Stance", [...] "Keep It Part Two (Inferiority Part One)", [...] "I'm Just Looking", [...] "Soon", and [...] "Soul Finger"), plus the original recordings of two more ("Plan B", [...] "Liars A to E"). [...] "One Way Love" [...] was the only Dexys song with Kevin Archer as the lead vocalist. The tracks covered Dexys' entire career, shown by the fact that, although the album was released on Mercury Records, 9 of the album's 19 songs were recorded for EMI Records, Dexys' first label.|$|E
5000|$|In August, the 1968 Democratic National Convention {{was held}} in Chicago. Intended to {{showcase}} Daley's achievements to national Democrats and the news media, the proceedings during the convention instead garnered notoriety for the mayor and city, descending into verbal outbursts {{on the part of}} politicians, and a circus for the media. With the nation divided by the Vietnam War and with the assassinations of King and Robert F. Kennedy earlier that year serving as backdrop, the city became a battleground for anti-Vietnam war protesters who vowed to shut down the convention. In some cases, confrontations between protesters and police turned violent, with images of this violence broadcast on national television. Later, anti-war activists Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and three other members of the [...] "Chicago Seven" [...] were convicted of crossing state lines with the intent of inciting a riot {{as a result of these}} confrontations, though the convictions were overturned on appeal. At the convention itself, Sen. Abraham A. Ribicoff (D-Conn.), went off-script during his speech nominating George McGovern, saying, [...] "And with George McGovern as President of the United States, we wouldn’t have to have Gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago. And with George McGovern as president, we wouldn't have to have a National guard." [...] Ribicoff, with his voice shaking, then said: [...] "How hard it is to speak the truth, when we know the problems that are facing this nation", for which some in the crowd booed Ribicoff. Ribicoff also tried to introduce a motion to shut down the convention and move it to another city. Many conventioneers applauded Ribicoff's remarks but an indignant Mayor Daley tried to shout down the speaker. As television cameras focused on Daley, lip-readers throughout America claimed to have observed him shouting, [...] "Fuck you, you Jew son of a bitch." [...] Defenders of the mayor would later claim that he was calling Ribicoff a faker, a charge denied by Daley and refuted by Mike Royko's reporting. A federal commission, led by local attorney, party activist Dan Walker, investigated the events surrounding the convention and described them as a [...] "police riot." [...] Daley defended his police force with the following statement, which was also a slip of the tongue: [...] "The confrontation was not caused by the police. The confrontation was caused by those who charged the police. Gentlemen, let's <b>get</b> <b>this</b> thing <b>straight,</b> once and for all. The policeman is not here to create disorder. The policeman is here to preserve disorder." ...|$|R

5000|$|Let's Make This Precious: The Best of Dexys Midnight Runners is a best-of {{compilation}} album by Dexys Midnight Runners, {{which also}} contained two newly recorded songs by the group, [...] "Manhood" [...] and [...] "My Life in England (Part One)". Dexys {{had broken up}} in early 1987, and these two songs, recorded in 2003, were the first new Dexys material since the single [...] "Because of You" [...] in 1986. Nevertheless, the album {{was similar to the}} 1991 compilation The Very Best of Dexys Midnight Runners, as eleven of the sixteen older Dexys songs on it had also been included on that album ("Geno", [...] "There, There My Dear", [...] "The Celtic Soul Brothers", [...] "Come On Eileen", [...] "Jackie Wilson Said", [...] "This Is What She's Like", [...] "Let's <b>Get</b> <b>This</b> <b>Straight</b> (From the Start)", [...] "Because Of You", [...] "Show Me", [...] "Breaking Down the Walls of Heartache", and [...] "Plan B"). However, to record the two new songs, Rowland put together a new version of Dexys that featured prior members Pete Williams (bass and vocals) and Mick Talbot (keyboards) plus new members such as Lucy Morgan (viola) and Neil Hubbard (guitar), and the reformed band played a series of live concerts later in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|There {{has long}} been a {{controversy}} related to whether or not session musicians were used on The Raiders hit albums during the years Volk appeared with the group. He says, [...] "There were no studio cats. That must have happened later, maybe in the 1970s when Mark has turned up as producer and Terry Melcher left. I don't know, Mark brought some people in for [...] "Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)", but when I was in the band, and I want to <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>straight,</b> I was the bass player, I sang background vocals, and I also sang some lead vocals on some of the songs, and it was Drake, and myself, and Smitty, and Paul on keyboards, and Mark played some saxophone. We were the players, because before becoming famous and national, we were on the dance circuit for a long time, playing up in the Northwest, and you know, we were known as the hardest workin' band in the Northwest, the hardest workin' band in show business. We would do a set of music at one of our dance gigs and our coats were soaking wet. We had to change outfits, because we had worked so hard on the set. So we were the players, and anyone who writes that we weren't doesn't know what they are talkin' about, they haven't done their homework".|$|E
5000|$|To {{fit in with}} Dexys' Celtic image, {{she took}} the stage last name of [...] "O'Hara". [...] Within months she was touring the UK, {{followed}} by the US, as [...] "Come On Eileen" [...] reached #1 in the charts in both countries. She also began {{a personal relationship with}} Rowland. [...] With the singles [...] "Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)" [...] (a Van Morrison cover) and [...] "Let's <b>Get</b> <b>This</b> <b>Straight</b> (From The Start)" [...] maintaining their popularity, the group continued to tour through 1983 with a nucleus of Rowland, O'Hara and Billy Adams, augmented by other musicians. Beginning in 1984, and with the assistance of both studio musicians and former members, Dexys wrote and recorded Don't Stand Me Down, which was released in late 1985. Earlier in 1985, Rowland appointed O'Hara as Dexys' musical director. [...] O'Hara later commented that the American musicians that they worked with [...] "couldn't quite make out my position in the band, and the whole thing." [...] Some of the lyrics and songs from that album, especially [...] "This Is What She's Like", were written by Rowland about her, which she said made them [...] "pretty uncomfortable" [...] to record. [...] The lengthy, contentious sessions for that album strained both her relationship with Rowland and the core of that version of Dexys. Although Dexys returned to the charts with [...] "Because Of You" [...] (co-written by Rowland, O'Hara, and Adams) in 1986, and O'Hara's [...] "fan club" [...] letter in November 1986 discussed imminent recording sessions for a new Dexys album, she later said that at that point [...] "Dexys were finished really" [...] and the band broke up in 1987.|$|E
