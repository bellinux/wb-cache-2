50|$|In {{this most}} common CVT system, {{there are two}} V-belt pulleys that are split {{perpendicular}} to their axes of rotation, with a V-belt running between them. The gear ratio is changed by moving the two sheaves of one pulley closer together and the two sheaves of the other pulley farther apart. The V-shaped {{cross section of the}} belt causes it to ride higher on one pulley and lower on the other. This changes the effective diameters of both pulleys, which changes the overall gear ratio. As the distance between the pulleys and the length of the belt does not change both pulleys must be adjusted (one bigger, the other smaller) simultaneously {{in order to maintain the}} proper amount of tension on the belt. Simple CVTs combining a centrifugal drive pulley with a spring loaded <b>driven</b> <b>pulley</b> often use belt tension to effect the conforming adjustments in the <b>driven</b> <b>pulley.</b> The V-belt needs to be very stiff in the pulley's axial direction in order to make only short radial movements while sliding in and out of the pulleys.|$|E

The {{purpose of}} the present study is to carry out failure {{analysis}} of a scooter’s continuously variable transmission (CVT) system that is considered to be one of the key components of the scooter. In the study, several reliability analytical tools such as failure mode, effect and criticality analysis (FMECA) and fault tree analysis (FTA) are used to identify possible failure modes of the CVT system and its subsystems. The failure effects of components on the CVT system are emphasized in particular. Aside from the qualitative evaluation, simulation algorithms are developed to examine the performance of the CVT system and assess the reliability of the belt. Through the study, it is found that mechanical wear at both sides of the V-belt is the most serious problem that affects the CVT performance. The sliding collar of the <b>driven</b> <b>pulley</b> is another component that has to be observed carefully. Some design improvements are pointed out at the end of the paper...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To {{investigate}} parametrically forced excitation and transverse oscillations of {{the belt}} with local heterogeneity, a new dynamic model of a V-belt drive with longitudinal motion has been developed. The model shows that when an appropriate quantitative and qualitative level of local heterogeneity is achieved, the oscillation mode {{of the belt}} starts to change, and the belt tensile force developing due to deformation of the belt significantly increases. Another V-belt drive dynamic model was developed based on the finite element model (FEM) analysis. This {{was used to examine}} the interaction of the belt, containing local heterogeneity, with the pulley in the area of contact angle. The natural frequencies of the system were calcu-lated and the system’s response to harmonic excitation was established. The correlation between the presence of defects in the belt and vibration activity of the driving pulley bearing housing was established. Using the developed model, the relationship between the defective belt and the dynamic component of the vibration reaction force of the <b>driven</b> <b>pulley</b> was studied.

40|$|In {{the present}} work closed form {{relationships}} {{for the power}} losses in rubber V-belt CVT are obtained, together with expressions for the axial thrust on both the driving and driven pulleys, starting fromsimple physical hypotheses.

50|$|The DAF 600 was {{the first}} car to have a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) system - the innovative DAF Variomatic., the same system was carried over to the 750 and its variants. The DAF Variomatic employs centrifugal weights to control the drive ratio of the transmission and is enhanced by the engine manifold vacuum. The action of the bob weights and inlet vacuum combined to pull together the cheeks of two, variable diameter, driving <b>pulleys,</b> <b>driven</b> directly from the engine. These were connected, by rubber 'V' belts, to two similar <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys,</b> connected to the drive wheels. The cheeks of the <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys</b> were held together by spring tension, which was progressively overcome as the <b>drive</b> <b>pulleys</b> expanded and the tension of the belts increased. The DAF Variomatics were thereby the only cars ever produced which went faster by the simple expedient of gently and gradually releasing the accelerator once top engine speed had been reached, as the increased vacuum took over from the reducing bob weight speed. The Variomatic also permitted increased engine braking by operating a switch on the dashboard which reversed {{the action of the}} vacuum on the pulley's diaphragm, seeking a lower ratio with increased manifold vacuum. Two separate transmissions ran the two driving wheels, eliminating the need for a differential. The two transmissions could provide different drive ratios, permitting the wheels to rotate at different speeds. The duplication also provided redundancy. If one belt broke, the vehicle could still be driven.An interesting feature: putting the car in reverse reversed the entire drive system. This enabled the vehicle, at least the earlier examples, in theory to reach the same top speed in reverse as forward.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a computer-based guide {{of the effect}} of layout and loading (tension and torque) on the timing belt life and uses it to show the sensitivity of life to changed conditions in an automotive camshaft drive. The predictions are in line with experience. The guide requires belt property information, such as the tooth and tension member stiffness, the friction coefficient between the belt lands and pulleys and the pitch difference from the pulley, in order to calculate the tooth deflections caused by the belt loadings on the various pulleys in the layout. It also requires information on how the belt life depends on the tooth deflections. Experimental data are presented on the life±deflection relations of a commercial automotive timing belt tested between 100 and 140 8 C, although the bulk of the data has been obtained at 120 8 C. Four different life laws have been found, depending on whether the failure-initiating deflection occurred on a driver or a <b>driven</b> <b>pulley,</b> and whether at entry to or exit from the pulley.

40|$|Rotary {{pneumatic}} actuators {{that are made}} out of linear one are always best suited for exoskeleton joint actuation due to its inherent power to weight ratio. This work is {{a modified version of}} knee actuation system that has already been developed and major modifications are made {{in order to make it}} more suitable for human wearing and also to reduce its bulkiness and complexity. The considered actuator system is a rotary actuator where a pulley converts the linear motion of the standard pneumatic piston into the rotary motion. To prove the capability of the actuator, its performance characteristics such as torque and power produced are compared to the required torque and power at the knee joint of the exoskeleton in swing phase and are found to be excellent. The two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed to find the effect of the throat area valve on knee angle. The ANOVA shows the significant effect of the throat area variation on the knee angle flexion made by the proposed actuator. A relationship between the throat area of flow control valve, that is connected to the exit port of the direction control valve, and angular displacement of the knee joint has been formulated. This relationship can be used to design a control system to regulate the mass flow rate of air at the exit and hence the angular velocity of the knee joint can be controlled.

In addition, new designs for driver pulleys are presented and evaluated which incorporate direct electro-mechanical actuation of the CVT. Two of these new designs are built and tested to evaluate their performance and to validate the modeling work. The results of the belt-pulley force interaction research indicates that (1) the iterative modeling strategy is a viable approach for discovering the physics that dominate {{the behavior of the}} CVT, (2) the torque distribution between helically constrained pulley halves is not equal, (3) the torque distribution between helically constrained pulley halves depends very strongly on the speed difference between the pulley halves, the shear stiffness properties of the belt, and the coefficient of friction between the belt and the pulley halves, and (4) there is considerable value to pursuing further the understanding of the physics of the load sharing on helically constrained pulley halves, because most driven pulleys for rubber-belt CVTs are of this type. The results of the steady-state modeling effort for CVTs indicates that (1) helically constrained driver pulley halves are probably not viable design options, and (2) understanding the load sharing on the <b>driven</b> <b>pulley</b> halves is key to modeling the complete CVT, especially for belt engagement and low ratio operation.
