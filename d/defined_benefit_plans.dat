5000|$|Retirement plans may be {{classified}} as <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> or <b>defined</b> contribution according to how the benefits are determined. [...] A <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> guarantees a certain payout at retirement, according to a fixed formula which usually depends on the member's salary {{and the number of}} years' membership in the plan. A defined contribution plan will provide a payout at retirement that is dependent upon the amount of money contributed and the performance of the investment vehicles utilized. Hence, with a defined contribution plan the risk and responsibility lies with the employee that the funding will be sufficient through retirement, whereas with the <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>plan</b> the risk and responsibility lies with the employer or plan managers.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to advance {{understanding}} of <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> pension <b>plans</b> in Canada by focusing on important questions related to the funding, accounting and policy aspects of management of <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> pension <b>plans.</b> As well, the paper aims to impart a reasonable estimate of the standing of <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> pension <b>plans</b> at December 31, 2003 and to explore potential remedies for consideration by stakeholders inclusive of legislators, regulators, standard setters, employers and members. The analysis shows that at December 31, 2003, 59 % of Canadian <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> pension <b>plans</b> continued to be in deficit. That number rises to 95 % if provided for indexation of benefits. It is expected that an additional $ 160 billion is required to fully fund those deficits (assuming indexation of accrued benefits). Given that the future prospects of equities market performance are relatively conservative, it is unlikely that stock market returns alone will correct the situation; at least in the short term. On a solvency basis, $ 15 billion per year will need to be injected into <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> pension <b>plans</b> over the next five years to make up for the investment losses.
