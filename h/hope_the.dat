5|$|Some historians {{allege that}} Jinnah's courting {{the rulers of}} Hindu-majority states and his gambit with Junagadh are {{evidence}} of ill-intent towards India, as Jinnah had promoted separation by religion, yet tried to gain the accession of Hindu-majority states. In his book Patel: A Life, Rajmohan Gandhi asserts that Jinnah hoped for a plebiscite in Junagadh, knowing Pakistan would lose, in the <b>hope</b> <b>the</b> principle would be established for Kashmir. However, when Mountbatten proposed to Jinnah that, in all the princely States where the ruler did not accede to a Dominion corresponding to the majority population (which would have included Junagadh, Hyderabad and Kashmir), the accession should be decided by an 'impartial reference {{to the will of}} the people', Jinnah rejected the offer.|$|E
5|$|The French Revolutionary Wars, {{which began}} in 1792, {{following}} the French Revolution, expanded in January 1793, when the French Republic declared war on the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of Great Britain. This brought the war to the Indian Ocean, where both Britain and the Netherlands maintained lucrative empires. Trade from these empires was menaced by French privateers and warships operating from Île de France, (now Mauritius) but it was protected in the waters off Southern Africa {{by the presence of}} the Dutch Cape Colony. Situated at the Cape of Good <b>Hope,</b> <b>the</b> Cape Colony had been established in the seventeenth century to offer a harbour for shipping traveling between Europe and the East Indies, and in the 1790s it remained the only such station between Rio de Janeiro and British India.|$|E
5|$|The Invasion of the Cape Colony was a British {{military}} expedition {{launched in}} 1795 against the Dutch Cape Colony at the Cape of Good <b>Hope,</b> <b>the</b> {{southern tip of}} Southern Africa. The Dutch colony at the Cape, established in the seventeenth century, {{was at the time}} the only viable South African port for ships making the journey from Europe to the European colonies in the East Indies. It therefore held vital strategic importance, although it was otherwise economically insignificant. In the winter of 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, French troops entered the Dutch Republic, which was reformed into the Batavian Republic. In response, Great Britain launched operations against the Dutch Empire to use its facilities against the French Navy.|$|E

5|$|The {{authorities}} had initially {{planned for the}} replica to replace the red Berlayer Beacon, but the Singapore Heritage Society was against the decision, saying the beacon was itself a heritage site {{and should not be}} destroyed because the beacon has been at Labrador Park since the end of World War II.

5|$|The {{cause of}} the war stems from the {{increasing}} numbers of English colonists and their demand for land. As more land was purchased from the Native Americans, they were restricted to smaller territories for themselves. Native American leaders such as King Philip resented the loss of land and looked for a means to slow or reverse it. Of specific concern was {{the founding of the}} town of Swansea, which was located only {{a few miles from the}} Wampanoag capital at Mount <b>Hope.</b> <b>The</b> General Court of Plymouth began using military force to coerce the sale of Wampanoag land to the settlers of the town.|$|E

5000|$|Moltmann's Theology of Hope is a {{theological}} perspective with an eschatological foundation {{and focuses on}} <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> that <b>the</b> resurrection brings.

In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living <b>hope</b> through <b>the</b> resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" [...] (1 Peter 1:3, NIV)), and knowledge of his return. For Moltmann, <b>the</b> <b>hope</b> of <b>the</b> Christian faith is <b>hope</b> in <b>the</b> resurrection of Christ crucified. Hope and faith depend on each other to remain true and substantial; and only with both may one find [...] "not only a consolation in suffering, but also the protest of the divine promise against suffering" ...|$|R

The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town has aided the intruder, sets out to destroy the town. A thrush had overheard Bilbo's report of Smaug's vulnerability and reports it to Lake-town defender Bard. His arrow finds the chink and slays the dragon.|$|E
