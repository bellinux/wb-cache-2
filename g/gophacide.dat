40|$|The acute {{rodenticide}} <b>gophacide</b> {{was tested}} against urban infestations {{of the house}} mouse (Mus musculus L.) and treatment success was assessed {{from the results of}} census baitings conducted before and after each treatment. Seven of eight populations of mice living in premises where alternative food supplies were limited were successfully controlled when medium oatmeal bait containing <b>gophacide</b> at 0. 1 % was laid directly for 4 days. In further treatments against mice inhabiting more complex environments and having greater access to other foods, the performance of <b>gophacide</b> at 0. 1 % and at 0. 25 % in a wholemeal flour/pinhead oatmeal/corn oil bait was compared with that of zinc phosphide at 3. 0 % in the same bait-base. The poison treatments were conducted for 1 or 4 days and always after 3 days pre-baiting. Treatment success varied considerably irrespective of the type of treatment or of the poison used. In general, however, <b>gophacide</b> proved to be as effective as zinc phosphide for the control of mice...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{tests were}} carried out to assess the {{efficacy}} of <b>gophacide</b> as a rodenticide against the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the house mouse (Mus musculus). Results of feeding tests with wild animals suggest that the compound would be more useful against mice than rats, and that 0. 3 % would be a near optimal concentration for field trials for both species. The hazards of using <b>gophacide</b> as a rodenticide are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Toxicants {{have been}} widely used for several decades to reduce numbers of problem animals. The utility of these substances, however, has been limited by hazards to other animals and man, {{inadequate}} effectiveness against the target species, and restrictions on use. The ecological complexity of most habitats in which animal control is undertaken requires utilization of new poisons that are less hazardous, more effective, and more specific. <b>Gophacide</b> 1, Bayer 38819, 0 _, 0 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) acetimidoylphosphoramidothioate, is generally favorable in these respects. Tests with <b>Gophacide</b> were initiated at the Denver Wildlife Research Center in late 1961; and more recently, this chemical has also been tested at several field stations under different conditions. The initial and major emphasis has been to determine its usefulness in pocket gopher control. Techniques of use have been described (Ward et al., 1967). PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Technical <b>Gophacide</b> is a white crystalline powder which is soluble in chlorinated hydrocarbons, acetone, or warmed corn oil, and melts at 104 - 106 F. It is an organophosphate, and like related compounds, inhibits the cholinesterase activity of the blood. We don 2 ̆ 7 t know yet what the animal metabolites or oxidates of <b>Gophacide</b> are or the activity of such materials. The anticholinesterases, in general, are not accumulated for long periods in fatty tissues, and the hazard to wildlife is considered to be less from chronic than from acute poisoning (Casida, 1964) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the single-dose poison treatments of farm rat infestations, analysed by comparing the weights of the post-treatment census bait takes in covariance with the weights of the prebait takes, showed that treatments with 2 - 5 % zinc phosphide, 0 - 3 % thallium sulphate or 0 - 3 % <b>gophacide</b> were equally effective and significantly better than were treatments with 1 % zinc phosphide or 0 - 1 % thallium sulphate. The methodology and sensitivity of different analyses are also considered...|$|E
40|$|The 1972 Apple and Peach Tree Survey {{indicated}} that there were 1. 6 million apple trees in Virginia. Dr. J. B. Bell and Dr. J. M. Johnson report that based on information from the Statistical Reporting Service and the Economic Research Service that the average per year {{market value of the}} 1973 - 74 - 75 Virginia Apple crop was $ 109, 160, 000. This value consists of the farm value of $ 28 million plus packing, storage, processing, and other marketing services. It is estimated that mouse damage to apple trees reduces the output in Virginia by 10 % per year or a potential loss of $ 11, 000, 000 annually for the years 1973 - 75. From 1967 - 74, the Virginia Agricultural Foundation provided $ 50, 576 for mouse control research in Virginia. The original grant of $ 26, 576 was from July 1, 1967 through June 30, 1970. That research was directed at determining if pine voles were developing a resistance to endrin, studying orchard cover crops and their inter-relationship with control. Dr. Ryland E. Webb reports that genetic resistance to endrin was developing, this being the first case of a mammal becoming resistant to a poison in its natural habitat. <b>Gophacide</b> and Chlorophacinone were studied with the latter showing more promise...|$|E

CALIFORNIA VERTEBRATE PEST CONFERENCE WONDER CHEMICALS The only wonder is that EPA still permits us to use any chemicals for controlling vertebrate animal damage. Anderson called Secretary Andrus a 2 ̆ 2 cuttlefish 2 ̆ 2 as the latter is as adept at squirting ink to hide his operations as is the marine squid. Anderson has documented some very questionable, Mafia-linked practices by Andrus when he was govenor of Idaho. Jack Anderson Andrus: Annoyed By Stories Of Past One of the immediate effects of Andrus selling out to the environmentalists has been the loss of a potentially effective tool incontroliing livestock depredation - - the 1080 toxic collar. A laboratory-field study of multiple-catch mouse traps - - 2 ̆ 2 Tin Cat 2 ̆ 2 ™ (Woodstream Corp.) and 2 ̆ 2 Ketch-all 2 ̆ 2 l|v 1 (Kness Mfg. Co.) - - has shown they areabout equal in effectiveness as in the field test they caught 36 and 37 mice respectively.
