40|$|The 22 -kilodalton glycoprotein, {{expressed}} in the rat ventral prostate {{under the influence of}} androgens, is structurally a cystatin-related protein (CRP), as has been shown by copy DNA sequencing. In fact, two slightly different forms (CRP- 1 and CRP- 2) are {{expressed in}} the prostate; one of them (CRP- 1) is also {{expressed in the}} <b>exorbital</b> <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland.</b> In both glands, the CRP- 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) s are androgen regulated. Moreover, androgens also influence the size of these mRNAs, which show marked heterogeneity (from 760 - 950 nucleotides). Indeed, the smaller forms are predominant in castrated animals, whereas the large forms are observed immediately after androgen induction. Hybridization with oligo(dT) followed by ribonuclease H treatment revealed that differences in length of the poly(A) -tail are responsible for this effect of androgens. Indeed, two well defined forms of CRP mRNA subsisted after removal of the poly(A) -tail by this treatment. In the less abundant shorter form (CRP- 1 DELTA), 123 nucleotides are deleted by alternative splicing at the junction between the third and the fourth exon. The variant mRNA encodes a truncated protein, wherein the last 27 amino acids are replaced by a hydrophobic stretch of 8 amino acids. No alternative splicing was observed for the CRP- 2 mRNA. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Histopathological {{parameters}} of the main <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland</b> from patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS 1) were investigated, and the relation between morphological and immunohistochemical changes in the innervation of <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland</b> in patients with SS 1, {{as well as the}} immunopathological differences between SS 1, non-autoimmune keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) and controls were analysed. METHODS: <b>Lachrymal</b> <b>glands</b> from patients with SS 1, KCS and control subjects were biopsied and examined using standard transmission electron microscopic techniques and an immunohistochemical method (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-VIP). RESULTS: Moderate numbers of myelinated and non-myelinated nerve fibres were found in the connective tissue around <b>lachrymal</b> <b>glands</b> in patients with SS 1. Non-myelinated nerve fibres made contact with glandular epithelium, myoepithelial cells, vascular endothelium, plasma cells and fibroblasts. Patients with non-immunological KCS had similar characteristics as SS 1 in number and activity, showing a normal morphological pattern. Control subjects showed a higher number of active nerve fibres. CONCLUSION: Main <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland</b> from patients with SS 1 were therefore definitively innervated with moderate activity and normal structures. The ultrastructural study demonstrated there were no statistical differences with respect to patients with non-autoimmune KCS. Immunohistochemical studies showed a similar VIP activity in <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland</b> between patients with SS 1 and KCS, but there was a significant decrease in the innervation activity with regard to control subjects. All this implies that the autoimmunological factor in patients with SS 1 does not significantly affect the <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland</b> innervation. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} scintigraphic, immunohistological and ultrastructural changes associated with radiation-induced dysfunction of the <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland</b> in an established experimental animal model. Ten rabbits were randomized into two groups and used for the study; in the control as well as experimental group, the Schirmer-test, <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland</b> scintigraphy, and immunohistological and ultrastructural investigations were carried out prior to irradiation and 72 h as well as 1 month after single-dose irradiation with 15 Gy. Seventy-two hours after irradiation, secretion reduction evaluated by the Schirmer-test was evident. At this phase, we could observe a decrease in the expression of α-SMA and a re-distribution of tenascin-C matrix. Ultrastructural changes of acinar and myoepithelial cells were noticed; simultaneously, disturbance in the primary 99 mTcO 4 – uptake as well as significant reduction of the lachrymal ejection fraction was assessed scintigraphically. These changes were still evident 1 month following irradiation but became less intensive. Single-dose irradiation with 15 Gy implicates a functional impairment of the <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland,</b> which is associated with early immunohistological and ultrastructural alterations. These changes may represent objective surrogate parameters for radiogenic dysfunction and prerequisites for further investigations on radioprotection of <b>lachrymal</b> <b>glands</b> during radiotherapy of the periorbital region...|$|R
40|$|Alymphoplasia (aly) mice {{are thought}} to provide a new model for {{systemic}} Sjogren's syndrome (SS), since they reveal remarkable infiltration of mononuclear cells into salivary <b>glands,</b> <b>lachrymal</b> <b>glands</b> and kidneys, and show histological findings {{similar to those in}} patients with SS. Cell transfer experiments demonstrate that T cells induce the infiltration of mononuclear cells into several tissues in aly mice. To analyse the pathogenesis of cell infiltration in various tissues, we examined T-cell receptor (TCR) V/? usage of T cells in salivary <b>glands,</b> <b>lachrymal</b> <b>glands</b> and kidneys from aly mice, using family-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) methods. The results of SSCP demonstrated that the infiltrating T cells in the three organs expanded clonally, suggesting that they proliferate by antigen-driven stimulation. Some TCR V/? genes (V/Jl, 3, 6, 11, 12, 16) were commonly used in salivary <b>glands,</b> <b>lachrymal</b> <b>glands</b> and kidneys, while the V/ 37 gene was specifically expressed in kidneys. SSCP also showed that there were a few shared T-cell clones (V/J 3 - and V/? 6 -positive cells) among the three tissues. Indeed, sequence analysis of accumulated T cells showed that a conserved amino acid (leucine) at position 98 in the TCR V/? complementary determining region (CDR) 3 was detected in all organs at high frequency (41 - 57 %) and the amino acid sequence motif (LG) was specifically conserved at a frequency of 32 % in the three organs. In conclusion, T cells that infiltrate into <b>lachrymal</b> <b>glands,</b> salivary glands and kidneys of aly mutant mice might recognize shared common epitopes in all thre...|$|R

It is a question of B-cell neoplasm with extranodal origin, and with invariable prolonged localization, indicating indolent malignancy. It is believed that this type of lymphoproliferative neoplasm is triggered by chronic antigenic stimulation. This is supported by the observation that this type of extranodal lymphoma is frequently found in regions affected by chronic inflammation, such as mucosa of the stomach, the respiratory tract, {{as well as of the}} salivary and the thyroid glands. It is not common in the breasts, liver, kidneys, and gallbladder. Primary orbital lymphomas account for 5 - 14 % of all extranodal lymphomas. The most commonly involved orbital tissue structures are: conjunctiva, the eyelids, and retrobulbar tissue, while the development of the disease in the <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland</b> is extremely rare.

40|$|Background: Peripheral B-cell {{lymphoma}} of {{the marginal}} zone (MALT, low-grade), presenting as localized, extranodal dis-ease, usually affects the elderly. The gastrointestinal tract {{is the most}} frequently involved extranodal location, representing 70 % of all MALT lymphomas. Recently, numerous other extranodal sites involved by MALT lymphomas have also been described. Patients and methods: From January 1990 to October 1995, 24 patients with untreated nongastrointestinal low-grade MALT lymphoma were submitted to treatments ranging from the local approach of radiotherapy and local a-interferon (a-IFN) administration to chemotherapy. The tumours were located in the lung (seven cases), conjunctiva (four cases), <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland</b> and orbital soft tissue (four cases), salivary glands (three cases), skin (three cases), breast (two cases), and thyroid (one case). All patients had low-grade stage IE tumours. Results: Chemotherapy was administered in 11 patients (six with lung, three with salivary gland, one with breast, and one with thyroid locations); radiation therapy was employed in seven patients (three with <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland,</b> three with skin, and one with breast locations); local a-IFN administration was administered in five patients (four with conjunctival, and one with <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland</b> sites); and surgery was employed in one patient with a lung tumour. All patients achieved complete remissions; three local recurrences and two relapses in other sites were observed.

Fas ligand expression by lymphocytes infiltrating the <b>lachrymal</b> <b>glands</b> and by peripheral blood monocytes in Sjögren's syndrome patients with enlarged exocrine glands was assessed immunohistologically and by immunoblotting. Cytotoxicity of peripheral blood monocytes and sensitivity to steroids in Sjögren's syndrome patients with enlarged exocrine glands were studied by functional assay. Minimal Fas ligand expression was detected in the lymphocytes of the <b>lachrymal</b> <b>glands</b> and a decreased level of Fas ligand was found in peripheral blood monocytes as assessed by immunoblotting. Functional assay confirmed the decreased cytotoxicity of lymphocytes in Sjögren's syndrome patients with enlarged exocrine glands, and that it is not affected by anti-Fas ligand antibody. By contrast, the sensitivity of lymphocytes in Sjögren's syndrome patients with enlarged exocrine glands to steroids was increased.

40|$|PURPOSE: Nongastrointestinal {{locations}} represent about 30 % to 40 % of all low-grade mucosa-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} (MALT) lymphomas. We report {{a retrospective analysis}} of 75 patients with nongastrointestinal low-grade MALT lymphoma, presenting their clinical, therapeutic, and follow-up data {{with respect to the}} initial location of the lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1988 to October 1997, 75 patients with untreated nongastrointestinal low-grade MALT lymphoma were subjected to treatments ranging from local radiotherapy and local interferon alfa administration to chemotherapy. The lymphomas were located in the lung (19 patients), orbital soft tissue (16 patients), skin (seven patients), thyroid (seven patients), <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland</b> (six patients), conjunctiva (six patients), salivary gland (six patients), breast (three patients), eyelid (two patients), larynx (one patient), bone marrow (one patient), and trachea (one patient). RESULTS: Complete and partial remissions were achieved in 59 (79 %) and 16 (21 %) of the 75 patients, respectively, with an overall response rate of 100 %. All but two of the patients are still alive, with a median follow-up of 47 months; these two patients died from other causes. The estimated time to treatment failure rate is 30 % at 5 years.

We have shown that these five mRNAs are coded by five distinct genes, MUP I through V. In the present communication, we examine the expression of MUP genes {{in all of the}} six tissues in which MUP mRNAs are synthesized, the mammary, parotid, sublingual, <b>lachrymal,</b> and submaxillary <b>glands</b> and the liver. We show that gene MUP II is expressed in the liver and in the mammary gland, that gene MUP IV is expressed in the <b>lachrymal</b> and parotid <b>glands,</b> and that gene MUP V is expressed in the submaxillary, sublingual, and <b>lachrymal</b> and parotid <b>glands,</b> and that gene MUP V is expressed in the submaxillary, sublingual, and <b>lachrymal</b> <b>glands.</b> Furthermore, we present evidence that in addition to genes MUP I through V, another gene, MUP VI, is expressed in BALB/c mice in the parotid gland. The tissue-specific synthesis of MUP mRNAs is thus brought about by two major mechanisms: the expression, in different tissues, of different members of the family and the expression of a single gene at various levels in different tissues. When a particular MUP gene is expressed in several tissues, transcripts of this gene initiate at the same site and are spliced and polyadenylated in the same manner...|$|R

In rats where serum 91 c IgA concentrations had built up to 0. 3 mg/ml or more, unstimulated tears contained 91 c antibody activity of a molecular weight range that corresponded to that of the polymeric sizes of IgA, and was associated with secretory component. The concentrations of IgA in tear samples were about 0. 3 % of those in matched serum samples. Thus, a plasma contribution is made to the IgA in tears, but greater than 99 % of the tear IgA is synthesized locally in the <b>lachrymal</b> <b>gland...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cytokines play {{a central}} role in the {{regulation}} of immunity and are often found to be deregulated in autoimmune diseases. Sjögren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and loss of secretory function of the salivary and <b>lachrymal</b> <b>glands.</b> This review highlights the current knowledge of the expression and the function of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines both locally and systemically in Sjögren's syndrome patients. In the salivary glands, saliva and serum of these patients, many pro-inflammatory cytokines are upregulated. Concomitantly, most anti-inflammatory cytokines are not detectable or are expressed at low levels. Besides a role in inflammation, cytokines are also thought to be involved in salivary gland dysfunction by directly interfering with the epithelial cells in the glands. Future research on the role of novel cytokines in Sjögren's syndrome in combination with a better understanding of the effect of cytokines on exocrine dysfunction will aide the identification of the best therapeutic targets for Sjögren's syndrom...|$|R
