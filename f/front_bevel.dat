50|$|Single bevel knives are knives {{made in the}} Japanese {{tradition}} and have an omote (front or face on the right for right-handers), a shinogi (where the <b>front</b> <b>bevel</b> meets the flat of the blade face), and a urasuki (backside hollow to release food). These knives are usually a little thicker at the spine and body than Japanese double bevels but are thinner right behind the edge. They leave a better surface finish but the produce must bend a further distance due to the thickness. These are the knives of the established traditional Japanese cuisine and were originally developed from double bevel knives from China. They are sharpened along the single bevel by applying pressure to the shinogi to raise it and to the edge. Honbadzuke is the initial sharpening to form a flat surface along {{the perimeter of the}} urasuki to strengthen it, straighten the backside, and lay geometry for future sharpening. The omote is sharpened much more than the urasuki {{in order to maintain the}} function of the single bevel. Kansai style knives usually have pointed tip for use standing up (which helps in decorative tip work) and Edo style knives have a square tip for use sitting down (which makes a more robust working knife). The standard Japanese knife kit includes the yanagiba, deba, and usuba. They are essential to Washoku (Japanese cuisine).|$|E

5000|$|The Rosario, FM90 and FM95 {{models are}} {{manufactured}} by FM. The Rosario {{is an almost}} exact copy of the Mark II intended for Argentine and Latin American sales. The FM90 was an export model based on the Mark II, but with a [...] "Colt style" [...] slide without the characteristic <b>bevelled</b> <b>front</b> end, first made in 1990. Rubberized pistol grips (similar to the Pachmayr grips used for P35s) with finger grooves were used {{in place of the}} traditional slabside wood grips. The FM95 was the current export model (until 2002) based on the Mark III, also with the [...] "Colt style" [...] slide. The last models, until 2010, are the M02 AR (modernised version of the M95, with a new single-action system by Fabrique nationale) and the M03 AR (not dated 2003, as it would seem, actually a [...]40S&W version of M02 AR) with their Detective versions.|$|R
