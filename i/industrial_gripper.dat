The SPRG {{has been shown to}} be a high performance gripper for industrial robots. It has a precise wide throw and at the same time, it is light, simple, compact, rugged, and jam-proof against side loads. Originated at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), this gripper is undergoing further development at NASA/GSFC in pursuit of two goals: as a potential gripper for robots in space and as the basis for sensory-interactive <b>industrial</b> <b>gripper</b> as part of NASA's technology utilization program.

40|$|Main factors {{influencing}} modern industrial processes are competition in a glob-al market {{and more and}} more customized products. Thanks to new technolo-gies, the idea of the "next day delivery" is becoming a standand for all kind of customers. This requires more flexible, automated and efficient processes. In fact, industrial robots play a fundamental role: they {{are becoming more and more}} "smarter", faster, less expensive and "collaborative". Therefore, it is clear how the link between the robots use and the integration of manipulation devices is extremely tight. In fact, a correct and smart manipulation allows more effec-tive, efficient and sustainable industrial processes. The present paper presents an innovative <b>industrial</b> <b>gripper,</b> called "QuBu Grip-per". It shows all steps that have interested the design process and it is focused on the experimental results obtained. The main function of this gripper is to manipulate products belonging to the family "oil ring seals" within an automat-ed robotic molding cell.

40|$|Many {{universal}} grippers and {{robotic hands}} {{have been developed}} in the past. In order to be usable for various tasks they are usually very flexible and dexterous with many degrees of freedom. However, they are usually not suitable for application in industry.

40|$|Various robotic {{grippers}} {{support or}} even replace human beings on particular tasks, for example, different industrial applications. However, {{in some cases}} complex tasks are required and specifications of the <b>industrial</b> <b>gripper</b> should be more advanced. The adjustment for dynamic environment should be done automatically without a human intervention in a control process. The aim of this master’s project {{was to develop a}} control software system for given mechanical gripper prototype developed in the AASS research lab. Gripper control program was implemented by using Galil motion control hardware and Galil specific low-level programming language. Gripper was equipped with tactile sensors on fingertips to adjust a grasping behavior for objects with different shapes and sizes. In this thesis the control system for gripper device as well as its integration into the ``intelligent arm´´system was implemented. The ``intelligent arm´´system is an ABB IRB 140 industrial robotic manipulator with IRC 5 controller and motion capture system installed in the AASS research lab. Communication between Galil and IRC 5 controllers allowed the gripper to be managed by IRC 5. On the other hand, gripper could communicate its condition into IRC 5 and therefore affect the arm motions. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} the Pisa/IIT SoftHand, a novel robot hand prototype designed {{with the purpose}} of being robust and easy to control as an <b>industrial</b> <b>gripper,</b> while exhibiting high grasping versatility and an aspect {{similar to that of the}} human hand. In the paper we briefly review the main theoretical tools used to enable such simplification, i. e. the neuroscience-based notion of soft synergies. A discussion of several possible actuation schemes shows that a straightforward implementation of the soft synergy idea in an effective design is not trivial. The approach proposed in this paper, called adaptive synergy, rests on ideas coming from underactuated hand design. A synthesis method to realize a desired set of soft synergies through the principled design of adaptive synergy is discussed. This approach leads to the design of hands accommodating in principle an arbitrary number of soft synergies, as demonstrated in grasping and manipulation simulations and experiments with a prototype. As a particular instance of application of the synthesis method of adaptive synergies, the Pisa/IIT SoftHand is described in detail. The hand has 19 joints, but only uses 1 actuator to activate its adaptive synergy. Of particular relevance in its design is the very soft and safe, yet powerful and extremely robust structure, obtained through the use of innovative articulations and ligaments replacing conventional joint design. The design and implementation of the prototype hand are shown and its effectiveness demonstrated through grasping experiments, reported also in multimedia extensio...|$|E
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} gives {{designers and}} engineers a geometric design {{space for the}} product development that is almost without limits. More complex shapes can not only be thought off and designed but also manufactured. Back-cuts, joints or flexible areas can be manufactured at once, thus presenting the opportunity {{to reduce the amount}} of products to be assembled as well as assembly time. With the new manufacturing processes we can move faster and more direct towards solutions for technical problems initially being difficult to manufacture or requiring complex assemblies. This includes not only complex outer shapes but also functional inner structures which can be integrated into the challenging lightweight products of the future. The Fraunhofer IPA is concentrating on the research and systematic development of possibilities that will arise by these new manufacturing processes introduced as processes in industrial scale and quality. One of the main goals of these efforts is to find and define solutions and functions with the possibility to be integrated directly in products. Achieving this goal will also increase the value of the manufactured products. This paper is presenting examples and alternative solution for various <b>industrial</b> <b>gripper</b> types currently on the market. The examples were developed with additive manufacturing in mind. The applicable functions of the traditional grippers were investigated in order to find alternative designs and layouts to produce a gripper fulfilling the same purpose but being manufactured in one step and consisting of one piece. This is only possible using additive manufacturing. Some of these examples are already saleable products being offered by the partners to the industry illustrating the viability of additive manufacturing as being a growing alternative to conventional manufacturing methods...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a robot system, which {{combines}} a parallel manipulator with an adjustable gripper. The robot {{is able to}} grasp objects with different sizes and shapes without using an additional gripper. It consists of several fingers with contact elements which can be moved independently from each other to grasp the object. After grasping, adhesion forces, provided, e. g. by an electromagnet or a vacuum cup, ensure that the fingertips remain connected to the object to be manipulated. The resulting closed-loop mechanism, formed by the fingers of the robot and the object, features a kinematic structure {{similar to that of}} parallel manipulators. The Robot is now able to achieve manipulation of objects with six degrees of freedom by actuating exactly six joints. Such a parallel robot – gripper combination has many advantages over existing <b>industrial</b> <b>grippers,</b> often used for simple gripping tasks, existing mechanical hands with costly control architecture and parallel manipulators with fixed kinematic parameters...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} {{technological}} advances, researchers have {{lost sight of}} robotic grippers/end effectors design intent. In a semi-structured environment the biomimetic approach is impractical due to the high complexity of the mechanism and control algorithms. Current <b>industrial</b> <b>grippers</b> are robust, but lack the flexibility that allows for in hand manipulation. The authors believe that underactuated grippers provide the best approach to allow for in hand manipulation along with being rugged enough for an industrial setting. Thinking of the robotic gripper and the robotic arm as one system (as opposed to two separate subsystems), one is capable of using the degrees of freedom of the robot in conjunction {{with that of the}} gripper to provide the desired motion profile without the complexity of running two subsystems. This paper will outline where recent grippers have failed and will introduce a new design paradigm for grippers along with several underactuated gripper ideas. This paper was presented at the IFToMM/ASME International Workshop on Underactuated Grasping (UG 2010), 19 August 2010, Montréal, Canada. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design {{possibilities}} concerning {{the next generation of}} advanced Robots. Aim of the work is to study, analyse and realise artificial systems that are essentially simple, performing and robust and can live and coexist with humans. The main design guideline followed in doing so is the Soft Robotics Approach, that implies the design of systems with intrinsic mechanical compliance in their architecture. The first part of the thesis addresses design of new soft robotics actuators, or robotic muscles. At the beginning are provided information about what a robotic muscle is and what is needed to realise it. A possible classification of these systems is analysed and some criteria useful for their comparison are explained. After, a set of functional specifications and parameters is identified and defined, to characterise a specific subset of this kind of actuators, called Variable Stiffness Actuators. The selected parameters converge in a data-sheet that easily defines performance and abilities of the robotic system. A complete strategy for the design and realisation of this kind of system is provided, which takes into account their me- chanical morphology and architecture. As consequence of this, some new actuators are developed, validated and employed in the execution of complex experimental tasks. In particular the actuator VSA-Cube and its add-on, a Variable Damper, are developed as the main com- ponents of a robotics low-cost platform, called VSA-CubeBot, that v can be used as an exploratory platform for multi degrees of freedom experiments. Experimental validations and mathematical models of the system employed in multi degrees of freedom tasks (bimanual as- sembly and drawing on an uneven surface), are reported. The second part of the thesis is about the design of multi fingered hands for robots. In this part of the work the Pisa-IIT SoftHand is introduced. It is a novel robot hand prototype designed with the purpose of being as easily usable, robust and simple as an <b>industrial</b> <b>gripper,</b> while exhibiting a level of grasping versatility and an aspect comparable to that of the human hand. In the thesis the main theo- retical tool used to enable such simplification, i. e. the neuroscience– based notion of soft synergies, are briefly reviewed. The approach proposed rests on ideas coming from underactuated hand design. A synthesis method to realize a desired set of soft synergies through the principled design of adaptive underactuated mechanisms, which is called the method of adaptive synergies, is discussed. This ap- proach leads to the design of hands accommodating in principle an arbitrary number of soft synergies, as demonstrated in grasping and manipulation simulations and experiments with a prototype.

The design and implementation of the prototype hand are shown and its effec- tiveness demonstrated through grasping experiments. Finally, control of the Pisa/IIT Hand is considered.

A hierarchical ring and tree data structure has been designed and implemented to comprehensively represent these motion pairs and to simulate their performance.

In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} state of the art in tactile sensing for mechatronics. We define a tactile sensor as a device or system that can measure a given {{property}} of an object or contact event through physical contact between the sensor and the object. We consider any property that can be measured through contact, including the shape of an object, texture, temperature, hardness, moisture content, etc. A comprehensive search of the literature revealed that there was a significant increase in publications on tactile sensing from 1991 onwards. Considerable effort in the 1980 s was spent investigating transduction techniques and developing new sensors, whilst emphasis in more recent research has focused on experiments using tactile sensors to perform a variety of tasks. This paper reports on progress in tactile sensing in the following areas: cutaneous sensors, sensing fingers, soft materials, <b>industrial</b> robot <b>grippers,</b> multifingered hands, probes and whiskers, analysis of sensing devices, haptic perception, processing sensory data and new application areas. We conclude that the predominant choice of transduction method is piezoelectric, with arrays using resistive or capacitive sensing. We found that increased emphasis on understanding tactile sensing and perception issues has opened up potential for new application areas. The predicted growth in applications in industrial automation has not eventuated. New applications for tactile sensing including surgery, rehabilitation and service robotics, and food processing automation show considerable potential and are now receiving significant levels of research attention.

40|$|A {{microprocessor-based}} controller {{has been}} developed that continuously monitors and adjusts the gripping force applied by a special two-finger gripper. This computerized force sensing gripper system enables the endeffector gripping action to be independently detected and corrected. The gripping force applied to a manipulated object is real-time monitored for problem situations, situations which can occur during both planned and errant robot arm manipulation. When unspecified force conditions occur at the gripper, the gripping force controller initiates specific reactions to cause dynamic corrections to the continuously variable gripping action. The force controller for this intelligent gripper has been interfaced to the controller of an <b>industrial</b> robot. The <b>gripper</b> and robot controllers communicate to accomplish the successful completion of normal gripper operations as well as unexpected hazardous situations.

40|$|The {{ability of}} stable {{grasping}} and fine manipulation with the multi-fingered robot hand with required precision and dexterity is playing {{an increasingly important}} role in the applications like service robots, rehabilitation, humanoid robots, entertainment robots, industries etc [...] A number of multi-fingered robotic hands have been developed by various researchers in the past. The distinct advantages of a multi-fingered robot hand having structural similarity with human hand motivate the need for an anthropomorphic robot hand. Such a hand provides a promising base for supplanting human hand in execution of tedious, complicated and dangerous tasks, especially in situations such as manufacturing, space, undersea etc. These can also be used in orthopaedic rehabilitation of humans for improving the quality of the life of people having orthopedically and neurological disabilities. The developments so far are mostly driven by the application requirements. There are a number of bottlenecks with <b>industrial</b> <b>grippers</b> as regards to the stability of grasping objects of irregular geometries or complex manipulation operations. A multi-fingered robot hand can be made to mimic the movements of a human hand. The present piece of research work attempts to conceptualize and design a multi-fingered, anthropomorphic robot hand by structurally imitating the human hand. In the beginning, a brief idea about the history, types of robotic hands and application of multi-fingered hands in various fields are presented. A review of literature based on different aspects of the multi-fingered hand like structure, control, optimization, gasping etc. is made. Some of the important and more relevant literatures are elaborately discussed and a brief analysis is made on the outcomes and shortfalls with respect to multi-fingered hands. Based on the analysis of the review of literature, the research work aims at developing an improved anthropomorphic robot hand model in which apart from the four fingers and a thumb, the palm arch effect of human hand is also considered to increase its dexterity. A robotic hand with five anthropomorphic fingers including the thumb and palm arch effect having 25 degrees-of-freedom in all is investigated in the present work. Each individual finger is considered as an open loop kinematic chain and each finger segment is considered as a link of the manipulator. The wrist of the hand is considered as a fixed point. The kinematic analyses of the model for both forward kinematics and inverse kinematic are carried out. The trajectories of the tip positions of the thumb and the fingers with respect to local coordinate system are determined and plotted. This gives the extreme position of the fingertips which is obtained from the forward kinematic solution with the help of MATLAB. Similarly, varying all the joint iv angles of the thumb and fingers in their respective ranges, the reachable workspace of the hand model is obtained. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is used for solving the inverse kinematic problem of the fingers. Since the multi-fingered hand grasps the object mainly through its fingertips and the manipulation of the object is facilitated by the fingers due to their dexterity, the grasp is considered to be force-closure grasp. The grasping theory and different types of contacts between the fingertip and object are presented and the conditions for stable and equilibrium grasp are elaborately discussed. The proposed hand model is simulated to grasp five different shaped objects with equal base dimension and height. The forces applied on the fingertip during grasping are calculated. The hand model is also analysed using ANSYS to evaluate the stresses being developed at various points in the thumb and fingers. This analysis was made for the hand considering two different hand materials i. e. aluminium alloy and structural steel. The solution obtained from the forward kinematic analysis of the hand determines the maximum size for differently shaped objects while the solution to the inverse kinematic problem indicates the configurations of the thumb and the fingers inside the workspace of the hand. The solutions are predicted in which all joint angles are within their respective ranges. The results of the stress analysis of the hand model show that the structure of the fingers and the hand as a whole is capable of handling the selected objects. The robot hand under investigation can be realized and can be a very useful tool for many critical areas such as fine manipulation of objects, combating orthopaedic or neurological impediments, service robotics, entertainment robotics etc. The dissertation concludes with a summary of the contribution and the scope of further work...|$|R
