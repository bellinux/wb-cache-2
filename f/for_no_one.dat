25|$|The Memorial, held after sunset, {{includes}} a {{talk on the}} meaning of the celebration and the circulation among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe the bread symbolizes Jesus Christ's body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine symbolizes his blood which redeems from sin. They do not believe in transubstantiation or consubstantiation. Because many congregations have no members who claim to be anointed, it is common <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to partake of the bread and wine.|$|E
25|$|Protestants {{perceived}} Roman Catholic salvation to {{be dependent}} upon the grace of God and the merits of one's own works. The reformers posited that salvation is a gift of God (i.e., God's act of free grace), dispensed by the Holy Spirit owing to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ alone. Consequently, they argued that a sinner is not accepted by God {{on account of the}} change wrought in the believer by God's grace, and that the believer is accepted without regard for the merit of his works, <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> deserves salvation.|$|E
25|$|It once {{happened}} in that country (and this seems indeed strange) that a living creature {{was caught in the}} forest as to which no one could say definitely whether it was a man or some other animal; <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> could get a word from it or be sure that it understood human speech. It had the human shape, however, in every detail, both as to hands and face and feet; but the entire body was covered with hair as the beasts are, and down the back it had a long coarse mane like that of a horse, which fell to both sides and trailed along the ground when the creature stooped in walking.|$|E

25|$|This {{could be}} a reason why {{environmental}} Kuznets curves {{have been found to}} be applicable to only certain types of pollutants. Yandle et al. argue that the EKC has not been found to apply to carbon because most pollutants create localized problems like lead and sulfur, so there is a greater urgency and response to cleaning up such pollutants. As a country develops, the marginal value of cleaning up such pollutants makes a large direct improvement to the quality of citizens' lives. Conversely, reducing carbon dioxide emissions does not have a dramatic impact at a local level, so the impetus to clean them up is only for the altruistic reason of improving the global environment. This becomes a tragedy of the commons where it is most efficient for everyone to pollute and <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to clean up, and everyone is worse as a result (Hardin, 1968). Thus, even in a country like the US with a high level of income, carbon emissions are not decreasing in accordance with the EKC.|$|E

Apart from the enthusiastic {{reports in the}} Daily Chronicle and the Illustrated London News—which each had a financial stake in Amundsen's success—the Manchester Guardian remarked that any cause for reproach was wiped out by the Norwegians' courage and determination. Readers of Young England were exhorted not to grudge [...] "the brave Norseman" [...] the honour he had earned, and The Boy's Own Paper suggested that every British boy should read Amundsen's expedition account. The Times correspondent offered a mild rebuke to Amundsen for his failure to inform Scott {{until it was too}} late for the latter to respond, [...] "all the more unnecessary, <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would have welcomed co-operation in the work of South Polar exploration more than Captain Scott... Still, no one who knows Captain Amundsen can have any doubt of his integrity, and since he states he has reached the Pole we are bound to believe him".|$|E

500|$|Charles Hartshorne and Norman Malcolm are {{primarily}} responsible for introducing modal versions of the argument into the contemporary debate. Both claimed that Anselm had {{two versions of the}} ontological argument, the second of which was a modal logic version. According to James Harris, this version is represented by Malcolm thus:If it [...] can be conceived at all it must exist. <b>For</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> who denies or doubts the existence of a being a greater than which is inconceivable, denies or doubts that if it did exist its nonexistence, either in reality or in the understanding, would be impossible. For otherwise {{it would not be a}} being a greater than which cannot be conceived. But as to whatever can be conceived but does not exist: if it were to exist its nonexistence either in reality or in the understanding would be possible. Therefore, if a being a greater than which cannot be conceived, can even be conceived, it must exist.Hartshorne says that, for Anselm, [...] "necessary existence is a superior manner of existence to ordinary, contingent existence and that ordinary, contingent existence is a defect." [...] For Hartshorne, both Hume and Kant focused only upon whether what exists is greater than what does not exist. However, [...] "Anselm's point is that what exists and cannot not exist is greater than that which exists and can not exist." [...] This avoids the question of whether or not existence is a predicate.|$|E

2500|$|The modern word [...] "immunity" [...] {{derives from}} the Latin immunis, meaning {{exemption}} from military service, tax payments or other public services. The first written descriptions {{of the concept of}} immunity may have been made by the Athenian Thucydides who, in 430 BC, described that when the plague hit Athens: [...] "the sick and the dying were tended by the pitying care of those who had recovered, because they knew the course of the disease and were themselves free from apprehensions. <b>For</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was ever attacked a second time, or not with a fatal result". The term [...] "immunes", is also found in the epic poem [...] "Pharsalia" [...] written around 60 B.C. by the poet Marcus Annaeus Lucanus to describe a North African tribe's resistance to snake venom.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars though have {{disagreements}} {{about the}} end for which the Platonic theory is used. In [...] "the usual interpretation of an elliptical construction," [...] the ending couplet expresses further praise [...] for the youth, seeming to say that while all things beautiful are shades of the youth, the youth like nothing else, is distinguished by a constant, faithful heart. Considering the sonnets expressing betrayal in Sonnets 40-42, this sonnet extolling the youth's constancy seems absurd for some scholars and is problematic. Seymour-Smith suggests that the last line should be interpreted: [...] "you feel affection <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>one,</b> and no one admires you for the virtue of constancy". Duncan Jones agrees and suggests that the word [...] "but" [...] {{at the beginning of}} the closing line radically changes all that has gone before and marks a turn to a more critical perspective.|$|E
2500|$|Sufis {{believe the}} sharia (exoteric [...] "canon"), tariqa (esoteric [...] "order") and haqiqa ("truth") are {{mutually}} interdependent. Sufism leads the adept, called salik or [...] "wayfarer", in his sulûk or [...] "road" [...] through different stations (maqaam) until he reaches his goal, the perfect tawhid, the existential confession that God is One. Ibn Arabi says, [...] "When we see someone in this Community {{who claims to}} be able to guide others to God, but is remiss in but one rule of the Sacred Law—even if he manifests miracles that stagger the mind—asserting that his shortcoming is a special dispensation for him, we do not even turn to look at him, for such a person is not a sheikh, nor is he speaking the truth, <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> is entrusted with the secrets of God Most High save one in whom the ordinances of the Sacred Law are preserved.
