It {{consists of two}} metal bellows with an <b>intermediate</b> <b>pipe</b> and connectors on both sides. As a special form of the axial expansion joint, the universal expansion joint has only a limited pressure resistance for stability reasons and, moreover, loads the adjacent pipe supports with the axial compressive force resulting from the internal pressure. It is usually used to compensate large axial and lateral movements at low pressure.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{water closet}} or toilet utilises a cistern to reserve {{and hold the}} correct amount of water {{required}} to flush the toilet bowl. In earlier toilets, the cistern was located high above the toilet bowl and connected to it by a long pipe. It was necessary to pull a hanging chain connected to a release valve located inside the cistern in order to flush the toilet. Modern toilets may be close coupled, with the cistern mounted directly on the toilet bowl and no <b>intermediate</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this arrangement, the flush mechanism (lever or push button) is usually mounted on the cistern. Concealed cistern toilets, where the cistern {{is built into the}} wall behind the toilet, are also available. A flushing trough is a type of cistern used to serve more than one WC pan at one time. These cisterns are becoming less common however. The cistern was the genesis of the modern bidet.|$|E
40|$|Problems {{have been}} {{reported}} for very high downflows in small and <b>intermediate</b> <b>pipes</b> in the bubbly and slug flow regimes. When the flow rate is near critical, the calculated mass flow rate depends strongly on the flow orientation for small and <b>intermediate</b> <b>pipes,</b> whereas the flow rate is nearly independent of flow direction for large pipes. At very high flow rates, the flow {{is expected to be}} nearly homogenous and hence to be nearly independent of flow direction. The flow rates calculated by RELAP 5 - 3 D agree with this expectation except for downflow in small and <b>intermediate</b> <b>pipes,</b> where the calculated flows in the downward direction are about 20 % lower than the flows in the upward and horizontal directions. The problem was traced to an extrapolation of the EPRI drift flux correlation beyond the range of its database. The problem was corrected by creating a very high downflow regime. The EPRI correlation is replaced by the Zuber-Findlay churn turbulent and Kataoka-Ishii drift flux correlations in the very high downflow regime for small and <b>intermediate</b> <b>pipes...</b>|$|R

The speed of band propagation {{is proportional to the}} temperature (lower temp lower speeds, higher temp higher speeds). Often time the critical stain will first decrease due to temperature.The temperature effect on PLC regime is causes by the increased ability of the solutes to diffuse to the dislocations with increasing temperature. Although the mechanism of diffusion is not entirely defined, it is believed that solute atoms diffuse by either volume (high temperatures), diffusion in stacking fault ribbon between partial dislocations (<b>intermediate)</b> or <b>pipe</b> diffusion(low temperature).|$|R

Indeed, the recent advances in the microfluidics of gas lead the scientific community to the question of scaling law in supersonic regime. Thus, in this paper, we simulate the flow induced by the opening of a small solenoid valve to know if it is able to generate a minishock wave. This shock wave moving in an <b>intermediate</b> <b>pipe</b> could be transmitted into a micro one. In this work, we focus on the flow in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>pipe</b> and on the properties of the transmitted wave into the microchannel. Three geometry of convergent between intermediate and micropipe are investigated. We have compared the results of our simulation to the classical analytical models dealing with shock tubes. After presenting the geometries of the study case, we give the characteristics of our numerical approach, and then we describe our main results. In a last section, the flow generated by the valve used in free jet regime is described...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The triple {{concentric}} pipes {{heat exchanger}} is an improved version of double pipe heat exchanger. Most {{of the previous}} study on the heat exchanger is confined to two fluids and few of many possible flow arrangements. The present study involves the sizing of triple concentric pipes heat exchanger where in two cold water streams flow through the central tube and outer annular space at same mass flow rates and same inlet temperatures in co-current direction while hot water flows through inner annular space in counter-current direction. This paper proposes a basic procedure for calculating overall heat transfer coefficients and length of triple concentric pipes heat exchanger. Length of triple pipe heat exchanger is computed for a required temperature drop of hot water with available dimensions of three pipes by LMTD method. Overall heat transfer coefficient and length of the equivalent double pipe heat exchanger are {{compared with that of}} the triple pipe heat exchanger. The theoretical analysis shows that introducing an <b>intermediate</b> <b>pipe</b> to the double pipe heat exchanger reduces effective length of heat exchanger, which results in savings in material and space. The triple concentric pipes heat exchanger provides large heat transfer area per unit heat exchanger length and better heat transfer efficiencies compared to double pipe heat exchanger...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) technique is employed to predict the flow of quenchant in a large quench tank. The characteristics of flow field in the existing quench tank are investigated, and the major deficiency occurred in the tank structure design is analyzed. Two different schemes for improving the tank structure design are brought forward, and further numerical simulations are carried out. Results show that the non-uniform flow field is generated throughout the quenching zone in the existing large quench tank. There is clear difference in flow rate in the regions near the inner surface of workpiece and the outer, which may cause the workpiece distortion and even cracking. Reduction in ring <b>pipe</b> <b>intermediate</b> diameter can not obviously enhance the uniformity of flow field in the quench tank. By adding an inner core in the center zone of the tank, the flow rate in the region near the inner surface of workpiece can be increased effectively, and the flow rate difference found in the quenching zone reduced significantly, which are beneficial to guarantee the quenching quality of workpiece...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. One {{of the problems of}} natural gas pressure reduction stations (City Gate Stations; CGS) is blocking the gas passage due to reduction of temperature in the regulator. In order to prevent this problem, gas is heated in a gas heater before pressure dropping. The gas heater includes, gas passage <b>pipes,</b> <b>intermediate</b> fluid and hot fluid passage pipes. Hot fluid is combustion products of an atmospheric burner and has high thermal energy. Since utilizing of porous media technology has many advantages in combustion systems, the idea of applying this type of burners instead of conventional burners has been widely considered. In this study, replacing of an atmospheric burner with a porous burner in the gas heater of a CGS has been studied numerically. First, by modelling the gas heater with an atmospheric burner, the values of produced heat fluxes at the different equivalence ratios have been studied. The results of these simulations determine the condition which leads to maximum efficiency of combustion in the atmospheric burner. The results indicate that maximum thermal efficiency of the atmospheric burner is obtained in 60 percent of the primary air. In the next step, by modelling the gas heater with a porous burner at various sizes and various equivalence ratios, produced heat fluxes were calculated and compared with those of the atmospheric burner. According to the results, although the gas heater of the pressure reduction station has not been designed for a porous burner, but utilizing a porous burner instead of the atmospheric burner, causes the thermal performance of the heater to increase. The increase of thennal performance at lean equivalence ratios is higher. ej 201...|$|R
40|$|Water {{is one of}} {{the most}} capable and widely used working fluids in heat pipes and thermosiphons. Aluminum is a high conductivity, lightweight, and high {{strength}} choice for heat pipe casing material. However, aluminum and water are a heat pipe combination that is not considered viable due to the rapid generation of hydrogen, a noncondensable gas (NCG), resulting from chemical reactions between water and aluminum. A great deal of past research has been done evaluating the compatibility of many pure fluids with different metal heat pipe casings, yielding a large volume of lifetime tests demonstrating success or failure of various combinations. On the other hand, very little research was found analyzing what, if any, progress can be made to take low compatibility combinations and make them more compatible through the use of chemical inhibitors. This is particularly true for the combination of water and aluminum. Recently, inorganic chemicals in an aqueous solution, with the proper concentrations and pH range, have been shown to suppress the unwanted reactions and subsequent hydrogen formation rates in a manner that could prove useful enough to allow aluminum heat pipe casings to operate with aqueous based solutions as a working fluid. 	The goal of this thesis is to produce, understand, and experimentally show the robustness of using inorganic inhibitors in aqueous heat pipe fluids for aluminum devices. Thermodynamic predictions were made to estimate conditions in which a stable oxide layer of the base metal, as well as the oxidizing inhibitors, will form within the pipe, thus giving a better chance at preventing NCG generation. E-pH, or Pourbaix, diagrams will be generated as a function of temperature to allow for prediction at any given heat pipe operating temperature range. Chemical reactions and processes responsible for NCG suppression will be explained. Inhibitor species’ concentrations will be investigated as an independent variable to determine recommended inhibitor amounts. Aluminum thermosiphons and heat pipes will be experimentally tested to verify efficacy of various inhibitor solutions in different thermosiphon geometries tested under different test conditions. Simple corrosion tests will also be carried out within a vacuumed chamber to determine relative amounts of hydrogen generated when an aluminum sample is in direct, static contact with a test fluid. The results of this thesis will show that while there is good evidence that inorganic inhibitors can significantly reduce the production of NCG in an aluminum-water heat pipe, the complex nature of two phase fluid circulation in such devices still presents serious challenges to the reliability and adoption of inhibitor fluids for critical thermal management needs. Reasons behind this phenomenon will be presented along with pathways for future research. These future work paths are believed to provide great opportunities for overcoming the challenges found in this work as well as potentially expanding the application of inhibiting heat pipe fluids to other active metals such as steel devices. The creation of a dilute aqueous solution which maintains the high latent heat of water but is also compatible with aluminum heat pipes would allow for significantly higher heat transport per device unit mass than currently used aluminum and ammonia heat pipes and provide another option for <b>intermediate</b> temperature heat <b>pipes</b> at low cost...|$|R
