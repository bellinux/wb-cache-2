5000|$|Sydney Chapman gave {{a correct}} {{description}} {{of the source of}} stratospheric ozone and its ability to generate heat within the stratosphere; he also wrote that ozone may be destroyed by reacting with atomic oxygen, making two molecules of molecular oxygen. We now know that there are additional ozone loss mechanisms, and that these mechanisms are catalytic meaning that a small amount of the catalyst can destroy a great number of ozone molecules. The first is due to the reaction of hydroxyl radicals OH· with ozone. OH is formed by the reaction of <b>electronically</b> <b>excited</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>atoms</b> produced by ozone photolysis, with water vapor. While the stratosphere is dry, additional water vapor is produced in situ by the photochemical oxidation of methane (CH4). The HO2 radical produced by the reaction of OH with O3 is recycled to OH by reaction with <b>oxygen</b> <b>atoms</b> or ozone. In addition, solar proton events can significantly effect ozone levels via Radiolysis with the subsequent formation of OH [...] Laughing gas or Nitrous oxide (N2O) is produced by biological activity at the surface and is oxidised to NO in the stratosphere; the so-called NOx radical cycles also deplete stratospheric ozone. Finally, chlorofluorocarbon molecules are photolysed in the stratosphere releasing chlorine atoms that react with ozone giving ClO and O2. The chlorine atoms are recycled when ClO reacts with O in the upper stratosphere, or when ClO reacts with itself in the chemistry of the Antarctic ozone hole. Paul J. Crutzen, Mario J. Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995 for their work describing the formation and decomposition of stratospheric ozone.|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} of atmospherically persistent (long-lived) greenhouse gases to the radiative forcing of Earth has {{increased over the}} past several decades. The impact of highly fluorinated saturated compounds, in particular perfluorinated compounds, on climate change is a concern because of their long atmospheric lifetimes, which are primarily determined by stratospheric loss processes, as well as their strong absorption in the infrared "window" region. A potentially key stratospheric loss process for these compounds is their gas-phase reaction with <b>electronically</b> <b>excited</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>atoms,</b> O(1 D). Therefore, accurate reaction rate coefficient data is desired for input to climate change models. In this work, rate coefficients, k, were measured for the reaction of O(1 D) with several key long-lived greenhouse gases, namely NF 3, SF 5 CF 3, CHF 3 (HFC- 23), C 2 F 6, c-C 4 F 8, n -C 5 F 12, and n -C 6 F 14. Room temperature rate coefficients for the total reaction, k Tot, corresponding to loss of O(1 D), and reactive channel, k R, corresponding to the loss of the reactant compound, were measured for NF 3 and SF 5 CF 3 using competitive reaction and relative rate methods, respectively. k R was measured for the CHF 3 reaction and improved upper-limits were determined for the perfluorinated compounds included in this study. For NF 3, k Tot was determined to be (2. 55 ± 0. 38) × 10 − 11 cm 3 molecule − 1 s − 1 and k R, which was measured using CF 3 Cl, N 2 O, CF 2 ClCF 2 Cl (CFC- 114), and CF 3 CFCl 2 (CFC- 114 a) as reference compounds, was determined to be (2. 21 ± 0. 33) × 10 − 11 cm 3 molecule − 1 s − 1 corresponding to a reactive branching ratio of 0. 87 ± 0. 13. For SF 5 CF 3, k Tot = (3. 24 ± 0. 50) × 10 − 13 cm 3 molecule − 1 s − 1 and k R − 14 cm 3 molecule − 1 s − 1 were measured, where k R is a factor of three lower than the current recommendation of k Tot for use in atmospheric modeling. For CHF 3, k R was determined to be (2. 35 ± 0. 35) × 10 − 12 cm 3 molecule − 1 s − 1, which corresponds to a reactive channel yield of 0. 26 ± 0. 04, and resolves a large discrepancy among previously reported values. The quoted uncertainties are 2 σ and include estimated systematic errors. Upper-limits for k R for the C 2 F 6, c-C 4 F 8, n -C 5 F 12, and n -C 6 F 14 reactions were determined to be 3. 0, 3. 5, 5. 0, and 16 (in units of 10 − 14 cm 3 molecule − 1 s − 1), respectively.

To understand the mechanisms of this effect, we studied the pressure dependence of this reaction. The oxidation rate was determined by measuring the amount of tritiated water formed as a function of irradiation time by use of a conventional liquid scintillation counter. It was found that the oxidation rate increased linearly with oxygen pressure in the range 0 ～ 160 Torr under a constant hydrogen pressure of 0. 7 Torr: namely, the reaction obeys the first order kinetics with respect to oxygen. This indicates that <b>excited</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>atoms,</b> O(3 P), formed with UV-photon irradiation play an important role for the enhancement of the oxidation. Hydrogen pressure dependence was examined with varying hydrogen pressure in the range from 0 ～ 5. 5 Torr under a constant pressure of 160 Torr. In this case, the amount of tritium used was kept constant. It was observed that the formation rate of tritiated water decreased with the increase in hydrogen pressure: the rate was approximately proportional to {[HT]/[H 2]} 1 / 2. Based on those observations, plausible mechanisms of the photon-induced oxidation of tritium gas in an oxygen atmosphere are discussed along with need for further systematic studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{activity of}} silver deposited Degussa P 25 titanium dioxide (Ag-​DP 25) in the photodegrdn. of methyl orange (MO) was investigated. The photocatalysts were characterized using PXRD, SEM, EDX, FTIR and UV-​vis spectrophotometer. The obtained {{results show that}} the silver (Ag 0) deposited TiO 2 exhibited visible light plasmon absorption band. The degrdn. expt. reveals that the catalytic property of Ag-​DP 25 in the degrdn. of MO is more efficient than that of com. available Degussa P 25 TiO 2 (DP 25) samples. The improvement of Ag-​DP 25 catalyst efficiency strongly depends on the content of silver (Ag) deposits. The present study shows that the degrdn. process is dominated by Ag-​TiO 2 photocatalytic system, complying with pseudo-​first order rate law. The higher rate of photodegrdn. obsd. on Ag-​DP 25 at pH 6. 6 can be correlated to the ratios of the concns. of the ionized to the neutral dye mols. and also to the higher concn. of hydroxylated surface, which are able to effectively scavenge photogenerated valence band holes. Accumulation of the holes in the semiconductor particles increases the probability of formation of <b>excited</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>atom</b> which is a reactive species readily oxidizing the org. dye mol. The redn. of pH {{during the course of the}} reaction is attributed to the complete mineralization of the dye...|$|R
