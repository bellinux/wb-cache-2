50|$|Measurement of {{the amount}} of drawing {{performed}} on a sheet metal blank is quantified using <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio.</b> The higher the <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio,</b> the more extreme the amount of deep drawing. Due to the geometry, forces, metal flow and material properties of the work, {{there is a limit to}} the amount of deep drawing that can be performed on a sheet metal blank in a single operation. The <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> is roughly calculated as,DR = Db/Dp.Db is the diameter of the blank and Dp is the diameter of the punch. For shapes that are noncircular the maximum diameter is sometimes used, or occasionally <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> is calculated using surface areas. The limit to the <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> for an operation is usually 2 or under.|$|E
50|$|The {{thinnest}} part thickness {{determines the}} maximum stress {{that can be}} transferred to the deformation zone. Due to material volume constancy, the flange thickens and results in blank holder contact at the outer boundary rather than on the entire surface. The maximum stress that can be safely transferred from the punch to the blank sets a limit on the maximum blank size (initial blank diameter in the case of rotationally symmetrical blanks). An indicator of material formability is the limiting <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> (LDR), defined as the ratio of the maximum blank diameter that can be safely drawn into a cup without flange to the punch diameter. Determination of the LDR for complex components is difficult and hence the part is inspected for critical areas for which an approximation is possible. During severe deep drawing the material work hardens and {{it may be necessary to}} anneal the parts in controlled atmosphere ovens to restore the original elasticity of the material.|$|E

For example, for PET and PA- 6, the <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio,</b> λ, {{does not depend on}} temperature and drawing rate (Godovsky 1992). However, at high drawing rates (> 100  mm/min), an increase in the <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio,</b> λ, was observed for PET and PP (Liu and Harrison 1988; Bazhenov 2011). An increase in λ with temperature was observed for PC (Chiang et al. 2013) and HDPE (Serenko et al. 2003).

A model of a rigid fiber rotating in an elongational flow field was used to describe the effect of <b>draw</b> <b>ratio</b> on the final orientation distribution.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} of the present work is to study the influence of sheet thickness on blank holding forceand limiting <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Variation in blankholding force and limiting <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> in deep drawing ofmetal foils were evaluated by calculation. Findings: The paper shows variation in the blankholding force required {{for the elimination of}} wrinkling and thelimiting <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> with sheet thickness. The blankholding force required for the elimination of wrinklingincreased rapidly as the sheet thickness decreased. When the sheet thickness was very thin, the blankholdingforce was strongly influenced by the coefficient of friction. The limiting <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> decreased as sheetthickness decreased and it decreased rapidly below 0. 04 mm thickness. When the sheet thickness was very thin,the limiting <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> was strongly influenced by the coefficient of friction. Research limitations/implications: The control of the loading path of blankholding force will be an effectiveway to prevent the formation of defects including fractures and wrinkles in deep drawing of metal foils. Practical implications: When deep drawing of metal foils is carried out, the control of loading path of blankholdingforce during deep drawing operation can be very effective for improving the limiting <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio.</b> Originality/value: The contribution of the conducted research is observed in a possible view of improvementof deep drawability of metal foils...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ultrahigh {{molecular}} weight polyethylene/SiO 2 hybrid hollow fiber membranes were prepared by thermally induced phase separation (TIPS), using mineral oil as the diluent and SiO 2 as the additive. The influences of heat-treatment, <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> and drawing temperature on melting behavior, crystalliza-tion, multi-pore-structure (MPS) and porosity were investigated. The {{results of this}} study demonstrated that the original crystal grains became more perfect and that new micro crystallites were produced through heat treatment. Defects were more easily formed by the micro crystallites in cold stretching. Heat treat-ment also made the pores contract. The MPS including TIPS pore, stretching pore and interfacial mi-crovoid was constructed after stretching. A model of interfacial microvoid was built. The model indicated that the area of interfacial microvoid increased as the <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> became larger, reaching a maximum at a certain <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio.</b> Values above this maximum <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> made no contribution to further in-crease the triangular area of interfacial microvoid but made many TIPS pores close. As the <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> increased, the pore diameter (PD) and total pore fraction (TPF) of the stretched pores increased whereas the TPF of the TIPS pores decreased. The pore diameter distribution (PDD) and the porosity resulted from the joint effect of multiple pores. Without stretching, the porosity was slight due to the pores con-tracting, and it increased as the <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> became larger, reaching a maximum at a <b>drawing</b> <b>ratio</b> of 5 times.

40|$|The {{effect of}} melt {{spinning}} and cold drawing parameters on {{the formation of}} β-phase crystallinity in Poly(Vinylidene Fluoride) (PVDF) fibres, and ways of increasing such crystallinity, were studied. Fibres were melt-spun using four different melt <b>draw</b> <b>ratios,</b> and subsequently cold-drawn at different <b>draw</b> <b>ratios.</b> The maximum <b>draw</b> <b>ratio</b> in cold <b>drawing</b> was dependent on the <b>draw</b> <b>ratio</b> used in the melt spinning.

By cold drawing, α-phase crystallites could be transformed into the β-phase. It was established that, at certain conditions of melt spinning and cold drawing, PVDF fibres containing up to 80 % of mainly β form crystallinity can be prepared. It is further proposed that fibres spun at a sufficiently high melt <b>draw</b> <b>ratio</b> consist to a large extent of extended-chain crystals, and this greatly affects the melting point of the PVDF. Thus DSC melting point data were shown to be insufficient to determine the crystalline phase of PVDF...|$|R

In the latter method, the blank holder was located at the lower dead point from the beginning of forming and the flange part of the blank was free during forming.
