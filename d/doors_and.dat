The theater's front <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> ticket office were altered by J. W. McFadden Inc. in 1930, {{along with the}} construction of a new ticket booth.

The theater's front entrance, including its <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> 1930s ticket booth, were remodeled by Ferguson Cassady Co. in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural {{features in the}} landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> walls along {{the path of the}} sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde's Sun Temple is thought to have been an astronomical observatory.|$|E

5|$|The M9 {{used the}} same chassis and {{mechanical}} components as the M5. It was laid out to provide similar stowage, access to the radios from the inside, rear <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> a pedestal machine gun mount as with the M2.

5|$|The Sognsvann Line was {{finished}} upgraded to metro standard on 7 January 1993, allowing the first T1000 trains to operate through the Common Tunnel into the western network, converting {{parts of the}} Oslo Tramway to metro. The Røa Line {{was finished}} on 19 November 1995, allowing all trains from the east to operate through the city center. To have sufficient metro-compatible trains, six two-car T2000 units were bought, and during the mid-1990s {{were considered to be}} a possible replacement for the T1000s. Starting in 1995, Oslo Sporveier made an interior and livery upgrade to the T1000 trains. The main red color to the exterior was kept, but the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> around the windows were painted blue. The lights and seats were changed, and the latter colored gray. The interior walls were painted red at the end, white on the sides, blue on the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> received yellow hand bars.|$|E

The concept also featured electrically operated scissor <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> a transparent engine cover {{to show off the}} V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|The house stood empty {{until the}} Manhattan Project support {{personnel}} arrived in early 1945. The northeast room (the master bedroom) was designated the assembly room.

5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval trusses where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961. A survey in 2002 found minor repairs were needed to the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> wall plate.|$|E

Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.|$|E

Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E
