Silk protein from Bombyx mori was used to create wound dressings via a proprietary electrospinning technique. The resulting dressing is vapor and air transmissible. Eight millimeter diameter full-thickness wounds were created on the backs of diabetic mice and covered with either a standard (n= 12) telfa-gauze or the silk (n= 12) dressing. At 2 day intervals, the telfa dressings were removed, the wounds photographed, measured and fresh dressings placed. For mice receiving the silk dressing, it was allowed to remain in place unless it became dislodged. In that case, a fresh dressing was placed into the wound bed. Wound healing was followed for 21 days at which time the mice were sacrificed, the wound areas excised and subjected to H 2 ̆ 6 E and Trichrome staining. Wounds covered with the silk dressings developed an eschar encompassing the silk whereas wounds <b>dressed</b> with <b>gauze</b> remained moist and without eschar throughout the study period. Upon histologic examination, 1 of the <b>gauze</b> <b>dressed</b> wounds developed a complete epithelial layer across the wound. The remaining 11 wounds had large areas remaining without an epithelial cover. In contrast, 5 of 12 mice receiving the silk dressing developed complete epithelial layers, 2 additional mice had very small areas remaining without a complete epithelium. The remaining 5 had modest areas without an epithelial covering. The ability of silk dressings to permit the formation of an eschar versus gauze in which the wounds remained wet may contribute significantly to the healing response observed. These results suggest that the breathable, vapor transmissible nature of the silk dressing may be an effective dressing for difficult to heal wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers...|$|R

Tension-free hernioplasty is currently commonly used for its treatment, with multiple advantages such as simple surgical method, low recurrence rate, and ability to be per-formed in primary care hospitals, but the risk of incision infection still exists. Mild infection can be cured by lo-cal washing, dressing, and systemic antibiotics. If the infection is severe, the wound may not heal after remov-ing the patch, and secondary suturing is needed. Material/Methods: A total of 60 patients with postoperative infection after tension-free repair of inguinal hernia were random-ly divided into control (n= 30) and treatment (n= 30) groups.

5000|$|A Hickman line is {{a central}} venous {{catheter}} most often used for the administration of chemotherapy or other medications, {{as well as for}} the withdrawal of blood for analysis. Some types are used mainly for the purpose of apheresis or dialysis. Hickman lines may remain in place for extended periods and are used when long-term intravenous access is required. They are inserted under sedation or a general anesthetic by a radiologist or surgeon. The insertion involves two incisions, one at the jugular vein or another nearby vein or groove, and one on the chest wall. At the former incision site (known as the [...] "entrance" [...] site), a tunnel is created from there through to the latter incision site (known as the [...] "exit" [...] site), and the catheter is pushed through this tunnel until it [...] "exits" [...] the latter incision site. The exit site is where the lumens are seen as coming out of the chest wall. The catheter at the entrance site area is then inserted back through the entrance site and advanced into the superior vena cava, preferably near the junction of it and the right atrium of the heart. The entrance site is sutured. The catheter at the exit site is secured by means of a [...] "cuff" [...] just under the skin at the exit site, and the lumens are held down otherwise by a sterile <b>gauze</b> or <b>dressing</b> centered on the exit site, which also serves the purpose of preventing potential contamination at the exit site.
