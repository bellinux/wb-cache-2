5|$|On 3 October, the troops, {{along with}} Colonel Alexander Evert Kawilarang, were tasked with {{capturing}} the rebel capital at New Victoria.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} a forest bathing on cardiovascular and metabolic parameters. Nineteen middle-aged male subjects were selected after they provided informed consent. These subjects took day trips to a forest park in Agematsu, Nagano Prefecture, and to an urban area of Nagano Prefecture as control in August 2015. On both trips, they walked 2. 6 [*]km for 80 [*]min each in the morning and afternoon on Saturdays. Blood and urine were sampled before and after each trip. Cardiovascular and metabolic parameters were measured. Blood pressure and pulse rate were measured <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips.</b> <b>The</b> Japanese version of the profile of mood states (POMS) test was conducted before, <b>during,</b> and after <b>the</b> <b>trips.</b> Ambient temperature and humidity were monitored <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>trips.</b> <b>The</b> forest bathing program significantly reduced pulse rate and significantly increased the score for vigor and decreased the scores for depression, fatigue, anxiety, and confusion. Urinary adrenaline after forest bathing showed a tendency toward decrease. Urinary dopamine after forest bathing was significantly lower than that after urban area walking, suggesting the relaxing effect of the forest bathing. Serum adiponectin after the forest bathing was significantly greater than that after urban area walking...|$|R

5|$|As {{commander}} of U.S. {{forces in the}} Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower on his three-day trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for an exit strategy for the stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases {{and the use of}} nuclear weapons. This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commander General Mark W. Clark, but had not been acted on when the armistice came in July 1953, {{at a time when the}} Chinese were struggling with domestic unrest. Still, Radford's frankness <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> and his knowledge of Asia made a good impression on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.|$|E
5|$|As {{they travel}} together, Natalie {{questions}} Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is adamant {{that he is}} more than happy with his lifestyle. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex {{in spite of their}} obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program. On the test run, the earlier concerns Ryan raised prove valid; one laid-off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and Natalie is unable to comfort him.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he {{was treated as a}} government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E

5|$|Diệm's visit {{prompted}} {{increased interest}} in Vietnam by Australian Catholics, particularly supporters of the DLP. Australian Catholics came to see South Vietnam as an anti-communist and Vatican stronghold in Asia and as a result, became strong supporters of the Vietnam War. Harold Lalor, a Jesuit priest and leading confidant of Santamaria, had studied with Thục in Rome. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> Diệm met with Gilroy, the first Australian cardinal, as well as Santamaria and Archbishop of Melbourne Daniel Mannix, both of whom praised him strongly.

He was unemployed in 1982, and TSR offered him a job based on his submission of several modules. That year, while driving from Utah to Wisconsin to start a job with TSR, Hickman and his wife created the Dragonlance universe concept. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> Hickman and his wife discussed two ideas they had had for several years: an entire world used to support a storyline, and a world dominated by dragons.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Washington {{traveled}} to Barbados with Lawrence, who {{was suffering from}} tuberculosis, {{with the hope that}} the climate would be beneficial to Lawrence's health. Washington contracted smallpox <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> which left his face slightly scarred but immunized him against future exposures to the dreaded disease. Lawrence's health failed to improve, and he returned to Mount Vernon where he died in the summer of 1752. Lawrence's position as Adjutant General (militia leader) of Virginia was divided into four district offices after his death. Washington was appointed by Governor Dinwiddie as one of the four district adjutants in February 1753, with the rank of major in the Virginia militia. During this period, Washington became a Freemason while in Fredericksburg, although his involvement was minimal.|$|E
5|$|In 1825 Hogg {{accompanied}} {{his brother}} John {{on a tour}} of Continental Europe. Jane encouraged him to take the trip, believing {{that it would be a}} test of his commitment to her. He returned to England in February 1826. Although Hogg enjoyed the trip, he missed reading Greek literature and English newspapers. Writing the journals that were published in 1827 under the title Two Hundred and Nine Days occupied much of his time <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>trip.</b> He frequently attacked the Catholic Church and customs officials in his journals, but he often made positive observations about the lifestyles of many of the ordinary people that he met.

40|$|Abstract. The {{calculation}} of fluctuating pressure is necessary <b>during</b> <b>the</b> progress of <b>trip</b> in <b>the</b> managed pressure drilling, because the bottomhole pressure should be constant <b>during</b> <b>the</b> progress of <b>trip.</b> <b>The</b> prediction model of <b>the</b> fluctuating pressure <b>during</b> <b>the</b> progress of <b>trip</b> was established {{based on the}} unsteady flowing theory. The actual application state of the prediction model was presented through a computational example. By the comparison between the computational result and the field test result, the computational result matches the field test result very well, which indicates the rationality and {{the accuracy of the}} model...|$|R
5000|$|Hafele and Keating, in 1971, flew caesium atomic clocks {{east and}} west around the earth in {{commercial}} airliners, to compare the elapsed time against that of a clock that remained at the U.S. Naval Observatory. Two opposite effects came into play. The clocks were expected to age more quickly (show a larger elapsed time) than the reference clock, since {{they were in a}} higher (weaker) gravitational potential for most of <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> (c.f. Pound-Rebka experiment). But also, contrastingly, the moving clocks were expected to age more slowly because of the speed of their travel. From the actual flight paths of each <b>trip,</b> <b>the</b> theory predicted that the flying clocks, compared with reference clocks at the U.S. Naval Observatory, should have lost 40±23 nanoseconds <b>during</b> <b>the</b> eastward <b>trip</b> and should have gained 275±21 nanoseconds <b>during</b> <b>the</b> westward <b>trip.</b> Relative to <b>the</b> atomic time scale of the U.S. Naval Observatory, the flying clocks lost 59±10 nanoseconds <b>during</b> <b>the</b> eastward <b>trip</b> and gained 273±7 nanoseconds <b>during</b> <b>the</b> westward <b>trip</b> (where <b>the</b> error bars represent standard deviation). In 2005, the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom reported their limited replication of this experiment. The NPL experiment differed from the original in that the caesium clocks were sent on a shorter trip (London-Washington, D.C. return), but the clocks were more accurate. The reported results are within 4% of the predictions of relativity, within the uncertainty of the measurements.|$|R
