50|$|A Boltzmann {{machine is}} a type of {{stochastic}} neural network invented by Geoffrey Hinton and Terry Sejnowski in 1985. Boltzmann machines {{can be seen as the}} stochastic, generative counterpart of Hopfield nets. They are named after the Boltzmann distribution in statistical mechanics. The units in Boltzmann machines are divided into two groups-visible units and hidden units. General Boltzmann machines allow connection between any units. However, learning is impractical using general Boltzmann Machines because the computational time is exponential to the size of the machine. A more efficient architecture is called restricted Boltzmann machine where connection is only allowed between <b>hidden</b> <b>unit</b> and visible unit, which is described in the next section.|$|E
5000|$|Units {{in towns}} and wooded hexes were {{invisible}} unless an enemy unit was directly adjacent to them, even though those units may {{have moved to}} that position {{in full view of}} the enemy, and fired from it as well. There is an optional rule called opportunity fire in which a unit moving in the line-of-sight of an enemy unit may be fired upon by that unit. This ability of units to hop from one woods hex to another without being attacked was called [...] "Panzerbush Syndrome", and [...] "Panzerbush" [...] became a scornful nickname for the game itself. The game provided a cumbersome optional rule to overcome this, but the later versions of the system (Panzer Leader and The Arab-Israeli Wars) provided much better solutions, such as the optional opportunity fire and more realistic rules for spotting and visibility. In these systems, a <b>hidden</b> <b>unit</b> that fires on the enemy becomes seen and can be fired upon in return. A common practice for those who desire more realism is to play PanzerBlitz with the Panzer Leader spotting rules.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the early}} {{techniques}} in reducing representational overlap involved making either the input vectors or the <b>hidden</b> <b>unit</b> activation patterns orthogonal to one another. Lewandowsky and Li (1995) noted that the interference between sequentially learned patterns is minimized if the input vectors are orthogonal to each other. Input vectors {{are said to be}} orthogonal to each other if the pairwise product of their elements across the two vectors sum to zero. For example, the patterns 0,0,1,0 and 0,1,0,0 are said to be orthogonal because (0&times;0 + 0&times;1 + 1&times;0 + 0&times;0) = 0. One of the techniques which can create orthogonal representations at the hidden layers involves bipolar feature coding (i.e., coding using -1 and 1 rather than 0 and 1). Orthogonal patterns tend to produce less interference with each other. However, not all learning problems can be represented using these types of vectors and some studies report that the degree of interference is still problematic with orthogonal vectors. Simple techniques such as varying the learning rate parameters in the backpropagation equation were not successful in reducing interference. Varying the number of hidden nodes has also been used to try and reduce interference. However, the findings have been mixed, with some studies finding that more hidden units decrease interference and other studies finding it does not.|$|E

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{states that}} {{as the number of}} <b>hidden</b> <b>units</b> H in a {{supervised}} regression network is increased, the generalization error, beyond a certain point, gets worse, so that the number of <b>hidden</b> <b>units</b> should be carefully controlled.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} two {{learning}} mechanisms for artificial neural networks (ANNs) {{that can be}} applied to solve classification problems with binary outputs.

5000|$|To {{test their}} hypothesis, McRae and Hetherington (1993) {{compared}} {{the performance of}} a naïve and pre-trained auto-encoder backpropagation network on three simulations of verbal learning tasks. The pre-trained network was trained using letter based representations of English monosyllabic words or English word pairs. All three tasks involved the learning of some consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) strings or CVC pairs (list A), followed by training on a second list of these items (list B). Afterwards, the distributions of the hidden node activations were compared between the naïve and pre-trained network. In all three tasks, the representations of a CVC in the naïve network tended to be spread fairly evenly across all hidden nodes, whereas most hidden nodes were inactive in the pre-trained network. Furthermore, in the pre-trained network the representational overlap between CVCs was reduced compared to the naïve network. The pre-trained network also retained some similarity information as the representational overlap between similar CVCs, like [...] "JEP" [...] and [...] "ZEP", was greater than for dissimilar CVCs, such as [...] "JEP" [...] and [...] "YUG". This suggests that the pre-trained network had a better ability to generalize, i.e. notice the patterns, than the naïve network. Most importantly, this reduction in <b>hidden</b> <b>unit</b> activation and representational overlap resulted in significantly less forgetting in the pre-trained network than the naïve network, essentially eliminating catastrophic interference. Essentially, the pre-training acted to create internal orthogonalization of the activations at the hidden layer, which reduced interference. Thus, pre-training is a simple way to reduce catastrophic forgetting in standard backpropagation networks.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} the main cause of catastrophic interference is overlap in the representations at the hidden layer of distributed neural networks. In a distributed representation any given input will tend to create changes in the weights to many of the nodes. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because when many of the weights, where 'knowledge is stored, are changed it is impossible for prior knowledge to be kept intact. During sequential learning, the inputs become mixed with the new input being superimposed over top of the old input. Another way to conceptualize this is through visualizing learning as movement through a weight space. This weight space can be likened to a spatial representation of all of the possible combinations of weights that the network can possess. When a network first learns to represent a set of patterns, it has found a point in weight space which allows it to recognize all of the patterns that it has seen. However, when the network learns a new set of patterns sequentially it will move to a place in the weight space that allows it to only recognize the new pattern. To recognize both sets of patterns, the network must find a place in weight space that can represent both the new and the old output. One {{way to do this is}} by connecting a <b>hidden</b> <b>unit</b> to only a subset of the input units. This reduces the likelihood that two different inputs will be encoded by the same hidden units and weights, and so will decrease the chance of interference. [...] Indeed, a number of the proposed solutions to catastrophic interference involve reducing the amount of overlap that occurs when storing information in these weights.|$|E
