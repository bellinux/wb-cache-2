40|$|This article {{studies the}} Lie algebra Diff(KΓ) of <b>derivations</b> {{on the path}} algebra KΓ of a quiver Γ and the Lie algebra on the first Hochschild cohomology group H^ 1 (KΓ). We relate these Lie algebras to the {{algebraic}} and combinatorial properties of the path algebra. Characterizations of <b>derivations</b> on a path algebra are obtained, leading to a canonical basis of Diff(KΓ) and its Lie algebra properties. Special <b>derivations</b> are associated to the vertices, arrows and faces of a quiver, and the concepts of a connected matrix and boundary matrix are introduced to study the relations among these <b>derivations,</b> concluding that the space of edge <b>derivations</b> is the direct sum of the spaces of the vertex <b>derivations</b> and the face <b>derivations,</b> while {{the dimensions of the}} latter spaces are the largest possible.
