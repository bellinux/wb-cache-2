30|$|On a {{voluntary}} basis and {{to get hold of}} the first-mover advantage, Peugeot Citroën (PSA; French) equipped some of its new cars with particulate filters in 1999 [60]. After several years of public pressure debate about its necessity, car makers have followed suit since 2003 and equipped most of their diesel vehicles with particulate filters[60] yet often at an extra charge[61].

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} calibrating the colour of a colour monitor with LED backlighting, in which at least one area of an image displayed on the colour monitor (1) is remotely measured in a spatially resolved manner using a colour sensor (7) {{in the form of}} an image or line sensor, deviations of measured colour values from desired colour values are determined in a spatially resolved manner, and LED backlighting of the colour monitor (1) is controlled in order to locally correct the deviations. When the colour sensor (7) is integrated into the remote control (2) of a colour TV, the user only suitably orients the remote control (2) with respect to the TV, as a result of which the colour sensor (7) records a test image (3) of the colour TV and evaluates said image in order to determine colour corrections.

The seller was domiciled in Italy, the buyer in France and the goods were sold in Italy. The contract contained a term providing that delivery was to be ‘free from the seller’s premises’ (in the original: ‘Resa: Franco ns. sede’) to a carrier and that the goods would finally be transferred to France. When the buyer was asked {{to pay the price}} of the goods in Italy, it objected that the Italian court did not have jurisdiction to decide the matter. This, in the opinion of the Italian court might trigger the application of art 5 (1) (b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments on civil and commercial matters, establishing a jurisdiction additional to the domicile of the defendant. In order to decide whether it was competent to deal with the issue, the Italian court had to determine the place {{of delivery}}.

30|$|Company E is an {{industrial}} {{systems and equipment}} manufacturer with a diverse product range, from industrial power systems and robotics to low voltage products and automated process systems. Globally, the company is present in 100 countries, has 300 manufacturing locations, 150, 000 employees and a turnover of approximately 40 billion €. In Sweden, the company employs 9000 people in 30 different locations. As such, the company has multifaceted supply chains with both complex inbound and outbound flows for MTS and MTO. It is estimated that, based on volume, MTS dominates, whereas measured in value, MTO is the dominating strategy. Considering palletised goods, the ratio of inbound to outbound volume is 60 / 40. Local manufacturing sites predominantly serve local markets, which makes the inbound flows of interest for this case study. However, the product range is so diverse that any one characterisation of the flows {{is bound to be}} inaccurate in some sense. The company controls and optimises its own flows by purchasing A to B transports. Supply is delivered according to Incoterms EXW (<b>Ex</b> <b>Works)</b> and FOB, and deliveries using DAP and CPT (Carriage Paid To). The logistics organisation does not influence the supply strategy and acts as an internal supplier of transport, given the demand derived from the manufacturing and purchasing functions. One of the objectives of the logistics organisation is to increase the level of central control over the physical flows to and from the many sites at different geographical locations. The centralised control and coordination aims to increase the efficiency of the physical flow of goods within the company’s supply and distribution networks.|$|E
40|$|The technical, {{environmental}} and economic potential of hemp fines as a natural filler in bioplastics to produce biocomposites {{is the subject of}} this study – giving a holistic overview. Hemp fines are an agricultural by-product of the hemp fibres and shives production. Shives and fibres are for example used in the paper, animal bedding or composite area. About 15 to 20 wt. -% per kg hemp straw results in hemp fines after processing. In 2010 about 11, 439 metric tons of hemp fines were produced in Europe. Hemp fines are an inhomogeneous material which includes hemp dust, shives and fibre. For these examinations the hemp fines are sieved in a further step with a tumbler sieving machine to obtain more specified fractions. The untreated hemp fines (<b>ex</b> <b>work)</b> as well as the sieved fractions are combined with a polylactide polymer (PLA) using a co-rotating twin screw extruder to produce biocomposites with different hemp fine content. By using an injection moulding machine standard test bars are produced to conduct several material tests. The Young’s modulus is increased and the impact strength reduced by hemp fines. With a content of above 15 wt. -% hemp fines are also improving the environmental (global warming potential) and economic performance in comparison to pure PLA...|$|R
