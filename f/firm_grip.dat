5|$|By August31, {{the storm}} began to slow and turn towards the west-northwest. The NHC {{noted that they}} did not have a <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> on the storm and were unsure of its future track and intensity. Below average sea surface {{temperatures}} ahead of the system would hamper significant development. Continuing on this track, Christine gradually intensified and on September2, the storm attained its peak intensity just below hurricane-status while situated roughly 300mi (500km) east of Guadeloupe. At this time, a reconnaissance aircraft recorded sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). Shortly after Christine attained this intensity, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{placed the}} young heir to Ludlow, another Edmund Mortimer, {{under house arrest}} {{in the south of}} England, and kept a <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> on Ludlow Castle himself. This persisted until Henry V finally granted Edmund his estates in 1413, with Edmund going on to serve the Crown overseas. As a result, the Mortimers rarely visited the castle during {{the first part of the}} century, despite the {{surrounding}} town having become prosperous in the wool and cloth trades. Edmund fell heavily into debt and having sold his rights to his Welsh estates to a consortium of nobles, before dying childless in 1425.|$|E

25|$|To George's amusement, {{the idea}} of him {{claiming}} the throne was circulated during his lifetime. By the 1920s, the Soviets had a <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> on power in Russia, {{and the return of}} the monarchy was not a serious possibility. Nevertheless, George's cousin, Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich, declared himself Emperor Cyril and George a prince.|$|E
25|$|In most phalangerid {{marsupials}} (a {{family of}} possums) except species Trichosurus and Wyulda {{the first and}} second digits of the forefoot are opposable to the other three. In the hind foot, the first toe is clawless but opposable and provides <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> on branches. The second and third toes are partly syndactylous, united by skin at the top joint while the two separate nails serve as hair combs. The fourth and fifth digits are the largest of the hind foot.|$|E
25|$|The {{small round}} brush head {{comprises}} seven tufts of tightly packed soft nylon bristles, trimmed so the bristles {{in the center}} can reach deeper into small spaces. The brush handle is ergonomically designed for a <b>firm</b> <b>grip,</b> giving the control and precision necessary to clean where most other cleaning aids cannot reach. These areas include the posterior of the wisdom teeth (third molars), orthodontic structures (braces), crowded teeth, and tooth surfaces that are next to missing teeth. It {{can also be used}} to clean areas around implants, bridges, dentures and other appliances.|$|E

25|$|Rákosi's {{priorities}} for the economy were developing military industry and heavy industry and providing the Soviet Union with war compensation. Improving standards of living were not a priority, {{and for this reason}} the people of Hungary saw living standards fall. Although his government became increasingly unpopular, he had a <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> on power until Stalin died on 5 March 1953 and confused power struggle began in Moscow. Some of the Soviet leaders perceived the unpopularity of the Hungarian regime and ordered Rákosi to give up his position as prime minister in favor of another former Communist-in-exile in Moscow, Imre Nagy, who was Rákosi's chief opponent in the party. Rákosi, however, retained his position as general secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party and {{over the next three years}} the two men became involved in a bitter struggle for power.|$|E
25|$|For the Turks, {{it was the}} {{beginning}} of a new era of power. Despite further invasions and attacks by Crusaders from the west and the Mongols and Turkic tribes from the east, the Turks slowly emerged as a superpower under the Ottomans. The rise of the Ottomans was parallel to the fall of the Sultanate of Rum and the carving up of the Byzantine Empire. The power vacuum left in Anatolia was easily exploited by one of the Sultanate's nobles, Osman I. Matters were made worse for the Byzantine Empire due to the Latin presence in the Peloponnese and the rising power of the Bulgarians who continued to press hard against the borders of Byzantium. In time, the Byzantines would be forced to call on the aid of the Ottomans to head to the European mainland and fight the Bulgarians, giving the Ottoman Turks a <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> on Europe. The close proximity of Osman's Beylik ensured that confrontation between the Byzantines and the Ottomans would be inevitable. The Byzantines were a match for the Ottomans but events west of Constantinople coupled with civil war and incompetent leadership left the Byzantines reeling from one siege after another until Constantinople fell in 1453.|$|E
25|$|To {{move from}} place to place, the velvet worm crawls forward using its legs; unlike in arthropods, both legs of a pair are moved simultaneously. The claws of the feet are only used on hard, rough terrain where a <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> is needed; on soft substrates, such as moss, the velvet worm walks on the foot {{cushions}} {{at the base of}} the claws. The actual locomotion is achieved less by the exertion of the leg muscles than by local changes of body length. This can be controlled using the annular and longitudinal muscles. If the annular muscles are contracted, the body cross-section is reduced, and the corresponding segment lengthens; this is the usual mode of operation of the hydrostatic skeleton as also employed by other worms. Due to the stretching, the legs of the segment concerned are lifted and swung forward. Local contraction of the longitudinal muscles then shortens the appropriate segment, and the legs, which are now in contact with the ground, are moved to the rear. This part of the locomotive cycle is the actual leg stroke that is responsible for forward movement. The individual stretches and contractions of the segments are coordinated by the nervous system such that contraction waves run the length of the body, each pair of legs swinging forward and then down and rearward in succession. Macroperipatus can reach speeds of up to four centimetres per second, although speeds of around 6 body-lengths per minute are more typical. The body gets longer and narrower as the animal picks up speed; the length of each leg also varies during each stride.|$|E

50|$|Typically {{the round}} ring was flat rather than round {{in cross section}} to provide a <b>firmer</b> <b>grip</b> and a more sturdy frame, as the ring was also used for strikes and {{deflective}} blows in use.

25|$|Around {{the same}} time that Olivier made his attack, Salme's Advanced Guard and Watrin's division, which had {{previously}} been in reserve, crossed the Trebbia on the far right flank. Moving in two bodies, the French force brushed aside the Austrian outpost line. The right thrust reached Ca' Pernici on the Po's south bank while the left thrust carried almost to Calendasco. Here Watrin paused because the noises from Olivier's fight were not encouraging. By this time, Melas had Olivier on the run and wished to attack across the Trebbia. Hearing of the Watrin-Salme incursion, the Austrian general was forced to deal with it first. Melas sent Liechtenstein with a task force composed of one squadron of the Lobkowitz Dragoons, two squadrons of the Archduke Joseph Hussars, 200 Cossacks and nine companies of infantry. Meanwhile, an artillery battery detached from the Mantua siege corps under the command of Colonel Kinsky unlimbered on the north bank of the Po. The Austrian guns proceeded to bombard their enemies, encouraging them in their decision to recross the Trebbia though the Austrians made prisoners of 300 French. The firing ended in the northern sector about 9:00 pm. The French maintained a <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> on {{the west bank of the}} Trebbia, but MacDonald's division commanders were not able to give him any estimate of their remaining strength. In a scene of horror, thousands of dead and wounded soldiers littered the bed of the Trebbia while Piacenza's Austrian garrison blindly fired cannons into the night. Realizing that neither Moreau nor La Poype were coming to his assistance, MacDonald issued the orders to retreat at 10:00 pm. As soon as the engineers bridged the Nure River, the artillery and wagon train were sent across, followed by the infantry starting about midnight.|$|E

500|$|Ndlovu-Gatsheni {{argued that}} since the mid-1990s, Mugabe's rhetoric and speeches came to be {{dominated}} by three main themes: an obsession with a perceived British threat to re-colonise Zimbabwe, to transfer the land controlled by white farmers to the black population, and issues of belonging and patriotism. References to the Rhodesian Bush War featured prominently in Mugabe's speeches. The scholar of African studies Abiodun Alao noted that Mugabe was determined to [...] "take advantage of the past in order to secure a <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> on national security".|$|E
50|$|Yuwen Tai {{appeared}} {{to hold an}} even <b>firmer</b> <b>grip</b> on power after Emperor Wen's death.

500|$|Although Constantine {{created his}} {{apparent}} heirs [...] "Caesars", following a pattern established by Diocletian, {{he gave his}} creations a hereditary character, alien to the tetrarchic system: Constantine's Caesars were {{to be kept in}} the hope of ascending to Empire, and entirely subordinated to their Augustus, {{as long as he was}} alive. Therefore, an alternative explanation for the execution of Crispus was, perhaps, Constantine's desire to keep a <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> on his prospective heirs, this—and Fausta's desire for having her sons inheriting instead of their half-brother—being reason enough for killing Crispus; the subsequent execution of Fausta, however, was probably meant as a reminder to her children that Constantine would not hesitate in [...] "killing his own relatives when he felt this was necessary".|$|E
500|$|... 'Fly Like A Bird', is a kitchen-sink, hyper-produced gospel number, but {{is really}} quite moving.

But there’s {{a lot of hope}} and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, a <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> on the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even if nobody else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out of her hands quicker than she could appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she really needs help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E

50|$|Cam {{fasteners}} are {{a simple}} type of fastener that use a cam to push {{down on the}} webbing that is passed through the cam and prevent the webbing from slipping back through the fastener. The edge of the cam lever that faces the webbing is usually knurled to provide a <b>firmer</b> <b>grip</b> on the webbing. Tension is added by pulling the excess webbing through the fastener until the necessary tension is achieved and then releasing the cam lever to lock the webbing in place.|$|R
50|$|Chirotherium, {{also known}} as Cheirotherium (‘hand-beast’), {{is the name of}} a Triassic trace fossil {{consisting}} of five-fingered (pentadactyle) footprints and whole tracks. These look, by coincidence, remarkably like the hands of apes, humans, and bears, with the outermost toe having evolved to extend out to the side like a thumb, although probably only functioning to provide a <b>firmer</b> <b>grip</b> in mud. Chirotherium tracks were first found in 1834 in Lower Triassic sandstone (Buntsandstein) in Thuringia, Germany, dating from about 243 million years ago (mya).|$|R

In spite of the beauty in him, and the aching desire to create, it was for her that he struggled. He was a lover first and always. All other things he subordinated to love.|$|R
500|$|The often uneasy {{relationship}} between the larger, wealthier ranches and smaller ranch settlers became steadily worse after the harsh winter of 1886–1887, when a series of blizzards and temperatures of -50 to -40°F (-45 to -40°C) followed by an extremely hot and dry summer, ravaged the frontier. Thousands of cattle were lost and the large companies began appropriating land and the water supply in the area. Some of the harsher tactics included forcing settlers off their land, setting fire to their properties, and excluding them from participating in the annual roundup. They justified these excesses on what was public land by using the catch-all allegation of rustling. Hostilities worsened when the Wyoming legislature passed the [...] "Maverick Act," [...] which stated that all unbranded cattle in the open range automatically belonged to the cattlemen's association. The cattlemen also held a <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> on Wyoming's stock interests by {{limiting the number of}} small ranchers that could participate.|$|E
500|$|The total {{construction}} cost of Boden Fortresssomewhere around 20 million kronor at the timewould {{correspond to}} almost 1 billion kronor (as of 2011) {{according to the}} consumer price index which the government agency Statistics Sweden uses. Despite this, the cost has been claimed to correspond to 4 billion kronor of today, and it has also been claimed that the project was more expensive than the JAS 39 Gripen project, which cost 106 billion kronor in total, each aircraft costing between 300 and 500 million kronor depending on what to include in the calculation. No matter what the actual cost was, opinions on Boden Fortress differ markedly, from being called a boastful project and the [...] "JAS project of the turn of the century" [...] to {{one of the reasons that}} kept Sweden out of two World Wars. The fortress also had a psychological aspect, in that its mere existence kept a <b>firm</b> <b>grip</b> of peoples' mindsessentially functioning as a morale boosterduring times when Sweden was in the shadow of war.|$|E

Despite his successes in television, Aubrey's abrasive personality and oversized ego– [...] "Picture Machiavelli and Karl Rove at a University of Colorado football recruiting party" [...] wrote Variety in 2004– {{led to his}} firing from CBS amid charges of improprieties. [...] "The circumstances rivaled the best of CBS adventure or mystery shows," [...] declared The New York Times in its front-page story on his firing, which came on [...] "the sunniest Sunday in February" [...] 1965. He earned the nickname [...] "Smiling Cobra" [...] for his brutal decision-making ways. Aubrey governed CBS with a <b>firm</b> <b>grip,</b> {{and it did not}} go unnoticed. He was suddenly dismissed in February 1965. Aubrey offered no explanation following his dismissal, nor did CBS President Frank Stanton or Board Chairman William Paley. After four years as an independent producer, Aubrey was hired by financier Kirk Kerkorian in 1969 to preside over Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's near-total shutdown, during which he slashed the budget and alienated producers and directors but brought profits to a company that had suffered huge losses. In 1973, Aubrey resigned from MGM, declaring his job was done, and then vanished into almost total obscurity for the last two decades of his life.|$|E
