5000|$|Wallace's <b>giant</b> <b>bee</b> {{has only}} been {{reported}} from three islands of the North Moluccas in Indonesia: Bacan, Halmahera and Tidore.

There are {{over two hundred}} different birds on the islands, twenty-six of which are endemic, a large number for this small island group. The endemics include four birds which are the only species in their genera, including the elusive invisible rail (Habroptila wallacii), the white-streaked friarbird (Melitograis gilolensis), and two birds of paradise, the paradise-crow (Lycocorax pyrrhopterus) and Wallace's standardwing (Semioptera wallacii).

5000|$|The {{members of}} Dvar have kept their identities secret, so {{little is known}} of their formation. In an {{interview}} they stated that [...] "Dvar is something that came in a dream". Band members claim to have heard music in their dreams, {{in which it was}} presented to them by a being named Dvar. Based on the recurring theme of bees in their album artwork, some fans have claimed that the Dvar being took the shape of a <b>giant</b> <b>bee.</b> The band have insisted in several interviews that all of their music is directly inspired by the Dvar being, with the band serving as mere messengers. The vocals which accompany Dvar's music use {{what appears to be a}} constructed language, which displays a sound pattern somewhat reminiscent of ancient Semitic languages. Due to this similarity, many followers of the band claim that the [...] "lyrics" [...] are sung in the occult Enochian language, incorrectly attributing this claim to the band themselves. However, the band has given no clues as to the nature of their invented language, except to say that, like the music, the vocals merely relate the message of the Dvar being.|$|E
5000|$|Wallace {{has opened}} a new business, [...] "From Bee to You" [...] specialising in {{delivering}} freshly made honey to his customers. He takes up the offer to provide fifty gallons of honey in repayment to the local grocer after his electric cheese-detecting machine accidentally rampaged through the store on a test run. However, Wallace has used up all the flowers in his garden, and is forced to improvise a growth formula to turn some daisy seeds provided by his neighbour, Ms. Flitt into giant flowers. The formula is a success, and he meets his client's demand but things soon go wrong when the bees react to the growth formula, becoming huge and terrorizing the town and Wallace's home. Gromit is able to trap most of the bees, but Wallace is stolen away by the <b>giant</b> <b>bee</b> queen. Gromit gives chase in Wallace's honey tanker truck, {{and is able to}} rescue Wallace. The two work together to feed the queen more honey dosed with more of the growth formula, forcing the bee to become stuck in a tunnel. Wallace works out an antidote to the growth formula to restore the bees to normal, though he accidentally shrinks himself in the process.|$|E
25|$|A. d. laboriosa, the Himalayan <b>giant</b> honey <b>bee,</b> was {{initially}} {{described as a}} distinct species. Later, it was included in A. dorsata as a subspecies based on the biological species concept, though authors applying a genetic species concept have suggested it {{should be considered a}} separate species. Essentially restricted to the Himalayas, it differs little from the <b>giant</b> honey <b>bee</b> in appearance, but has extensive behavioral adaptations that enable it to nest in the open at high altitudes despite low ambient temperatures. It is the largest living honey bee.|$|R
2500|$|... "The Sting" [...] is {{the twelfth}} episode of season {{four of the}} American {{animated}} television series Futurama.

In the episode, the Planet Express crew is sent to collect space honey, and {{find themselves in a}} harrowing battle with <b>giant</b> <b>bees.</b> The episode's plot originated from the writers wanting to do a story where it seemed as though a major character had died. The episode was then produced faster than normal and was well received by critics.|$|R

50|$|Ben Fields, {{married to}} Francesca Fields, is an {{entomologist}} seeking a lab assistant. Regina, a giant mutant queen bee in human form, who {{is searching for}} a human mate to evolve her species, takes the job. Regina is accepted into their household after fabricating a story of accused infidelity by her 'former' employer's spouse, whom she chose to keep anonymous to prevent anyone from knowing about the alleged affair. Suspicious of her background, while being treated with disrespect and contempt, Francesca discovers Regina has lied; as well as seeing her abruptly morphing into a <b>giant</b> <b>bee</b> while apparently drawing nectar from a flower in their garden. At one point, due to the metabolic changes while in human form, Regina experiences spasms of pain, and is examined and treated by the Fields' personal physician, who reveals to them his belief that Regina may not be who she appears to be. Later, with her knowledge of Regina's attempts to seduce her husband, Francesca confronts her, whereupon Regina unleashes her army of drones kept in Ben's laboratory, attacking and then stinging Francesca to death. Ben, grief-stricken, accuses Regina of murdering his wife; and, together with his enlightened understanding of her true identity and purpose, causes her to topple over his bedroom's second story balcony and {{fall to the ground}} below, where she miraculously recovers, transforms into the queen bee, and then flies off.|$|E
50|$|The {{game is a}} {{horizontally}} scrolling shooter, {{with some}} elements similar to early, classic shoot 'em ups. The player controls a bee capable of launching a number of projectiles which can damage or destroy enemy targets. The game uses the power-up bar system pioneered by Gradius. Destroyed enemies sometimes leave a power-up {{in the form of}} a red-and-yellow flower. The player may collect these flowers and activate new weapons and enhancements. A 'build-up' weapon, similar to the 'beam' weapon in R-Type, also features. If the fire button is held down for a second or two, the bee produces a hissing noise and releasing the fire button will then cause the bee to fire a large, organic projectile (a <b>giant</b> <b>bee</b> sting) which can wipe out waves of small enemies, or damage larger ones. If the player's bee is hit by enemy fire or crashes into the terrain, a life will be lost and the current stage is restarted except for the end bosses of the first 3 stages, that will continue till all lives are lost. Once all lives are lost the game ends. A co-operative two-player mode is possible, in which the second player controls a smaller companion drone, which can launch small projectiles and shield the first player. The drone can sustain 5 small projectiles per life but won't survive large projectiles or collisions and the stage doesn't reset if it dies, the large bee is the alpha which must survive to advance. The alpha bee dying resets the stage as with normal play minus end stage bosses for the first 3 stages.An alternating two player mode is also possible.|$|E

500|$|Accidental {{intoxication}} {{of humans}} by [...] mad honey {{has been well}} documented by several Classical authors, notably Xenophon, while the deliberate use of such honey as a medicine and intoxicant (even hallucinogen) is still practiced by the Gurung tribe of Nepal, who have a long tradition of hazardous cliff-climbing to wrest the precious commodity from the nests of Apis dorsata laboriosa, the giant Himalayan honeybee. The honey thus collected by the Gurung owes its inebriating properties to the nectar which the <b>giant</b> <b>bees</b> gather from a deep red-flowered species of Rhododendron, which, in turn, owes its toxicity to the compound grayanotoxin, widespread in the plant family Ericaceae, to which the genus Rhododendron belongs.|$|R
50|$|The Earth Defense Force, {{a unified}} {{multinational}} military sponsored by nearly every country, is founded after detecting an impending alien visit {{in case the}} aliens prove to be hostile. In the year 2017, {{that proved to be}} true and the EDF fought against the Ravagers, an alien race that attacked Earth with giant insect-like creatures, UFOs, robots and gigantic, 120-foot-tall lizard-like creatures. Eight years after defeating the last Ravager in Arizona, they attack again with new creatures, evolved from their underground nest. Among them is the Retiarius, a spider-like creature which makes gigantic spider-webs, and <b>giant</b> <b>bees.</b> In the year 2025, the EDF must protect the Earth again from the alien invaders.|$|R
