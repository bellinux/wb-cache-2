5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One {{of the problems of}} biomass is that material directly combusted <b>in</b> <b>cook</b> stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{composition}} of seven common foods viz. cooked rice, cooked beans, cooked yams, cooked fufu, fried fish, stew, and vegetable soup, {{sold by the}} selected (147) vendors in Abeokut, were investigated. Descriptive statistics was used to analyse the collected data. The results of the proximate analysis of food samples showed that the mean moisture content of the street foods ranged from 44. 87 % in fried fish to 72. 43 % <b>in</b> <b>cooked</b> fufu. Protein content varied from 0. 03 % <b>in</b> <b>cooked</b> fufu to 14. 47 % in fried fish while the fat content ranged from 0. 03 % <b>in</b> <b>cooked</b> fufu to 34. 43 % in fried fish.

The energy content ranged from 89. 0 Kcal <b>in</b> <b>cooked</b> fufu to 375. 24 Kcal in fried fish. In general, fried fish had the highest values of protein (14. 47 %), fat (34. 43 %) and energy content (375. 24 KCal.).

40|$|Antioxidant {{and color}} {{stability}} effects of carnosine and phytate were compared {{in a fresh}} beef model system and <b>in</b> <b>cooked</b> beef. Both compounds increased the rate of pH decline in pre-rigor muscle. Phytate also increased the rate of post-mortem glycogen catabolism. Both antioxidants inhibited metmyoglobin formation in raw samples during storage. Phytate was more effective than carnosine for inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Heme iron content was negatively related to lipid peroxidation <b>in</b> <b>cooked</b> beef (r=– 0. 92). Phytate was also more effective for inhibition of iron release from heme during cooking. Phytate is recommended over carnosine as an effective antioxidant <b>in</b> <b>cooked</b> meats...|$|R

5|$|Lenders, {{including}} Bank of America, {{moved to}} foreclose on the retail and transit {{portion of the}} mixed-use development on October 19, 2009, because the developer, Joseph Freed and Associates LLC, ran out of money. Freed technically defaulted in March. With cost overruns exceeding $34million as of August 25, Freed owes $128.5million on a $205million construction loan, according to a lawsuit filed <b>in</b> <b>Cook</b> County Circuit Court. On November 3, the developer announced it had landed 13 new tenants to open within the succeeding few months. On November 20, a circuit court judge stripped Freed of the development rights and turn the responsibility over to CB Richard Ellis.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 This study {{investigated}} the effect of cooking on the neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content of cauliflower and carrots. For each replication the vegetable was divided in half to serve as its own control. One half was used raw {{and the other half}} was <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> 60 ml of distilled water for 7 to 8 minutes. Internal temperature of the cooked samples verified a uniform cooking process. Moisture and NDF were determined in both raw and cooked samples. A texture reading, determined by shear force, was also done on the cooked samples. The resulting NDF residues from the raw and cooked samples were used to compare water-absorbing capacity and ash content. In terms of 100 g dry weight, NDF decreased <b>in</b> <b>cooked</b> cauliflower from 19. 13 to 17. 22 g (p< 0. 05) and increased <b>in</b> <b>cooked</b> carrots from 9. 47 to 10. 54 g (p< 0. 05). The exact opposite was observed for water-absorbing capacity. It increased <b>in</b> <b>cooked</b> cauliflower and decreased <b>in</b> <b>cooked</b> carrots. Ash content showed large variations but a general increase in both vegetables after cooking. No positive relationship was found between texture and NDF <b>in</b> the <b>cooked</b> vegetables. These observations confirm the complex nature of dietary fiber. Results suggest that although cooking affected the NDF in selected vegetables, the quantity of the change was not large enough to alter dietary fiber's physiological effect in the body...|$|R
