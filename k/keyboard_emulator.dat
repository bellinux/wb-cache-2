40|$|<b>Keyboard</b> <b>emulator</b> has {{interface}} at {{same level}} as manual keyboard entry. Since communication and control take place at high intelligence level in instrument, all instrument circuitry fully utilized. Little knowledge of instrument circuitry necessary, since only task interface performs is key closure. All existing logic and error checking still performed by instrument, minimizing workload of laboratory microcomputer. Timing constraints for interface operation minimal at keyboard entry level...|$|E
40|$|For {{people with}} motion impairments, {{access to and}} {{independent}} control of a computer can be essential. Symptoms such as tremor and spasm, however, can make the typical keyboard and mouse arrangement for computer interaction difficult or even impossible to use. This paper describes three approaches to improving computer input effectivness for people with motion impairments. The three approaches are: (1) {{to increase the number}} of interaction channels, (2) to enhance commonly existing interaction channels, and (3) to make more effective use of all the available information in an existing input channel. Experiments in multimodal input, haptic feedback, user modelling, and cursor control are discussed in the context of the three approaches. A haptically enhanced <b>keyboard</b> <b>emulator</b> with perceptive capability is proposed, combining approaches in a way that improves computer access for motion impaired users...|$|E
40|$|This study {{proposed}} {{the use of}} assistive technology (AT) to promote communication and leisure opportunities by three children with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Furthermore, it assessed the effects of such technology on the indices of positive participation and provided a social validation procedure. Three children emerged from a minimal conscious state and presenting extensive motor disabilities were involved. The intervention program allowed the participants to request and to choice preferred items independently and to perform literacy through a <b>keyboard</b> <b>emulator.</b> A multiple probe design across behaviors with post-intervention check was employed. Outcome measures were correct requests, understandable words, intervals with positive participation, and scores of social validation assessment. Request and choice behaviors and literacy improved significantly during intervention phases. During post-intervention check, all participants consolidated their performance. Moreover, indices of positive participation increased during intervention phases. Scores of social validation assessment showed {{that the combination of}} both behaviors was preferable to the same considered separately. AT program showed to be suitable for promoting constructive engagement and literacy behaviors by children with TBI. Future research is needed to generalize this data to a larger sample and to develop new technology for people with different levels of disabilities due to TBI...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} ways {{in which}} computers have-radically altered and improved the lives of handicapped students. The visually impaired have been helped {{through the use of}} computerized braillers, embossers, and readers. Both adaptations of off-the-shelf software and specialized software have provided the visually impaired with magnification of print on the computer screen, voice synthesis, Braille word processing, and access to databases of assistive devices. Microcomputers have given the hearing impaired access to telephone communication (the Telecommunications for the Deaf device), lip reading training, synthesized speech, and computer assisted instruction. Finally, computers can help the nonverbal physically handicapped student to communicate and peripherals (such as speech synthesizers, talking scanners and keyboards, touch sensitive screens, <b>keyboard</b> <b>emulators,</b> <b>keyboards,</b> and adaptive switches) can provide access to off-the-shelf software. High costs and lack of information are still barriers to the widespread use of these computerized inventions. A resource list of 17 computer hardware and software companies and 8 publications is appended, as well as a 35 -item reference list.

50|$|The {{success of}} the Fairlight CMI caused other firms to {{introduce}} sampling. New England Digital modified their Synclavier digital synth to perform sampling, while E-mu Systems introduced a less costly sampling <b>keyboard,</b> the <b>Emulator,</b> in 1981. In the United States, a new sampler company called Ensoniq introduced the Ensoniq Mirage in 1985, at a price that made sampling affordable to the average musician for the first time.|$|R

He deems it [...] "insufficient and slow" [...] for immediate and spontaneous creation and all his efforts [...] "are {{to stay away from}} that beast". He considers that the contemporary civilization is living in a cultural [...] "dark age" [...] of [...] "musical pollution". He considers musical composing a science rather than an art, similar to Pythagoreanism. He has a mystical viewpoint on music as [...] "one of the greatest forces in the universe", that the [...] "music exists before we exist". Some consider that his experience of music is a kind of synaesthesia.|$|R
5000|$|The VK-7 is {{designed}} to recreate the organ sounds of the 1960s and 1970s jazz and popular music. The instrument has nine harmonic drawbars so that the organist can control the volume of different overtones. The instrument also provides vibrato, chorus, and reverb effects and an overdrive knob, which adds simulated tube amplifier [...] "growl". As with most clonewheel <b>emulator</b> <b>keyboards,</b> the drawbars are positioned {{to the left of}} the keyboard. Unlike the Hammond organ, which had two manuals (keyboards), the VK-7 has only a single manual with 61 keys.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} WordStar interface left a large legacy, {{and many}} of its control-key command are still available (optionally or as the default) in other programs, such as the modern cross-platform word processing software TextMaker and many text editors running under MS-DOS, Linux, and other UNIX variants. The popular Turbo Pascal compiler used WordStar keyboard commands in its IDE editor. The TEXT editor built into the firmware of the TRS-80 Model 100 portable computer supported a subset of the Wordstar cursor movement commands (in addition to its own). Home word processing software like Write&Set not only use the WordStar interface, but have been based on WordStar DOS file formats, allowing WordStar users who no longer have a copy of the application to easily open and edit their files. There are WordStar <b>keyboard</b> command <b>emulators</b> and keymappings, both freeware and shareware, for current versions of Microsoft Word. Popular modern word processing software like WordPerfect, StarOffice, and Microsoft Word (with the proper filters) can open and save to WordStar documents, enabling users to move back and forth.|$|R
