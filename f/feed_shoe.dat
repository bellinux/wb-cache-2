50|$|Grain is fed {{by gravity}} from the hopper into the feed-shoe. The shoe is {{agitated}} by a shoe handle running against an agitator (damsel) {{on the stone}} spindle, the shaft powering the runner stone. This mechanism regulates the feed of grain to the millstones by making the feed dependent on {{the speed of the}} runner stone. From the <b>feed</b> <b>shoe</b> the grain falls through the eye, the central hole, of the runner stone and is taken between the runner and the bed stone to be ground. The flour exits from between the stones from the side. The stone casing prevents the flour from falling on the floor, instead it is taken to the meal spout from where it can be bagged or processed further. The runner stone is supported by the rind, a cross-shaped metal piece, on the spindle. The spindle is carried by the tentering gear, a set of beams forming a lever system with which the runner stone can be lifted or lowered slightly and the gap between the stones adjusted. The weight of the runner stone is significant (up to 1500 kg) and it is this weight combined with the cutting action from the porous stone and the patterning that causes the milling process.|$|E
40|$|Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) is a {{non-invasive}} technique which enables quantitative {{information on the}} position and 3 D motion of a tracer particle during processing to be determined at high frequencies. This technique has been successfully used to investigate powder behaviour during mixing, fluidization, granulation, etc. In this study, PEPT {{was employed to examine}} the flow behaviour of powders during die filling. Time histories of displacement and velocity of traced particles were determined. It has been found that the measured displacement and velocity in the moving direction of the <b>feed</b> <b>shoe</b> corresponds very well with the specified shoe motion, demonstrating that the motion of particles during die filling can be accurately determined using PEPT. This will provide useful information to fully understand the die filling process...|$|E
40|$|The flow {{behaviour}} of powders during die filling was investigated using the positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) technique, from which quantitative {{information on the}} flow of individual particles was obtained. Two grades of spherical microcrystalline cellulose powders with different particle sizes were used as the model powder systems. It is shown that the trajectories of tracked particles at different initial positions {{are consistent with the}} overall flow patterns observed using a high-speed video system and linear kinematics (i. e. displacement and velocity) of the tracked particles in the moving direction of the <b>feed</b> <b>shoe</b> correspond very well with the specified shoe motion. Furthermore, a close examination of the vertical velocity component (i. e. in the gravitational direction) of the tracked particles that were deposited into the die reveals that for the system with large particles, the particles flow into the die at a higher falling velocity, compared to the system with small particles. This is primarily due to the effect of the presence of air in the die, which can significantly inhibit the flow of small particles, while its effect on the flow of large particles is small. ...|$|E
40|$|Using {{three-dimensional}} meso-particle dynamics (MPD) simulations {{we investigate}} die filling processes. In contrast to continuum methods this approach automatically {{takes into account}} the rearrangements of the grains and predicts structural compositions. The particle code utilizes a soft-sphere model. Comples grain and cavity shapes can be represented. The numerical implementation is highly parallelizable by means of load balanced domain decomposition. Thus large systems containing 107 particles could be studied. Analyses of powder flow and density distributions reveal influences of cavity geometries and <b>feeding</b> <b>shoe</b> motion on the filling homogeneity...|$|R
40|$|Inhomogeneous density {{distributions}} after {{die filling}} are a ubiquitous problem in powder technological part production. In this paper, numerical simulations of the die filling process in realistic, three-dimensional (3 D) cavities are presented using the discrete element method with both multi-sphere and single sphere grain models. Good agreement {{was found between}} calculated and experimentally measured density distributions. The formation of an inhomogeneous distribution is discussed by a time-resolved analysis of the filling process. Grain rearrangement and densification during subsequent <b>feeding</b> <b>shoe</b> passages are characterized. The shoe velocity was tested for its influence on the density homogeneity. Suggestions for density homogenization with the application of cavity oscillations or volumetric filling are given. A density homogeneity index is introduced. The application of a coarse graining scheme circumvents the intrinsic difficulty of non-manageable grain numbers in 3 D filling simulations. The validity and limitations of this scheme are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} {{characterize}} the filling behaviour under process near conditions will be presented. By {{the use of a}} self-constructed fill device, which maps the process chain: product <b>feeding</b> - fill <b>shoe</b> - die, the filling process can be visualized and quantified via image processing. As it is shown in experiments using spray dried ceramic granules of different characteristics, detailed information about the filing behaviour can be achieved...|$|R
6000|$|... "Guess again. I {{bought them}} eight with Oakland money, an' they was shipped to Oakland. But I got the Lawndale {{contractor}} on long distance, {{and he agreed}} to pay me half {{a dollar a day}} rent for every work horse up to half a dozen. Then I telegraphed the Boss, tellin' him to ship me six sore-footed mares, Bud Strothers to make the choice, an' to charge to my commission. Bud knows what I 'm after. Soon as they come, off go their shoes. Two weeks in pasture, an' then they go to Lawndale. They can do the work. It's a down-hill haul to the railroad on a dirt road. Half a dollar rent each--that's three dollars a day they'll bring me six days a week. I don't <b>feed</b> 'em, <b>shoe</b> 'm, or nothin', an' I keep an eye on 'm to see they're treated right. Three bucks a day, eh! Well, I guess that'll keep a couple of dollar-an '-a-half men goin' for Saxon, unless she works 'em Sundays. Huh! The Valley of the Moon! Why, we'll be wearin' diamonds before long. Gosh! A fellow could live in the city a thousan' years an' not get such chances. It beats China lottery." ...|$|R
