5000|$|The {{most common}} type of power driven tap is the [...] "spiral point" [...] plug tap, whose cutting edges are {{angularly}} displaced relative to the tap centerline. This feature causes the tap to continuously break the chip and eject it forward into the hole, preventing crowding. Spiral point taps are usually used in holes that go {{all the way through the}} material, so that the chips can escape. Another version of the spiral point plug tap is the spiral <b>flute</b> <b>tap,</b> whose flutes resemble those of a twist drill. Spiral flute taps are widely used in high speed, automatic tapping operations due to their ability to work well in blind holes.|$|E

The added value is often near its peak when the tapping operation is carried out. Consequently, conservative cutting conditions often are employed to avoid costly tap failure. Taps and tapping also are amongst {{the most complex}} and least understood cutting tools and processes. In this paper, the geometry and specification of straight <b>flute</b> <b>taps</b> are discussed, followed by an outline {{of the development of}} computer-aided predictive models for side force, thrust force, and torque in machine tapping, based on Armarego’s ‘Unified-Generalized Mechanics of Cutting Approach’. This approach allows processes to be modelled based on their cutting action and geometry only, with material properties provided from a generic database. Unlike other tapping modelling approaches, this is a truly predictive methodology. The models allow for the transient and steady stages and they include all the tap and tapping geometrical variables and the tapping conditions, as well as the tool–workpiece material prop-erties. The models are verified through extensive numerical studies and a comprehensive exper-imental testing programme. Good qualitative and quantitative correlations are found between the predicted and measured average force components and torque. These models allow tool designers and process planners to optimize the generation and use of taps, thereby improving the competitiveness of this vital manufacturing operation. The results provide further evidence of the validity and generic nature of the unified-mechanics of cutting approach...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{machining}} characteristics of thread tapping (torque, tap, wear, work hardness etc.) The tapping of MMC (aluminum alloy metal matrix composite) with TiN coated forming taps under eco-machining technology operation, where chips are not produced and {{ejected from the}} <b>tap</b> <b>flute,</b> was investigated and compared with the characteristics during uncoated tapping. The following results are obtained from this study. 1) The tool life of TiN coated taps was 4 times longer than that of uncoated tap, 2) Threads formed with the TiN coated taps exhibit lower work hardening than those formed with uncoated taps...|$|R
50|$|Metalworking taps {{and dies}} were often made by their users during the 18th and 19th centuries (especially if the user was skilled in toolmaking), using such tools as lathes and files for the shaping, and the smithy for {{hardening}} and tempering. Thus builders of, for example, locomotives, firearms, or textile machinery {{were likely to}} make their own taps and dies. During the 19th century the machining industries evolved greatly, and the practice of buying taps and dies from suppliers specializing in them gradually supplanted most such in-house work. Joseph Clement was one such early vendor of taps and dies, starting in 1828. With the introduction of more advanced milling practice in the 1860s and 1870s, tasks such as cutting a <b>tap's</b> <b>flutes</b> with a hand file became a thing of the past. In the early 20th century, thread-grinding practice went through significant evolution, further advancing {{the state of the art}} (and applied science) of cutting screw threads, including those of taps and dies.|$|R
