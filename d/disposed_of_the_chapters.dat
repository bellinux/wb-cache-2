40|$|How can {{we begin}} to {{understand}} and explain <b>the</b> changing significance <b>of</b> cremation in past societies? From many parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world and for many periods of human history from {{as early as the}} Upper Palaeolithic (Bowler et al., 1980) to recent centuries, archaeologists have uncovered and investigated material evidence for <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> fire as a means <b>of</b> transforming and <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead. This <b>chapter</b> argues that in contrast to the rich and widespread evidence for cremation in the archaeological record, theoretical approaches in <b>the</b> archaeology <b>of</b> cremation have been relatively thin on the ground until very recently. This relative failure to adequately engage with the complexity and <b>the</b> variability <b>of</b> cremation practices across cultures seems connected to the fact that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theoretical debates and developments in mortuary archaeology have, until quite recently, been primarily geared to <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> unburned human remains. Therefore, alongside increasingly refined methodologies for investigating burnt bones, it is argued that archaeologists need to redress this imbalance by developing explicit theoretical approaches to <b>the</b> phenomenon <b>of</b> cremation. Such theories need to engage with broad cross-cultural themes and also remain sensitive to <b>the</b> considerable variety <b>of</b> mortuary procedures involving fire used at different times and in different places...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} Britain’s “compensation culture,” and {{the allegation}} that society has had to bear an increasing burden as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rising number and cost of claims for damages for personal injury. The analysis {{is divided into two}} parts: <b>the</b> total number <b>of</b> claims brought each year is discussed first, and this is followed by an assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall cost <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> individual actions. <b>The</b> <b>chapter</b> gathers together information from a variety of academic and practitioner sources to produce a novel and up to date perspective upon the compensation culture debate. Although it is indeed true that claims have increased, they have done so only with regard to specific types <b>of</b> injury. Among <b>the</b> key factors highlighted are <b>the</b> working practices <b>of</b> three institutions which form <b>the</b> bedrock <b>of</b> our claims system: liability insurance companies, claims management organisations and claimant law firms. Criticisms are made here of a “dysfunctional” insurance industry; this is followed by a description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rise and fall of an even more criticised claims gathering industry; and finally, attention is focused upon the rapidly changing structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal profession involved in personal injury. In considering <b>the</b> rising cost <b>of</b> individual claims <b>the</b> major changes to tort damages awards are summarised. Reforms have been made not only <b>of</b> <b>the</b> method by which compensation is calculated, but also <b>of</b> <b>the</b> form in which the money is to be paid: periodical payments are now common in cases involving serious injury. Damages for pain and suffering have been raised substantially without appreciating the full policy implications, whilst compensation for financial loss has had to be revised to match <b>the</b> realities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wider financial world. These reforms are placed in a broader context which sees <b>the</b> increasing cost <b>of</b> claims as an inevitable result of closer adherence to <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> restoring <b>the</b> claimant to the financial position that was enjoyed before the injury took place. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conclusions drawn is that the structural factors identified here will continue generate concern about “compensation culture” for some time to come...|$|R
