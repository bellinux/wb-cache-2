[...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation {{for the next three}} road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

[...] "Storm" [...] was originally written by Wade at the age of sixteen, when he was going through difficult times.

500|$|Critics were {{retrospective}} of both Rachel and of Baxendale's performance when the series ended. In the New Statesman, Andrew Billen wrote that Rachel [...] "was as near to a sex symbol as this comedy drama about six cold-footed yuppies produced. She was also materialistic, unfaithful, self-absorbed, tricky {{and had not}} the first clue about men [...] Yet her death, caused by a moment of carelessness behind the wheel, was powerful and shocking, {{a tribute to the}} extent to which we have invested and believed in her." [...] Observer critic Kathryn Flett noted that Baxendale's high-profile role in Friends made her the [...] "star" [...] of Cold Feet in the first series, but both she and Rachel had been [...] "eclipsed" [...] by the other actors and characters by the time of the final series. Spectator critic Simon Hoggart wrote, [...] "I wasn't as sorry about poor old Rachel as I should have been. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> deaths which makes you think, 'Oh, her poor baby boy,' rather than 'Goodness, how we'll miss her.'" [...] Hoggart attributed his ambivalence to Baxendale's portrayal of the character as a [...] "fraught, snippy" [...] woman. Matt Greenhalgh, who co-wrote the episode featuring Rachel's death, called killing off the character [...] "a privilege".|$|E
500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground‚Äìlocking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I‚Äôm most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{more members}} {{passed through the}} group, {{including}} drummer Mike Pareskuwicz of Subsist and guitarist T.J. [...] "Racine" [...] Kunasch. While Stump at this point felt uninterested in the group, Wentz was, according to Uprising Records owner Sean Muttaqi, viewing the group as [...] "the thing {{that would make him}} famous. He had a clear vision." [...] Wentz was [...] "singularly focused on taking things to the next level," [...] and threw the band into promotion via early social media. Muttaqi got word of the demo and wanted to release half of it as a split extended play with Hurley's band Project Rocket, which the band viewed as competition. Uprising desired to release an album with the emerging band, which to that point had only written three songs. With the help of Logan, the group attempted to put together a collection of songs in two days, and recorded them as Fall Out Boy's Evening Out with Your Girlfriend. The rushed recording experience and underdeveloped songs left the band discontent. When the band set off to Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin to record three songs for a possible split 7-inch with 504 Plan, engineer Sean O'Keefe suggested the band record the trio with Hurley. Hurley was also recording an EP with his new group the Kill Pill in Chicago the same day, but raced to Madison to lay down drums for Fall Out Boy. [...] "It was still a fill-in thing but when Andy sat in, it just felt different. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> [...] "a-ha" [...] moments," [...] recalled Wentz.|$|E
500|$|Howarth {{said he had}} {{no desire}} to portray a {{redeemed}} Todd, and that the show would be better off finding [...] "a Todd who won't object to the material." [...] He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to me they were taking the character on a different path‚Äîthey were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic‚Äîit's a fairy tale. I thought, [...] "It would be best for the show if I were to leave." [...] That's when I tendered my resignation.|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on {{the applause}} {{given to the}} Madres during the PopMart concert in Buenos Aires, the U2 {{magazine}} Propaganda called the result [...] "about the most moving thing I've ever seen on a rock stage. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> ideas that really could have gone either way, but the obvious empathy of the audience towards these women made it an unforgettable moment." [...] Following the televised concert in Chile, Bono said [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours {{some of the best}} shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv... anywhere music meant more than entertainment". He added [...] "to be able to address General Pinochet from the stage on live television in Chile and say, 'Give the dead back to the living. Please, General Pinochet, tell these women where the bones of their sons and daughters are.' That was an extraordinary moment... certainly in my life and U2's." [...] When asked if the negative reaction from some of the audience had disappointed the band Bono said it had not, stating [...] "it's proof to me that a rock 'n' roll audience are not lemmings.... If they don't agree with you, they will let you know ‚Äì but that doesn't mean they're not fans.... I was flattered that we weren't just playing to people who agreed with us." [...] U2's performance was later credited with inspiring a protest in the Chilean Parliament against Pinochet, who {{was in the process of}} becoming a Senator for life after relinquishing his position as head of the armed forces. The opposition party brought in the Madres, who again held pictures of their disappeared children and asked for information on the location of their bodies.|$|E
