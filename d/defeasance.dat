60|$|Your Lordships {{see here}} that Mr. Hastings informs the Nabob, that, having {{received}} peremptory {{orders from the}} Company, he restores and replaces Mahomed Reza Khân. Mahomed Reza Khân, then, is in possession,--and in possession by {{the best of all}} titles, the orders of the Company. But you will also see the manner in which he evades his duty, and vilifies in the eyes of these miserable country powers the authority of the Directors. He is prepared, as usual, with a <b>defeasance</b> of his own act; {{and the manner in which}} that <b>defeasance</b> came to our knowledge is this. We knew nothing of this private affair, till Mr. Hastings, in his answer before the House of Commons, finding it necessary to destroy the validity of some of his own acts, brought forward Sir John D'Oyly. He was brought forward before us, not as a witness in his own person for the defence of Mr. Hastings, but as a narrator who had been employed by Mr. Hastings as a member of that Council which, as you have heard, drew up his defence. My Lords, you have already seen the public agency of this business, you have heard read the public letter sent to the Nabob: there you see the ostensible part of the transaction. Now hear the banian, Sir John D'Oyly, give an account of his part in it, extracted from Mr. Hastings's defence before the House of Commons.|$|E

The goods are carried to a {{warehouse}} at the waterside, where the merchant has a free and public access to them, as if in his own warehouse and an honourable liberty to sell and deliver either the whole (paying their disburse) or a part without it, leaving but sufficient for the payment, {{and out of that}} part delivered, either by notes under the hand of the purchaser, or any other way, he may clear the same, without any exactions, but of 4 pounds per cent., and the rest are his own.|$|R

Oh, think, I say, my Lords, of the degraded, miserable, and unhappy state to which human nature may be reduced, when you hear this unhappy man declare that all the charges which we have made upon this subject relative to him, and which are all either admitted by him or taken from his own representation, are now stated by him in a paper before you to be all false, and {{that there is not a}} word of the representation which he had made of Mr. Hastings that has the least truth in it!

60|$|I confess that, in my judgment, Don Quixote is {{the most}} perfect {{character}} ever drawn. As Sir John Falstaff is, in a certain sense, always a gentleman,--that is, as he is guilty of no crime that is technically held to operate in <b>defeasance</b> of his title to that name {{as a man of}} the world,--so is Don Quixote, in everything that does not concern his monomania, a perfect gentleman and a good Christian besides. He is not the merely technical gentleman of three descents--but the true gentleman, such a gentleman as only purity, disinterestedness, generosity, and fear of God can make. And with what consummate skill are the boundaries of his mania drawn! He only believes in enchantment just so far as is necessary to account to Sancho and himself for the ill event of all his exploits. He always reasons rightly, as madmen do, from his own premises. And this is the reason I object to Cervantes's treatment of him in the second part--which followed the other after an interval of nearly eight years. For, except in so far as they delude themselves, monomaniacs are as sane as other people, and besides shocking our feelings, the tricks played on the Don at the Duke's castle are so transparent that he could never have been taken in by them.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{the most}} {{significant}} type of penal bond was the penal bond with conditional <b>defeasance.</b> A penal bond with conditional <b>defeasance</b> combined in one document the bond (the promise to pay a specified amount of money) with the contractual obligation. It did this in what the historian Brian Simpson called a ‘topsy-turvy’ fashion by printing the bond {{on the front of}} the document and the condition, whose performance by the obligor would render the bond void (referred to as the indenture of <b>defeasance),</b> on the back.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Defeasance</b> (or defeazance) (défaire, to undo), in law, an {{instrument}} which defeats the force or operation {{of some other}} deed or estate; as distinguished from condition, that which in the same deed is called a condition is a <b>defeasance</b> in another deed. The term is used in several contexts in finance, including: ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Creditors {{could not}} take {{advantage}} of the conditions of <b>defeasance</b> to avoid being repaid purposely to double the debt.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Including the {{condition}} {{which made the}} bond void {{as part of the}} same document as the bond prevented the debtor from alleging outlandish conditions in <b>defeasance</b> of the bond.|$|E

5000|$|It “prevented {{plaintiff}} creditor from pleading {{that the}} conditional acquittance or indenture of <b>defeasance</b> language which spelled out the condition {{upon which the}} obligation to pay the stated sum {{on the front of}} the bond was voided produced by the defendant was not plaintiff’s deed.” ...|$|E
50|$|Although an {{innovation}} in its structure, the conditional penal bond {{was not the}} first English attempt to impose “fixed monetary penalties” for failure to perform on an agreement. Penalty clauses inserted into written contracts, a mainstay in civil law jurisdictions, as well as penal bonds with separate indentures of <b>defeasance</b> were commonly used to secure the performance of a contract until well into the fifteenth century.|$|E
50|$|Many American CMBSs carry less {{prepayment}} {{risk than}} other MBS types, {{thanks to the}} structure of commercial mortgages. Commercial mortgages often contain lockout provisions after which they can be subject to <b>defeasance,</b> yield maintenance and prepayment penalties to protect bondholders. European CMBS issues typically have less prepayment protection. Interest on the bonds may be a fixed rate or a floating rate, i.e. based on a benchmark (like LIBOR/EURIBOR) plus a spread.|$|E

50|$|In computing, a {{while loop}} sets {{the truth of}} a {{statement}} as a condition precedent for the execution of a given subroutine or other code segment.

5000|$|The penal {{bond with}} {{conditional}} <b>defeasance</b> (hereinafter {{referred to as}} a conditional bond, conditional penal bond, or penal bond) first arose in England during the 1340s/1350’s. The conditional bond has been characterized as the dominant method for “framing substantial contracts in the later medieval and early modern periods.” [...] In fact, during the Tudor Period, actions of debt were the most numerous single class of actions in the Common Pleas rolls (and would continue to be so for the next 300 years).|$|E
5000|$|In {{judicial}} opinions, {{the use of}} defeasible is commonplace. There is however disagreement among legal logicians whether defeasible {{reasoning is}} central, e.g., in the consideration of open texture, precedent, , and rationales, or whether it applies only to explicit <b>defeasance</b> clauses. H.L.A. Hart in The Concept of Law gives two famous examples of defeasibility: [...] "No vehicles in the park" [...] (except during parades); and [...] "Offer, acceptance, and memorandum produce a contract" [...] (except when the contract is illegal, the parties are minors, inebriated, or incapacitated, etc.).|$|E
50|$|The {{etymology}} of defeasible usually {{refers to}} Middle English law of contracts, where {{a condition of}} <b>defeasance</b> is a clause that can invalidate or annul a contract or deed. Though defeat, dominate, defer, defy, deprecate and derogate are often {{used in the same}} contexts as defeasible, the verbs annul and invalidate (and nullify, overturn, rescind, vacate, repeal, debar, void, cancel, countermand, preempt, etc.) are more properly correlated with the concept of defeasibility than those words beginning with the letter d. Many dictionaries do contain the verb, to defease with past participle, defeased.|$|E

50|$|The {{solution}} was to merge the latter-day wadset and gage for years into a single transaction embodied in two instruments: (1) the absolute conveyance (the charter) in fee or for years to the lender; (2) an indenture or bond (the <b>defeasance)</b> reciting the loan and providing {{that if it was}} repaid the land would reinvest in the borrower, but if not the lender would retain title. If repaid on time, the lender would reinvest title using a reconveyance deed. This was the mortgage by conveyance (aka mortgage in fee) or, when written, the mortgage by charter and reconveyance and took the form of a feoffment, bargain and sale, or lease and release. Since the lender did not necessarily enter into possession, had rights of action, and covenanted a right of reversion on the borrower, the mortgage was a proper collateral security. Thus, a mortgage was on its face an absolute conveyance of a fee simple estate, but was in fact conditional, and would be of no effect if certain conditions were met.|$|E
50|$|The {{do while}} {{construct}} {{consists of a}} process symbol and a condition. First, the code within the block is executed, and then the condition is evaluated. If the condition is true the code within the block is executed again. This repeats until the condition becomes false. Because do while loops check the condition after the block is executed, the control structure is often {{also known as a}} post-test loop. Contrast with the while loop, which tests the condition before the code within the block is executed, the do-while loop is an exit-condition loop. This means that the code must always be executed first and then the expression or test condition is evaluated. If it is true, the code executes the body of the loop again. This process is repeated as long as the expression evaluates to true. If the expression is false, the loop terminates and control transfers to the statement following the do-while loop. In other words, whereas a while loop sets the truth of a statement as a condition precedent for the code's execution, a do-while loop provides for the action's ongoing execution subject to <b>defeasance</b> by the condition's falsity, which falsity (i.e., the truth of the condition's negation) is set as a condition subsequent.|$|E

They should not profit at the expense of small businesses; these taxes would have been owed anyway." [...] Three months later in his annual State of the State address, Governor Bill Owens criticized the program and called for its termination: [...] "By any measure the CAPCO program has failed. The state auditor’s recent report on the program is very compelling. Fact: the insurance companies collected nearly $1 million more in fees than they invested in venture capital. Fact: the state auditor could not verify the CAPCO companies’ claims about the alleged number of jobs created. Fact: Nearly half a million in taxpayer money went to lobbying fees. I guess that at least supports 'job retention.' Friends, all of us here are for economic development. But what separates us from the CAPCO advocates is that we want economic development for Colorado. We want new jobs and new companies on the West Slope, not the West Side of Manhattan. We want innovation in the Tech Center, not Rockefeller Center. We can’t mend this program.

40|$|A debt <b>defeasance</b> {{arrangement}} is an arrangement whereby a debtor’s obli-gation {{to pay a}} creditor is nullified.

The money received by the third party is referred to as a debt <b>defeasance</b> receipt. Debt <b>defeasance</b> arrangements are used in countries such as the United States of America and Australia. The financial community in South Africa is becoming increasingly interested in the debt <b>defeasance</b> arrangement.

A survey was done among South African banks, auditing firms and taxation senior counsel to determine the majority opinion of South African respondents regarding the source of a debt <b>defeasance</b> receipt.

40|$|LL. M. The {{concept of}} a debt <b>defeasance</b> {{transaction}} has recently come under scrutiny in the South African financial market. In the financial arena lower lending rates and efficient tax planning are of paramount consideration to corporate entities seeking to raise finance and to properly structure their affairs. Debt <b>defeasance</b> transactions recognise the time value of money. Companies with long-term borrowings obtain financial advantages if those borrowings can be retired early as {{the present value of}} the liability is less than the face value thereof. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a comparative study of the manner in which debt <b>defeasance</b> transactions have been dealt with in the Australian jurisdiction and how the South African courts would view the income tax consequences of such transactions. The choice of the Australian jurisdiction finds its motivation in the similarity of the income tax regime of that country with the system applied in South Africa. Although the Australian income tax legislation allows for a wider range of income to be recognised as assessable income (hence the frequent references to "income according to ordinary concepts" in the judicial pronouncements in that country) the {{concept of a}}n accrual of income is recognised and applied in the Australian legislation in a similar manner to that of the South African income tax legislation. In addition, there have been a number of recent decisions in the Australian courts on debt <b>defeasance</b> transactions that were implemented during the 1980 's. Given that the South African courts are mindful of developments in 2 Australia and will seek guidance from that jurisdiction, the contemporary nature of the Australian decisions referred to below is insightful and useful in a comparative study. The conclusions reached in this dissertation are that the income tax benefits sought by the parties to the transaction and which are pivotal to the success of the transaction, will not be available in the South African context, just as they are not available in Australia. In certain circumstances the debt <b>defeasance</b> profit, as it is termed in this paper, will be fully taxable in the hands of the taxpayer to whom it accrues, particularly in regard to instantaneous defeasances and where the taxpayer is a financial institution. It is this outcome of the application of the general principles of the South African income tax legislation that leads to the failure of the transaction as a fund raising tool in the structured finance environment. Thought has been given to whether or not the South African legislation should be amended to cater specifically for the debt <b>defeasance</b> transaction. There are no issues that are created by these transactions, such as mismatches in the timing of accruals and deductions as is the case in the trading of financial instruments, that are not already catered for in the current income tax legislation. The main enquiry in determining the consequences of a debt <b>defeasance</b> transaction is in the application of the gross income definition in section 1 of The Income Tax Act 58 of 1962. The application of the gross income definition is trite law and the judicial pronouncements thereon are 3 adequate guidance and it is submitted that no amendment to the Income Tax Act is required to cater for debt <b>defeasance</b> transactions. The structure of this paper will be to give an overview of the mechanics of debt <b>defeasance</b> transactions and the <b>defeasance</b> transactions and the consequences thereof. A survey of the Australian examples of debt defeasances is undertaken and the judgements given by the Australian courts in response to such transactions are canvassed. An analysis will finally be undertaken on the income tax consequences of debt defeasances as they have been imported into South Afric...|$|E

We, of course, are responsible for any remaining errors. 1 Pricing the <b>Defeasance</b> Option in Securitized Commercial Mortgages To protect the interests of investors, commercial mortgage loans pooled for the issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) have restrictive covenants that discourage the borrower from refinancing. Such restrictions limit the borrower’s ability to access any accumulated equity. The predominant means of accessing this equity today is <b>defeasance.</b> By defeasing a loan, the borrower substitutes the commercial mortgage with U. S. Treasury or agency obligations whose payments match those of the defeased mortgage. Therefore, <b>defeasance</b> is an exchange option whereby the borrower gives up the portfolio of Treasury or agency securities and in return receives {{the market value of}} the commercial mortgage plus the liquidity benefits arising from accessing the accumulated equity in the underlying property. The value of the option to defease is shown to depend critically on the rate of return that can be earned on the released equity, prevailing interest rate conditions, as well as the option’s contractual features. 1...|$|E
40|$|Special {{investment}} vehicles (SIVs), {{extremely popular}} financial structures {{for the creation}} of highly-rated tranched securities, experienced spectacular demise in the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis.

The efficacy of these risk controls varies depending on anticipated asset volatility and fire-sale discounts on <b>defeasance.</b> Despite risk management controls, we show that a high failure rate is inherent in the design of these vehicles, and may be mitigated to some extent by including contingent capital provisions in the ex-ante covenants.
