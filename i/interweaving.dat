5|$|The episode {{begins the}} process of <b>interweaving</b> action {{happening}} in multiple separate locations within and around the fictional continent of Westeros. Most of the action takes place in and around Winterfell where Lord Eddard Stark is the feudal overlord of the northern reaches of the kingdom. Outside of Westeros is a land across the Narrow Sea where the two surviving members of House Targaryen, previous rulers of Westeros, live in exile.|$|E
5|$|The decorations are {{all high}} quality and often highly complex. In one decoration, which {{occupies}} a one-inch square {{piece of a}} page, there are 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon with a black border on either side. Some decorations can only be fully seen with magnifying glasses, although lenses of the required power are not {{known to have been}} available until hundreds of years after the book's completion. The complicated knot work and <b>interweaving</b> found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period. Since their gradual rediscovery from the 19th century on, these designs have also had an enduring popularity. Many of these motifs are used today in popular art including jewellery and tattoos.|$|E

40|$|<b>InterWeave</b> is a {{distributed}} middleware {{system that}} supports the sharing of strongly typed, pointer-rich data structures across heterogeneous platforms. As a complement to RPC-based systems such as CORBA,. NET, and Java RMI, <b>InterWeave</b> allows processes to access shared data using ordinary reads and writes. Experience indicates that InterWeave-style sharing facilitates the rapid development of distributed applications, and enhances performance through transparent caching of state. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} aspects of <b>InterWeave</b> specifically designed to accommodate heterogeneous machine architectures. Beyond the traditional challenges of message-passing in heterogeneous systems, <b>InterWeave</b> (1) identifies and tracks data changes in the face of relaxed coherence models, (2) employs a wire format that captures not only data but also diffs in a machine and languageindependent form, and (3) swizzles pointers to maintain long-lived (cross-call) address transparency. To support these operations, <b>InterWeave</b> maintains an extensive set of metadata structures, and employs a variety of performance optimizations. Experimental results show that <b>InterWeave</b> achieves performance comparable to that of RPC parameter passing when transmitting previously uncached data. When updating data that have already been cached, Inter-Weave’s use of platform-independent diffs allows it to significantly outperform the straightforward use of RPC. 1...|$|R

25|$|It {{remains a}} matter of debate whether and how a non-first-person narrator can be unreliable, though the {{deliberate}} restriction of information to the audience can provide instances of unreliable narrative, even if not necessarily of an unreliable narrator.

25|$|In 1899 Picasso {{rejected}} academic {{study and}} joined {{a circle of}} avant-garde artists and writers known as modernistes or decadentes. Meeting at Els Quatre Gats in Barcelona, they assimilated trends such as symbolism and Art nouveau, characterized by contour lines, simplified form and unnatural colors. Yet, {{in addition to the}} influence of Théophile Steinlen and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, that of Francisco Goya and El Greco can be seen in Picasso's work of the period. A significant innovation of El Greco's later works is the <b>interweaving</b> of form and space; a reciprocal relationship is developed between the two that unifies the painted surface. This <b>interweaving</b> would re-emerge three centuries later in the works of Cézanne and Picasso. Adapting these style, the artist produced numerous portraits of friends such as Carlos Casagemas and Jaime Sabartès (Sabartès Seated). The modernists also devoted themselves to political anarchy and other social causes, including sympathy for the poor, denizens and the underclass; subjects that would soon emerge in the paintings of Picasso's Blue Period (a color associated with despair and melancholy, blue was commonly used in Symbolist painting).|$|E

Undaunted by a lack of enthusiasm for his initial proposal for the Harvey Milk biography, Shilts reworked the concept, as he later said, after further reflection: I read Hawaii by James Michener. That gave me the concept for the book, the idea of taking people and using them as vehicles, symbols for different ideas. I would take the life-and-times approach and tell the whole story of the gay movement in this way, using Harvey as the major vehicle.|$|E

However, any point specified by two parameters can be instead specified by one, because the cardinality of the real plane is equal to the cardinality of the real line (this can be seen by an argument involving <b>interweaving</b> the digits of two numbers to yield a single number encoding the same information). The example of a space-filling curve shows that one can even take one real number into two both surjectively (so all pairs of numbers are covered) and continuously, so that a one-dimensional object completely fills up a higher-dimensional object.|$|E

With origins in the culture of the Proto-Slavs, over time Polish culture has been profoundly influenced by its <b>interweaving</b> ties with the Germanic, Latinate and Byzantine worlds as well as in continual dialog with the many other ethnic groups and minorities living in Poland. The people of Poland have traditionally been seen as hospitable to artists from abroad and eager to follow cultural and artistic trends popular in other countries.

These factors have contributed to the versatile nature of Polish art, with all its complex nuances.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian {{constitution}} {{gives the}} federal government the exclusive right to legislate criminal law while the provinces have exclusive control over civil law. The provinces have jurisdiction over the administration of justice in their territory. Almost all cases, whether criminal or civil, start in provincial courts and may be eventually appealed to higher level courts. The quite small system of federal courts only hears cases concerned with matters which are under exclusive federal control, such as federal taxation, federal administrative agencies, intellectual property, some portions of competition law and certain aspects of national security. The federal government appoints and pays for both the judges of the federal courts and the judges of the superior and appellate level courts of each province. The provincial governments are responsible for appointing judges of the lower provincial courts. Provincial administrative tribunals also comprise part of provincial courts. This intricate <b>interweaving</b> of federal and provincial powers {{is typical of the}} Canadian constitution.|$|E
