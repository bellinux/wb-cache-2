5|$|A 2011 {{study by}} Walk Score ranked Denver sixteenth most {{walkable}} of fifty largest U.S. cities, though massive {{gaps in the}} cities sidewalks remain an oft-discussed issue. Many walkability advocates believe the city's need for pedestrian infrastructure is only growing as <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> the Colorado Department of Transportation place the needs of cars over the needs of people by widening roads or the purposeful plowing of snow onto sidewalks during winter storms.|$|E
5|$|<b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> {{surrounding}} {{cities are}} home to {{a large number of}} local and national breweries.

5|$|The {{first attempt}} to build a modern trade route through the area is {{credited}} to William Jackson Palmer, founder of the <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> Rio Grande Western Railroad (D). Palmer started a project in 1880 to make {{what had been a}} local railroad from Colorado into a transcontinental railroad empire. This would mean a second transcontinental railroad would be built across Utah. This would also place the D in competition with the First Transcontinental Railroad, then operated by Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The first {{railroad}} track laid through Thistle was a narrow-gauge {{spur line}} servicing coal mines near today's Scofield Reservoir, built in 1878 by the Utah and Pleasant Valley Railway. By 1890, the <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> Rio Grande Western, which acquired {{the line in}} a foreclosure sale in 1882, had rebuilt the line to standard gauge. The D connected this line with one they had built west from Colorado, completing a link from Salt Lake City to Denver.|$|E

5|$|After {{two seasons}} in Kansas City, the {{franchise}} moved to <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> was renamed the Colorado Rockies it {{played at the}} McNichols Sports Arena. The team won its first game as the Rockies, 4–2, against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Rockies were in position {{to qualify for the}} playoffs 60 games into the 1976–77 season, but a streak of 18 games without a win caused them to fall from contention. The Rockies ended the campaign last in the division with a 20–46–14 record and 54 points, and improved to 59 points the next season. Despite having the sixth-worst record in the League, the Rockies beat-out the Vancouver Canucks for second in the Division by two points and gained a playoff berth. The Philadelphia Flyers eliminated the Rockies from the playoffs in the preliminary rounds.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, Sunday {{began to}} conduct {{meetings}} (usually {{longer than a}} month) in small cities like Youngstown, Wilkes-Barre, South Bend, and <b>Denver,</b> <b>and</b> then finally, between 1915 and 1917, the major cities of Philadelphia, Syracuse, Kansas City, Detroit, Boston, Buffalo, and New York City. During the 1910s, Sunday was front page news in the cities where he held campaigns. Newspapers often printed his sermons in full, and during World War I, local coverage of his campaigns often surpassed that of the war. Sunday {{was the subject of}} over sixty articles in major periodicals, and he was a staple of the religious press regardless of denomination.|$|E

5|$|Few nickels had {{circulated}} {{in the western}} states before the 1880s (people there preferred silver and gold coins); interest in the new Liberty Head design had led to increasing use of nickels there. Good economic conditions and high demand for nickels for use in coin-operated devices caused the piece to circulate throughout the nation by 1900. That year, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to quintuple the Mint's appropriation to purchase base metals for striking into nickels and cents. At the time, statutory restrictions permitted production of cents and nickels only at Philadelphia; Roberts' request that Congress allow striking at the other mints was granted in 1906. The <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> San Francisco Mints began striking nickels in 1912.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, facing {{cash flow}} problems, John Cleveland Osgood turned to George Jay Gould, a {{principal}} stockholder of the <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> Rio Grande, for a loan. Gould, via Frederick Taylor Gates, Rockefeller's financial adviser, brought John D. Rockefeller {{in to help}} finance the loan. Analysis of the company's operations by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. showed a need for substantially more funds which were provided in exchange for acquisition of CF's subsidiaries such as the Colorado and Wyoming Railway Company, the Crystal River Railroad Company, and possibly the Rocky Mountain Coal and Iron Company. Control was passed from the Iowa Group to Gould and Rockefeller interests in 1903 with Gould in control and Rockefeller and Gates representing a minority interests. Osgood left the company in 1904 and devoted his efforts to operating competing coal and coke operations.|$|E

5|$|Ornithischians are {{abundant}} in the Scollard Lance, Laramie, Lance, <b>Denver,</b> <b>and</b> Hell Creek Formation. The main groups of ornithischians are ankylosaurians, ornithopods, ceratopsians, and pachycephalosaurians. Three ankylosaurians are known, Ankylosaurus, Denversaurus, and possibly a species of Edmontonia or an undescribed genus. Multiple genera of ceratopsians are known from the formation other than Triceratops, the leptoceratopsid Leptoceratops, and the chasmosaurine ceratopsids Torosaurus,Nedoceratops and Tatankaceratops. Ornithopods are common in the Hell Creek Formation, and are known from several species of the ornithopod Thescelosaurus, and the hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus, and a possible species of Parasaurolophus. Several pachycephalosaurians {{have been found in}} the Hell Creek Formation and in similar formations. Among them are the derived pachycephalosaurids Stygimoloch, Dracorex, Pachycephalosaurus, Sphaerotholus, and an undescribed specimen from North Dakota. The first two might be junior synonyms of Pachycephalosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Several {{versions}} of Blade Runner have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113 minutes) was shown for audience test previews in <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> Dallas in March 1982. Negative {{responses to the}} previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version. The workprint was shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theatre. Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut. A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.|$|E
5|$|The Comos' first child, Ronnie, {{was born}} in 1940 while the Weems band was working in Chicago. Como left the {{performance}} to be at his wife's side {{even though he was}} threatened with dismissal if he did so. Though Perry was now making $250 a week and travel expenses for the family were no problem, young Ronnie could not become used to a normal routine when they were able to stay in one place for a period of time. The radio program Beat the Band did not always originate from Chicago, but was often done from locations such as Milwaukee, <b>Denver</b> <b>and</b> St. Louis, as the band continued to play road engagements while part of the radio show cast. The Comos decided road life was no place to try raising a child, and Roselle and the baby went back to Canonsburg.|$|E
