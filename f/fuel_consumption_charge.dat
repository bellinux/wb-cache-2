40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Real-Time Energy Management System (RT-EMS) for minimizing the operating {{costs of a}} Fuel Cell/Battery Electric Vehicle (FCBEV). Particularly, a suitable cost function is considered, which accounts for battery and fuel cell degradation, {{as well as for}} <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and battery <b>charging</b> reinstatement. The cost function is thus minimized in real-time by a suitable energy management strategy, which is designed based on an appropriate model of the overall electric propulsion system. In this regard, a suitable power split criterion is determined, based on which the proposed RT-EMS shares the propulsion power between fuel cell and battery. As a result, the cost function can be minimized whatever the driving cycle is. The effectiveness of the proposed RT-EMS has been assessed by numerical simulations, which have been performed in Matlab-Simulink considering different driving cycles and a hysteresis-based EMS for comparison purposes...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{battery and}} hybrid {{powertrain}} technology have significantly expanded the automotive design space. In this work, {{the design process}} of a new extended range electric vehicle (E-REV) is presented, following industry standard vehicle development process (VDP). To effectively achieve the design targets, this project was developed following a model-based design (MBD) process. The design process started from a vehicle technical specification, which defines the required vehicle performance characteristics. A number of models were built to exam various design options against the design targets. Improved vehicle performance was demonstrated through model-in-loop (MIL), software-in-loop (SIL) and hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulations using the new vehicle and controller models. The designed vehicle uses a 2009 Saturn VUE as a baseline platform and incorporates a GM 2 -Mode transmission, a GM E 85 flex-fuel engine, a rear traction motor and a high-capacity battery system. It achieves zero <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> in <b>charge</b> depleting mode under normal operating conditions, while maintaining the highly efficient 2 -Mode hybrid functionality in charge-sustaining mode. By integrating an additional traction motor with the 2 -Mode transmission, the new design overcomes the constraints imposed {{by the size of}} the electric motors and gearing configuration in the 2 -Mode transmission, to allow the vehicle to be operated at higher speeds and loads without turning on the IC engine. The work is part of the collective efforts of the UVic EcoCAR team in the EcoCAR – Next Challenge collegiate advanced vehicle technology engineering competition...|$|R

Fuel {{costs are}} one of the main cost items fishing fleets have to face, even when fuel prices for the fishing sector are often lower than public prices, as in many other {{production}} sectors. Fuel prices paid by the fishing sector are often exempted of certain taxes. Fuel subsidies, such as tax exemptions, have received significant attention, while taxes themselves may have not received the deserved attention lately. However, both, taxes and subsidies, can distort production and markets. In fact, low taxation levels behave similar to subsidies, and can be considered as such. This happens when <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> is <b>charged</b> with a tax lower than the externalities they generate (e. g. related to pollution, health risks and global warming).

By analyzing the state of art regarding the functional design of the displays from existing hybrid vehicles, it can be observed that only the actual state and history of relevant variables like <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> state of <b>charge,</b> and distance to empty are displayed. This information is important for the human driver to analyze the realized previous behavior, but what exactly the driver should or could do in next minutes to improve the driving behavior during driving is usually not displayed. In order to improve upcoming behavior and related consequences and therefore to solve the task for further efficiency improvement, a new interface has been developed to help the human driver to drive more efficiently. By applying the new interface, the human driver can perceive the actual driving situation and predicted corresponding consequences. In comparison, the suggested optimal driving behavior and its consequences will be displayed as well.

With the new design, the diesel engine maintains a constant engine speed, keeping <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> low while <b>charging</b> the batteries that drive the forwarder.

The combination of the diesel engine and six electric motors provides plenty of power for heavy lifting and pulling. The main component parameters of the drive system are calculated and optimized with a set of dynamics and simulated with AVL Cruise software.

40|$|Todayx 2019;s air {{transportation}} industry {{is faced with}} the challenge of maintaining a viable economic position in the face of unparalleled increase in fuel costs in combination with the ever-present threat of fuel supply shortages. The rapid increase of air traffic makes the problem regarding aviation fuel challenging. The aviation fuel prices comprise an important expenditure for the airliners. Hence, aircraft <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> becomes a relevant issue in the planning and analysis of aviation operations. The key elements that have major effect on <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> are aircraft design and operating methods. Another element that makes a major impact on the aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> is the aircraft delay caused by air traffic congestion. It is necessary to minimize aircraft delays in air and on ground and thereby minimize aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> This paper presents a method for the <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimation, which has fuel efficient trajectory as one of the interesting by-products. The method presented in this paper, uses <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> information directly from the flight manual provided by the aircraft manufacturer to predict <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> accurately using neural network approach. <b>Fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> information is collected from the pilotx 2019;s flight manual and segregated with respect to the different phases of flight like climb, cruise and descent.

40|$|Landscape fires {{occur on}} a large scale in (sub) {{tropical}} savannas and grasslands, affecting ecosystem dynamics, regional air quality and concentrations of atmospheric trace gasses. <b>Fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> per unit of area burned is an important but poorly constrained parameter in fire emission modelling. We combined satellite-derived burned area with fire radiative power (FRP) data to derive <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates for land cover types with low tree cover in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Australia. We developed a new approach to estimate <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> based on FRP data from the polar-orbiting Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the geostationary Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) in combination with MODIS burned-area estimates. The <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates based on the geostationary and polar-orbiting instruments showed good agreement in terms of spatial patterns. We used field measurements of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> to constrain our results, but the large variation in <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> in both space and time complicated this comparison and absolute <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates remained more uncertain. Spatial patterns in <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> could be partly explained by vegetation productivity and fire return periods. In South America, most fires occurred in savannas with relatively long fire return periods, resulting in comparatively high <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> as opposed to the more frequently burning savannas in Sub-Saharan Africa. Strikingly, we found the infrequently burning interior of Australia to have higher <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> than the more productive but frequently burning savannas in northern Australia. Vegetation type also {{played an important role in}} explaining the distribution of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> by affecting both fuel build-up rates and fire return periods. Hummock grasslands, which were responsible for a large share of Australian biomass burning, showed larger fuel build-up rates than equally productive grasslands in Africa, although this effect might have been partially driven by the presence of grazers in Africa or differences in landscape management. Finally, land management in the form of deforestation and agriculture also considerably affected <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> regionally. We conclude that combining FRP and burned-area estimates, calibrated against field measurements, is a promising approach in deriving quantitative estimates of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> Satellite-derived <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates may both challenge our current understanding of spatiotemporal <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> dynamics and serve as reference datasets to improve biogeochemical modelling approaches. Future field studies especially designed to validate satellite-based products, or airborne remote sensing, may further improve confidence in the absolute <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates which are quickly becoming the weakest link in fire emission estimates...|$|R
