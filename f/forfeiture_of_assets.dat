5000|$|Relatively few prosecutions or <b>forfeitures</b> <b>of</b> traffickers' <b>assets</b> took place.

[...] This would be an extension of an existing program that trains members of remote Mexican indigenous tribes to man such patrols. SOS Chihuahua's media contact, Karyn Longhurst of Nuevo Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, said the group desires rapid response to kidnappings (presently the police must await a police report's being filed), the <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> the <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> convicted kidnappers, mechanisms for reparations to victims, tightening of judicial and sentencing loopholes used by those suspected or convicted of kidnapping, increased prosecutions and punishments for those aiding and abetting kidnapping, including through official corruption.|$|R

The content of a prenuptial agreement can vary widely, but commonly includes provisions for division of property and spousal support {{in the event of}} divorce or breakup of marriage. They may also include terms for the <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> as a result of divorce on the grounds of adultery; further conditions of guardianship may be included as well.

5000|$|In 2013, the US Department of Justice, {{represented}} by the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, sued Prevezon Holding, a Republic of Cyprus corporation registered in New York State as a foreign business corporation, under the Magnitsky Act for money-laundering. The lawsuit sought <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> various <b>assets</b> and real estate holdings in the US. [...] The sole shareholder of Prevezon is Russian citizen Denis Katsyv, whose father is Petr Katsyv, vice president of Russia's state-run rail monopoly and [...] "reportedly a business associate of Vladimir Yakunin, a confidant of Vladimir Putin". Katsyv’s Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya is not licensed to practice in the US, and Katsyv hired {{the law firm of}} BakerHostetler to represent Prevezon; BakerHostetler hired Fusion GPS early in 2014 to provide research help for the litigation, although BakerHostetler was later thrown off the case. In May 2017, two months after President Trump had dismissed Bharara, the lawsuit was settled for $6 million, without Prevezon admitting to any wrongdoing and with both sides claiming victory.|$|R
50|$|The first {{subtitle}} {{tightened the}} record keeping requirements for financial institutions, making them record the aggregate amounts of transactions processed from {{areas of the}} world where money laundering is a concern to the U.S. government. It also made institutions put into place reasonable steps to identify beneficial owners of bank accounts and those who are authorized to use or route funds through payable-through accounts.The U.S. Treasury was charged with formulating regulations intended to foster information sharing between financial institutions to prevent money-laundering.Along with expanding record keeping requirements it put new regulations into place {{to make it easier for}} authorities to identify money laundering activities and to make it harder for money launderers to mask their identities.If money laundering was uncovered, the subtitle legislated for the <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> of those suspected of doing the money laundering.In an effort to encourage institutions to take steps that would reduce money laundering, the Treasury was given authority to block mergers of bank holding companies and banks with other banks and bank holding companies that had a bad history of preventing money laundering. Similarly, mergers between insured depository institutions and non-insured depository institutions that have a bad track record in combating money-laundering could be blocked.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} sustained {{law enforcement}} efforts during the reporting period. Belarusian law prohibits {{trafficking in persons}} for both sexual exploitation and labor exploitation through Article 181 of its criminal code which prescribes penalties ranging from two to 15 years’ imprisonment in addition to asset forfeiture. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes. The government reported 219 human trafficking investigations in 2009, including at least 10 labor trafficking investigations. Authorities reportedly prosecuted 61 cases under Article 181 and convicted 15 trafficking offenders under the same statute in 2009, down from 17 convictions in 2008. The government did not report {{how many of the}} convictions were for forced labor versus forced prostitution. Officials reported that the majority of convicted trafficking offenders were given imposed sentences of over eight years’ imprisonment, in addition to the <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> While reports indicated that officials engaged in corrupt practices, there were no reports of government complicity in human trafficking during the reporting period - such information may have been limited because of lack of press freedom and imprisonment of citizens for criticizing government officials in Belarus. In general, the judiciary lacked independence, trial outcomes usually were predetermined, and many trials were conducted behind closed doors. The Ministry of Interior continued to provide at least partial funding for its anti-trafficking training center, which has trained 47 Belarusian law enforcement officers and officials from other governments to be trafficking specialists since 2007. Courses at the center reportedly focused on anti-trafficking law enforcement techniques and victim assistance and were developed in partnership with IOM, other internationals organizations, and NGOs. The government reported partnerships with the following governments on trafficking cases: Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Israel, and Turkey.|$|E
5000|$|Bailey's high public profile {{has come}} {{both as a}} result of the cases he has taken and his own actions. In 2001, he was disbarred in the state of Florida, with {{reciprocal}} disbarment in Massachusetts on April 11, 2003. The Florida disbarment was the result of his handling of shares in a pharmaceutical company named Biochem Pharma during his representation of marijuana dealer Claude DuBoc. Bailey had transferred a large portion of DuBoc's assets into his own accounts. The stock, worth about $5.9 million, was supposed to be included in the <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> that DuBoc made as part of a plea bargain. It had been held by Bailey because it would be sold immediately if it came into government possession, but it was expected to rise dramatically in value. Bailey later refused to turn it over, claiming that it was payment of his legal fees and not part of DuBoc's asset forfeiture. In addition, Bailey claimed that the stock was collateral for loans that he had received, and so could not be sold until the loans were repaid. These arguments were rejected by the court; the stock rose in value to about $20 million, and Bailey then argued that, if he turned over the stock so that it could be sold, he was entitled to keep the difference between what it was valued at when he received it and its new, higher price. After Bailey was imprisoned for six weeks in 1996 for contempt of court, his brother raised the money that enabled Bailey to turn the stock over to the government, and he was released. [...] He was later found guilty of seven counts of attorney misconduct by the Florida Supreme Court, and in 2001 he was disbarred. Massachusetts disbarred Bailey two years later.|$|E
40|$|Voluntary <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> {{intellectual}} <b>assets</b> — often, exceptionally valuable assets — {{is surprisingly}} widespread {{in information technology}} markets. A simple economic rationale can account for these practices. By giving away access to core technologies, a platform holder commits against expropriating (and thereby induces) user investments that support platform value. To generate revenues that cover development and maintenance costs, the platform holder must regulate access to other goods and services within the total consumption bundle. The trade-off between forfeiting access (to induce adoption) and regulating access (to recover costs) anticipates the substantial convergence of open and closed innovation models. Organizational patterns in certain software and operating system markets are consistent with this hypothesis: open and closed structures substantially converge across {{a broad range of}} historical and contemporary settings and commercial and noncommercial environments. In particular, this Article shows that (i) contrary to standard characterizations in the legal literature, leading “open source” software projects are now primarily funded and substantially governed and staffed by corporate sponsors, and (ii) proprietary firms have formed nonprofit consortia and other cooperative arrangements and adopted “open source” licensing strategies in order to develop operating systems for the smartphone market...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{concentrates}} on the counter-terrorist financing measures and policies adopted in the United Kingdom. The UK, unlike many other jurisdictions, has a long and established history of tackling terrorism and has implemented {{a wide range of}} legislative and policy measures. These legislative measures, which were originally enacted over a century ago, have been amended in response to the growing threat posed by international terrorism. The UK terrorist legislation was extended to include CTF provisions prior to the terrorist attacks in September 2001 and the introduction of the International Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing. The first part of the chapter seeks to define the ‘Financial War on Terrorism’ and it then moves on to briefly comment on the UKs CTF legislation that existed before 9 / 11. The next part of the chapter considers the impact of the ‘Financial War on Terrorism’ on the UKs CTF legislation after 9 / 11 and it {{concentrates on}} the criminalisation of terrorist financing, the ability to freeze the <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> terrorists, the confiscation or <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> terrorist <b>assets,</b> the implementation <b>of</b> the United Nations sanctions regime and the use of financial intelligence provided to the National Crime Agency. Therefore, the central theme of the chapter is to identity the impact of the ‘Financial War on Terrorism’ in the UK...|$|R

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMSeveral {{international}} instruments {{relating to}} the <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> derived through unlawful means have been developed in the last decade. These relate to both civil and criminal forfeiture proceedings. Nevertheless, the processes of tracing the assets and having them forfeit to the State present formidable obstacles to justice authorities enforcers around the world. The {{fact of the matter}} is that the advent of the internet has made it easier for money launderers to camouflage the nature and the physical locality of their ill-got gains. This has made it all the more necessary for states and financial institutions to co-operate more closely in hitting the criminals where it hurts most – their pockets. However, the international structures that provide for mutual legal assistance procedures are drafted in broad terms or in guideline-form. Most of the books and journal articles dealing with money laundering devote scant attention to this very important aspect of combating transnational economic criminality. In most of the literature, this topic is simply avoided. This paper, which confines itself to civil recovery proceedings, strives to determine first, what international mechanisms are available for obtaining information located abroad that could be used for domestic civil forfeiture, and second, to identify some of the most intractable problems encountered by justice authorities in their attempts to attach property situated abroad. The idea is to identify the principal point of discordance, and to suggest ways in which the international instruments governing civil forfeiture could be amended so as to make them more user friendly...|$|E
40|$|Trademarks play an {{important}} role in conveying reliable information to consumers about the quality of goods and the manufacturer’s reputation. Counterfeiting can destroy these important benefits. Despite difficulty in quantifying its scope and effects, many studies recognise the global prevalence of counterfeiting. Its invasion across product categories harms legitimate producers, economies and society. While there are many contributing factors to its proliferation, the only real area where a government can make a difference is in setting up a responsive legal system that includes good enforcement against counterfeiting. This study aims to address that need by examining comparatively how the relevant intellectual property laws can be used as effective enforcement mechanisms in Malaysia and the UK. The importance and, effectiveness of and key obstacles in judicial proceedings and border measures in both countries are examined and analyzed, using a combination of comparative, doctrinal and socio-legal research. The data used derives from relevant legislation, case law, legal literature and public domain statistics. These sources are supplemented and corroborated by interviews with key figures (official, judicial, practitioner) in Malaysia and Europe. This study draws the following conclusions: (1) Civil proceedings in both countries are comprehensive but the responsible authorities need to review litigation costs to ensure the effectiveness of civil remedies. Malaysia should explicitly provide for remedies in its Trade Marks Act 1976. (2) In criminal actions, <b>forfeiture</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> obtained through counterfeiting activities could be the most effective form of punishment and deterrence, coupled with the use of officers experienced in handling prosecutions. (3) Compared to judicial proceedings, border measures could be the most effective mechanisms in preventing the proliferation of counterfeit goods, but close co-operation and effective communication between rights-holders and customs authorities are crucial in this regard.
