5000|$|Many Icelandic politicians, {{including}} the first prime minister <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein,</b> former Prime Minister Davíð Oddsson and the former President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, attended MR. Almost every Prime Minister of Iceland has been educated at the school apart from Halldór Ásgrímsson, Ólafur Jóhannesson, Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson and Þorsteinn Pálsson. Geir H. Haarde, Davíð's successor {{as chairman of the}} Independence Party and former Prime Minister, also took over from him as chairman of student body, Skólafélagið ("inspector scholae"). In 1879 <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein</b> was the school's first inspector scholae, and in 1940 his grandson Einar Ragnarsson Kvaran achieved the position. [...] The former President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, was also the president of the main student body, Framtíðin.|$|E
50|$|Candidates {{opposed to}} the draft law won a {{landslide}} majority, whilst voter turnout was 72.4%, nearly 20% more than the 1903 elections. As a result, the law was voted down in 1909, resulting in the resignation of Minister for Iceland <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1874, a {{thousand}} {{years after the first}} acknowledged settlement, Denmark granted Iceland a constitution and home rule, which again was expanded in 1904.

50|$|In 1874, a {{thousand}} {{years after the first}} acknowledged settlement, Denmark granted Iceland home rule. By the end of the 19th century, the various efforts made on behalf of Iceland had their desired result. The constitution, written in 1874, was revised in 1903, and a minister for Icelandic affairs, residing in Reykjavík, was made responsible to the Althing. <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein</b> served as the first Minister of Iceland from 31 January 1904 until 31 March 1909.|$|E
50|$|In 1906 {{the first}} {{official}} proposals for railways in Iceland were made. The route would run from Reykjavík to Selfoss via Þingvallavatn. This route would allow extensions to Akranes/Borgarfjörður, Rangarvöllur. Surveys {{were made in the}} summer by the instigation of the Prime Minister, <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein.</b> Over the next few year more surveys were made by engineer Jón Þorláksson in regard to snowfall and cost estimates, including a cost comparison between oil and coal powered systems.|$|E

50|$|The {{historical}} main {{settlement in}} the valley is Möðruvellir, at its northeastern end, which {{was the site of}} an Augustinian monastery, founded in 1296, and of one of Iceland's first academic secondary schools, founded in 1880; the school moved to Akureyri after a fire in 1902 and is now Akureyri Junior College. There is a church built in 1865 - 67 and an agricultural research station. Möðruvellir was the birthplace of Jón Sveinsson and of <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein,</b> and also of Valtýr Stefánsson (1893 - 1963), the editor of Morgunblaðið.|$|E
50|$|Björn Jónsson (8 October 1846 - 24 November 1912) was Minister for Iceland from 31 March 1909 to 14 March 1911. He was {{the father}} of Sveinn Björnsson, the only Regent of Iceland and first President of Iceland. Björn became Minister for Iceland after <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein</b> and his {{supporters}} suffered losses in the elections of 1908, where the voters rejected the draft of a new constitution. Björn was forced to resign after forcing the General Director of the National Bank, Tryggvi Gunnarsson, out of that post due to heavy criticism of their supporters. Björn and other opponents of the Draft won a landslide victory in the 1908 elections.|$|E
50|$|Þorláksson {{continued}} to paint, holding regular exhibitions until 1911. However, he required a regular income {{that could not}} be derived solely from his art. On December 30, 1913, he was appointed by Prime Minister <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein</b> as one of the five people on the committee that designed the Flag of Iceland. He taught drawing at the Technical College and other institutions in Reykjavík, and was principal of that college from 1916 to 1922. He also ran a shop selling art materials, journals and books until his death. Throughout his life he {{continued to}} paint, particularly in the countryside during the summers, and it was at his own summerhouse, Birkihlíð, that he died on July 10, 1924.|$|E
50|$|He was {{a member}} of the Alþingi under the King of Denmark from 1905 to 1908, {{representing}} the Home Rule Party in the government of <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein.</b> When the University of Iceland was founded in 1911 he became Professor of Icelandic there, and also served as the first rector, from 1911 to 1912. He was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Christiania in 1911 and by the University of Iceland on 17 June 1918. He was president of the Icelandic Literary Society in 1894 - 1900 and 1909 - 1918; the Reykjavík and Copenhagen branches were combined in Iceland during his tenure. From 1895 to 1919 he was on the distribution committee for the Jón Sigurðsson bequest. He was an honorary member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters and other learned societies.|$|E
50|$|The cabinet {{was changed}} on 15 February 1902 {{because of the}} death of Hørup. Hage became the new {{minister}} for public works. No changes were made to the cabinet {{as a result of the}} 1903 Folketing election and the next change to the cabinet was on 1 February 1904 when <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein</b> took the post as minister for Iceland as the first Icelander. The Constitutional Act of Iceland of 3 October 1903 stated that the minister for Iceland had to be a resident of Reykjavík and be able to read and write Icelandic. The ministry had until then been a part of the justice ministry of Denmark, but with the new Constitutional Act it was made responsible to the Icelandic Althing and Iceland obtained home rule. The fact that Deuntzer had countersigned the nomination of Hafstein was considered Danish meddling in Icelandic affairs, however.|$|E
50|$|A {{constitutional}} amendment, confirmed on 3 October 1903, {{granted the}} Icelanders home rule and parliamentary government. <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein</b> was appointed as the Icelandic minister on 1 February 1904 who was answerable to parliament. The minister {{had to have}} the support of the majority of members of Althing; {{in the case of a}} vote of no confidence, he would have to step down. Under the constitutional amendment of 1903, the number of members was increased by four, to a total of forty. Elections to the Althing had traditionally been public - voters declared aloud which of the candidates they supported. In 1908 the secret ballot was adopted, with ballot papers on which the names of the candidates were printed. A single election day for the entire country was at the same time made mandatory. When the Constitution was amended in 1915, the royally nominated members of Althing were replaced by six national representatives elected by proportional representation for the entire country.|$|E
5000|$|Subject to {{the control}} of {{parliament}} and the cabinet, Landsbanki has more than once {{been the focus of}} political disputes. A change in government in 1909 meant difficulties for Tryggvi Gunnarsson, Landsbanki’s managing director and prominent member of the outgoing Home Rule party led by his nephew, <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein.</b> Within a year Hafstein’s successor, Björn Jónsson, dismissed Gunnarsson, together with the bank’s two appointed supervisors. He followed up by appointing a fellow Independence Party member, the merchant Björn Kristjánsson, as managing director of the bank. Soon it was decided to divide responsibility for the bank's affairs between two men, and two directors were appointed. [...] Both the Minister’s motivation and methods brought forth highly vocal criticism, and eventually his party split and he himself was forced to step down following a vote of no confidence. Landsbanki emerged from the disputes relatively unscathed; it would subsequently have three managing directors, appointed on a party political basis, partly reflecting the balance of political power. It did not, however, escape a major fire in central Reykjavík in 1915, which destroyed Landsbanki’s headquarters plus another 11 buildings. The bank’s accounts, valuable documents and its notes and coin were saved, however.|$|E
50|$|The Cabinet of Iceland is {{considered}} to have been formed 1 February 1904 when home rule was expanded in Iceland and <b>Hannes</b> <b>Hafstein</b> became the first Icelander to hold the position of Minister for Iceland in the Cabinet of Denmark (Cabinet of Deuntzer). A constitutional amendment, confirmed on 3 October 1903, stated that the Minister for Iceland {{had to be a}} resident of Reykjavík and be able to read and write Icelandic. The Minister for Iceland therefore belonged to both the Danish Cabinet and the newly created Icelandic Cabinet but was only answerable to the Icelandic Parliament. Executive power was thus transferred to Iceland with the creation of the Icelandic Cabinet (the executive branch of the government). In the beginning, there were no cabinet ministers nor ministries (aside from the Minister for Iceland) that formed the Cabinet but instead the Cabinet was divided into three offices. The offices were called first, second and third office. The first office was responsible for court, school and church affairs, the second for employment, transport and postal affairs and the third for finance. The Minister for Iceland was the most supreme officeholder in the Cabinet, but each office was headed by an Office Manager and a National Secretary supervised the three managers. The position of Minister for Iceland in the Danish and Icelandic cabinet was discontinued 30 November 1918 as the Danish-Icelandic Act of Union was signed 1 December 1918 by Denmark and Iceland. The agreement made Iceland a sovereign state — the Kingdom of Iceland — joined with Denmark in a personal union with the Danish king as the head of state of both kingdoms. The Minister for Iceland {{at the time of the}} signing of the agreement, Jón Magnússon, became the first Prime Minister of Iceland.|$|E
