5000|$|I {{wanted to}} tell the truth but my parents were {{homophobic}} and I was in the closet.

One of my big goals was always to be honest with my parents and I couldn't be for a long time. I tried to bring up the subject but felt I couldn't. My mother would say, [...] "We're not talking about things like that", and I was pretty easily stopped because I was reluctant anyway. I ended up with an eating disorder that came from trying to numb myself from my feelings. I needed to surrender far sooner than I did. At the age of 51, I was finally able to talk about it properly with my parents and no longer <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> measure my words with them. That was a turning point for me as it meant I didn't have regrets any more.|$|E

5000|$|The trumpet was not {{my first}} choice for an instrument. In fact, I ended up playing it by default. When we were asked {{what we wanted to}} play in the Eighteenth Avenue School Band, I chose the violin, but I was too late since all the violins were taken. My second choice was the {{saxophone}} or the trombone but they were also all spoken for. The only instrument that was left was the trumpet, and I felt why <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get stuck with this [...] "tinny" [...] sounding thing.When I complained to my music teacher that I didn't think it was fair that all the other kids got to play the instruments they wanted, he told me to just be patient. He said he had a good feeling about me and the trumpet, and he assured me I'd grow to love it. Of course my teacher was right, and it didn't take long for me {{to fall in love with}} the trumpet. In retrospect, I believe there was some mystical force that brought us together.|$|E

By now, Gaye had learned of freebasing while living in London and would spend weeks getting high. Gaye also began to reevaluate the Love Man album stating [...] "I {{had to do something}} for money, but I also had an obligation - to the truth. Motown wasn't giving me a cent 'cause they were yelling how they'd spent a fortune on the Love Man cover and here I was holed up in Hawaii telling them the love man was dead. He was. The love man was me and I needed to stop that shit." [...] Gaye rethought the album's concept and said he [...] "saw how silly I'd been. Who needed another record moanin' and bitchin' 'bout some woman? Why <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> regain my throne as the sex king? Who cared about competing with Michael Jackson and Prince? Look what was happening with the world. I had a message to spread. I had my theme." ...|$|E

Sharp:The chappie who directed originally Reeve, who died in 2010 has gone on to produce some nice movies, and before this he had a good career in shooting commercials. And he’s a talented man. But he didn’t have a story sense then, as a director, and he and his camera operator, each set-up, you know, a sequence that looked like part of a television commercial and wasn’t there for the drama of it, or just to let the audience know what was happening. And therefore I had to take parts out of, for example, a nightclub sequence. Seventy-five per cent of it was fine; only {{when it came to the}} dialogue bits between them <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go in and reshoot it, because it just didn’t make sense - to shoot a couple of really good, important dialogue lines to do with the plot in a shot between the legs of a dancer [...] [...] [...] That wasn’t exactly it but I mean that sort of thing, you know.
